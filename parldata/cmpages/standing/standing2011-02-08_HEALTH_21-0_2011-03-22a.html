                        <p class="tabbed">I raise that
because back in 1983, only 55% of people were happy with the NHS. Why
are we having such an upheaval, and why is there this major clause? We
have had a lot of debate about Monitor, pricing, accountability and
competition, but there has not been much focus outside on the issue of
designation, which has just as great an impact on the future of the
national health service in terms of competition and the greater
involvement of private
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
would be grateful if the Minister explained designation to us as part
of his response, as I am sure he is about to. Funnily enough, some
people who are much more knowledgeable about the national health
service than I are having difficulty completely understanding what
designation means. We will explore that in our debate this morning,
but, fundamentally, we disagree with the clause’s
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments seek to express our opposition to the notion of designated
services. As we will no doubt discuss the wider concerns in the stand
part debate, amendments 474 and 475 are specifically targeted to remove
the most damaging principle of this clause: the principle that, unless
an application is made otherwise, services are assumed to be
non-designated. In effect, the amendments seek to mitigate the damage
that such a designation regime will
cause.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
474 would alter the Bill so that all services were classed as
designated in the first instance. The onus would then be on the
commissioners to apply to undesignate a service. We believe that it
should be for commissioners to prove that competition will be of
benefit to a service, not the other way round. Manufacturing
competition for a service should not be the default position. I will
repeat that point time and again during this
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People
have been commissioning services for years on the basis that they are
essential, so why should that suddenly change as a result of this
provision? That represents an important structural difference between
us and the Government. I stress that we are opposed, although we are
trying to help the Government. Our approach in government was to give
targeted support for limited competition in specific areas where there
was clear evidence that it could bring demonstrable benefits to
patients within a managed system. Strategic decisions were taken based
on merit and patient need. I am struggling to find any sign of how
strategic decisions will be made—not only under this clause, but
throughout the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are interested to hear what the Minister has to say. We will explore
the issue further in the clause stand part debate. In contrast, I would
also be interested to hear how the Minister believes allowing a range
of non-designated services to be shut down by providers, or stopped as
a result of a provider’s failing without being helped, could be
presented as having a specific or demonstrable benefit to patients.
Again, the issue is about promoting competition, not promoting the
interests of patients. That is a theme that we will continue to come
back to during the debate on
designation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are many services that, if removed, would have a significant adverse
impact on the health of patients. It is clear from the conversations
that all Members regularly have with their constituents that the vast
majority of services are important to the local population; as I said
before, if they were not, the commissioners would not 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 895<a class="bkMark" name="Column895">&#160;</a>
                           </div>commission them in the first instance. That all comes back to the point
that we will debate later, which is that the provision’s purpose
is to allow failure to become easier, to cut services and to open them
up to competition; it is not to promote the best interests of
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
it stands, the clause will ensure that the smallest possible number of
services will be designated. Does the Minister have any idea about that
number?<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000028">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sure that the Minister does not want to get
into how regional and consortia boundaries will impact on such
decisions. That is the problem. There is so much detail that is not in

is a great
worry.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000030">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
commitment to competition is put before patient care and choice. I
remind the Minister that it is simply not enough to say that
competition will provide a better service and better health outcomes
for patients, and we will explore that further. The measure will lead
to mass fragmentation and volatility in the provision of services, and,
of course, it wagers too much on the success of under-regulated market
forces. Every service that a patient uses is important to them, and, as
such, there should be no system of first or second-class services. This
group of amendments aims to ensure that if such a regime of designation
is implemented, it is done with the intention of undesignating services
only in exceptional circumstances where there is a clear body of
clinical evidence to show that it is not detrimental to patient
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
would be interested in what patients’ views would be in such
instances and what consultation would take place. The Government have
made a great play of stating that this is about putting the patient
first and about consultation with local populations and providers, such
as healthwatch and local authority scrutiny, but we have seen little of
that in this particular proposal. It would be interesting to hear from
the Minister how important patients’ views will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government believe that decisions should be made locally by those who
know best, because they are clinical professionals, local authority
members or even a member of the public or a patient. However, Monitor
is the king in that respect—not the local clinicians or GP
consortia, and not the local population or patients. It is, again,
about Monitor.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000033">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Leicester West exposed last week, putting
patients first is not at the centre of the Bill; Monitor, regulation
and promoting competition are at the centre. It is not surprising that
we want to explore that further in the clause stand part debate. Our
view is that patients, not competition, should remain at the heart of
the Bill, and I hope that my hon. Friends will join me in supporting
the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Before going
into the detail of the amendments, I thought that it would be helpful
to remind the Committee of the purpose of designated services. Our aim
is to give providers the freedom to thrive and succeed, and to develop
high-quality services for NHS patients, but in doing so we must
recognise the possibility of failure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Failure is
not new; it happens in all sectors and all health care systems, as a
result of factors such as overcapacity, poor management or inefficient
service delivery. Failure has always existed at times in the NHS, but
rather than being acknowledged and dealt with openly it has too often
been covered up. Poor-quality, inefficient providers have been propped
up through covert subsidies at the expense of patients and taxpayers.
Our aim is to create a robust and credible failure regime that will
deal with failure fairly if it happens, and will act as a deterrent to
make failure far less likely in the first place.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under our
proposals, commissioners will have the primary duty to ensure the
continuity of an NHS-funded health service to all patients in England
through effective contracting and oversight of their providers.
However, as we set out in “Equity and Excellence: Liberating the
NHS”, Monitor will have an additional role in supporting
commissioners by ensuring the continuity of designated services, which
are essential local health services where there is no alternative
provider. Monitor can do so through additional regulation and
intervention and, in extreme circumstances—where a provider
becomes insolvent or is at risk of becoming so—by triggering a
special administration regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Due to the
variety of the health care needs of different communities and to
significant differences in the provider landscape between communities,
it is likely that the services that need additional regulation will
vary across

commissioners, rather than a national body such as Monitor, to lead the
process of defining which services would be designated. Knowledge of
local health needs and the local provider landscape will be critical in
determining whether additional protection from Monitor would be
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000044">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill sets
out high-level criteria for commissioners to follow when considering
whether a service should be designated. Those criteria will require
commissioners to demonstrate that the services are necessary to meet
the health needs of their populations, and that no alternative
providers of those services exist. The default position will be that a
service should not be designated unless commissioners can demonstrate
that the principles set out in the Bill have been met.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000047">&#160;</a>

locality, and that it has contracts in place with other providers to
provide the same service. Should one of the providers fail due to
inefficiency or low demand, those other providers could be scaled up to
replace the lost capacity. Additional regulation would, therefore, not
be required to protect patient services. Commissioners would have a
duty to consult providers, local authorities, HealthWatch England and
other key stakeholders, in determining which services should be
designated.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000051">&#160;</a>

understand the Minister, he is saying that the principal criterion
against which designation will be judged is whether there are
alternative providers in the local health care economy. If those
alternative providers exist, the service might not be designated, might
not need to be protected through designation. Does the Minister imagine
that, as we have more entrants into the health care market, just as
with competition applied to a great degree, there will be greater
pressure to de-designate services? If so, how often does he imagine we
will see services being reviewed and de-designated, as more entrants
come into the

                           </strong> First, as I just said, there will be guidance for
criteria, which will be published in due course. When published, that
will provide greater detail. Secondly, I am not going to fall into the
trap of answering the question about numbers; as I said earlier, with
Opposition Members what might seem an innocent question at the time
gets misinterpreted and sometimes misrepresented. However, I will say
very broadly that it might happen in some circumstances. The crucial
point is that with non-designated services—by definition, they
are not designated—there is a plurality of the supply of that
service. However, I do not wish to go further than that and interpret
precisely how it might look on the ground, to avoid a repetition of a
rather unfortunate incident during our second or third
sitting.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
return to the new regime. Monitor will have a number of tools to
minimise provider failure at three stages. In the first stage, in
advance of a failure, Monitor’s licence for providers will
contain a number of continuity of service conditions that will seek to
restrict risky behaviour among providers of designated services. For
example, those could include restrictions on the disposal of assets or
financial requirements, such as a ban on cross-subsidies between
regulated and unregulated services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the same
time, providers of designated services will be required to contribute
to a provider risk pool, which will create incentives for providers to
reduce their financial exposure. In comparable schemes, such as the
Pension Protection Fund, those mechanisms have proved to be effective
in reducing the overall risk of failure of organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, if
a designated service provider became distressed, Monitor would have the
ability, through a combination of licence conditions and the threat of
special administration, to increase the basic level of surveillance and
advice and to require action from providers to address particular
issues. It is only likely to be in exceptional circumstances,
therefore, that a provider would reach the third stage and need to be
placed into special administration. Nevertheless, it is crucial that
special administration should exist as a possibility. The more credible
the failure regime, the stronger the incentive will be for providers to
take action to tackle their problems, and the less likely failure will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000059">&#160;</a>

a number of occasions to try to determine what the estimated failure
rate is likely to be under the new arrangements. I can give a couple of
examples—not least the west Cumbria practice-based commissioning
model, which is being held up as an exemplar. As I understand it, that
is about £11 million in debt, and it is being bailed out by the
strategic health authority, which, of course, will not exist under the
new arrangements. If that is typical of what we can expect, my
anticipation is that the failure rate will be very high. Does the

474 and 475 amend the clause to change fundamentally the policy of
designated services, from being one where commissioners have to opt in
services for designation and additional regulation, to one where
commissioners have to opt out services from such measures. Where no
application is received to opt out, the assumption would be that all
services would be designated, as per the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000064">&#160;</a>

a service is not designated does not mean that commissioners plan to
close that service. In fact, it means that the commissioner wants the
service to continue and is also confident that it is not the only
provider of that service for the locality. Therefore, the service will
continue. I repeat that from my earlier remarks, so that there can be
no misconception among Labour Members. The commissioner would have to
be confident that the service had contracts in place with other
providers of that same service, and should one of the providers fail
due to inefficiency or low demand, the other providers could be scaled
up to replace the lost capacity. That means that additional regulation
is not required to protect patient

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman has asked for evidence, to which
I simply say that it is self-evident. It is all right for the hon.
Gentleman to pray in aid a witness at the beginning of the Committee,
who referred to the United States, but as I have mentioned before, it
is most unwise to compare the American system with the British national
health service. The fundamentals of the two systems are poles apart,
and they are totally different. Personally, I think that such
comparisons are a non sequitur.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I return to
my original comments. The amendment would mean that the vast majority
of services would be designated, and therefore additionally regulated.
It is important that I explain the impact of a high level of designated
services, because significant negative implications to
patient care will arise as a result of designating services that do not
require it. If a commissioner designates a service, they effectively
lock that service provision into one provider. That means that the
benefits of competition—greater quality, innovation,
reduced inequalities, efficiency—are missed, and renders any
willing provider policy and increased patient choice
ineffective.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Preventing
competition would also run counter to Monitor’s duty to promote
competition where appropriate, and might lead to market investigation
references for the Competition Commission about anti-competitive
features of the market. As a result, the opposition amendments would
subject almost all providers of NHS care to a high level of regulatory
burden, giving Monitor additional powers to intervene where it is not
necessary—for example, in physiotherapy or podiatry
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Providers and
commissioners would have to pay for the protection that designation
offers by paying into the financial mechanisms that cover the cost of
ensuring continuity of service in the event of failure. The amendments
would lead to a higher amount of designated services than necessary,
and therefore higher costs than necessary for commissioners and
providers. Patients would not receive the best quality of care if we
missed out on these benefits. If there is less cash for commissioners
to spend on services, that is clearly not in the best interests of
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
474 and 475 would also degrade commissioners’ responsibilities
by removing their responsibility for the continuity of services. The
Government believe that commissioners, as those closest to patients and
the needs of their populations, should have the primary duty of
ensuring continuity of services. Ironically, the amendments would move
that responsibility to Monitor. I therefore ask Opposition Members to
withdraw the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
move on to amendment 476, which seems to remove the requirement of
commissioners to consult while designating services. I am unsure why
the hon. Member for Halton has tabled the amendment, as it would remove
the ability of the local population, local authorities, the Care
Quality Commission, healthwatch and other local stakeholders to
contribute to the designation process. From the Government perspective,
that would remove local accountability from the process and
disfranchise patients and the public. I think we all agree that that
would be a retrograde step, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000073">&#160;</a>

                           </div>on local knowledge and consultation with the local partners that I
mentioned. Monitor’s role is to approve applications where the
criteria set out in the legislation are met—in other words, to
ensure that due process is followed and that the legislation is applied
properly. It is right that commissioners, armed with extensive local
knowledge, should lead on the application of services for
designation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000074">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not have any misconception about the Bill; I
just want to know what it means. <em>[Interruption.]</em> Again, the
Minister is shaking his head. Responsibilities given to Monitor in the
Bill involve three key functions. One is to promote competition. It was
initially to be competition full stop, but now it is to be competition
on quality, though we are not sure what that means at this stage.
Monitor is also to set prices, and we will move on to that later today,
I hope. The third function is to ensure continuity of essential
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has just described what that means. However,
“designation” is confusing to me. I took notes as he
spoke; he talked about a service not being designated. To take the
example of a GP surgery would be a bit harsh, but there could be a
local health service provider that was not designated by an economic
regulator. The Minister said that that would not mean that it would
close, but he went on to say that that the service it provided would be
provided by others. What does that mean? A provider will not close, but
the service it had provided will be provided by somebody
else.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What does
that provider do? Does it just hang around in the ether? What does that
mean? I have just conveyed what the Minister said, although I will
crawl over it 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 902<a class="bkMark" name="Column902">&#160;</a>
                           </div>when we get <em>Hansard.</em> I do not know what it means. I have looked
through the explanatory notes for clause 69, which explain
what the economic regulator has to do, but frankly I am
confused.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With regard
to how an economic regulator would make the clinical judgment, the
Minister outlined three areas. The licence for providers would apply if
someone were involved in risky behaviour, which would obviously have to
be put right. Financial exposure would have to be reduced. Secondly, if
the designated provider became distressed, Monitor would have to make
it improve, or it would have to go into special administration if
necessary. What does that all mean?<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When talking
about licence for providers, risky behaviour and reducing financial
exposure, where does quality come in? The Minister keeps throwing in
the issue of quality now and again. Where is quality in what Monitor
has to do? It is an economic regulator that, we assume, is going to
designate parts of the private and public health service and social
care. It is going to designate whether that can provide or not for
local commissioners to commission from.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We ought to
ask which criteria will be applied.  The Minister mentioned
local knowledge and local commissioners, and the need for the people
designated to maintain, improve and meet criteria where necessary.
Which criteria will they have to meet? All we have in clause 69 are
criteria laid down by an economic regulator, not by a body that
includes clinicians looking at standards and quality. That is what I
want to come round
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000087">&#160;</a>

out competition on prices and put in competition on quality, but I do

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman talks about Monitor and
its general duties, and, yet again, I draw his attention to clause 52.
He mentioned guidance, and he is right. As I said, guidance will be
published, which will then be consulted on to move
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
that the right hon. Gentleman supported the creation of foundation
trusts and the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards)
Act 2003, I thought that it was a little rich for him to refer to a
lack of detail in the Bill. The modus operandi of the previous
Government was to provide primary legislation that was a skeleton. All
the powers flowed from that skeleton through secondary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000094">&#160;</a>

opposed the 2003 Act in Committee, we did not have any draft statutory
instruments or draft guidance—we were left to buy a pig in a
poke. Opposition Members have complained about the length of the Bill,

putting far more detail in the Bill. Inevitably, however, some of it
will flow from secondary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000095">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> So the criteria on whether a service will be
designated are something that we will see a few months down the road.
As has been said all along in the Committee, the Minister says that
this is a seamless move from what the previous Government were doing;
the Minister’s defence is always about what the previous
Government did or what a previous Minister said six years ago. I want
to know why the Bill has nearly 100 clauses that introduce
competition, so that the OFT or the Competition Commission can
designate what services will potentially be like for my
constituents.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is all right to say that the criteria will be published further down
the road, but when I asked the Minister last week about the issue of
monopolies having to open their doors for third-party access, he used
one example to say that that would be in a limited way only. How are we
to know that? Those are just words that he keeps coming out with. It
seems ill thought through.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000097">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We know that
the Bill was put together after the coalition agreement was published,
but it is at odds with much of what that contained. There seems to be a
running dialogue in the media about changes that might come in the
future, because people on the other side seem to be dissatisfied with
some aspects of the Bill. The country, never mind the House, deserves
to know what the criteria will be.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000098">&#160;</a>

know what is going to happen to the NHS as a result of the changes
proposed in the Bill. On that basis, I will keep coming back to these
issues and asking what criteria an economic regulator will use to say
whether a service—it might be a GP practice or a local clinic;
it could be anything—is a designated service that serves people
such as those in my constituency.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000099">&#160;</a>

State for Health when he first gave evidence to the Committee, I
believe that the proposals were hastily put together. We have changed
competition to competition on quality, but I do not know who within

it will be designated. I would like to see those criteria.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000103">&#160;</a>

the scope of a regulator should be. In part, the legislation endeavours
to address that through the concept of designated services, which we
are debating now. It also looks into issues, such as financial risk and
stability, that are not currently taken on board when decisions are
made, but which ought to be.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000113">&#160;</a>

ensuring that lazy providers do not continue to provide poor services
and that there is collaboration and integration. The real issue is not
the objective, but whether the legislation actually captures

against is something that their legislation in part set up, in some

is not wholly dissimilar and it can be argued that this model does it

do not think that his understanding is right. The co-operation and
competition panel does not look solely at deficient services—if
he looks at the cases on its website, he will find that it is looking
at services that are up and running. Many hospitals are trying to
reconfigure, amalgamate and merge to achieve quick savings. They are
referring the related issues to the co-operation and competition panel,
not because they are deficient services, but, for example, because they
are mergers that seem anti-competitive.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000120">&#160;</a>

My concern about the CCP is that, in a sense, it is left to make up its

issue of cherry-picking emerges—for defining anti-competitive
behaviour in a very precise way, and not leaving it

                           </strong> Thank you, Mr Gale. We do want that stand part
debate, so I will try to be as brief as possible. However, the Minister
did raise a number of interesting issues. The first thing that must go
on the record is that we are obviously discussing a system different
from the current one. Let us look at how commissioning will be
done.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
view, which I do not think is unreasonable, that if commissioners are
commissioning services today, they are doing so because those services
are needed. The Bill is about markets and about having to go through
the Monitor process. Why do we have to have such upheaval in the health
service as a result of designation?<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 907<a class="bkMark" name="Column907">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The proposed
system is different from the current system—no matter what the
hon. Member for Southport says, it is different. The Bill’s
proposals might relate to parts of the current system, but it is
actually about having open competition in the health service, not the
limited competition that we introduced. It is about designating only
certain services—in other words, protecting them—and
leaving lots of services undesignated and, therefore, unprotected. That
will make it easier for those services to be closed, changed or
reconfigured.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
know that the Minister will not go into boundaries, integration and how
the system fits in with other services, but designation is an important
part of the Bill. The Minister has not addressed those issues in any
way. The key thing is that he said that there is no need to keep
services that are not necessary. That suggests that today we have lots
of unnecessary services. I do not know how many, because the Minister
has not said. Perhaps he would like to intervene and give me an example
of such a
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has not intervened. That goes back to the real issue, which we
will explore in the clause stand part debate. This is a
recipe—an agenda—for cuts in the health service,
underlined by the Minister’s comment about keeping more services
than are necessary. That is what designation is really about.

                           <em>]</em> The Minister—I wrote this
down—did mention keeping more services than necessary. That is
the key
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will explore the issue again in much more detail, but I have lost count
of the number of times the Minister mentioned failure. The phrase was,
“This will make failure easier”. Because the criteria
will make failure easier, it will be easier to close services or
hospitals. As I have said, this is an agenda for closing hospitals. We
will explore that
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister did not mention the pressure on those who are commissioning
services and who have to make recommendations to Monitor about those
services. To some extent, amendment 476 is about the bureaucratic
nature of the provision. We can consult if someone wants to designate a
service, but I suspect that not many people would be opposed to
designating a service. They have to go through the same bureaucratic
procedure to do that. People will feel pressure; perhaps sometimes they
will think, “Oh well, it’s not worth it.” We do
not know the pressures of their day-to-day work and it is quite a
bureaucratic system that does not exist today. Failure, failure,
failure is continually mentioned by Ministers—and, of course, by
the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister talks about local knowledge, but the commissioners use that
today. What we do not have today is Monitor sitting on their shoulders
making the final decision. The Minister is trying to dress it up as if
all Monitor will do is ensure that commissioners follow the rules.
Unfortunately, as we have heard from the Minister, the Government are
not prepared to give us the details of the criteria. We have no
details. That runs through the whole Bill. We are being asked to make
decisions about the future of the national health service without
knowing the details of how things will apply. That is
appalling.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000132">&#160;</a>

have in the sense of control, involvement of the private sector and
competition. It is basically implementing a competitive system—I
am conscious of your ruling, Mr Gale, and I do not want to
stray—to which, as the Minister has said, European and UK
competition law will become increasingly applicable. That is the big
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000136">&#160;</a>

are lots of issues that we need to explore, and we will explore them

face. Commissioners will have to think carefully about whether they put
a service in a certain place, because they may not be able to make as
much money out of it. “Should I not do that?”, they may
think. That is what the issue is about. I would like, however, to hear

                           </strong> I am looking straight ahead of me, so that I do not
embarrass any particular Member. The Procedure Committee is conducting
an inquiry at present into the use of electronic devices in Committee
Rooms. The current ruling by the Chairman of Ways and Means is that
electronic devices should not be used. Until and unless that situation
is changed, I advise all Members that such devices are not permitted in
the Committee Room.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000166">&#160;</a>

                           </span> On a
point of order, Mr Gale. I gave evidence to the Modernisation Committee
in 2006 about the use of mobile telephones. I thought that the rules
had now changed and that as long as such devices are on silent and are
used only by screen, we are allowed to use them in the Chamber and in
Committee. It may well be that that has not been extended to electronic
devices in general.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000167">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is partly right. The use of hand-held
devices—the term was intended to allow such devices as radio
pagers—was, and still is, permitted. What is under consideration
is what constitutes a hand-held device—in other words, whether
hon. Members are allowed to use tablets or laptops. As things stand,
that is not the case. The situation may well change, but that is a
matter for the House. For the moment, I must enforce the ruling by the
Chairman of Ways and Means, which is that only hand-held devices may be
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000168">&#160;</a>

not want to get drawn too far down this road, because it will be the
subject of a very comprehensive report to Members, and the House will
have the opportunity to vote on it. The specific intention has
been—and I understand that this is Mr Speaker’s
view—that machines should not be used for communication with the
outside world.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000170">&#160;</a>

people outside the Committee Room, or outside the body of the

ruled on the subject. As long as I am in the Chair, I must enforce the

consideration is given to the wider effects that designation of a
service may have on the services received by patients and to the

concern generally is a lack of strategic leadership in the Bill. The
Government propose to remove strategic health authorities and primary
care trusts. SHAs have had a strategic, regional and inter-boundary
view and involvement on a range of services and configurations. We have
not heard from the Government how that strategic leadership will be
provided, other than on a local basis, for those areas where consortia
and inter-regional and inter-hospital services come into
play.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendments
seek to strengthen and clarify the strategic aspect of the criteria for
designation and explore how the Government envisage them being applied.
Amendment 477 would put in place a statutory requirement for
commissioners to consider health inequalities among the criteria for
applying for designation of service. As it stands, clause 69 does not
include such a requirement, as we believe it should. As the process of
designation would be local, the effects of the clause may vary on a
geographical basis. As such, it is vital to include a provision that
refers to a duty to tackle inequalities across the whole of England,
not just within the commissioning
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
consequences of commissioning decisions on different areas will be an
important part of the Government’s proposals, which we are still
trying to clarify as part of the designation issue. The amendment would
help ensure equality between regional services offered to and received
by patients in Devon, for example, and those offered in my constituency
of Halton. At an earlier stage of the Bill, the Minister made a big
play of a commitment to reducing inequalities across the country. He
commented on the postcode lottery. <em>[Interruption.] </em>The Minister

misquoting the Minister—he claimed that the Conservative-Liberal

and instead of just “talking the talk” are
“walking the walk”. That is an interesting phrase, given
the context of the decision on services and designation, and I am sure
we will explore it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000181">&#160;</a>

welcome the inclusion of at least a nod to ensuring that health
inequalities are not created within a commissioning area, that
commitment is not sufficient to meet the Government’s and
Secretary of State’s commitment outlined in clause 3. Equality
must refer to equality for all people, across all regions, not simply
equality within one commissioning area, depending on how good that
commissioning service is, or how good it is at co-operation. The hon.
Member for Southport, who is not in his place at the moment, made an
important point about integration and co-operation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000184">&#160;</a>

would require a commissioner to have due regard to the impact
applications for designation may have on the other services in the
organisation or region. That comes back to strategic need and
oversight, which is very important. We are waiting to see whether the
national commissioning board will have regional offices, or even
regional input, or whether it will all be run from London. That applies
equally to Monitor. I mean no disrespect to my hon. Friends with London
constituencies, but we have a slight problem with that back in the

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is brief, but it recognises the interdependent nature of
services in a region. It highlights regional factors that will have an
impact on the designation of services and explores how the Government
envisage the application of designation. The Minister should give
careful consideration to that point, because genuine concern has been
raised by several
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000186">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is designed to remedy the lack of strategic planning in the
clause. Some services are highly interdependent—in hospitals,
for example, one service often relies on several others to function
safely. The Minister and the Government have said that patient safety
is a primary concern in the Bill. Our argument, and a source of
increasing concern to us, is that the proposals in the Bill will lead
to greater fragmentation, to a lack of co-operation between providers
and to misunderstandings. We are worried about safety: if one service
is designated, several others may require designation for it to remain
at a full and safe working capacity. It will be interesting to hear the
Minister explain that, because, as he explained before, a service will
designated because it is essential and it needs support, but other
services will not be designated because there are many players out
there that can provide the service. How would that work in a hospital
where one service was designated but others, because of competition,
were not? How would that work in practice to ensure continuity and
support for designated services? We do not know the answer because the
Minister has not given us any idea about the details of the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000187">&#160;</a>

we are not the only ones; there are people out there with much more NHS

the splitting of services, if a piece of equipment or a member of staff

We need to understand that. It is all very well for the Minister to say
that non-designated services will have several providers, but they
could go out of business. The Minister has talked a lot about failure.

the Minister tell us which part of the clause will achieve that? The
whole idea of designation is formed on the basis that it would be easy
to break up a provider, such as a hospital, into individual services.
That is something that the Minister may want to look at. Has he any
idea how many services in a hospital would be designated—an
accident and emergency unit for instance? I am interested to hear what
he says. In many cases this is neither possible nor desirable. At some
level there should be significant strategic leadership within the

the amendment flows with their previous proposals on tackling
inequality. As I did when dealing with earlier parts of the Bill, I
agree that issues of equality and inequality should be considered as
part of the designation process. That is why subsection

I said before the intervention, it would not be appropriate to include
the provision in subsection (3) because doing so would reduce the
benefits of competition, quality and so on to patients. That takes us
back to the purpose of designation and the benefits to patients that
are brought about by having providers that are not subject to the
additional regulation that being designated requires. The greater the
proportion of services that are not subject to additional regulation
and that are undesignated, the greater the benefits to patients that
competition can bring—namely, greater quality, innovation and
efficiency.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000210">&#160;</a>

services—in other words, those services that would have less of
an impact on the health outcomes and equality of patients—will
not be subject to additional regulation, rather it will be the
responsibility of commissioners to have plans in place to ensure the
continuity of those services through using alternative
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000211">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Halton asked what would happen if one service within a
hospital is designated and others are not? That would be an important
question for commissioners generally in securing high-quality,
efficient and sustainable services. Equally, it would be an important
question for commissioners to consider when consulting on applications
for designated services, because it is integral to consideration of
whether the withdrawal of a particular service would impact on the
health of the population in the absence of alternative providers.
Designation of some services but not of others provided by the same
provider would mean that some services would be subject to additional
regulation while the others would not. That would mean that the
provider would have greater freedom as to how it delivered its
non-designated services than it would in relation to designated
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000230">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also asked how the equality consideration would work. When
designating a service, commissioners would have regard to the equality
of access in terms of distance travelled or the impact on particular
sections of the population—patients with anaemia, for example.
That would be part of the commissioner’s considerations when
applying for
designation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also made a possibly dubious suggestion that designation
will be bureaucratic. He is worried about that, and I will seek to
convince him that he need not be. On past practice, given his mindset,
it might be an uphill battle, but it is worth the try.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If used
appropriately, designation is a targeted and proportionate system that
focuses regulation where it is needed. It ensures that the extra cost
of protecting a particular service is paid only where necessary. In
contrast, too often under the current system have
inefficient and poor quality providers been bailed out wholesale and at
too great a cost. We want regulation to protect services for patients,
not for the institutions that provide
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000233">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Halton also raised the question of equality across the
country. As the Prime Minister has made clear, our proposals would put
key decisions in the hands of family doctors. GP consortia would decide
how best to improve the quality of services for their patients and how
to make best use of NHS resources. That is the very opposite of a
postcode

services will be designated. At this stage it is simply not possible to
answer that question. The whole point of our Bill is to ensure that
decisions are made locally, not by Ministers in Whitehall. It

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
a number of Opposition Members asked what is a non-essential service.
As I said earlier, I am not going down the route of specifying
different services against others, because it is a recipe for
misrepresentation or, if I am being generous, misunderstanding.
Designation is not about what is essential; it is about where
additional regulation is necessary to secure continuity of NHS
services. I would have thought that Opposition Members would warmly
welcome it for that alone. It is for those reasons that I urge my hon.
Friends to reject the amendment, if it is pressed to a

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not sure how to put this, but, in some ways, the Minister seems to
underestimate the importance of his speeches. I assure him that we
follow what he says word for word in <em>Hansard</em>, and what is said
by his right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Health. In
particular, we look at times where their views might not be compatible,
so the Minister should not underestimate the importance of his
words.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is as
though the Government do not want to accept any Opposition amendment in
this Committee, full stop. There seems to be a mantra, “Under
any circumstances, do not accept an Opposition amendment.” The
Minister did not advance a logical argument for rejecting our amendment
on reducing inequalities and making that an important part of the
commissioner’s role. What was telling, and the reason why we
will be reading the Minister’s comments, was his point that it
would reduce the benefits of competition. That was his argument for not
accepting our proposals. Again, that comes back to our main point,
which is that the Bill is driven by competition and not by what is in
the best interests of patients, or promotes the interests of patients
first. As I have said, we will look at <em>Hansard </em>tomorrow, but I
repeat that the Minister said that it would reduce the benefits of
competition. That comment is quite telling.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000243">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Can I help the hon. Gentleman, because I do not
think he quite gets it? If there are two providers of a service in a
local community, competition will work because patients have choice,
and they will be the driving force in choosing which of the two
providers they use. That will drive up quality, because both providers
will want the patient to choose them to provide their health care. It
is simple, if only the hon. Gentleman would get
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000244">&#160;</a>

correct this before it becomes a fact, because he keeps repeating the
point about underfunding. We are the only party that is giving a
real-terms increase—however modest—to the NHS, which will
ensure that we move forward with all these services being provided. The
Labour party policy is not to give a real-terms increase, and the
Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that over the lifetime of
this Parliament such a policy would result in a £5 billion
funding cut for the health service, rather than the £10.7
billion increase that we are giving it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000248">&#160;</a>

suggest that there is wholesale failure that has not been dealt with in
the system. We still cannot get examples out of the Minister. We look
forward to the clause stand part debate, during which these issues will

is a minor, technical amendment that clarifies the drafting of clause
69 to make it clear that Monitor is able to refuse or accept an
application. The current drafting might suggest that Monitor must
accept an application. The amendment also makes it clear that Monitor
must approve the designation of services only where the criteria for
designation are met. It must also agree to the removal of a designation
only when the criteria are no longer

of the right to complain against its decision. If Monitor refuses an
application, amendment 508 sets out what the notice of refusal must
contain. It must contain the reasons for the refusal and explain the

Monitor’s decision to grant an application under clause 69 for
designation. The new clause will allow the provider of the designated
service, or a potential provider of NHS services, to complain against a
designation of a particular service if they believe that the criterion,
as set out in subsection (3), for designating a service is not made.
The new clause would then require Monitor to re-examine its original
decision and decide whether the designation should be removed or
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000293">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new
clause will also allow the commissioner for the provider or potential
provider to appeal to the first-tier tribunal should they believe
Monitor’s decision on the complaint was based on an error of
fact, or wrong in law, or unreasonable. By allowing complaints against
a designation of services by the provider, or potential provider, in
question, new clause 10 provides an important check to ensure that
services are not unnecessarily designated, which would prevent market
entry and would mean that the benefits of competition—greater
quality, innovation and efficiency—would be missed out on.
Unnecessary designation would also mean unnecessary additional cost to
providing services, as providers and commissioners would have to pay
for the protection that designation offers, by paying into the
financial mechanisms that will cover the cost of insuring the
continuity of services in the event of failure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000294">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At this
point, I would like to clarify a misconception that has appeared in
recent reporting of designated services. As I have said before—I
believe it is important, so I will say it again—just because a
service is not designated does not mean that commissioners plan to
close that service. Rather, that means that the commissioner has
contracts in place with other providers locally to provide that same
service and, should one of the providers fail, then those other
providers could be called up to replace the lost
capacity.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000295">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New clause 11
introduces measures that will govern how complaints can be made in
relation to Monitor’s decision to refuse an application for
designation under clause 69. The new clause will allow the
commissioner, or the provider of the service, to complain against the
decision not to designate if they believe that the criterion, as set
out in subsection (3), for designating a service is met. The new clause
would then require Monitor to re-examine its original decision and
decide whether the designation should be applied or not. The new clause
would also allow the commissioner, or the provider, to appeal to the
first-tier tribunal should they believe that Monitor’s decision
on the complaint was based on an error of fact, or wrong in law, or
unreasonable. New clause 11 would also provide an important check to
ensure that services that actually need the protection of designation
are able to obtain protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, new
clause 14 introduces general rules to which all complaints under this
chapter must follow. The new clause would mean that complaints would
only be accepted if they are received no later than 28 days after the
decision to which the complaint relates was notified. The new clause
would restrict individuals at Monitor, who were involved in the
original decision, from being involved in the reconsideration of the
original decision. The new clause would also restrict the grounds of
appeal to the first-tier tribunal, only if the complainant believed
that Monitor’s decision on the reconfiguration was based on an
error of fact, or wrong in law, or unreasonable. The new clause
provides that the first-tier tribunal may confirm Monitor’s
decision, or direct that it is not to have effect. On that basis, I
move the amendments and new clauses, and urge my hon. Friends to
support
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000299">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have a few questions about new clause 10. It notes that a provider of a
designated service could be one who has a significant interest in the
application, but who will judge what qualifies as a significant
interest? Benefit providers with significant resources will be able to
challenge a decision legally, so we are concerned, again, about the
process of opening it up to legal challenge and it becoming a
lawyers’ charter for the private sector. We are also not
satisfied about bureaucracy continuing to be a problem. If any
interested health care provider challenges a decision, Monitor must
consult the commissioner who made the original application and,
whatever the outcome, an appeal can be made and it will be dealt with
by a first-tier tribunal. That might not happen—I accept that it
is a matter of judgment—but it might happen repeatedly, which
would increase the amount of time spent on
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000301">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe that new clause 11 will also lead to more bureaucracy. It
covers an important area, but the entire process of designation,
challenge and appeal could lead to countless lengthy disputes over
designation of services in relation to providers, commissioners,
Monitor and tribunals.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000302">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Finally, on amendment 505 and new clause 12, what
is significantly different under the new clause from subsections (8) to
(10) of clause 71, which are of such concern to the Government? I
understand that the Government tried to table an amendment to delete
that part of the clause, but I assume that the Clerks did not accept
it. Will the Minister say more about what is different? Clearly, the
Government did not like what they put in the Bill originally, so it
would be useful to know why they now propose this new

                           </strong> Again, it might be helpful if I clear up this
point. The reason why we are adding the new clauses and seeking to

an important issue. I would have thought that, rather than giggling,

because my hon. Friends and I still want to explore many matters. As I
said in my opening remarks, we are somewhat unconvinced by the
Minister’s arguments. These provisions amount to a charter for
hospital and service closure, which will be made easier by these
proposals, and, given the funding backdrop against which we live, they
will be a major driver. Many parts of the Bill will change
the NHS as we know it for ever.
<p class="tabbed">We have had a
lot of time to discuss accountability, Monitor, competition and giving
powers to quangos, such as the national commissioning board and Monitor
itself. The clause puts Monitor at the centre of everything that is
going on in the national health service and gives it untold powers. We
will discuss pricing and why we need an income regulator
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000317">&#160;</a>

designation of services has not received much attention until today and
the Minister has tried to explain it to us, but, unfortunately, he has
not been able to give us many examples or details. He keeps saying that
guidance will be forthcoming some time in the future. We find ourselves
in the incredible situation of having to make decisions with lots of
information missing. None the less, as I have said before, we will
oppose this clause. The fact is that these duties are overseen by
Monitor. We have already talked about bureaucracy, but we are placing a
massive burden on those who must do this work. It will distract them

that and how long the process will take. It is unclear how the process
will work on the ground. That is crucial. When will the process of
designation or non-designation begin and how long will it take? I will
come to resources in a minute. If the process is done in the way in
which we think it will be done, it will be a massive distraction for

                        <p>The
other thing that we are not clear about—I do not want to go into
the arguments about primary care trusts—is how many people will
still be around who have the necessary skills to do that. The Minister
has said that that is not an issue, but we know that people are
leaving. It would be interesting to know how many commissioners have
given an indication that they wish to leave the health service and how
many have already left. It would be useful to have that information.
Commissioners are skilled people; they have a great deal of
knowledge.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000323">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What about
GP-provided services? Are we into designation and non-designation of
such services? Later, we will talk about gatekeeper GP services. I am
not sure whether GPs and the services that they provide in health
centres or surgeries will be part of this grand designation plan. If
they are, that will entail even more bureaucracy and involvement. Will
the Minister set out the costs of this whole designation process and
tell us how long he expects it to take?<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of course
there is also the disruption as well as the pressures and the cost.
People are under huge pressure to find unprecedented efficiencies and
face not only cost pressures but the massive reorganisation, which the
Government had said would not happen but will now happen. How does the
Minister expect the commissioners and NHS staff to cope with all that
as well as take on other responsibilities? The disruption is very
important. A report that was published last week mentioned the real
threat to services, to which I may come
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000325">&#160;</a>
                        </p>On
page 98 of the explanatory notes, paragraph 588 states:
<p class="hs_brev">“The
determination as to whether the criterion would be met for a service
should in practice be based on an assessment of evidence of patient
needs and local provision, and therefore done principally by local
professionals with local knowledge. Commissioners would be expected to
demonstrate this evidence to
Monitor”.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000410">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
return to the point that these people are supposed to know everything
that is going on locally, but they will have to appear in court before
Monitor to demonstrate that what they are saying is correct. These
people have been commissioning services for years, but under the Bill
they have to convince Monitor that they are following the rules, which
is remarkable. The explanatory notes go on to say that commissioners
would be expected to demonstrate the evidence to Monitor<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“when applying

responses”.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000411">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It
would be interesting to see how far that goes in the light of the time
taken to look through various consultation responses. As I said, this
has to be done when services are not designated and when they are
designated, and we are not quite clear how that will work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000327">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again, I
would put the emphasis on local knowledge. The Government are trying to
have it both ways: they say they want GP consortia and local
professionals and clinicians to drive everything, but people still have
to appear before Monitor, which will make the final decision. The
Government try to dress that up by saying that as long as people follow
the rules, everything will be okay, but we do not have any details or
guidance about how the process will work. That is quite extraordinary,
and the Minister might want to say something later on that important
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will people
increasingly be looking at the profit line in this process? They might
want to deal only with services they can make a profit out of, and they
might get rid of other services, because they will be focusing on the
pressure on them as a result of the drive for increased competition,
rather than on promoting patients’ best interests. The Minister
might think that this does not require any comment from him, but it has
been raised with Opposition Members by several people working in the
health service. <em>[</em>

some comment, but the fact is that people who work in the health
service raised these issues with us, and they have much more knowledge
of them than we have.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000329">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As I will keep
repeating, Monitor is at the centre of all this. The hon. Member for
Totnes (Dr Wollaston) made an important point in an interview last
week, when she called those working for Monitor<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000330">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The
people running Monitor will not be those who have a patient background
or whose primary concern is to ensure integration and collaboration in
services and to promote the interests of patients. This will be about
economic regulation and driving competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To stick to
local accountability, the Government often say that local
people—professionals, clinicians and patients—will drive
this process. Interestingly, paragraph 4.1 on page 27 of the
White Paper states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000332">&#160;</a>

                        <p>except
Monitor, that is. Paragraph 1.10 on page 8 says:<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000333">&#160;</a>

                        <p>although
not, of course, from Monitor, which is omnipresent. The Secretary of
State talked about top-down forced closures, but if Monitor is not a
top-down structure, I do not know what it is—apparently, it will
have no regional presence—and I wonder how that fits in with the
Secretary of State’s words. We will come back to hospital
closures a little later.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000334">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At a time of
great financial strain and pressure on NHS staff and the service, where
will Monitor get the expertise—this comes back to the point
about Monitor not having the necessary expertise—to examine and
challenge designation proposals from local professionals with local
knowledge? Where will that resource come from? How much bureaucracy
will be involved in that process? How many people will Monitor have
working on it? Those are important questions. The Government say we are
cutting bureaucracy and getting rid of management consultants, so we
need to know the answers. What will
happen?<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000335">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government—not just Ministers in the Department of Health, but
Ministers throughout the Government, from the Prime Minister
down—have made great play of the fact that they want massively
to reduce the cost of management consultants. Will management
consultants be employed by Monitor or anyone else to help this process
through? How many consultants will Monitor employ? Have the Government
set a financial limit on Monitor’s use of consultants, because
it will not be able to find enough qualified people? Will the
Government prevent the re-employment of former NHS staff who have left
with redundancy packages, or left the service, as management
consultants? What will the Government say about
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000336">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister said that we should not be concerned about designating
services. I come back to the point that we still do not understand why
the Government have a process that involves making a case to designate
a service rather than to undesignate it. That goes to the heart of the
Government’s proposals. The process lacks scrutiny. How many
services need to be considered for designation? I will keep repeating
that question because it is about how the process will be carried out,
how  long it will take, and how many people and how much

                           </div>NHS resource will have to be involved. Why would a commissioner who has
been commissioning a service decide it should not be designated all of
a sudden? It is a problematic process because it is changing the Bill;
they now have to consider whether a service is designated. We find
ourselves in an unbelievable
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000337">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
are differences among hospitals, GPs and  different health
providers. As I said in the debate on amendment 478, hospital services
are highly interdependent. In the first instance, that means that if
one service is designated, a lot of others on which it relies might
also have to be, which makes the process messy. An example of that
might be accident and emergency, which needs a lot of back-up services
to make it safe. Will the Minister guarantee that every A and E will be
designated? I will come back to reconfiguration, but I must ask the
Minister to give us a guarantee. It is very easy
if this is not about
cuts.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000338">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
make the point I made before: it is difficult to say exactly what in a
hospital is designated. What if a doctor works 50% of the time on a
designated service and 50% on a non-designated service? What happens to
him if the hospital becomes insolvent? What happens if a piece of
equipment is used 50% of the time on a designated service and 50% on a
non-designated service? Those are important
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000339">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On the question of designated services and how
difficult it is when they are linked to other services, I know that the
Minister does not like examples, but it is well publicised that the
West Cumberland hospital and its NHS foundation trust are in financial
difficulties. It was widely reported in the media that it is running a
deficit of £20 million. In such circumstances, under the new
arrangements, presumably, Monitor would use its powers to encourage
another provider, either an existing foundation trust or a private
sector provider, to take it over. If, as the Minister suggests, there
are certain key services, and those are essential for the people of
west Cumbria, such as A and E, how could A and E possibly be designated
without designating all the other integrated services that relate to
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000340">&#160;</a>

well thought out point that undermines the idea that we can easily
break up hospitals into individual services. In keeping with what he

whole when making decisions about
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000341">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister might want to correct this, but I get the impression that
there will be a determination to break hospital services into different
parts and not, for instance, designate a whole service in terms of its
inter-reaction. We will be interested to hear what he says. What about
the impact of this on the integration of services? Fitting in with
regional services will be an important element, as I mentioned before.
The King’s Fund makes some important
points:<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000342">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

that removing the Secretary of State’s ability to intervene in
reconfiguration will pass responsibility to Monitor, which is
unelected. That will make it easier to allow plans to make unpopular
cuts and to close down services. Ministers will then try to wash their
hands of that by saying, “Not me, guv; it was Monitor, and that
is what Parliament voted for.” I still think that there will be
a lot of pressure in Parliament, through Adjournment and other debates,
on the Secretary of State and other Ministers, but one has the
impression that they are trying to wash their hands of the matter and
blame everything on
Monitor.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000353">&#160;</a>

comment. It sort of says that things were not done in a
“fact-based transparent way.” Again, we would be very
grateful if the Minister gave us some examples of where that has
happened. I may be misreading comments about MPs. The article
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000357">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>We
are very grateful. We are most grateful that the chair of Monitor says
that we can continue to make representations on the closure of
services. We will be doing so.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000358">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The fact is
that the Secretary of State and Ministers have been taken out of the
equation. May I give a couple of examples that might be useful in
showing how important the switch from the Secretary of State to Monitor
is? There was a review of burns services in the country as a whole. In
the north, that review recommended that the most serious burns cases
should be centred in Manchester and taken away from the Liverpool
designated hospital, which was Whiston and St Helens—one of my
local hospitals. There was a great deal of debate and massive public
opposition, which ran into the thousands, to the review. There were
petitions and much lobbying of MPs took place.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000359">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It came to
light that the person who had a significant say in transferring that
part of the service to Manchester was Manchester based. Through a lot
of ground work, done by MPs, we found out that many of the data
responsible for the decision’s being proposed were not adding
up. That came about because we could ask the Minister questions. She
could make representations on our behalf and intervene on the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000360">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 929<a class="bkMark" name="Column929">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the end of
the day, the decision was changed. That was fact-based and pretty
transparent. The Secretary of State was able to express a view on the
matter, which was translated to the service in the north-west. That
intervention meant that there was such an outcome. Monitor does not
have to take account of such things. The fact is that we will lose
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000361">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second example relates to my local trust—Warrington and Halton
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Again, there was a great debate and
campaign because the trust wanted to transfer its critical care in some
medical wards from the Halton site to the Warrington site. There were
good arguments for doing that. We listened to those. After meeting the
Minister, we asked Professor Sir George Alberti to come along and look
at the services, and he did that. Based on his recommendations, the
service was transferred, but we managed to campaign to have other
services delivered at our hospital in Halton—more operations,
day surgery and so on. That was a very important part of the process of
seeing the Minister. The Minister got involved and expressed a view on
the matter. Again, that was done in a fact-based, transparent way. I
take it as a bit of a slight for the chair of Monitor to be saying that
we do not do things in a fact-based, transparent
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
two examples I gave involved massive public
involvement—demonstrations, marches and petitions. If the
patients are at the centre of the Government’s proposals, how
much weight will be given to them in the reconfiguration of decisions,
particularly if the chair of Monitor believes that a “strong
emotional attachment” is the problem? How is a strong, emotional
attachment to NHS services a problem? Is that not a good thing and a
very important part of the process? I can see what he is getting at. He
is trying to say that emotion overrides facts and that Ministers are
susceptible to that type of influence. I have given two examples where
the facts were transparent, the emotion was strong and decisions were
taken on that basis. Whose views will win most in these reforms? Will
it be patients or will it be others? We keep hearing that patients will
be involved, but they will not have the decision. I could go on to give
further examples, but I will leave it
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the issue of reconfiguration, which is an important part of the
process, the King’s Fund has raised some important concerns. It
has
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000364">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

authorities”—<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000422">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>the
Minister may remember that I made this point in the debate on the
amendment—<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000365">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“is
underlined by a new report published by The King’s Fund on the
reconfiguration of hospital services. The report shows that essential
changes to improve quality and tackle financial deficits in some
hospitals are unlikely to happen if left to market forces
alone.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000423">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is a very
important point, which the Minister needs to consider. The
King’s Fund goes on to
state:<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000366">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Bill enables GP consortia to collaborate to address issues across
consortia boundaries. However, they may not have the appetite or the

                        <p class="tabbed">In
light of designation, and other changes, could the Minister tell us how
major service reconfigurations will be overseen in future? What about
the regional perspective? That is particularly important—and I
am glad that the King’s Fund agree with us—because, given
the loss of the strategic health authorities, there is a real issue
concerning leadership, making or driving forward proposals, and
ensuring that there is strategic vision. I would like to hear the
Minister’s
thoughts.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000369">&#160;</a>

is time consuming, bureaucratic and costly at best. The Opposition
believe that it is a mechanism to allow wholesale cuts in the NHS so as
to bring in more competition, with lip service paid to local clinical
and professional views and those of patients. There is a complete lack
of scrutiny here, and a lack of the detail needed for us to make an
important decision. Monitor believes public attachment is a problem,
which we find unbelievable. It will be fertile ground for lawyers,
legal challenge and bureaucracy. It is a terrible proposal and we will
vote against
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000370">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The clause, as we have heard, provides for
commissioners—commissioning consortia, the NHS commissioning
board, or the Secretary of State if exercising his powers—to
apply to Monitor for services to be designated and put into a special
administration regime where there has been a provider failure.
Additional regulation will exist to ensure that there is continued
provision where a failure regime is initiated. There is an
acknowledgement of the need for this regulation to protect vital health
services where they fail in the new health
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000371">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have discussed the importance of Monitor to the new health market, and,
in the view of Opposition Members, the over-reliance on this
superquango. Monitor’s key concluding function will be to act
when patients’ local services are forced to close. A
commissioner can apply for a service to be designated only if there is
an absence of alternative provision, and when ceasing to provide the
service would have a significant adverse impact on the health of
patients. The commissioner must also have regard to the current and
future need for the provision, and whether losing the service would
significantly reduce equality of
access.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000372">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
it will be for Monitor—which, we should not forget, is the
economic regulator—to decide whether the commissioner has
satisfied the criteria to carry out a consultation and demonstrate that
clinical need will not be met. That raises the fundamental question of
why the economic regular of health services should make that judgment
of clinical need. My hon. Friend the Member for Halton referred to that
earlier, and other colleagues have discussed the considerable
administrative burden of proof that this will place on commissioners to
show that a service is defined as
vital.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000373">&#160;</a>
                        </p>That
is another example of the contradiction between the actions of the
Government and their rhetoric. In the way in which the clause is
formulated, they seem to have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 931<a class="bkMark" name="Column931">&#160;</a>
                        </div>moved from patients’ champion to defender of bureaucracy. A
considerable bureaucracy is being established under the guise of
Monitor, which, we discovered last week, will cost half a billion
pounds—over the lifetime of a Parliament—with a
comprehensive role that runs counter to the rhetoric that we have
previously heard from the Government Front Bench. We know that Monitor
intends to interpret its power to grant an application for designated
services, as set out in subsection (6), but we will not know how until
it writes its regulations after the passage of the Bill. That concern
was also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
Halton.<p class="tabbed">In
the current financial climate, with pressures for efficiency savings,
Monitor can be expected to challenge applications and to require
commissioners to jump through hoops. Even with the kind of budget that
we have discussed—up to £140 million a year—there
are questions about whether Monitor will have sufficient funds to meet
its obligations to areas with failing services, because Ministers have
not been capable of making any estimation of service failures. That is
despite my repeated questions, parliamentary questions, letters and the
matter being raised in Committee. There has been no robust or
meaningful response about service failures, either commissioner or
provider failures, which will be a really big issue for the reorganised
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000374">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition are concerned that Monitor will be given the latitude to
decide upon its own guidance under clause 73, which it will then
publish and require commissioners to follow. The guidance will cover
applying for designation of a service under clause 69, and reviewing of
designation and applying for the removal of designation, where it has
been granted, under clause 71. The Government are being coy about the
necessity of provider failure in the market that the Bill creates, and
they have not spoken clearly about it in their vision for the future of
the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000375">&#160;</a>

management”, and that it has been “covered up” and
“propped up through covert subsidies”. Would my hon.

subsidies and have been, as the Minister said, “propped
up”, when they have actually been helped to continue, so that we

with a grasp of what is proposed in the Bill will be surprised by what

of the strategic planning at PCT or SHA level, under the new

service is failed by the market, the Bill will prevent any centrally
dictated rescue of that service, no matter what public opinion or,
indeed, local representatives might think. If

                           </div>I am wrong and if there are provisions in the Bill that allow Ministers
to intervene to prevent the market from reaching that conclusion
through the vehicle of Monitor, I will gladly give way, but I see that
the Minister does not want to speak. That point was also made by the
hon. Member for Southport last week when we were dealing with clauses
56 to 60. Despite Government Front-Bench rhetoric, the Bill will
ultimately prevent democratic pressures from affecting decisions on
health care provision, replacing them with market forces and
unaccountable superquangos.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000379">&#160;</a>

referred frequently to the impact assessment. It is important, and it
is illuminating to read. It makes it clear that local hospitals will
have to close, and that local MPs, councils and campaigners must not be
allowed any influence in that regard. The sweeping powers being given
to Monitor to dictate the failure regime are also mentioned in
supporting documents to the Bill. The consultation document
“Regulating healthcare providers” states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000380">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>

Minister said, it is clear that the failure regime is not there to
mitigate significant service failures; in his view, the mechanism will
be used only in extreme circumstances. I suspect that the Minister has
significantly underestimated the failure rate. At the risk of repeating
myself, I believe that the theoretical basis for the Bill is contained
in paragraph B4 of the impact assessment. It is important to listen to
this, because it gives the guiding principles of the Bill. It

will send shock waves through existing NHS providers if it is given the
force of law. The document goes on to explain that unless providers are
allowed to access the market, the changes made under the Bill will not
produce the anticipated benefits—in other words, the Bill
anticipates a failure regime, and Government Front Benchers consider
that that failure may be a good thing as it could bring about
innovation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032278000383">&#160;</a>

In response to that intervention, we understand that Monitor judges by
quality and is an economic assessor, so if we are talking about poor
providers, what is the context? Is it poor economically or poor in
