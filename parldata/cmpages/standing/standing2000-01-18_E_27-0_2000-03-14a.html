<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> When we adjourned, I was talking of the speech of the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray). I said that he was presenting himself today not as the philosopher king that he played last week but as a lance corporal. I was rather sorry about that, because I enjoyed him in that former role; it reminded me of the writings of some of our great philosophers. Bertrand Russell immediately came to mind. Indeed, I thought of the hon. Gentleman recently, when re-reading Russell's ten commandments. The third is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The tenth states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool's paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hesitate to say so, but that is an apposite comment on the position taken by the Opposition.
<P>
Bertrand Russell came to mind because he wrote a small pamphlet entitled ``In Praise of Idleness''. However, that is not a charge that would I levy against the hon. Member for North Wiltshire. His speech was essentially in praise of congestion. It was a most extraordinary speech, and quite counter-intuitive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): My hon. Friend the Minister might recall the Russell theory of paradox, which has been exemplified by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire on many occasions. Premise A: traffic congestion. Premise B: hypothecation. Ergo: integrated transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. I shall speak in a moment of the curious logic of the hon. Member for North Wiltshire. First, he raised the question of what would happen to existing workplace car parking spaces. He wondered whether businesses would dig them up. The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) nodded at that, and I suspect that some businesses will do so.
<P>
Some businesses might decide to reduce the number of car parking spaces. That would be a perfectly sensible response for an employer who did not wish to pay too large a levy, particularly if alternatives were available for their employees to travel to work without having to depend on the private car.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Will the Minister turn his mind to my constituency? The Dyson company, which manufactures vacuum cleaners, has about 1,200 parking places outside its factory. Planning permission for a huge factory expansion has just been turn down. If I were Mr. Dyson, and the Government wanted to impose that huge tax, I would say: ``Parking is cancelled, lads. You can park anywhere you like in the surrounding area. There are no parking restrictions in Malmesbury. Park wherever you like and cause as much congestion as you like, and I shall build my factory in the car park.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman assumes that it would be acceptable to introduce a scheme that had such an effect. I said this morning that in deciding whether to approve a scheme, the Secretary of State would want to be satisfied that there would be no adverse consequences. It will be made clear in guidance that schemes should not result in additional pressure on on-street parking. The purpose is to discourage the unnecessary movement of vehicles into an area, and to encourage green transport plans and alternatives. That scenario would be looked at closely.
<P>
However, I take what the hon. Gentleman said about that site. Using land that is currently sterilised by a car park—brownfield land in city areas—for new office buildings or new housing would be entirely consistent with the Government's policy of urban renaissance, of making better use of brownfield sites. The hon. Gentleman is on to a good thing. He is saying how his constituents might contribute to the Government's policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): The Minister mentioned in passing that companies might develop their own green transport plans. He passed rather quickly over my contribution, but with a great deal of praise, for which I am grateful. I remind him that I said that there would be considerable merit in looking again at the tax regime in relation to the support that companies give employees for using alternative transport. I pointed out that the support given by employers for season tickets is taxable. Does he agree that there would be merit in reconsidering the tax regime, and would he be prepared to go further and suggest that some of the ring-fenced money raised from car parking levies could be recycled to offset some of the costs that companies can incur when setting up green transport policies for their employees?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes several fair points. I start by apologising for not doing justice to his speech this morning. I was seeking to conclude the debate before 1 pm, but I was unfortunately deceived by the clock, which told me that I had two minutes to spare. I am now a little more expansive. I apologise for being in such a rush to complete the debate before lunch.
<P>
I accept that many issues of that nature will need to be considered. Tax is obviously a matter for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. It would be inappropriate for me to make statements on such matters, especially in the week before the Budget. However, I agree that one of the purposes of the Bill is to incentivise employers to consider helping their employees to get to work other than by depending on the private motor car. Green transport plans and other arrangements that would help employees to use public transport or to walk, or other means, should all be considered. Disincentives, too, need to he considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> May I pursue that point a little further? Does the Minister agree that it would be perfectly in order for a local authority—a charging authority— to use some of those proceeds to make grants to companies in the charging area to offset some of the costs of that company's establishing a green transport policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I do not want to go into too much detail. I have given the general response to the hon. Gentleman. Important issues need to be considered, but I would rather not give an off-the-cuff response on a point of detail that has interesting fiscal implications—matters on which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will no doubt have a view.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) made another interesting observation. He said that congestion charging would reduce employment. That was put forward on the curious premise that the prominent merchant banker who featured in this morning's proceedings, Mr. Goldman Sachs, who is paid hundreds of thousands of pounds and given bonuses of millions of pounds, would lose his job because his employer was unwilling to pay a parking charge of £3,000 for his Roller. That is an incredible proposition. I invite the hon. Gentleman to think back to his own days in the City, and to recall the ethos that applied then. I would be surprised if that led to a reduction in employment. It might now reduce some of the bonuses paid to fat cats, but as the hon. Gentleman was most scathing about fat cats he would presumably welcome that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Goldman Sachs is the largest financial institution in the world. It is an employer, not an employee. If, for any reason, the company had to pay out large sums of money, it would plainly affect its profitability. That may have a knock-on effect on the number of people being employed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am sure that the company would look specifically at the cost benefit of such provisions. The Opposition's double whammy would allow them to recover the cost from the bonus otherwise paid to the fat cat. We should, however, leave Mr. Goldman Sachs and progress to the next interesting point.
<P>
We heard about the hon. Gentleman's journey from his London home, via schools that curiously opened—as my Member for Watford (Ms Ward) pointed out—at 7 am, to his office, where he had difficulty parking. The reduced number of parking places is designed to discourage people from taking their cars into congested areas. In Chippenham—the last place that we visited in his most interesting tour of the country—he suggested that young people who attend Saturday training at Chippenham Town football club would be liable for the charge. I should make it clear that an 11-year-old who arrives by motor—

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Their parents bring them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If their parents bring them, they will arrange to collect them at the end of the training session, without incurring a parking charge during training. Alternatively, they might think it a good idea to encourage the young person to come on foot to prove that it is not just the time spent training on the pitch that is good for sport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): My hon. Friend may want to bear it in mind that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire also said that Chippenham Town had sold one of its best strikers to Swindon Town. Given Swindon Town's league position, he might think that that is another dud from North Wiltshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I note my hon. Friend's point, but given the result of the match between Swindon and Charlton last week, I did not think it wise to mention that fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am prompted by the intervention of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape). Despite having sold our best striker, we did remarkably well in Saturday's cup match and we are now through to the semi-final of the FA Vase. It was a most pleasing result.
<P>
It was interesting to hear the Minister admit that the Council for Physical Recreation is correct in presuming that parents of young people who come to a football ground for Saturday morning training will have their cars taxed. To say that young people should walk reveals the Minister's limited knowledge. That might be possible in Greenwich, but in a rural area, such as mine, and in many large city areas, people travel considerable distances to get to football grounds. To say: ``Never mind. They can pay the tax. If they don't like paying the tax, they can walk,'' shows how little he is concerned about our youngsters' training in football grounds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> On the contrary, it shows my interest in ensuring that our young people are fit. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there are alternative options to explore, which is what the debate is about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the Minister agree that it would be possible, even with his interpretation, to introduce a charging scheme under which charges were not levied on a Saturday?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I said that it would be open to local authorities to vary the charge day by day. Assuming that congestion on Saturdays would not be heavy, it would be possible for an authority to decide that no charge should apply. In those circumstances, any person taking their child to Chippenham Town football club for training on a Saturday would not be liable for the charge. There is no fundamental objection to the policy.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) made some useful points, not least the importance of the hypothecation. He asked whether the period could be longer than 10 years. We have always said that the 10-year period was intended to allow the benefits of the scheme to be reviewed. The availability of the hypothecated income stream will not necessarily cease after 10 years, but the benefit should be reviewed at the end of that period.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) made a number of points about people in rural areas and emphasised the extent to which they depend on motor cars. My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson) rightly pointed out that many people in rural areas do not have access to motor cars. Indeed, we must not leave those people without transport and they should have public alternatives.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Having said that, I recognise that travel by motor car is important in a number of rural areas. Most such areas do not have a serious congestion problem, so the likelihood of a charge being introduced is probably less. I am not familiar with the current circumstances of Market Drayton or Oswestry and I do not know whether their traffic problems would merit the introduction of a charging scheme. Despite the nightmare of the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, the imminent appearance of gantries over the approach to Oswestry is probably not the immediate priority of local planners. As a little aside, I suspect that if there is any use for the infamous gantries in North Wiltshire, it will be to provide goalposts for the kids' training—
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): In which case, from where will the money come for the improvements in public transport that the Government have heralded during our consideration of the Bill? The Minister is right, neither Oswestry nor Market Drayton have great traffic congestion or parking problems, and schemes to deal with such problems are not necessarily needed there. However, because he failed to get money out of the Treasury, local authorities can obtain money for the transport schemes heralded by the Government only by enforcing parking or congestion charging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. We have already made available the substantial sum of £170 million for rural bus services through a direct initiative undertaken by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The initiative will succeed in securing funds for the further improvement of rural bus services and we will continue to do just that. The option of a charging scheme, whether for congestion or for workplace parking, is designed for circumstances in which an authority believes that such a scheme is appropriate to reduce congestion. Raising money is not the purpose of the schemes, although additional funds for the improvement of local public transport services could be a by-product. Councillors in the hon. Gentleman's constituency might want to pursue such schemes, but it is entirely their choice to do so. The schemes are not imposed and authorities are not required to run them; indeed, alternative options have been put in place. The Government will pursue an agenda to ensure that further work is done to give effect to our integrated transport policy proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> These matters are fundamental to the concerns of rural areas. The Minister's explanation reveals the urban basis from which all transport policy has come. The expenditure and investment required to establish a comprehensive public transport system in a rural area such as my own is enormous—£170 million is a lot of money. The cost of establishing comprehensive public transport in my area that can reach the other third mentioned by the hon. Member for Harwich will be titanic. If the money does not come from central Government, it will have to come from some form of local taxation and the Bill gives local authorities the chance to impose such taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can only repeat that that is a matter for the local authority to consider. I shall not prejudge its conclusions—all I can say is that we are investing money in rural bus services. I am told by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), who is an expert on such matters, that a 20 per cent. increase has been made in provision for the local transport plan in Shropshire in the current year. That is a significant uplift and I am sure that the good councillors of Oswestry and Market Drayton are considering the options for using those resources to best effect and to improve transport options for people in their area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That was an interesting observation by the Under-Secretary. I went to Oswestry 10 days ago and saw a volunteer scheme run by Oswestry Helpmates that operates minibuses and private cars driven by volunteers and links up with the public bus service run by Arriva. There has been an increase in the number of buses on some of the main routes, but in a thinly populated area such as my constituency there is a need for further transport modes, such as volunteer cars and volunteer minibuses. Enormous investment is needed to provide a comprehensive transport system, but the proposal will not approach the sums required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, we are already encouraging community transport schemes and putting supplementary funding into them. I am delighted to hear about this initiative. It sounds an admirable response to the special circumstances in Shropshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): In putting together their local transport plans, local authorities will be able to factor in the impact of congestion charges and workplace parking charges. In assessing those plans, central Government will be able to give the appropriate grant necessary to make them work in an integrated manner. Does the Minister agree that the philosopher and hon. Member for North Wiltshire is unlikely to agree with Mill's maxim that it is better to be a dissatisfied Socrates than a satisfied pig, unless the pig is Goldman Sachs? [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Answer, in Greek.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I do not intend to respond to my hon. Friend either in Greek or with other philosophical observations. We should return to the point in hand. However, I do congratulate my hon. Friend, who rightly highlighted some of the inconsistencies in the Opposition's position.
<P>
The final point made by the hon. Member for North Shropshire is that Telford and Wrekin, a well-run council, has decided not to adopt the proposal. That is the point of this arrangement, which leaves it to the local authority to determine the matter in the light of local circumstances. The purpose of the scheme is to give local authorities the ability to assess the potential benefits of charging; if they believe there are benefits, they should bring forward a scheme, and will that scheme is robust and satisfies the test which we will set, the Secretary of State should give consent. However, there are many steps to go through before that stage is reached.
<P>
I shall return to the amendments, which have justified this most interesting debate. The Opposition's amendments would allow local authorities to levy workplace parking charges on individual users of parking places as an alternative to requiring the occupier of the building to obtain a licence for its workplace parking needs. The amendments would make either building occupiers or individual motorists liable for workplace parking charges. That is the double whammy I referred to earlier. The amendments are not necessary. The Bill provides for two separate systems of charging—road-user charging, which we discussed last week, and workplace parking levies, which are specifically aimed at employers to encourage them to consider the amount of parking they provide.
<P>
Local authorities asked for powers in the form provided in the Bill so that they can promote local solutions to local traffic problems. I think that this approach, with different targets for the two forms of charges—congestion charging on the one hand and workplace charging on the other—makes sense. However, I would say that if businesses want to pass workplace parking levies on to their employees they will be able to do so, subject, of course, to negotiation with the employees concerned. Therefore the amendments are not necessary.
<P>
I would also like to re-emphasise the fact that local authorities that choose to introduce a workplace parking levy will be required to consult the local business community and, ideally, reach agreement before any scheme is introduced. Given the prospective benefits of reduced congestion and increased transport expenditure on appropriate local transport schemes, agreement may be possible. However, if agreement is not possible, the business community will have the opportunity to put its concerns to the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales, which will have to consent to any scheme before it can be introduced. Consequently, there are real safeguards in the arrangements to ensure that the interests of the business community are not overridden. 
<P>
I hope, at the end of this rather lengthy debate, that the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) will agree to withdraw the amendment. However, he is not in his place and I do not know whether it is right and proper for the hon. Member for Poole to withdraw it on the hon. Gentleman's behalf. If we have to vote on it, I invite Labour Members to vote against it.

Clause 154, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 155</center></H4>
<H4><center>Local licensing schemes</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> Clause 155 provides that a workplace parking levy scheme may cover all or part of the licensing authority's area. It also provides the essential link between a workplace parking levy scheme and the licensing authority's local transport plan.
<P>
The clause will ensure that any licensing scheme must be a coherent part of an authority's overall integrated local transport strategy. Schemes must help to meet the policies in an authority's local transport plan either directly or indirectly. The latter gives an authority the flexibility, for example, to fund complementary measures outside its own immediate area provided contribute that they contribute to the objectives in its own plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> As I understand it, local transport plans are drawn up for five years, and each year they can be amended. An authority may not state in its transport plan at the beginning of a five-year period that it will introduce a charging scheme, but can it during that period—perhaps in year two or three—amend its plan to establish such a scheme? I thought that the idea was to have plans that were subject to only reasonably modest amendments, but the clause's provisions are somewhat immodest. How will the proposal interact and operate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> During our somewhat lengthy discussion on the previous clause, the Minister frequently said that the Secretary of State or the relevant authority would accept a workplace charging levy scheme only if it was for the purposes of reducing congestion. Does the Under-Secretary accept that interpretation? Clause 155(2) refers to the meeting of a ``local transport plan''. Local transport plans are defined in clause 92, which states that they reduce congestion and involve
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services to, from and within their area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are huge merits in ensuring that the wide range of opportunities contained in local transport plan will be met by workplace charging. Will the Under-Secretary clarify the rather different messages given by his hon. Friend the Minister of State?
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> First, the hon. Member for Poole referred to the fact that local transport plans will operate within a five-year period, and asked whether it would be acceptable for a charging scheme of some description—a workplace parking levy scheme was just mentioned—to be introduced during that time. The answer is yes; we made it clear that charging schemes of both characters can be introduced at any stage during the 10-year period allowed by the Bill for the implementation of charging schemes. Presumably, a charging scheme could therefore finish 19 years and 11 months after the Bill is enacted. The Secretary of State would have to consider whether the scheme fulfilled the objectives of the local transport plan. If he deemed that it did, he would authorise its introduction. I hope that that explanation satisfies the hon. Member for Poole.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) asked a question that I did not fully grasp, as I was slightly distracted by thinking about the previous intervention. However, I shall try to answer the question as far as I understood it. We would expect congestion reduction to form part of a local transport plan. To the extent that a charging scheme is required, congestion reduction is an essential aspect of its implementation. We would also expect such aims to be entirely consistent with the objectives of local transport plans. If I have not grasped the hon. Gentleman's point, I shall give way again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The point is more important than the Under-Secretary has perceived it to be. The Minister of State repeatedly said that the acceptance of a scheme by the Secretary of State or by the relevant national authority would be determined by whether it achieved the objective of reducing congestion. However, the clause makes it clear that the purpose of a workplace levy charging scheme is to enable a local authority to meet its local transport plan at least in part. The purposes of the plan include the reduction of congestion but also involve other activities. The Bill makes a clear distinction on where a local authority may choose to introduce a charging scheme. It may seek to introduce such a scheme in an area that is not suffering significantly from congestion but where it would help it meet other objectives in the local transport plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I confess that I am still having difficulty in understanding the point being made by the hon. Gentleman. Clause 155 sets the scene for the introduction of charging schemes, specifically workplace parking levy schemes. My hon. Friend the Minister set out the policy.
<P>
I remind the hon. Member for Bath that the local transport plan will have a number of objectives, one of which is likely to be congestion reduction. The local transport plan will also include various public transport and road improvement measures. Consistency comes in at that point; the effects of road user charging and workplace parking levy schemes are themselves two-fold. On the one hand is the objective of congestion reduction. On the other hand, the objective is to raise revenue in order to permit investment public transport schemes or local road improvements, whichever is considered appropriate by the local authority. The conjoint effect of those objectives is to assist with congestion reduction. There is no essential contradiction in the purposes of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Under-Secretary may find that his briefing on amendment No. 479, which we shall reach later, will give him more powerful information on that point—I hope that it does. Does he envisage the Secretary of State authorising the introduction of a workplace charging levy scheme in an area where there is little congestion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The short answer is that it is the responsibility of the local authority to bring forward schemes. One might argue that the implementation of a charging scheme in certain areas could contribute to congestion reduction. However, I think that it would be reasonable to assume that the Secretary of State would be reluctant to introduce a charging scheme in an area that itself suffered relatively low congestion. I hope that that answer assists the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Some areas of the country suffer congestion only at certain times of the year, particularly holiday resorts such as the constituency of the hon. Member for Bath. Is it conceivable that a scheme could operate for only part of a year? A case could be made for congestion charging at one time of the year that would not stand the test of a full 12 months. How would one weigh those various aspects?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> There is a short answer to the hon. Gentleman's question. The question is whether a workplace levy parking scheme could apply to only part of a year to deal with seasonal working. The answer is yes.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 479, in page 89, line 5, after `premises', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which shall include out-of-town retail shopping complexes, entertainment facilities and warehouses'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now return to a matter that was the subject of an intervention on the Minister. I apologise for pressing the point, but I believe that it is important. I now have a fourth attempt to explain my concern. I shall do so by referring to the precise wording of clause 155(2) which states that a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>local licensing scheme may only be made if it appears desirable for the purpose of directly or indirectly facilitating the achievement of policies in the licensing authority's local transport plan.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A workplace charging scheme is supposed to help to achieve the range of measures in a local transport plan. When we discussed local transport plans many weeks ago, we agreed that their purpose was not merely to reduce congestion, but to meet other objectives. Those are set out in clause 92 and include the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>encouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is great merit in improving public transport for reasons other than reducing congestion. There is enormous benefit in improving public transport to reduce the overall number of cars on our roads and to tackle the associated financial and health costs. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire repeatedly asked the simple question of how will money be found to improve the much-needed public transport in his area if there is no workplace charging because there is no congestion. The hon. Gentleman and I could join forces to say that the Government do not provide adequate financial support directly from their funds to improve public transport. Leaving that argument aside, a local authority has the option to establish a workplace charging scheme to generate funds to improve public transport and reduce the use of cars even if there is no significant congestion.
<P>
I can make two strong arguments against the amendment. The first is argument C—the list argument. I could have included other items on my mini list of three. The second argument is that the schemes can be introduced in different parts of the charging area to include out-of-town shopping areas and leisure facilities. No doubt the Minister will say that the amendment is unnecessary for those reasons, but its purpose is twofold. First, we want to persuade him to discuss in more detail his thoughts on whether workplace charging schemes might operate in places other than highly congested areas, which would help to meet other aspects of the local transport plan. Secondly, some organisations that operate immediately outside congested areas are worried that they may lose out if a workplace parking scheme is introduced in a city centre. For example, it has been brought to my attention that supermarket operators might find their car parking spaces used as part of a non-authorised park-and-ride scheme. What measures would prevent that from happening? Does clause 155 mean what it says or something different, as outlined by the Under-Secretary?

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): I want to pursue what the hon. Member for Bath and the Minister have been saying by giving a local example of an out-of-town shopping centre, which has expressed concern about the workplace charging. I refer to the Metro centre outside Newcastle, one of the largest shopping centres in Europe. Its management are concerned that employees' parking places may be charged if the metropolitan borough of Gateshead so decided. It argues that this would be problematic as there is no adequate transport service to bring employees to the centre because they come from a wide area, often from the rural hinterland. It is concerned that the local authority might see charging as a cash cow, by which they can meet other public transport objectives in the built-up area of Gateshead. The Secretary of State does have a veto over any workplace parking system, although it is a local authority matter because it will have to be part of a transport plan. What would the Secretary of State's reaction be to a system where the local borough wanted to put a charge on car parking spaces at an out-of-town shopping centre such as the Metro centre, but did not provide adequate bus services and used the money for meeting other objectives in other parts of the borough?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The amendment touches a number of interesting areas and no doubt out-of-town shopping centres are concerned about it. However, it is not uncommon when there is a large investment in an out-of-town shopping centre for the retailer or the property owner to have an agreement with the local authority on parking policies because it is in the interests of an investor in retail sites to ensure that there is sufficient parking for customers. Sometimes it may insist on charging so that there is a turnover of cars and employees do not fill the car park, thereby preventing visits, and sometimes it will insist there is no charging, depending on local circumstances. Presumably, the implementation of any workplace charging scheme would mean that any agreements undertaken in the past between a local authority and a developer would no longer apply. In which case, would the investor have to go to judicial review to clarify whether the local authority had broken its agreement? Many local authorities make deals with developers and sign agreements setting out what a local authority will do and what an investor will do in terms of parking policy. I wonder whether a scheme devised by a local authority could run into a problem where it has a number of developments and has signed agreements with a developer or a property company on parking policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am so grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I will come to his technical point in due course. It appears to me that the speeches of the hon. Members for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) and for Bath are entirely at cross purposes. The hon. Member for Bath wants to extend such parking regimes to out-of-town shopping centres and entertainment complexes and warehouses, whereas the hon. Member for Hexham is opposed to such objectives. I have to say—[Interruption.] This may assist the hon. Member for Hexham. On this occasion, I come down on the side of the official Opposition but if that does not satisfy hon. Members I will certainly want to return to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I have to say that I did not express an opinion one way or the other. I was simply on a fishing trip to test the liability of out-of-town shopping centres in terms of staff parking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Before I deal in broad terms with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath, I want to respond to a couple of other points.
<P>
On the use of retail parking facilities by non customers, all hon. Members will have experience of such matters through their constituency activities. In my experience, such practices are wholly unacceptable to retailers and supermarket proprietors, who take firm measures to prevent such unauthorised parking. That is understandable, because people who buy goods from the supermarkets concerned cannot occupy the parking spaces. There is not a powerful argument for the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole raised the issue of arrangements or agreements between local authorities and developers. The parking provision requirements will not matter if the site owner reduces the amount of parking, as he will pay less levy in those circumstances. That should answer the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
I want to deal with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. I am grateful to him for raising the matter, which has been much discussed. I am sure that the Committee appreciates that there are two separate issues. First, where might the workplace parking levy be applied? Secondly, should the scope of the levy include customer parking at out-of-town retail and leisure centres? The amendment relates only to where the workplace parking levy might be introduced, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is unnecessary. Clause 155 provides that the workplace parking levy can apply across all or any part of a licensing authority's area. That includes workplace parking in out-of-town areas, as well as workplace parking in urban areas. Local authorities will decide whether a levy on workplace parking is appropriate for a particular area, and, if so, whether it should apply to out-of-town areas.
<P>
On the scope of the levy, the Committee will be aware that the hon. Gentleman has tabled new clause 28 in part III of the Bill, which would enable the Secretary of State to extend the scope of the levy by order to include non-workplace parking. The Committee should wait until the new clause has been considered before debating the wider question whether the Bill should provide a workplace parking levy, which would be extended to customer parking. I would not want to keep the hon. Gentleman in suspense over whether the Government will accept new clause 28, and I hope that he will not be too disappointed if I tell him that we will not. The parking levy provisions in the Bill will apply to workplace parking only. I see that the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) wishes to intervene. He is just in time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth </B>(Aldershot): I thought that we all believed in ``just in time'' these days. I am told that it is an efficient way of conducting business.
<P>
The Minister helpfully exoceted the Liberals by saying that the Government did not intend to extend the workplace parking provision to customer parking. Could not the courts interpret the expression ``business customer'', in clause 158(1)(b), as including you and I, Mr. Gale, were we to go shopping in our local out-of-town shopping centre, whether Sainsbury's or another store? Surely we could be construed as being business customers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The answer is very simple. There is an extremely clear division between a ``business customer'' and a shopper. The Government have no intention of extending the provisions of the workplace parking levy scheme to shoppers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Might not the courts, on the basis of the present wording, be invited to interpret ``business customer'' as being a customer of the business? A shopper is not a defined term in English law as far as I am aware. I can see that a business customer might be somebody coming to the supermarket to deal with matters relating to the planning of the extension of the supermarket or whatever, but is the Minister saying that he is entirely satisfied on the advice available to him that the definition of ``business customer'' could not be extended to include a shopper?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I hesitate to embark on a discussion of the contents of a clause that we have not yet reached, but I shall clarify it for the hon. Gentleman. I wish to welcome him to this Committee on one of his rare visits and ask him to cast his eye further down page 89. Under subsection (4) he will find the definition of ``business customer''. ``Business customer'', as defined here, quite clearly excludes, by any common understanding of the term, a shopper. I am sure that helps the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I turn to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bath—[Interruption.] I apologise for pronouncing Bath with a short ``a''. I am getting very confused about the two different pronunciations of Bath.
<P>
I hope in the light of the explanation I have offered that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw amendment No. 479.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I thought that the Minister might have addressed my point, but if he did I did not notice. When I was talking about out-of-town shopping centres, I was talking about staff parking places, not customer parking spaces. My point was: would a local authority get permission from the Secretary of State to impose a levy on an out-of-town shopping centre if that shopping centre caused no congestion at all and the local authority simply wanted a method of raising money for another transport scheme elsewhere in the borough—in other words, a cash cow?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call the Minister—sorry, the hon. Member for Poole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> You can call me Minister any time, Mr Gale. Let us take the example of a builder's merchant with two sorts of customers—builders who buy building supplies and members of the public who buy bits and pieces and things for the garden. A builder who had an account with the business and who regularly went in there, might be construed as a business customer. His parking would have to be paid for. However, a member of the public who went in there once in a blue moon to purchase something for the garden might be seen as a shopper. Am I right in that distinction? It does seem very difficult to work out whether someone is a business customer or a shopper. I can see a lot of building contractors dressing up people and saying: ``You're a shopper today! Go shopping!''
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We are entering the realms of ``what-iffery'' on a large scale. Under subsection (4) ``business'' is again defined as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any trade, profession, vocation or undertaking.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The expression ``business customer'' must be interpreted in the light of the definition of business under the Bill. A reasonable authority—if I dare say so, a reasonable court—would have little difficulty in drawing a distinction between a trades person professional or a person who is responsible for an undertaking and a shopper in the terms that we have debated such people.
<P>
I apologise to the hon. Member for Hexham for not dealing earlier with the point that he raised. Yes, the Bill and the local authority make a distinction between staff car parking facilities at an out-of-town amenity and customer parking facilities. It would be possible for a local authority to embrace such facilities in an out-of-town complex within the terms of a charging scheme. I hope that that explanation has been helpful to the hon. Gentleman.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Yes, on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Under-Secretary is a model of courtesy, of which members of other Committees would be advised to take note. Parking spaces that are available only to staff in the out-of-town shopping centres will have to be delineated, as will those that are available only to business visitors and those that will be available only to the general public. There will be no opportunity for cross-fertilisation. Shops will be under pressure to provide fewer staff parking spaces and allow the staff to park in the customer parking spaces, so that they do not incur the charge.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions are becoming rather long. I appreciate that such matters are inter-related and that the narrow substance of the amendment stretches into the rest of the clause. I shall bear that in mind when considering whether to have a clause stand part debate, so if members of the Committee have anything else to say about the clause, they had better say it now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It might be appropriate, at least before the hon. Member for North Shropshire joins in the fun, if I attempt to reply to the hon. Member for Aldershot. My mind boggles at the notion of cross-fertilisation between parking spaces. I do not think that any of us should explore that avenue in much detail. The hon. Gentleman almost seemed to be inciting a breaking of the law in the use of non-staff parking spaces—non-workplace parking spaces—and the use of customer parking spaces, but I hope that that was not the case. As part and parcel of the charging scheme, the Secretary of State would be looking for the company to be encouraged to use a green travel plan, to which the hon. Member for Bath referred and of which the Government are highly supportive. In those circumstances, it would be our expectation that there would be little encouragement for breaking the law.
<P>
Having said that, I must agree with the hon. Member for Aldershot that the delineation of spaces is an issue. That is true. A certain amount of detailed application will be necessary in such cases. This is not the first time in Committee that questions of detail have been raised and we do not want to shy away from the fact that complexities are involved in the application of our proposals. However, the broad principles of the provisions are clear and we think that local authorities, which widely support workplace parking levies, will be happy to deal with such detail in due course when the Bill is enacted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> We are getting into the most infernal muddle. The Under-Secretary has conceded that there will be problems with delineation. If workers in the famous Metro centre want to avoid the charge, they can park in shoppers' spots, go and buy some buns from the bakery and ostentatiously put them in a bag, declare that they are shoppers and go to their places of work for the rest of the day. Nothing in the Bill would prevent that.
<P>
Conversely, professionals such as accountants or solicitors may have sensibly opened an office in the shopping centre. Their customers could qualify as shoppers. They have as legitimate a reason to go to buy services at the Metro centre as those who go to by groceries or batteries for a radio. A person in a suit with a briefcase who wants to visit his solicitor or accountant would be raked in as a ``business customer'' under the definition in subsection (4), as he would not appear to be a shopper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot mentioned the stark example of builder's merchants, where builders come in with trade accounts. For instance, BÿQ's super-warehouses now deal with trade as well as retail customers. How does one say that a parking space occupied by builders in a van is taxable if they pop in to get some drainpipes, but not taxable if an individual occupies the space and does the same? Does my hon. Friend agree that that is nonsense?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for backing me up. Subsection (4) says that a business customer ``means a client''. Those who go to see professionals tend to be regarded as clients, not customers. The Under-Secretary has conceded that there are practical muddles on the matter. Would it not be sensible to withdraw the clause and redraft it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Clearly, the Under-Secretary is not sure whether he wants to withdraw the clause and redraft it. I do not intend to enter the debate about the definition of ``business customer'', other than to say that I thought that I was confused before the start of our discussion, but am now even more confused. All members of the Committee may want to do what I intend to do as soon as possible after our sitting, which is to read the definition to some of my hon. Friends and ask them if they have the foggiest notion what it means. The problem is for the Under-Secretary. We all know what the intention is, but I am not competent to judge whether he has achieved it in legalistic jargon.
<P>
I trust that I shall not bring on your famous irascibility, Mr. Gale, if I say a little in defence of the Official Report. I have increasingly wondered how today's proceedings will be reported, given the constant attempts by hon. Members to pronounce my constituency name in two different ways that appear the same when spelled. I suspect that it will make strange reading for future generations. Perhaps we could have a moratorium on the different pronunciations. As a northerner, I pronounce my constituency with a short ``a'', as does the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Streatham. Most of my constituents prefer the other pronunciation, which some hon. Members have chosen to use.
<P>
I told the Under-Secretary that I expected him to answer me by saying that the Bill already covered the option to have workplace levies in different parts of the charging authority's area, and he did so. I gave him a second way out, which was to refer to argument C, the list argument. I was disappointed that he did not deploy that on this occasion. However, more than disappointed, I am mortally wounded by his exocet that, when it comes to it, he will not accept new clause 28. I am sure that you would deem me totally out of order, Mr. Gale, if I pointed out how strange that is in the light of the work of the Commission for Integrated Transport—but I shall not mention that now.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's rejection of the spirit of the amendment—I knew that he would not accept the wording of it—will create a greater temptation for some businesses to consider establishing out-of-town shopping and leisure centres, to which I thought that he and his Government were opposed. A significant workplace levy for employees of such centres in town centres, which he is suggesting would not apply to out-of-town centres, would be an additional incentive for people to consider building outside towns—thereby adding to the traffic on our roads.
<P>
Secondly, the Under-Secretary rejects my argument—indeed, he seems not to have understood it—that by refusing concessions in that matter he appears to go against the wording of clause 155. The third and final argument that I put to him, and to which he may like to respond, is that he has now established a real difference of opinion between him and his hon. Friend the Minister. The Under-Secretary has just told us that the Secretary of State is likely to be opposed to the establishment of workplace charging schemes for areas that may have significant congestion, such as out-of-town shopping centres and other premises referred to in the amendment—but in talking about clause 154, the Minister said that it would not be possible to establish a workplace charging levy scheme that discriminated between different categories of business. That seems to create a difficulty; if a store—John Lewis, for example—operates in a city centre where there is congestion, that store is likely to be subject to a workplace levy scheme, whereas a store operating out of town will not. That seems discriminatory, and if it happens to be John Lewis in the city centre and a rival outside, that would surely discriminate in the way that the Under-Secretary suggests that the Secretary of State would not allow.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) repeated the point, in an excellent speech that he made last night on the Floor of the House in moving an amendment to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill, that he did not want it to be thought that he or our party were the grit in the machinery of that Bill, of which we are very supportive. We also want to oil the wheels of this Bill, but are concerned about a number of nitty-gritty details. That apparent contradiction is one of them.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall respond briefly to the various points raised by members of the Committee. I may, at last, have understood the point made by the hon. Member for Bath—with a short ``a'', as I shall now pronounce it—on what he claimed were apparent contradictions between what I and my hon. Friend the Minister said. It is true that my hon. Friend said earlier that an authority could determine specific areas within its own area for the application of workplace parking levies. That is completely different from distinguishing between individual stores. The determination is made on a judgment about traffic conditions in an area, and certainly not about individual companies or enterprises. It would be quite wrong to put that interpretation on the remarks made by my hon. Friend.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also suggested that the proposals could encourage companies to establish out-of-town retail facilities. He knows very well that the Government have set out clear and firm guidance—planning policy guidance note 6—which introduces a sequential test for such retail development applications. Developers must first look at opportunities in the town centre and then on the edge of town. They may look at out-of-town sites only if there is nothing in the first two areas. A clear demonstration of need is required when it comes to out-of-town developments. The Government have responded to proper environmental concerns about the development of out-of-town shopping facilities and we have established a number of thresholds to prevent the easy acquisition of such sites, which took place under the previous Administration.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire, in addition to the concept of cross-fertilisation between parking spaces, has now offered us the concept of the appearance of a shopper. There was a certain failed populism in his references to the Metro centre. He suggested that it would be perfectly possible for someone going to work to pop into the Metro centre, buy some buns and then go on to work. The hon. Gentleman has obviously never shopped there, as he would know that there would almost inevitably be a clear time limit on the length of time that the shopper may park at the shopping centre. In my experience, and I am an extensive shopper in my constituency, it is about two hours which is a reasonable period in which to make one's purchases and then to leave. The hon. Gentleman need not worry about that potential abuse.
<P>
Finally, an individual going to a solicitor would not be caught by the workplace levy provisions. Nothing in the definition of an individual customer would suggest that that person was engaged in business or working activities at that workplace.

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the Minister give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We have thrashed this one to death. With those few helpful responses, I hope that we can conclude this fascinating exchange.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Minister's last comment was wholly inadequate. The clause is quite clear that a ``business customer'' means a client, with the corollary that he will be caught up in the charge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> We have had an extensive debate. A minute ago, I thought that it had come to an end, but I now realise that it falls to me to bring it to an end. I am delighted that we have had shopping for buns and I hope that they were Bath buns. I am also delighted to hear that the Under-Secretary regards himself as an extensive shopper, but I have no idea whether that means that he buys too much, takes a long time to buy a little, has too much surplus cash or time, or whatever. No doubt over the many months still to come for our deliberations, he will refine that definition in the same way that he refined the definition of a business customer.
<P>
I have made several points, sought to have them answered and failed miserably in my task. No doubt you will give us ample opportunity, Mr. Gale, to continue our debate later. To ensure that your sanity is retained, Mr. Gale, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 639, in Clause 158, page 89, line 14, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`engaged in the carrying on of any business of the body'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 692.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have made it clear that the workplace parking levy provisions in this part of the Bill should apply to workplace parking only. If the hon. Member for North Shropshire looked more carefully at subsection (4), he would see that ``client'' is subsequently qualified by reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>who is attending . . . for the purposes of a business,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is different from someone visiting a solicitor.
<P>
Subsection (l)(d) could conceivably be interpreted as implying that the scope of the levy could include members of leisure or sports clubs whose affairs are managed by their members. That takes us back to Chippenham Town, but we could also introduce Oswestry United or some other local football club in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. Let me make it clear that any members of such an organisation would be subject to workplace parking only if they were carrying out its business. If they attended a social or football club for leisure activities, no charges would apply. That is consistent with our objective that the levy is to be applied only in respect of business activities. The amendments would clarify that, and I hope that they will be warmly welcomed by the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Subsection (1)(d)—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>where a body whose affairs are controlled by its members is a relevant person, by a member of the body—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is an interesting part of the Bill. The amendment improves the wording and makes it clearer, but I still wonder what is meant—a golf or recreational club, a building society, the Conservative party or what? The Conservative party is, of course, controlled by its members. With one member, one vote, we are democratic. On political premises, I presume that the agent or secretary—rather than visitors—would have to pay. Is that how it will be determined?
<P>
On page 26 of the explanatory notes, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The definition also includes members of organisations such as a recreational club or Chamber of Commerce.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is straightforward in chambers of commerce because if the chamber has a base in which people park, it is counted in a sense as part of the business. Will the Minister clarify what is meant by ``recreational club'', and which clubs will be caught by the provisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I would like to follow up what my hon. Friend the Member for Poole said, because serious consequences might follow from the provisions. Will the Minister clarify whether they will extend to the Aldershot Conservative club, which is located in a prime site in the middle of Aldershot? Several years ago, it concreted over its bowling green to make a car park. Presumably, in so far as the club secretary works at the club part-time, any car parking space that he uses would be subject to the levy.
<P>
Aldershot Town and Farnham Town football clubs are keen to maximise their incomes. One of those clubs is struggling, so the imposition of such charges will add to its woes. The Minister should tell us whether those who work for those football clubs in a voluntary capacity because of a sense of loyalty and conviction for their clubs, rather than for any financial return, will be subject to the full weight of the levy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The key matter is the definition of the phrase ``organisations controlled by their members''. That point has been made by the hon. Members for Poole and for Aldershot. Clearly, a building society—a mutual organisation controlled by its members—is a business. A building society may be controlled by its members, but it exists to carry out a business, and its staff will be liable whether they work in offices at Poole, Bournemouth, Aldershot or, in my case, Greenwich. The Greenwich building society is now, alas, owned by the Portman building society, so it no longer has its local identity, but it is still a small mutually owned society, which I strongly support.
<P>
Recreational clubs are a different case. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that those who attend leisure or recreational clubs simply for recreational purposes will not be liable. However, the staff of any such club, including its volunteer staff, would be liable if a charge applied when they were present. As I said during a previous debate, as did the hon. Member for Bath, the local authority will determine the times at which any such charging scheme applies. Therefore, people might be exempt from charges on Saturdays—or, more probably, Sundays—because congestion is not so likely then. So someone who does voluntary work at weekends on behalf of the sporting club that he or she supports might not be liable because there may be no charge at that time.
<P>
The principle is that those who attend recreational or social clubs, or those misguided enough to go to a Conservative club—on the whole, we think that they should see a psychiatrist—will not be liable to workplace parking charges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am sorry but I missed the earlier part of the debate, so I apologise if I have missed the point. The Women's Royal Voluntary Service owns several buildings in my constituency. Is the Minister confirming that those excellent people who work for the WRVS, providing wonderful help all week long to old people and others who live alone, will be charged that tax if local authority so decides?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The people themselves would not be liable unless the organisation passed on the charge. However, the organisation would be liable if a parking charge covered the area in which its premises were located.
<P>
We are implementing transport measures to encourage people to use public transport rather than using their cars. I worked for a voluntary organisation for many years, so it is absurd to suggest that a different logic should apply to people who work in a voluntary organisation or in a voluntary capacity. It is wrong to suggest that it is all right for them to use cars when it is not all right for people who are employed. The hon. Gentleman is pursuing a logic that may have relevance on the wilder shores of the Conservative party. However, in relation to transport policy, trying to discourage people from going to work by car should apply across the board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Minister is wide of the mark. The WRVS and meals on wheels need cars to do their voluntary work. Indeed, if they did not have cars, they could not they take meals from their headquarters to old folk.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman completely misses the point.
<P>
If volunteers are taking their car to an individual's premises in order to deliver a meal, they are not parking at their workplace. They would be liable only if they were parking at the workplace. Visiting the workplace to collect certain produce is a different matter from parking a car there. The hon. Gentleman's attempt to suggest that the scheme is grossly unfair and would penalise voluntary workers is therefore wide of the mark.
<P>
Our interesting debate also brought forth from the hon. Member for Aldershot a confession that the Conservative party has been concreting over the countryside. I look forward to hearing more about that on Thursday, when the House is debating the issue. I trust that the Committee agrees that the amendments are sensible improvements to the Bill's wording.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 758, in page 89, line 33, leave out from `profession' to end of line 34.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 764, page 89, line 33, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`employing more than 10 full-time employees'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We have tabled the amendments because we do not like what the Government are doing.
<P>
We would like to exempt small businesses from the provision. Throughout our proceedings, we have expressed concern about the costs that will fall on business. We have moved the amendments because we are anxious that churches and voluntary services should be exempt from the clause. We want to explore who is included and who is excluded.
<P>
As we have discussed, definitions are problematic. Several people require reassurance. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is clear that people working in a private hospice for cancer patients in an area with a charging scheme would have to pay, including those making regular visits as unpaid voluntary workers. Therefore, there are many matters that give rise to concern and, no doubt, many people will apply for exemptions, which will be dealt with by local authorities and possibly the Secretary of State.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The more that we explore what the tax means to ordinary people, the more anxious I become about certain groups and categories of people. There has been a degree of levity in some of the exchanges on this and other clauses. Nonetheless, some vulnerable and important people may be affected, possibly inadvertently, by a workplace parking tax. I am especially worried about two categories of people. In winding up the debate on the previous amendment, the Minister dismissed the notion that people who work for the WRVS and meals on wheels will pay the tax. I submit that in saying that either he is ignorant of or he has chosen to draw a veil over how such organisations work. For a large part of the day, the car will be parked at WRVS headquarters or meals on wheels headquarters, if that is not the local authority, and the owner will go out at lunchtime or in the evening to carry out that worthwhile work. The WRVS will bear a significant tax burden if the local authority chooses to impose workplace charging in that area. The local authority will not be able to exempt the WRVS or other worthwhile voluntary organisations such as citizens advice bureaux. The CAB is entirely voluntary. Will owners of cars parked at the CAB in Chippenham have to pay tax?
<P>
Churches also worry me. The vicar and voluntary Church workers will spend a great deal of time parked outside the Church, and the vicarage itself could be considered to be a workplace under the definition in the Bill. I am having a quick look through the clause to find a reason why it would not be, but it seems that a vicarage would be considered to be a place of work. The vicar would therefore be required to pay a tax to keep his car at what is also his home.
<P>
We may now be entering the realms of fantasy, but it seems that the definition might be stretched to cover self-employed people who work from home. We know what damage has recently been done to the information technology industry under IR35. The Minister shakes his head. I am happy to be corrected on the question of self-employed people who work from home. It would be interesting to know which clause will exempt them.
<P>
The amendments cover vulnerable and worrying groups of people who will be watching the course of the debate with great care—namely, those who give their time and other resources voluntarily for all sorts of worthwhile purposes in the community, who seem to fall into this category and will therefore face the charge, as will Churches. How, unless the Minister accepts the amendment, will Churches and voluntary workers be exempt? If I have misread the clause, and there is some reason why self-employed people who work from home will be exempt, perhaps the Minister will explain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I am just trying to study the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex. Will my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire explain why the amendment specifies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>three times in a seven day period?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am not sure that we are dealing with the same amendment. My impression is that we are dealing with the amendment that covers voluntary organisations. I do not know the answer to my hon. Friend's question. The next time that he wants to intervene on me he might give me advance notice.
<P>
The thrust of the amendments to exempt voluntary groups and Churches and to restrict the definition to businesses that employ 10 or more people—an eminently sensible suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendments are clearly prompted by hostility to the provisions. Of the two, the second is entirely understandable, and I believe that by the end of this short debate I shall have assured Opposition members that the clause will meet their principal objective, even if we do not agree with how they would go about it. However, the first amendment is simply confusing, because it would limit the definition of people involved in work activities who might be liable to workplace charges.

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>6.24 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Before we adjourned for the Division, I was saying that there was some merit behind the thinking for the second of the two Opposition amendments, but that the first was misconceived. It would limit the definition of businesses and exclude several employees from the scope of the levy. For example, police officers are designated as holding the office of constable, which is why the Bill refers to an office holder. There are other consequences of the proposed amendment to delete the references to ``vocation or undertaking'' under subsection (4)(a). The hon. Gentleman's first amendment would result in some bizarre anomalies and open up many loopholes in the scope of the levy. It would be at odds with our proposal that the levy should apply to all workplace parking unless a specific exemption were granted.
<P>
Amendment No. 764 would exempt businesses that employ up to 10 full-time workers. We recognise the attractions of such an exemption, which is why we invited views in our consultation paper ``Breaking the Logjam'' on exempting the first few vehicles from workplace parking charges. We also asked people at what level a threshold might be pitched. Following consultation, we concluded that there was a good case for exempting the first few vehicles parked at premises from workplace parking charges.
<P>
In particular, that would make a workplace parking levy scheme easier to administer and enforce, and it would be particularly beneficial to small businesses and community-based organisations, as many would be removed from the scope of the levy. That is the answer to the concerns raised by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, which was why I said that his worries were not justified. Bodies such as the WRVS, unless they employed a lot of people, would probably not have sufficient numbers attending to reach the threshold. In any case, that would be a matter for the local council to determine when proposing a scheme. It could decide to give a wider exemption than that which would be available under the national scheme.
<P>
Our preferred approach is to leave exemption to local discretion. We would want to work with local authorities that are actively considering workplace parking levy schemes as part of our charging development partnership before deciding whether a national threshold is appropriate and at what level that threshold might be pitched. The effect of a particular threshold will almost certainly vary from area to area, but the possibility of a national exemption along the lines of that proposed by the hon. Member for Poole is not something that we would rule out as a possibility.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we have some sympathy with the spirit of the amendment, even if we are not willing to accept it. We will not accept it because it could have the perverse effect of exempting a business that employs 10 people, all 10 of whom drive and park at work, but not a business that employs 20 people, only two of whom bring their cars to work. That would be counter to the spirit of what we are seeking to do and, given the consequences, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am glad that the Minister took our second amendment seriously. The Government have exempted NHS hospitals and part of the argument used is that there is a shift system and that there may not be an alternative to public transport. People who work in hospitals work at night. Police officers and prison officers also work shift systems and work at night. A lot of anomalies will need thinking about. Given the hour, I shall not pursue my argument and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 760, in page 90, line 37, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
The amendment is concerned with subsection (2) of the clause. The subsection gives the Secretary of State or the national authority substantial latitude, so we want a full explanation of why it is so important in the architecture of the Bill and in what circumstances the provision would be used. Does it mean, for example, that the Secretary of State could offload his power to adjourn?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that I can offer the hon. Gentleman some reassurance. We cannot accept his amendment, because, as I have already made clear, we want to ensure that all workplace parking levy schemes are submitted to and confirmed by the appropriate national authority. That is the effect of subsection (1). As the Committee knows, we shall work closely with the first charging and licensing authorities through our charging development partnership to give assistance, to learn practical lessons and to develop best practice and guidance for others.
<P>
At the outset every scheme in England will need the confirmation of the Secretary of State and those in Wales of the National Assembly. By deleting subsection (2), amendment No. 760 would remove the power of the appropriate national authority to set out in regulations circumstances where that confirmation is not needed.
<P>
We envisage that the Secretary of State may use this regulation-making power at some point in the future. We have no immediate plans to use it. When a sufficient body of best practice and guidance has been built up, it may be appropriate to set out broad criteria and the presumption that, if schemes satisfy those criteria, they will not need the Secretary of State's specific approval. That could be a sensible and anti-bureaucratic measure for the future, but, as I have already made clear, we have no plans in the immediate short term to make use of the power. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that it is a sensible provision that should remain part of the Bill.
<P>
As regards the Welsh position, it would be open to the National Assembly for Wales to decide whether it wished to act in a similar way in future.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The Minister has confirmed some of our worry. Throughout our discussions it has been said that a local transport authority can determine whether it wishes to have a scheme, but it must be approved by the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales. One has looked to the Secretary of State as somebody who, if a scheme came forward that he was not happy with, could stop it in its tracks. We have now heard that, provided that regulations or criteria are set out, it could almost be automatic. The inference from the Minister was that, once we had done a few, it would be an easier process. I still have a concern about the issue, but I do not wish to press the point, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Concerns have been expressed by a number of organisations, particularly in business, about sufficient consultation, and I hope that Ministers will take that on board. Reference was made in an earlier discussion to local authorities establishing their intentions in their transport plans, and there will doubtless be some consultation in that regard. In addition, there is the question of the particular scheme involved. Consultation will be important, and this afternoon's arguments on what should and should not be exempt ought properly to be aired in the local environment. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that there will be real and extensive consultation before any such scheme is introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I rise to support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Poole on consultation. Committee members will know, Mr. Gale, even if you do not, that the Engineering Employers' Federation numbers among those organisations that have raised strong objections to the workplace parking levy. It says that, for many companies, the levy will translate into a tax on jobs. Moreover, it is unclear who will bear the cost and how the levy will result in less congestion. If employers are the targets, employees should not be expected to alter their habits. Alternatively, if the tax is directed at employees, local authorities should levy it on employees directly, rather than requiring employers to act as unofficial tax collectors.
<P>
There is a further extremely important matter on which I hope that the licensing authorities will consult. The tax could push parking into surrounding streets or retail parks and have no impact on the number of cars on the roads. As Members of Parliament, we are all familiar with the propensity of motorists to avoid the imposition of on-street parking charges by simply moving to the nearest area where no such constraint applies. The result is complaints from residents in roads newly subjected to parking overspill from those who do not wish to pay charges imposed elsewhere. The Engineering Employers Federation says that forcing firms to close off and monitor car parking spaces will prove time consuming and costly. As it stands, the workplace parking levy takes no account of seasonal fluctuations in car parking requirements or the necessary use of cars by, say, female shift workers who travel alone.
<P>
In addition to the very real concerns expressed by the Engineering Employers Federation, I draw Committee members' attention to a point raised by the Association of International Courier and Express Services, which will, I hope, be taken into account in consultation. The association represents courier services such as DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS, which use large transporters and park them overnight in depots. As the association says, the purpose of the proposed levy is surely to reduce private motorists' use of the car, not penalise businesses, many of which have to situate delivery vehicles at strategic depots. Such businesses are already introducing many of the green initiatives that the Government are keen that they should introduce.
<P>
There is a problem for those who park their lorries. We know that drivers have sophisticated cabs in which they can sleep overnight. Will the places in which they park constitute parking spaces liable to tax? In responding to the question of consultation, I hope that the Minister can assure us that he will send the strongest possible signal to those responsible for implementing the schemes that they must take into account the concerns of the business community as expressed by the two organisations that I mentioned today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> One of the concerns raised by the Engineering Employers Federation, which the hon. Member for Aldershot has just raised, relates to my constituency. The two largest private sector employers are the Littlewoods catalogue company and the J D Williams catalogue company, which employ large amounts of seasonal labour, particularly over the busy Christmas period. Therefore, the concerns about seasonal fluctuations raised by the EEF are pertinent. I have raised this matter previously with Ministers.
<P>
I am reassured that the scheme in the Bill allows the local authority—in my case the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority—together with Oldham borough council, in consultation, as is required, with Littlewoods and J D Williams, to take into account that large seasonal fluctuation. While the concerns raised in the EEF's letter are real, I am satisfied from the information that I have that the scheme takes that point on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) for raising those points. He can certainly take the message back to his local employers—
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> It will be on the front of The Chronicle tonight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It is expected that there will be a choice, which I am fully confident in offering my hon. Friend in response to his important intervention on behalf of his local employers, Littlewoods and J D Williams. As ever, my hon. Friend displays remarkable commitment and assiduousness in serving his constituents' interests, and I congratulate him.
<P>
Let me also offer reassurance to the hon. Member for Aldershot. The concerns that he has expressed on behalf of two employers federations constitute the justification for the clause. Not for the first time, the hon. Gentleman tempts me into rehearsing a number of the arguments that we have already enjoyed in the Committee, not just on the possibility of the displacement of cars but on seasonal shift working, to which we have already referred, but we shall have an opportunity to come back to that on a later amendment. I assure the hon. Gentleman that all those matters have been properly debated in the Committee. The Government are well aware of them and expect local authorities to be responsive to those concerns.
<P>
The clause enables local authorities to consult and hold inquiries into licensing schemes and sets out the role of two national authorities in relation to consultation and the holding of public inquiries. The hon. Member for Poole raised a number of major concerns, and I hope that what I am about to say will provide him with the reassurance that he seeks.
<P>
The clause allows the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to require a local licensing authority to undertake further consultation before a workplace parking levy scheme order is made or confirmed. I assure the hon. Member for Poole that the Government expect these such consultations to be ``real and extensive''. Were it otherwise, we would not be taking the power set out in the clause.
<P>
The clause also provides that the appropriate national authority may require an inquiry to be held in relation to the introduction or variation of a local licensing scheme. We believe that authorities should have the assurance that they can revoke licensing schemes, if necessary, without having to negotiate regulations.
<P>
Clause 161 also contains provisions relating to the joint London and non-London charging schemes. It provides that the Greater London Authority may carry out similar functions to require consultations to be held before an order making or varying a joint London and non-London licensing scheme is confirmed. It further provides that the Secretary of State may not cause an inquiry to be held in relation to such a scheme without the consent of the Greater London Authority.
<P>
The clause provides important safeguards, ensuring that there is adequate consultation about licensing schemes.

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 787, in page 92, line 21, leave out subsections (1), (2) and (3) and insert—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) A business that employs seasonal workers shall only be required to purchase a licence for the proportion of the year in which the workers are employed.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> This is a friend-of-the-shift-workers amendment. Not all parking spaces are used all day and if they are not, they should not be fully taxed.
<P>
Amendment No. 788 refers to a matter that was raised by the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth.
<P>
The amendments are well drafted and the Minister should take them seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I assure the hon. Member for Poole that we take his amendments seriously. I hope to give him a thorough and convincing response to his inquiries. As we have tabled an amendment to clause 164, I was a little surprised that amendment No. 788 was tabled, but I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the hon. Gentleman's concerns now and I hope that I can reassure him on the reasonable points that he raised.
<P>
Turning first to amendment No. 787, I hope that I can convince the hon. Gentleman that it is unnecessary. A workplace parking licence will simply need to cover the total number of workplace vehicles parked at a premises at any one time. The licence will not need to cover the total number of vehicles parked at the premises over the course of, for example, one day.
<P>
If two sets of shift workers use the same parking places at different times, the workplace parking licence will need to cover only the workplace parking needs of one set of shift workers, assuming that both shifts are the same size. If one shift is larger than the other, the licence will cover only the larger group of workers because the smaller shift will already be covered by virtue of the licence covering the workplace parking needs of the larger shift. Therefore, amendment No. 787 is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> My hon. Friend outlines a fascinating situation. Will he tell us what will happen if there is a handover period, as there usually is, between the early shift and the late shift? Where will those on the later shift park during the handover period?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As ever, my hon. Friend goes to the heart of the difficulty. We have anticipated it and I can offer him some comfort. The Government realise that all shift workers employed by a business might be parked on site at one time. It would be unfair if the licence was required to cover all the workers for a very short period simply because they were all parked on the premises at the same time. The Bill includes a way round that problem. Clause 164 enables a licence to be granted subject to conditions. It provides a means of facilitating a change-over of shift workers. For example, a licence condition could be that the licence will not apply to a particular time of day for, perhaps, half an hour to facilitate a shift change-over. We believe that it should be left to local authorities to decide what conditions are appropriate to individual licences. We are confident that they will want to implement practical and equitable schemes. Consequently, we do not believe that there is any merit in trying to specify possible requirements for shift change-overs in the Bill. I hope that that satisfies my hon. Friend—[Hon. Members:—``Excellent.''] and I am most grateful for the Committee's expressions of acclaim.
<P>
Turning to amendment No. 788, our proposed amendment to clause 164 will simplify the arrangements for obtaining workplace parking licences. It will provide that a workplace parking licence can be issued for any period of up to one year, giving local authorities the flexibility to issue licences for periods of less than one year. Consequently, local authorities will be able to issue licences to cover the workplace parking needs of seasonal businesses that operate for only a few months of each year.
<P>
Our amendment will also provide the flexibility to allow a licensing authority to issue workplace parking licences for a given amount of parking at a premises for one year, while allowing businesses to obtain additional licences for part of the year to cover any extra workplace parking to reflect seasonal factors. For example, some companies employ a given number of staff over the year and employ additional staff during, say, the run-up to Christmas.
<P>
However, we believe that the needs of seasonal workers are best addressed by responsible local authorities in their design of individual licensing schemes, rather than by the Bill. We are confident that responsible local authorities that choose to implement the workplace parking levy scheme will want to ensure that their schemes are equitable and acceptable to local people and businesses, which implicitly requires the consideration of seasonal employment factors. I reiterate that local authorities will be required to consult on their proposed schemes. Therefore, the Bill does not need to be overly prescriptive, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I was hoping to squeeze in a quick intervention. This is a golden opportunity for the Under-Secretary to tell the Committee about the Government's thinking on exceptions. The clause states that the Secretary of State can decide that certain exemptions must form part of the scheme. As we have heard from unofficial sources that the Government are minded automatically to exclude, for example, car park spaces in hospitals, I should have thought that the Under-Secretary might want to take the opportunity to place that on the record and give us the opportunity to discuss it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before hon. Members go further down that road, I point out that the matter will be covered during the debate on amendment No. 794.

<P>
Today's debate has already ranged over exemptions to some extent, so I shall not detain the Committee for long. Essentially, the amendment lists people and organisations that we feel should benefit from exemptions. The hon. Member for Bath—or Aqua Sulis, as it is sometimes known to those who live nearby—
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Aquae Sulis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that correction. Of course, when the Romans ran things there were lots of straight roads and no congestion.
<P>
As I said, the amendment lists people and organisations that should be exempt. I believe that the Government have already accepted, in their consultation paper ``Breaking the Logjam'', that the disabled may fall into that category. The amendment also covers powered two-wheel vehicles, cars driven by voluntary workers, taxis and private hire vehicles, military vehicles or cars used by members of the military, any vehicle that is parked in a place of worship—God is on our side, I think—any vehicle parked at an out-of-town shopping centre, and any vehicle parked at a leisure centre or sports stadium. I do not want to labour the point, as we have discussed exemptions pretty extensively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I have a particular interest in proposed subsection (3B)(h), which deals with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>military vehicles or cars used by members of the military
<P>
</UL></FONT>As Aldershot is a garrison town, it has a tremendous number of military vehicles. Is it intended that charges should apply to parking spaces provided not just for tyred vehicles but for tracked vehicles such as the odd tank that may be seen in the constituency? Will parking charges apply to Challenger 2 tanks, to Warrior track vehicles and so on? If they will, the Minister may have to apologise to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence for incurring his Ministry a tremendous amount of additional expense. Such expense would hit the defence budget, and the Secretary of State would have to go the Chancellor to seek more funds to meet the new cost.
<P>
A change of arrangements will occur at Aldershot when the Parachute Regiment leaves in the course of the year. I will be replaced by a mechanised brigade that is likely to use military vehicles to move to its place of work at the training grounds to the west of Aldershot. It will be interesting to see whether soldiers who park vehicles overnight in the garrison, which is obviously military premises, will be subject to the workplace tax both there and at the training areas to which they will drive in the morning. Such questions highlight the difficulties into which the Government will get as a result of their proposals for the workplace parking levy or tax, as the Opposition would prefer it to be described.
<P>
I suspect that I shall require more than the assurances that the Minister can give now. I do not expect him to answer my questions off the top of his head, so perhaps he will write to me in due course to let me know how his Department thinks that the policy will impact on the military. The matter is important for my constituency and for others such as those of the hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) and of my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key), who have an interest in such matters. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has an interest in Kettering. All such constituencies could be adversely affected by the proposal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Poole spoke to the amendment succinctly and quickly. He almost used opening gambit D, so I am inclined to respond with argument C, the list argument. However, I shall try to do a little more justice to the points made, bearing in mind the interventions made by the hon. Member for Aldershot, who rightly expressed a constituency concern, and by the hon. Member for Bath-—or Aquae Sulis—who contributed to our debate on the group of amendments considered previously. He did so perhaps a little prematurely, but his interest in the subject was such that I shall try to respond to his points.
<P>
We have made it clear that there should be a limited number of national exemptions. We have set out their broad application to emergency vehicles and the disabled, who should be excluded both from road user and workplace parking charges. Workplace parking at NHS hospitals will also be exempted from the workplace parking levy. Otherwise, we are not minded to make a large number of national exemptions. We believe that local authorities have the scope to make appropriate local exemptions in response to local circumstances. I should tell the hon. Member for Aldershot that the matter of military vehicles applies in spades in Aldershot should the local authority be minded to introduce a workplace parking charge. I am not sure that many of his constituents would travel to work in a tank—or even an exhausted vehicle, as he so nicely described them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> A tyred vehicle.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I put a different interpretation on the hon. Gentleman's description. If a workplace parking charge were to apply, the Ministry of Defence would be liable for those people who work in the military who travel to work by vehicle and who leave the vehicle in the area. However, whether or not it would be appropriate for military vehicles from military sites to be included will be a matter for the local authority. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence would advance some pungent and cogent arguments if such a proposal were to have an adverse affect on the military. I am sure that the concerns raised by the hon. Gentleman are covered.
<P>
Apart from the principle that there should be scope for local exemption to take account of local circumstances, the list drawn up in amendment No. 794 goes very wide. For example, all ``road freight vehicles'' is a huge category. I am not sure of the logic of excluding all those classes of vehicle. Indeed, it might have been easier to list all those vehicles that were not considered essential. However, I shall try to reassure the hon. Member for Poole. The parking levy will apply to workplace parking only. I have said on several occasions that it will not apply to customer parking at shopping centres, or to people attending leisure centres or sports stadiums for recreational purposes. It will apply only to workplace parking. That is a fundamental principle of the scheme.
<P>
As drafted, the amendment would require essential vehicles to be exempted. Although I am persuaded that there is a case further to consider some form of exemption or concession for parking that is genuinely essential, it is not best achieved by making exemptions in the Bill. The amount required will vary from one area to another, and an element of judgment will be needed to decide what it should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am conscious of the time, Mr. Gale. I was tempted to ask the Minister whether he knew how many members of the military travelled daily to work in a Challenger tank. However, he was right to deploy argument C against the amendment. He said that it is not appropriate to add all categories of essential vehicles to the list but to leave it to local discretion, but that begs the question of why the Government chose to exclude NHS hospital trust car parks. I can see no rationale for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman may not have been here when we last debated the matter. I made it clear that the exemption reflected the fact that staff were required to attend NHS hospitals 24 hours a day. That made it almost inevitable that some staff would have to travel to work when public transport was not available. That does not apply to other public services such as education; for instance, teaching staff have normal working hours. That is the rationale for the specific exemption for NHS trusts. I accept that other categories of people have to work anti-social hours. The hon. Gentleman will recognise the problem—he is a reasonable man—and the list will inevitably cause a degree of selectivity. We therefore felt that it was best to draw the line under the three categories that I have outlined—emergency vehicles, disabled people and NHS hospitals. Wider discretion is left to local circumstances. The military issue, which was raised by the hon. Member for Aldershot, will not apply in many areas of the country. It would be absurd to have detailed provision for exemptions for military vehicles in relation to schemes covering areas where there is not a single establishment employing a member of the military. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It does not answer the point. The Minister has acknowledged that it is foolish to have a long list. He provided no justification—other than one he used earlier in relation to congestion charges, which was unconvincing at the time—as to why one category of people doing valuable work in the community, and possibly working unsocial hours, should be given special treatment. The Minister is not necessarily helping the hospitals that he seeks to help. Nottingham city hospital recently introduced its own charging scheme—£100 for staff—to develop green transport policies. The exemption proposed by the Minister means that it is unlikely that other hospitals will follow suit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have to beg to differ on this point. The hon. Gentleman has put a reasonable case, but I do not agree with him. There is an overriding case for NHS hospitals being included. I accept that other people might reach a different judgment. The main safeguard that I can offer is that, if Bath and North-East Somerset council were to introduce a workplace parking scheme, it could consider other appropriate amendments to exempt particular categories of vehicle that it regarded as essential in its area, and which would not be subject to the charge. That is subject to approval by the Secretary of State, which is a paramount requirement that will apply throughout the early years of the scheme. I say that to reassure the hon. Member for Poole who might have misinterpreted my comments in relation to the provision of flexibility at a later stage, which would relax the requirements for consent where schemes conform entirely with agreed criteria. In the early stages, all schemes will have to be approved by the Secretary of State, although scope will exist for local variations.
<P>
On appeals, to which proposed new subsection (3C) refers, the Government intend to establish a proper appeals mechanism. The relevant proposals are set out in the response to ``Breaking the Logjam''. The appeal process will have two stages, the first of which will involve an appeal by the authority itself. The second would go to the civil courts. That is a better mechanism than appealing directly to the Secretary of State, as the amendment proposes. I hope that the hon. Member for Poole will recognise that there is clear provision for an appeal. The appeal mechanism provides a powerful discipline to ensure that local authorities act fairly and responsibly in developing schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> This has been a short and useful debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot raised an important issue. A local authority might decide to encompass military vehicles simply as a way of getting money from the Government. Someone might park a vehicle on a military base and then be posted for six months, while the vehicle sits in the space. There might be a substantial number of such vehicles, whose drivers will not sit in them for three or six months because they are in Bosnia or somewhere else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> At the risk of being mischievous towards the Minister, who has been extremely forthcoming, did my hon. Friend hear the Minister's sotto voce remark in response to the suggestion that local authorities might regard it as a good idea to impose charges on the military, and therefore on the Government? The Minister said: ``We wouldn't let them.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> That is an interesting point. Another is the security issue. We hope that things will hold in Northern Ireland and that we make progress, but over the past 20 years we have lived in an environment in which we have had to be careful about what people do with various cars. Anything that discourages the military from providing car parking spaces in secure places would not be wise. However, having heard what the Minister said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`A licence may not be granted for a period of more than one year.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 693.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Amendment No. 653 is designed to improve the drafting of the clause with regard to the period for which a workplace parking licence will operate.
<P>
The Bill specifies that a licence must be granted for a period of not less than one year unless it is a special licence. A special licence would cover periods of less than one year and could cater for short-term requirements—for example, for seasonal workers or for businesses expecting to take on a substantial number of people at one time in the year. Both those eventualities could be expected to arise in the lifetime of a licensing scheme that was due to last for at least one year.
<P>
We believe that the clause can be simplified by amendment No. 653. It provides that a licensing authority cannot issue a workplace parking licence for more than one year. That provides local authorities with the flexibility to issue licences for one year or for shorter periods. In addition, it provides an important safeguard to ensure that a local authority cannot demand up-front payment for a workplace parking licence for premises for several years. The amendment provides that the limit on the duration of a workplace parking licence is one year.
<P>
Amendment No. 693 amends the Greater London Authority Act 1999 to provide that those arrangements apply in Greater London as in the rest of England and Wales.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will agree that these two simplifying amendments retain the policy objectives of the Bill, while making it easier to understand and to operate, and contain important safeguards for all those who may be liable to workplace parking charges.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I apologise for detaining the Committee, but I want to probe the Minister a little further on the clause, which provides for a right of entry into premises by officials of the licensing authority. It is incumbent on us as parliamentarians to provide a power of entry to officials only sparingly, and conscious of the power that we are conferring on them. Officials already have an enormous range of powers to enter our premises and business premises, and the public would expect us to provide such an additional power only in exceptional circumstances where it was justified.
<P>
Is it necessary for officials to have a power to enter premises without the owner's authority to establish whether they are providing workplace parking spaces without a licence, or without a licence covering all the workplace parking spaces being provided?
<P>
I accept that subsection (2) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person duly authorised in writing by the licensing authority . . . may at any reasonable time enter any premises for the purpose of issuing notice of a licensing scheme penalty charge.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, I put it to the Minister that that could be dealt with in another way, perhaps by registered letter. Whether or not the recipient was willing to accept the charge, the fact that a registered letter had been sent would be sufficient notice of delivery of the penalty. I question whether we are right, in the circumstances, to allow this additional right of entry into private premises to be authorised by statute.
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Clause 166 gives licensing authorities the power to enter and inspect premises to check whether a licence's terms are being complied with, or, if the premises has no licence, whether workplace parking is being provided. There are important safeguards, which I hope will reassure the hon. Member for Aldershot; he has recognised some of them.
<P>
Anyone seeking to exercise this power must be duly authorised by the licensing authority in writing. It will not be open to an individual simply to turn up and say: ``I wish to inspect your premises.'' That individual must be duly authorised by the licensing authority. As the hon. Gentleman said, the power may be used only at a reasonable time, and specific reasons are set out clause 166(1)(a) and (b), which govern the way in which the power can be used. In other words, the person inspecting the premises must look to see whether any workplace parking is being provided without a licence, or with a licence that does not cover all the workplace parking provided. That person could also look for a contravention of the conditions of a licence. The authorised person must produce evidence of his authority before entering.
<P>
Those are reasonable safeguards for the organisation of which the premises may be liable for inspection. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that, as we are creating a liability of this nature, it would clearly be wrong for organisations to be able to defy it with total impunity because the local authority had no means of ascertaining whether there had been a contravention.
<P>
In due course, with the development of GPS systems, I have no doubt that satellites will provide all the necessary information, and the number of Challenger tanks parked in any particular square yard of the hon. Gentleman's constituency will be well known. In the meantime, it may be necessary to carry out inspections to ensure the integrity of the scheme. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that proper safeguards will exist to prevent misuse of this power, and that this is a proportionate response to the enforcement requirements of the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that response. I can see that if someone wilfully wishes to circumvent the scheme, there must be a means of ascertaining whether they are behaving lawfully. However, I am sorry that the Minister did not take the opportunity to acknowledge that Parliament should grant sparingly the power to officials to enter private premises.
<P>
The Minister said that a person had to be duly authorised in writing. However, anyone with similar powers of entry is duly authorised. It is a question of bureaucracy. I would like to reflect on that matter, and perhaps revisit it on Report.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
