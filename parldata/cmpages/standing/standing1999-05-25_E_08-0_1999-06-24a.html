<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 29, leave out line 2.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 59, in page 29, leave out lines 3 to 5 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) that it would be unfair to the accused to refuse to allow the evidence to be adduced or the question to be asked'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 60, in page 29, line 17, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or--
<P>
(c) it is an issue of consent and the court considers it to be in the interests of justice to allow the evidence to be adduced or the questions to be asked.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We now come to an extremely important part of the Bill; indeed, it would not be unfair to suggest that it was the most important and far-reaching, certainly in terms of its effect on victims and defendants in rape cases.
<P>
On Tuesday, the Committee agreed--there was a fair amount of consenus--that it could no longer be right under any circumstances for a defendant in a rape trial to ask the victim questions directly in open court.
<P>
This afternoon, we are reconsidering and redefining what sort of questions the representative or lawyer of the accused should be permitted to put to the victim in rape cases. We need not detain the Committee long in considering whether there is a consensus in favour of changing the law in that regard. Many in the legal profession undoubtedly believe that a change is not justified. One has only to study the debates that took place in Committee in the other place--particularly that on 8 February--to determine that many leading practitioners are not convinced that a change is justified. They include, of course, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, and, to a fair extent, Baroness Mallalieu, who has long experience of prosecuting and defending in rape trials.
<P>
There is, however, a general sense among those of us who are not legal practitioners--this relates to the point that the Minister of State made when I lightheartedly asked whether not being a lawyer was a good or a bad thing in terms of dealing with the Bill--that aspects of rape victims' personal lives and sexual histories have been trawled through the courts on too many occasions. That has been done in a way that shocks us all and which we find wholly deplorable.
<P>
I want, therefore, to stress the seriousness and importance of the provisions. The first key question that we must answer as we approach clauses 40 to 43 is: does the law need changing? On balance, I am satisfied that it does. I hope that that will help the Minister when he reflects on our other questions and concerns.
<P>
Those who feel that the law does not need changing cite section 2(2) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976, which provides courts with the discretion to decide which questions about a victim's personal sexual history to permit and which are relevant. Nonetheless, I agree with the Minister--I am sure that he will say this shortly--that the discretion in that legislation, which is 23 years old, has failed to protect many rape victims. Given some of the horrendous experiences to which women have been subjected in the courts--which, on any sensible balance, must be regarded as questioning wholly irrelevant to the case--we must be determined to do more to protect such women from such ordeals, as we did in clauses 33 and 34.
<P>
I shall cite one example, to which I referred on the Floor of the House at the time. Although the case related to problems with the rules of disclosure, the reason for those problems related to the law in the regard that we are currently considering. The Minister of State may be aware of the case; it was one of those cited by the Metropolitan police during the mid-1990s to demonstrate the need for change to the rules of disclosure of facts to the defence by the prosecution. A girl of 18 was gang-raped in a car park in west London. The five accused effectively escaped justice because the poor girl had suffered an identical ordeal a year earlier, and it was clear that that would be relevant to the defence--more to the point, it was clear that the defence would seek to exploit that fact. The Crown Prosecution Service rightly concluded that it would be entirely unreasonable for the girl to suffer that ordeal, so the case was discontinued.
<P>
If a girl who had been grabbed off the street and subjected to a terrifying ordeal of rape at the hands of several men was so unfortunate as to have that experience happen to her again, most of us would ask what on earth was the relevance of the first experience in considering the guilt of the accused on the second occasion.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes </B>(Stretford and Urmston): I should like to support the hon. Gentleman's argument Is he aware of a case in January 1998 in which a 10-year-old girl who alleged rape by some slightly older boys was forced to testify--or, at least, to try to begin to testify--in court about sexual abuse by men that had taken place when she was aged six? That case was also discontinued at that point. Does the hon. Gentleman think that there is ever a case for a child of such an age to be forced to give any evidence about previous sexual experience?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I recall that case, and I find it difficult to think of any such circumstances. The hon. Lady will know that, irrespective of clauses 40 to 43, we have afforded considerable additional protection to such young victims in other clauses, especially the special measures in relation to the questioning of children. I am sure that the combination of all those provisions will assist in such cases.
<P>
We could double the girl's age. She might he 20 and at the age of 12 or 13 have suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a relative--a parent, a brother, an uncle--or someone living in the house. All kinds of experiences come to mind. I find it difficult to see in what sense questioning someone, of whatever age, about horrific abuse against them on a previous occasion can be in any way relevant to the defence in such cases.
<P>
<B>Ms Margaret Moran </B>(Luton, South): A victim of repeated domestic violence and abuse in my constituency had a similar experience. Having had a stranger rape her two years previously, the evidence from that rape was used in evidence as a reason to dismiss the case of domestic violence. The Luton police said at the time that they suspected that the defence used her previous sexual history as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a tactical course of action to keep the victim from giving evidence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that is a good example of why we should ensure that special measures apply to victims of domestic violence, so that they too are protected in such circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I feel almost like the Minister having to defend the Bill. We considered that issue on Tuesday in respect of special measures. I remember arguing that domestic violence and the threat of intimidation from a person who had abused the victim by acts of violence would be a major reason for the court to agree that special measures for the giving of the witness's evidence would be appropriate. That is slightly different from the matter that we are discussing now. It is clear from the interventions that I have already taken that there is consensus across the Committee that the present situation is unsatisfactory. I am, on balance, satisfied that the answer to the question ``Does the law need changing?'' is that it does.
<P>
Having settled that the law should be changed, we come to another important question. Once the law has been changed, how far should the courts have discretion, or how far should Parliament lay out a structure that seeks to fetter that discretion? Given the experiences that have been described, in which the current law has not afforded protection in every case, how far should we trust the court to use such discretion as it has at its disposal to allow questioning of a victim about previous sexual history?
<P>
Assuming that discretion is to be narrowed, one then moves on to the question of what the test should be. What is the prime objective of allowing discretion at all? That is crucial in determining whether the Bill is adequate in meeting the requirements.
<P>
At this juncture, I should say that amendment No. 58 is a probing amendment, whereas amendment No. 59 has more substance in that it suggests an alternative wording to that of the Bill. It is a question of whether the discretion that the Bill provides is too narrowly drawn, sufficiently widely drawn or, to put it another way, meets the requirements of what we are seeking to do by providing the courts with any discretion at all.
<P>
It is fair to say that amendments Nos. 58 and 59 largely reflect the concerns that were expressed in the debate in Committee in the other place on 8 February. I have already mentioned Baroness Mallalieu, whose comments in that debate deserve substantial consideration by anyone who wants to study the matter in more detail. She pointed out that the crucial issue was fairness. She asked whether denial of cross-examination of victims about their previous sexual history is always fair to the accused. Amendment No. 59 seeks to address that concern, which is why it uses the word ``fairness''.
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government have drafted a different test, which is contained in subsection (2)(b), which the amendment seeks to replace. Subsection (2)(b) provides that the court may not give leave for cross{**nrl**}examination unless refusal to do so could lead the jury to wrongly convict the accused. The court may not give such leave unless a subsequent inquiry into the case, presumably in the Court of Appeal, would result in the verdict being thought unsafe.
<P>
The philosophy behind subsection (2)(b) is capable of differing interpretations, which is why Baroness Mallalieu was right to ask Lord Williams to give examples of cases that the provision would cover. A further question has come to mind that was not discussed in the other place. When judges are deciding whether questions are to be denied, how will they know what answers would be given and the relevance that they could have? Will the Minister explain the purpose of subsection (2)(b)?
<P>
The Committee will discuss the detail of subsection (3) later. The Minister seeks to amend that detail, and I do not think that our opinions are wide apart in that respect. Subsection (5) is not a time-related exception that would allow cross-examination. When I first read the Bill, I wrote in the margin that subsection (5) might be referred to as the Owen Oysten subsection. The case was in my mind because a day or two earlier I had read a document circulated by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). The document supports Owen Oysten, whom, as the Committee may recall, was convicted of the rape of a 16-year old girl. I think that he may have been convicted on two counts. He contends that while the evidence adduced in his trial suggested that the young lady involved was of unblemished character and was beyond reproach, there is now evidence to rebut that view. If the prosecution brings evidence suggesting that the victim is of unblemished character and sexual purity but evidence to rebut that view also exists, I do not think that anyone would deny that such evidence should be considered and that it is relevant.
<P>
That may be the best answer to people who ask whether evidence of previous sexual history should ever be permitted to be adduced in court, and it explains why the Government were right to allow exceptions. The Minister will know that several people have suggested that we should go further than the proposed measures.
<P>
The Government clearly think that there are circumstances in which it is right for evidence of previous sexual history to be permitted to be adduced, and there is no great divide between us on that question. More pertinent to our discussion is the question of degree. In assessing degree, the final, perhaps overriding question to be determined is whether questioning would be relevant to the issues of consent or honest belief of consent. Clause 40(4) is hugely important in that regard because it makes it clear that questioning designed merely to impugn the character of the witness, to blacken her reputation, and which is of no relevance to the defence must be outlawed. We can all accept that point.
<P>
My real point is that, if the court considered questions relevant, it would be unfair to disallow them. It is difficult for us to anticipate every situation. Although some of us have experience of such criminal trials, none of us have the experience of other law practitioners. That suggests that we must be guided by what is fair. The interests of the victim and of the accused should be balanced.
<P>
In a large proportion of cases of women who are raped, the perpetrator escapes unpunished, and we cannot tolerate that. We know also that false and malicious allegations are made; some people have been wrongly convicted of rape. That suggests that, for all that we have the interests of the victim in mind, we must balance those with the interests of the defendant. Seeking that right balance is a matter of our determining whether the present wording is correct or whether it could be improved. I am happy to accept that the courts' discretion will be significantly limited. However, their discretion must be adequate--they must have flexibility. The courts would be better guided by the straight issue of fairness than by the wording of subsection (2)(b).

<P>

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> This is the first occasion on which I have been able to speak on the Bill apart from in an intervention. I wish to preface my brief remarks on the amendment by saying how radical and welcome both part I and part II of the Bill are. The personal commitment of the Minister of State and his colleagues to bring forward the proposals on criminal evidence relating to cases involving vulnerable witnesses is to be commended unreservedly. The remarks that I wish to make do not detract from my support and applause for the initiatives taken by the Government.
<P>
I want to oppose the amendment. The comments of the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) gave cause to suppose that there was a large degree of consensus on how individual rape cases might be handled. Given his careful argument and establishment of agreement that the current situation does not deal adequately with cases from the complainants' point of view, I find it contradictory and somewhat surprising that he supports an amendment that would extend the discretion to those courts that have failed to give a fair deal to many complainants in the past. So although I agreed with the spirit of his earlier comments, I cannot link that logically with the wording of the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale spoke about fairness, and I would like to as well. I should be grateful if, in his reply, my hon. Friend the Minister of State could tell us if he has considered whether it is fair and right that a child under 16 should ever have to give evidence of previous sexual history. The case that I cited earlier, which I shall not repeat, is just one of many examples in which children have been required to give evidence of previous sexual experience. Very often such experience has been in the context of abuse. I believe that it can never be right to require a child to give that sort of evidence.
<P>
I am assured that my hon. Friend the Minister of State has given the matter consideration in the drafting of the Bill. I should like his assurance that he will consider it again, but I hope that he will address that point in his comments.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> I am grateful to all those who have contributed to this debate. I am bound to say that I share absolutely the analysis by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes) of the contribution of the hon. Member for Ryedale. It is as though there were an almost psychological bifocality--as though the hand that wrote the amendment could not possibly have belonged to the same person as the mind that engaged with its substance. Well, that may actually be the case. [Laughter.] The result is a speech whose every sentiment--apart from something at the end that I am obliged to demur from--one could agree with, yet the amendments, taken together, would completely undermine the very thing that the hon. Gentleman purported to support. They would restore the situation that prevailed under the 1976 Act. We would be getting away from the purposes of the Bill, and going back in time, were the amendments to be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I see the hon. Gentleman shake his head. Let me take him through the amendments that he has tabled.
<P>
Amendment No. 58 would remove the requirement for evidence of the complainant's sexual behaviour to be relevant to an issue in the case or to be necessary for prosecution rebuttal. A consequence of that would be to make subsections (4) and (6)--providing that evidence must be of specific instances and not intended to discredit the complainant--redundant. So those provisions would go by the board.
<P>
Amendment No. 59 would replace the current test--that evidence should be admitted only if a refusal to admit it might result in the jury or the magistrate reaching an unsafe conclusion on a relevant issue in the case--with the test from the 1976 Act that evidence should be admitted if it would be unfair to the accused to refuse it. So the test under the 1976 Act would go and be replaced by a wider one. Amendment No. 60 would allow evidence of sexual behaviour to be admitted in relation to consent if the interests of justice required it. That is going wider still.
<P>
The combination of the three amendments would restore the situation that applied under the 1976 Act except that the restrictions would apply to more sexual offence trials--I will give the hon. Gentleman that--and that evidence of sexual behaviour with the defendant would be restricted in the same way as all other sexual behaviour. The courts would have a wide discretion to allow any evidence of sexual behaviour if refusing it would be unfair to the defendant and, in relation to consent, if the evidence were also in the interests of justice.
<P>
It is no wonder, given the thrust of his amendments, that the hon. Member for Ryedale finds himself in agreement with Baroness Mallalieu. Those were her concerns about our Bill, which is why she felt unable to support it in a number of key respects. While commending her analysis and producing amendments that support and give effect to it, the hon. Gentleman supports our Bill. That cannot be. I hope that I will persuade him not to press his amendments this afternoon, because that would defeat the purpose which I am glad that he joins us in seeking to achieve.
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Women--it normally is women although it might be a man--who are considering making an allegation of rape are all too often deterred from so doing, or from going through with the process of prosecution, because they are terrified of having their sexual history trawled through in a gratuitous way. I shall come to examples of the sort of cross-examination that has been allowed in the past under the 1976 Act formula, which the hon. Gentleman's amendments would restore and which will no longer be allowed under the Bill.
<P>
The intention of the Bill is to keep as much evidence of complainants' sexual behaviour out of trials as possible. That is vital if complainants are to pursue their complaints through to trial and not to feel that their privacy is being invaded to discredit and humiliate them. We must ensure that victims have faith in the criminal justice system and believe that their attacker will be on trial, not them and their history. Sexual history should be admitted only in very limited circumstances where it is really relevant to an issue at trial.
<P>
A clear framework is needed to govern when evidence of sexual behaviour can and cannot be considered relevant. No evidence that falls outside it should be admissible. The existing law--the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976--gives judges a broad discretion that any evidence that it would be unfair to the defendant to exclude should be admitted. No clear guidance was given on what that meant. That accounts for the disparity in practice in the various cases that has been identified in the law reports. That disparity makes it difficult for anyone seeking to counsel or advise rape victims to give them the confidence that they will not be subjected to this sort of intrusive and gratuitous cross-examination and the humiliation that all too often results.
<P>
We accept that there can never be complete certainty about that, but it is the absence of a reasonable degree of certainty that deters all too many people from coming forward and pursuing their complaints. Research evidence shows that sexual history evidence has been introduced in cases where it cannot be considered relevant, partly because the case law that the courts have built up in the absence of any statutory guidance permits it.
<P>
I shall take the Committee through some of that case law in detail because it is important that we all know what we are doing. The purpose of the Bill is to overturn that case law. No one should doubt that. We aim to overturn existing case law and impose a new statutory test on the relevance of previous sexual behaviour, especially to consent.
<P>
The Court of Appeal judgment in Viola in 1982, when it was ruled that the complainant's promiscuity was relevant to consent, will be overturned. It is our view that the fact that someone is or has been promiscuous does not take away that person's right to say no and to be able to draw on the full protection of the law to say no. We aim to overturn the judgment in Viola.
<P>
Similarly, the Court of Appeal judgment in SMS in 1992 will be overturned. That relates to the point, to which I shall return later, that my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston made. In SMS in 1992 it was held that the judge should have given permission for the 14-year-old complainant to be cross-examined about the fact that she was not a virgin, even though the prosecution had not claimed that she was a virgin. If the prosecution had claimed that she was a virgin, it would have been permissible for the defence to produce evidence to rebut that. But the defence was gratuitously seeking to cross-examine the girl on her previous sexual history to suggest that if she was 14 and not a virgin, the chances were that she consented. That cannot be right. The 14-year-old was supposed to have consented to sex with a one-eyed, one-handed man in a grubby flat. In order to explain why she would choose to do that, the defence was to be allowed to gain from her the knowledge that she was not a virgin. How could the fact that she was not a virgin be relevant? The judge made a proper decision not to allow the defence to go down that path. Such a decision will be supported by the law in future, when the House passes the Bill--I hope that that will happen. The Court of Appeal finding will be overturned.
<P>
The Court of Appeal judgment in Brown in 1988 will also be overturned. In that case, it was held that the judge had to decide in each case whether
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the complainant's attitude to sexual relations could be material upon which in these days a jury could reasonably rely to conclude that the complainant may indeed have consented to the sexual intercourse on the material occasion.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the woman--it is usually a woman--has, in the opinion of the judge, a certain attitude, it is deemed right to cross-examine her on her sexual history.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I ask the Minister to face my direction? I am finding it difficult to hear him. It would also help the recording if he faced the front.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg your pardon, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
We say that the complainant's attitude is not relevant to consent. The idea that attitude should be taken into account was one that the Heilbron committee in the 1970s found wholly implausible, because people do not decide to consent to sex in general with anyone on any occasion: they give consent on separate occasions to a certain person. It is right that the law should uphold that.
<P>
We must get away from the old-fashioned idea, which reared its head on Second Reading, that a class of woman exists who are of loose sexual morals and whose consent can therefore be assumed in all circumstances. This ``virgin and whore'' attitude towards women is unacceptable. It would not be tolerated in relation to men. Why should it be tolerated in relation to women?
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): I want to draw my hon. Friend's attention to a study of which he may be aware by Zsuzsanna Adler, called ``Rape--the Intention of Parliament and the Practice of the Courts'', because it is particularly relevant to this debate about the intention of the Bill and how it will be interpreted by the courts. Zsuzsanna Adler's study, which was done in the Old Bailey, showed that in every case where a girl of under 17 was alleged not to be a virgin and an application was made to allow evidence of her sexual past, the jury was allowed to take that evidence into account. Does the Minister believe that that study is relevant in any of the cases to which he is referring?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The Adler study is indeed worth looking at. It is one reason why we must go into this provision in such detail. Should our proceedings subsequently be examined by the courts to determine Parliament's intention, what was said in the Committee today will be the firmest indication of our intention.
<P>
As I was saying, what I have described as the virgin and whore attitude to women would never be tolerated in relation to men. The idea that a man would consent to sex with someone on a certain occasion because he had consented to sex in the past with others would, when applied to a man, be seen as clearly ridiculous. Evidence of so-called sexual character is therefore unnecessary and irrelevant. The idea that a jury should look differently at whether a 14-year-old girl consented to sex simply because she had had sex before should not continue to be perpetrated.
<P>
The jury's function is not to pass judgment on the complainant. Its function is to reach a verdict on the defendant's guilt by determining what happened on the occasion in question, not to second-guess it by wild speculation from the fact that the complainant was not a virgin or had had sex in a car before. That is why the Bill places a ban on evidence of sexual behaviour that does not relate to a specific, alleged instance of behaviour.
<P>
Further research in this area shows how radical our approach in the Bill is and what a change it will be. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston for pointing that out. In Sue Lees' ``Carnal Knowledge'' in 1996 she reported that, in trials that she had seen, defence barristers made sweeping statements about complainants, apparently on no grounds at all. They suggested that one complainant was ``looking for physical satisfaction''. In one case a judge intervened to ask of the defendant,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Did you regard this young woman as respectable? .Å.Å. You did not regard her as a tart?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of what possible relevance could that be? Under the Bill, that sort of intervention will no longer be justified, if it ever was.
<P>
Subsection (4) will ensure that juries are not invited to pass judgments on the complainant's general character in that way. Only specific allegations of behaviour that can be shown to be relevant to an issue at trial will be admissible, and barristers and juries alike will be forced to concentrate on the issues at trial.
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall go into a little more detail about why we oppose the amendments. Previous sexual behaviour is not relevant to consent unless it is virtually contemporary with the offence or is so unlikely and so similar to the defence's version of events surrounding the alleged rape that it could not reasonably be considered a coincidence.
<P>
That does not include general evidence of promiscuity or of having had sexual relations with someone of a different race or of a different age. Attempts have been made to support the notion of consent in a specific instance by trawling the past. For example, the defence might say to a complainant: ``In the past, you had sex with a man older than you and who was of the same age as the defendant. In the past, you had sex with an Asiatic; the accused happens to be an Asiatic.'' That sort of questioning should not be allowed in relation to the issue of consent.
<P>
I shall give some examples from Sue Lees' research. Consent was the issue at the trial of Mulherne, a serial rapist. The complainant was asked about an abortion that she had had three years before the event and when she had last had sex. Of what possible relevance could that be to the issues at trial?
<P>
A complainant who had been raped by a taxi driver was asked about her relationship with her boyfriend, including how often she had sex with him and how long she had been going out with him. That was irrelevant to the issues at trial, and will no longer be permitted under clause 40.
<P>
I shall say a few words about strikingly similar behaviour. Examples of sexual behaviour evidence that might be admissible in relation to consent may include something along the lines of the example given by Baroness Mallalieu in the House of Lords. In that example, the defendant said that the complainant invited him to re-enact the balcony scene in ``Romeo and Juliet'' after meeting him in the pub. He subsequently climbed into her bedroom and had consensual sex with her.
<P>
That version of events sounds highly implausible and the complainant's claim that the defendant had broken into her room and raped her sounds far more plausible. Therefore, if the defendant had evidence of the complainant's previous sexual behaviour that was strikingly similar to his version of events, he should be allowed to introduce that evidence. However, if the defendant does not have such evidence and is unable to lay the grounds for that line of questioning, he will not be allowed to adduce evidence of previous sexual behaviour.
<P>
Under the provision, the following case reported by Sue Lees would not be allowed. At a trial at the Old Bailey in August 1993, the white complainant was asked whether she ``often slept with ethnics'', and what colour the father of her baby was, for no reason other than that the rapist happened to be black. We must never again allow offensive and wholly irrelevant questions of that nature in our courts.
<P>
Undoubtedly, hon. Members will be concerned about what is meant by the provision that allows evidence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at or about the same time'' <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the alleged offence, and will want to know its purpose. It is designed to allow in evidence behaviour just before the alleged offence, so that it can be seen in context. For example, the defendant and the complainant might have been having consensual sexual contact an hour before the alleged rape, on what amounted to the same occasion. That could be relevant to the jury's determination, and it should be allowed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale urges on us what has been described as an in the interests of justice gateway. our proposals have been deliberately tightly drawn. A wide interests of justice gateway would undermine the general premise that someone's past sexual behaviour is irrelevant to whether she consented on a particular occasion. That is why we cannot go down the road that the hon. Gentleman wants by having a general interests of justice gateway that would enable evidence to be admitted that we believe should not be allowed.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the position in Scotland, where such a wide gateway exists. Research has shown that the gateway makes the rest of the legislation excluding sexual behaviour virtually redundant. That is why we cannot accede to the hon. Gentleman's amendments or the thrust of his oral arguments.
<P>
I shall now deal with the issue of honest belief in consent. It is a matter that has been raised by several hon. Members and it is right to give a specific and detailed answer.
<P>
Clause 40 highlights the distinction between the two defences of belief in consent and actual consent. This distinction is made for good reason. As I have said, consent is given, or not given, separately on different occasions.
<P>
But someone's belief may be affected by his previous experience and knowledge. Assumptions can be made on the basis of past experience, especially when there has been a previous relationship between the defendant and the complainant. There may be cases when a defendant realises, long after intercourse took place, that the complainant was not consenting, but that does not mean that his belief at the time was not genuine, based on some sort of  misunderstanding, or misreading of the situation. The complainant's past sexual behaviour may sometimes be relevant to that belief. If it is, it should be admissible, because the defendant's honest belief in consent, as the law is currently framed--I stress that--can acquit him.
<P>
These proceedings and the Bill relate to criminal evidence. They do not relate to the substantive offence of rape. The Bill deals with criminal evidence.
<P>
The Government are aware of anxieties about rape and its definition. We should take a good, long, hard look at the offence in the light of contemporary knowledge and understanding of human sexual relations. We have therefore established a sexual offences review to consider the law on sexual offences generally, including the law on rape and consent. It will consider how to ensure that the criminal law meets and reflects contemporary views about the nature of human sexual relationships and the basis on which they should be subject to the criminal law.
<P>
The Bill will ensure that relevant evidence is admissible in relation to offences as they stand, and that is what should concern the Committee. Although I understand hon. Members' concern about the substantive offence of rape and other sexual offences, this is not the time or the place to try to make changes--through a side wind--in the law on rape. The Bill deals specifically with what is properly admissible in evidence.
<P>
Under subsections (3) or (5), evidence must either be relevant to an issue in the case or needed for the rebuttal of prosecution evidence. There is no reason why it should be admitted more widely; that is another reason for rejecting the hon. Member for Ryedale's amendment. Because the clause creates restrictions on the offence, there is a general provision in subsection (5) for the rebuttal of prosecution evidence to impugn the complainant's credibility; it is an important safeguard of the defendant's fair trial. If the prosecution asserts something and evidence can be produced that undermines it, it is right that that should be possible. If, for example, a prosecution's case was that a 14-year-old was a virgin and the defence could show that she was not, that would be fair enough--otherwise, the process would be wrong. It is important that evidence of a complainant's previous sexual behaviour is only ever relevant to her credibility if it undermines something that she explicitly claims at the trial. That is what the clause provides. Apart from that, sexual behaviour is irrelevant to credibility. The hon. Member for Ryedale will want to take that important point on board.
<P>
A judge, quoted in Ms Lees' research, directed the jury that a complainant was not a promiscuous person but a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``sober, sensitive and religious young lady''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such a comment, suggesting that if she were not sober, sensitive or religious, she would just have to take her chances as to how much belief she could inspire demonstrates the problem that we need to tackle.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I support everything that he has said. Given the evidence, which he has brought out, of some of the appalling ways in which people have been treated in court, is he satisfied that the matter has been tightened up enough and that, commensurate with the interests of justice, the guidelines have been drawn tightly enough to preclude evidence about victims' previous sexual history? On what research evidence have the proposals been based? Can he reassure me that they will lead to a reduction in the number of such appalling incidents, which occur in full display of a court?
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am so satisfied, and I hope that the Committee will be. The guidelines are based on the research evidence that I mentioned earlier. I assure my hon. Friend that we will take steps to ensure that the Judicial Studies Board brings home to the judiciary the significance of those changes.
<P>
I have given the Committee an undertaking to keep the law under close and rigorous scrutiny. I do not for a moment seek to avoid the necessity for vigilance in that area; I acknowledge that, for example, the 1976 Act has been more honoured in the breach than in the observance and we cannot be complacent. I am unable to give my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) categorical assurances that there will never again be cases that do not give cause for concern. However, I reassure him that we take nothing for granted. We recognise that, in the task of changing a culture, one has to do more than simply pass legislation and we are determined to do more. The observation that my hon. Friend and other hon. Friends--indeed, to be fair, other hon. Members--have made in our debate will help us to do so. Whatever the content of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ryedale, he made it clear that he did not regard the existing conditions as satisfactory. Nobody reading the report of our proceedings should believe that there is a party political divide in the Committee around the central issue; there is not. The Committee speaks with one voice on it. I believe that it will continue to do so and I will do all that I can to ensure that we do.
<P>
On subsection (2)(b), which deals with unsafe conclusions, the test that leave should be given for evidence to be admitted only if 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a refusal of leave might have the result of rendering unsafe a conclusion of the jury or (as the case may be) the court on any relevant issue in the case''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is carefully drawn  so that any matter that is not of real evidential value--if, in other words, its introduction would not change the jury's mind about any issue in the case--will be inadmissible.
<P>
We think that that is a better test than that of simple ``unfairness to the defendant'', which might allow evidence that might help the defendant's case, even if it were not conclusive; or which might help his case because it would undermine the complainant's credibility. Hon. Members have raised that issue with me, which is why I have considered it in detail. We have chosen the test because we believe that it is tighter than the simple test of ``unfairness to the defendant'', so we shall resist any attempt to reintroduce that test.
<P>
All such evidence represents an intrusion into the complainant's privacy and should be admissible only if it has real evidential value. As I have said, it is not relevant, despite some antediluvian beliefs about good character that still linger, to the credibility of the witness.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Lancaster and Wyre, for Stretford and Urmston and for South Swindon (Ms Drown) have asked about the evidence base on which we have chosen to proceed. I commend specifically the Adler study and the research carried out by Sue Lees, both of which bear reading, are to be commended and have helped to inform our views on such matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) has also drawn my attention to that research.
<P>
I commend that research to the Committee as a way of showing that in formulating the clause we have taken into account the proper balance that must be achieved between the interests of the defendant and those of the complainant. We have achieved that balance bearing in mind that all the evidence suggests that the courts have tended to get it wrong in the past and that the interests of the complainant--the interests of the victim--have suffered time and again. I hope that I have shown that that will no longer be the case. With that uppermost in my mind, I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I shall try to be brief in my summing-up. The conclusions that we can draw from the debate are that the Minister concludes that the courts will have discretion under his proposals and, therefore, those who would like there to be no such discretion will be disappointed. As I have said, we disagree about the extent to which that discretion should be available.
<P>
The Minister says that the wording that we suggest in the amendments would provide a wide gateway, but that was not the view of the Lord Chief Justice in the other place. [Interruption.] I hardly think that one should scoff at praying in aid the Lord Chief Justice. One could take the view that he is wrong, but the wording of this amendment is only marginally different from the wording of amendment No. 125, which was discussed in another place. It referred to the interests of justice, which must be paramount, and to ensuring a fair trial of the accused. That principle lies behind our amendment, too. When referring to the terms of amendment No. 125, the Lord Chief Justice said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I can see no good reason why any court should be deprived of a discretion as limited and closely circumscribed as that.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 8 February 1999; Vol. 597, c.56.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is not much between us on this subject although I understand the Minister of State's view that his wording provides a narrower discretion. He gave his interpretation of subsection (2)(b), but I contend that it is open to alternative interpretations. None the less, our exchange will benefit those who, in due course, have to interpret the wording.
<P>
I am sure that Hansard will prove me right when I say that the Minister of State described subsection (2)(b) as being carefully drawn. He said that, if the questioning were not of real evidential value, it would not be permitted. I understand what he means by that. However, he added that, if it helped the defendant even though it was not conclusive, that would be prohibited. That worries me, because who will judge whether something that helps the defendant is conclusive or inconclusive? That is a matter for the jury to decide.
<P>
I do not intend to press the amendment. I anticipate that we shall have a further opportunity to consider the matter on Report and that other Members will want to contribute to that debate.
<P>
However, the Minister of State's description of the intention behind subsection (2)(b) reinforces the arguments of those of us who want there to be marginally wider discretion. We want to balance protection of the victim with providing the defendant with an honest and fair opportunity to defend himself from conviction for an extremely serious offence.
<P>
What is between us is a matter of degree. I take the Minister of State's point in the spirit in which it was intended. My views are not necessarily in keeping with those of colleagues on both sides of the House: some of them may take a different view.
<P>
I do not accept that the amendment would return the law to the way that it was in 1976. That is not our intention. However, it has been of benefit to have had this lengthy discussion about our objectives for such a crucial matter. I shall be happy not to press the amendment, but I do so in the full knowledge that the Minister must expect that there will be further attempts to challenge the wording of the clause on Report. There will be views, honestly held and honestly put, which will be significantly different from those expressed in Committee.
<P>
I hope that, in spite of our different interpretation of the degree of discretion that the courts should be given, I have shown that there is virtually complete consensus between the Government and the official Opposition on there being a case for changing the law. We agree that some change is needed, but we disagree slightly about the way in which the discretion, which the Minister accepts the courts have, should be granted through the clause. I shall not press the matter any further today.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for the way that he has summed up his amendment. Let me just respond to two matters. First, I hope that he will concede for the completeness of the record, which cannot visually represent our proceedings, that I did not scoff at the mention of the name of the Lord Chief Justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Quite.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I simply say that so that it is clear for the record. Call me old fashioned, but one never knows, does one? However, with the utmost respect, I beg to differ from the Lord Chief Justice. I do so because under his preferred formula, the court would be free to continue to allow evidence which he said he thought should be admitted. The example that he gave was that the complainant had had consensual sex separately with three different men on three different occasions on the week before the alleged offence. The view of the Government, and I suspect of most, if not all, Committee members, is that that is neither here nor there. A woman who has had such sexual relations is still entitled to say no and must still receive the protection of the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I understand the Minister's point--I would not have prayed in aid such an example--but if he studies carefully columns 55 and 56 of Lords Hansard, he will find that the Lord Chief Justice in no way attempted to substantiate his remarks by the examples that he gave. I referred to an entirely discrete paragraph of his comments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I hope that I have not suggested--if I have it is in error--that the test in subsection (2)(b) requires evidence to be conclusive in favour of the accused before it can be admitted. That was not what I said or intended to say. The point that I need to make is that we prefer our test to the simple unfairness test suggested by the hon. Gentleman because, although the unfairness test might allow evidence that would help the accused's case, it would do so only tenuously.
<P>
I have argued on behalf of defendants in precisely that way. I have said that the evidence may not be conclusive, but it certainly helps and, therefore, to exclude it would be unfair. In future, the likes of me will not be able, under our test, to do that, because the evidence will have to be of such value that its exclusion would render the jury's verdict unsafe. I hope that that clarifies the matter for the hon. Gentleman and for my hon. Friends. Our test is designed to be much tougher.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 29, leave out lines 13 to 16 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) it is an issue of consent and the sexual behaviour of the complainant to which the evidence or question relates is alleged to have been, in any respect, so similar--
<P>
(i) to any sexual behaviour of the complainant which (according to evidence adduced or to be adduced by or on behalf of the accused) took place as part of the event which is the subject matter of the charge against the accused, or
<P>
(ii) to any other sexual behaviour of the complainant which (according to such evidence) took place at or about the same time as that event, that the similarity'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 26.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I shall be briefer in speaking to these amendments, which have two purposes: to correct a technical flaw in respect of strikingly similar behaviour and to ensure that the defence can rebut prosecution evidence about the complainant's sexual behaviour if the judge allows it to do so.
<P>
I do not intend to rehearse the arguments on rebuttal. I am grateful to Vera Baird, who, if she is not one now, will no doubt in due course be recognised as one of Her Majesty's counsel, for bringing this matter to our attention. She has been of great assistance to the Committee in this instance by pointing out a technical flaw in an amendment that we tabled in the other place which had passed by the Government's legal advisers.
<P>
The Lords amendment was intended to allow the defence to introduce evidence of the complainant's previous sexual behaviour if it was strikingly similar to behaviour during the events constituting the alleged offence, or at or about the same time as the alleged offence. Clause 40(3)(b)(ii) and clause 41 allow sexual behaviour in evidence only if it is similar to behaviour outside the events constituting the alleged offence. The amendments seek to correct that technical flaw, so that the original aim is achieved. I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will therefore give them a fair wind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Indeed I welcome the amendments. I do not know at what time the lady to whom the Minister of State referred suggested to him that the wording was technically deficient, but column 404 of the Second Reading debate on 15 April records that there was a deficiency. As I pointed out on Second Reading, the explanation in the explanatory notes was not the same as the wording in the clause. It left open to some ambiguity at what time the behaviour referred to in subsection (3) had to have taken place in order to be relevant.
<P>
I am happy to take at face value the Minister of State's explanation and the new wording. I expect that others will wish to test it further on Report. However, should a young lady agree to go to a flat with four or five healthy young males and allow two or three of them to have sexual intercourse with her, only for the others to take their turn, she can claim that she was raped by them but not the others. As that all happened within the confines of what may be described as the same event, it would be evidence of relevant behaviour and could be adduced under subsection (3)(b).
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> No, let me make my point, as it may demonstrate that I am onside with the hon. Lady's concerns.
<P>
However, if, on the previous Saturday night, that young lady--
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is clear that the hon. Gentleman will not give way at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I want the hon. Lady to be clear about my example. Will the Minister confirm that the provision is intended to cover offending behaviour that takes place at the same time as the consensual event? If the young lady had gone back to a flat with one, two or three young men the previous week, and sexual intercourse had taken place, the other two men could not produce that as evidence to demonstrate that they had an honest belief in consent. The wording of the amendment makes that clear.
<P>
The existing wording of subsection (3)(b)(ii) left the matter open to doubt and--as the Minister knows--that is why a detailed debate took place in the other place about whether the similar behaviour took place 24 hours before or after the event. Time measured in hours does not matter; clearly, it would be reasonable to allow the evidence, if the behaviour is part of the same event. However, the amended subsection will disallow evidence in such cases, should the behaviour have occurred days before, whatever the similarity.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman is aware that, whenever he talks about women in relation to rape, he refers to ``young ladies'', with the emphasis on ``young''? I am sure that he agrees that women of all ages may confront rape. I urge caution on him. I hope that, by constantly referring to young ladies, he is not implying that young women somehow put themselves at risk in sexual predicaments.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I take the hon. Lady's point. I accept that many elderly ladies, some of them pensioners, are subject to horrific attacks by the young. However, with all due respect, such women are not likely to be in a night club in Leeds or Birmingham at 1 o'clock on a Sunday morning and agree to go to a flat with several young men.
<P>
My example was intended to demonstrate that there may be circumstances in which a woman of any age--I take the hon. Lady's point, but such a woman is likely to be young--agrees to sexual intercourse with a man or men. We must consider whether the fact that she has done so is relevant to allowing a defendant to say that, as a result, he had an honest belief that she would consent to sexual intercourse with him on a separate occasion. Subsection (3) is intended to rule out the relevance of such behaviour and its being permitted as evidence. Furthermore, two girls--or two women--going to a flat with a group of men, intending to have sexual intercourse with some, but not others, could result in a trial for rape.
<P>
Earlier, it was said that women who may say yes one day have the right to say no the next, and I support that right. However, the Minister intends that because what happened was during the same event, such behaviour would be relevant. I hope that I have that right; if I have, I am happy that the wording clarifies what I thought on Second Reading was a drafting error. On balance, I support the amendments.
<P>
I suspect that Members on both sides of the House will want to debate the matter on Report in order to challenge some of the propositions. However, I hope that what I have said in Committee has been helpful to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I want to raise two matters relating to the amendments and more generally to subsection (3)--first, the issue of belief in consent, to which the hon. Member for Ryedale referred. I am grateful for the Minister's lengthy and helpful exposition in our debate on the previous amendment. Although in the situation described by the hon. Member for Ryedale the sexual history evidence would be circumscribed if the issue was one of consent, there is considerable anxiety that such evidence would not necessarily be restricted by the amendment if the issue was one of belief in consent. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the matter.
<P>
I fully understand what the Minister said about the legal definition of belief as a defence and the fact that this is neither the right time nor the right vehicle to change a more fundamental definition of belief in a Bill that is concerned with criminal evidence. However, I hope that the Minister will agree that, in practice, consent and belief in consent are frequently used in cases either in tandem or as a sequential means of defence; belief in consent is advanced by defendants almost as an insurance policy in case consent cannot be proved.
<P>
The Government amendment will tighten and circumscribe evidence of previous sexual history that can be introduced when the issue is one of consent, thus there is more chance of the defendant falling back on the loophole of belief in consent, which will allow a wider range of sexual history evidence to be put forward. That is a loophole, which defendants and their representatives will try to use to an even greater extent than they do now. Most sensible people would believe that the Minister's compelling and cogent arguments about why sexual history evidence should be heavily circumscribed by the amendments when the issue is one of consent should also apply in practice to belief in consent.
<P>
Although I understand my hon. Friend the Member Minister's point that, technically in law, when the defence is one of belief in consent, many attitudes and experiences that have contributed to that belief can be introduced. In practice, a defendant must formulate the belief in relation to events at the time and to his knowledge of the woman and her sexual history. If sexual history outside the confines of the Government's amendments is not relevant to consent, there is a valid argument that it should also not be relevant to belief in consent.
<P>
I understand the technical reasons why the Minister says that belief in consent cannot be dealt with in the Bill, but I want to put on record the strong views held by many hon. Members and people outside the House that that leaves a loophole whereby women could still be subjected to questioning about a range of sexual experiences that should not be relevant in a rape trial.
<P>
The second issue that I want to raise relates to striking similarity. I appreciate the Government's attempts to define ``similarity''. Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm that, to meet this test, previous sexual behaviour must be both strikingly similar and unusual, like the ``similar fact'' criteria in criminal law for defendants?
<P>
The Minister gave some sound reasons why, generally, sexual history evidence is not relevant. Taking that a step further, the only sexual history evidence that is relevant in a case of rape should be sexual experience that has included an allegation of rape which was found to be false or malicious or was withdrawn. To allow any other sexual history evidence feeds the Victorian legacy that, if a woman has had sex before, she is fair game for sex with anybody and that, unlike men, women do not discriminate between incidents in which they are willing consenters and those where they are forced to have intercourse against their will. Therefore, the similarity that we should be considering is whether a person has accused somebody falsely or maliciously and not simply whether she has had sexual experience.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Julia Drown </B>(South Swindon): I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston has said, although I want to clarify one point about false accusations. My understanding is that false accusations in previous cases are a separate issue from sexual history, so would not need to be covered by the clauses. Existing law could cover the matter. We might discuss how much such matters should be relevant, but they are not relevant to the clause.
<P>
I particularly support my hon. Friend's comparison between consent, and belief in consent. The law seems to give more protection in court when the defendant is running a line of belief in consent. To me, belief in consent is a much weaker defence than consent. We are in grave danger of giving less protection to those who are up against a weaker defence.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister rightly said that many rape victims do not go to court because they are understandably frightened that their sexual history will be trawled through gratuitously. The Bill should be as strong on belief in consent as on consent itself. That is especially important because so many cases run the two defences in parallel. Provision for belief in consent and for consent should be made in the same clauses. The same protection should apply to both. That is especially relevant, given that the sexual offences review team is considering the matter. It could cause confusion if the review team said that belief in consent and consent should always be parallel, but the Bill separates them.
<P>
If an event is covered by proposed new subsection (3)(c)(i), which deals with any sexual behaviour of the complainant that was part of the event, why is it necessary to introduce proposed sub-paragraph (ii), which widens the scope of the provision and refers to behaviour that takes place
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at or about the same time as that event``?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister gave one example, to which I shall return later, but we need further clarification of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``about the same time as''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How can we prevent the court from widening the provision's scope, so that what starts as an hour becomes a day, then a month and leads to the complainant's whole history being considered?
<P>
I was pleased to hear the Minister strongly putting the case for the need to protect the many victims of rape and to update the law. He rightly said that consent on one occasion does not constitute consent on any other occasion, and is not relevant to a case. Again, that leads me to question the need for proposed new paragraph (c)(ii).
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale suggested that the amendment had been tabled to satisfy Baroness Mallalieu, who gave the famous example of the balcony scene. Most of us agree that that example is far fetched, but if it had happened once, a year ago, that would not be relevant to a current case. However, would it be relevant if it happened a month, a day or two hours ago? The Minister should seriously consider whether any behaviour outside the event is relevant.
<P>
I have had similar discussions with people outside the Committee about another scenario, which is perhaps not as far fetched as the balcony scene, and involves those who enjoy vigorous sex. If someone enjoyed vigorous sex that resulted in bruising once, a year ago, would that be relevant to a current case? If it is not relevant because it happened a year ago, it should not be relevant if it took place a week or a day ago. A jury must consider what happened.
<P>
I recognise that rebuttal is an issue. If someone has bruises, it might be possible to provide another explanation for them. However, no one has questioned the clause on the ground of rebuttal, and I do not see why we need anything more than the rebuttal provision to deal with the scenario that I have just outlined.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When my hon. Friend the Minister replies to this amendment or to the clause stand part debate, will he say a bit more about the background to the wording? Amendment No. 25 contains the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``at or about the same time''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and he gave an example of when they might be relevant. He referred to a case in which consensual sex between a husband and wife or between people who had been out together took place an hour before the alleged rape. In such a case, we all accept that it is necessary to paint the history.
<P>
However, we could limit the clause further so that the only sexual history that can be considered is that between the complainant and the accused. Women would very much welcome it if we could narrow the provision further. In Michigan, the law limits the evidence that is allowed to be introduced so that it covers only what happened in the past between the complainant and the accused. Several organisations support such a law and they have written to members of the Committee. Therefore, I ask the Government to consider strengthening the clause by limiting sexual history evidence to that involving the accused and the complainant.
<P>
The legislation in Michigan has been very successful. It has been challenged under the constitution on the ground that the restrictions do not give proper protection to the accused. However, it has survived all the challenges, and that point is worth noting. I know that the Minister has considered that example, but it is worth reconsidering such a law to see whether it could help us further to protect witnesses in rape trials. The Bill will do that and has taken great steps forward. However, as this might be the only chance that we have to legislate on the subject in the next five, 10 or 20 years, I hope that we can get the Bill as perfect as we can.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> Nearly 25 years ago, Parliament's intention was to protect rape victims from the unnecessary trauma caused in court by the questioning of their sexual histories. That intention was reflected in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976, but everyone will agree that we have to consider the subject again nearly 25 years later because of that Act's limitations. Not only the courts but the Court of Appeal have allowed a coach and horses to be driven through it.
<P>
I very much welcome the Bill. It is beginning to address seriously what has happened in the past 25 years and the concerns that many organisations and individuals have expressed. However, in 1999, we should be able to address the assumptions made about male and female sexuality. Even though we might not realise what we are saying, judgments are often conveyed in the tone of our remarks. That is why I intervened on the hon. Member for Ryedale.
<P>
Young women today are very different from the young women of 25 years ago and we may all have our own views on that. I have sons and a daughter. My daughter might go to a club in the future and, whatever the situation, she might have relationships with men. If, on the occasion that she said no, her other relationships could be brought into play and used as evidence against her, I, as a mother, would be distraught.
<P>
In addressing the issue, we must be mindful of the fact that rape is not a sexual act in itself: it is an act of power and an act of abuse. Where people consent to sexual relations, it is very different from a sexual act to which they do not consent, which is about power. As my hon. Friend the Minister pointed out, we will have a further opportunity to debate this under the sexual offences review.
<P>
For me, the question is whether the woman, or the man for that matter, consented to the accused on the occasion in question. Getting into the area of previous sexual behaviour with other people is open to abuse. I am glad that the Bill is addressing that although I share the concerns of some of my hon. Friends about how it will be implemented.
<P>
I was pleased that in earlier debates my hon. Friend the Minister gave an assurance that the Bill would be monitored and evaluated as it came into force. It is a difficult area. Certainly in questions of belief in consent it is often deemed relevant that previous sexual relations had come into discussion. It almost implies that it is reasonable for men to infer consent from the past. In essence, they can presume rather than negotiate and ensure that consent is given.
<P>
Call me old fashioned, but I believe that men should make sure that they ask. In some cases there may be negotiations, but they should ensure that consent is given. It is not just or justifiable for them simply to presume it from other relationships that a woman or man might have had.
<P>
Rape victims complain about the injustice of having to answer humiliating questions that have no direct relevance to the facts of the case when the defendant does not have to answer any questions about previous charges or convictions. There is no balance in that sense. The issue of whether the defence of consent or belief in consent is raised must depend on whether the complainant consented to sex with the defendant. I am very concerned about how previous sexual behaviour has been brought up in the past. We must monitor the Bill vigilantly to ensure that that does not happen to that extent in future.
<P>
Many hon. Members have quoted Baroness Mallalieu. I should like to quote Lord Lester who pointed out that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consent by its very nature is to a person and not a circumstance.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 8 February 1999; Vol. 597, c.47.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is vital not to miss that point. Some years ago, when I was in my twenties, a man exposed himself to me on a train. In the nine months before the case came to court police officers told me that the man was suggesting that he believed that I had given consent by my behaviour in sitting in a tube carriage. When it finally came to court, he pleaded guilty. But even in those circumstances, where there was no physical contact, I went through quite a lot of stress, thinking, ``My goodness, what did I do sitting on the tube to indicate that I was giving him permission to expose himself to me?''
<P>
That is an extreme example, but it is something that women go through and find difficult; they challenge, unjustifiably, what they may or may not have done. I hope that I have been able to show how worrying that is. I hope that, when the Bill is enacted, we can see positive evidence of it working in practice and that it will be monitored to ensure that it meets its aims.

<P>

<B>Angela Smith:</B> I shall endeavour to be brief. My hon. Friends have set out the position carefully. I should like to reiterate on behalf of all of us how pleased we are to serve on the Committee. The Bill brings so much change to the criminal justice system that is essential and we are delighted that the Government have introduced it. Having said that, the issue of belief in consent is causing us considerable concern.
<P>
We have heard a lot from the hon. Member for Ryedale about fairness in the law. One of the issues of fairness is that if belief in consent is allowed as a defence, thus enabling evidence or allegations about past sexual behaviour to be brought into court, information about the defendant's past sexual behaviour, such as previous rape convictions or charges, cannot be brought to court. There is an imbalance there. The worrying thing is that belief in consent could be used as a defence more often, to bring in the complainant's past sexual history.
<P>
The uncertainty gives us cause for concern. As I said earlier, some people have learning difficulties, which can cause them problems in making themselves understood. That leaves open the issue of the defendant saying, ``I believed that I had consent''. As my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) said, it implies that men can presume a belief in consent.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister will be aware of the Canadian system, which made some changes in the law to deal with the issue of belief in consent. At present the defendant can only use belief in consent and must show that he has taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances known at the time to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting. It is not enough to say, ``I believed in the consent''; he must prove that at all stages the complainant was consenting. The defendant cannot say, ``I believed that the complainant was consenting to sex because I know of her past sexual behaviour. She regularly went to the pub with some mates of mine and they went back and had sex.'' The court must ensure that he personally had tried to ascertain whether she consented. In the Canadian system the judge must apply eight criteria before he can exercise his discretion.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston asked whether belief in consent in the case of children under 16 or 17 could be justified by a child's past sexual behaviour. A great deal of sexual behaviour involving children is sexual abuse. Those of us who have dealt with such cases over many years know of occasions when a case of alleged rape has not reached court. That is what the Minister is trying to guard against in the clause. I know of a case where the child did not go to court on the allegation of rape because the social workers said that, because there had been abuse in the past, allegations of past sexual activity would be brought into court and they could not put her through that. Therefore, in the case of children no past sexual behaviour evidence should be allowed.
<P>
I look forward to hearing the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister on those points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I shall deal first with the amendment and then with the important and relevant issues raised by my hon. Friends that pertain to the amendment but go wider.
<P>
The amendment applies only where the issue is consent, not where the issue is belief in consent. The behaviour that is the subject of the evidence to be admitted must, whenever it occurred, be sufficiently similar to the sexual behaviour that occurred as part of the event that is the subject-matter of the charge or to other sexual behaviour that occurred at or about the same time as that event.
<P>
As I have said, the issue of consent or belief in consent will have to be revisited during the review. The review will draw on the interesting examples from foreign jurisdictions such as Michigan or Canada in arriving at a substantive offence of rape that reflects the changed social attitude towards sexual relationships between two individuals, whatever their sex or sexual orientation.
<P>
As my hon. Friends said, these are difficult issues which need detailed study and inquiry and, in due course, the House will reconsider them.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, we must deal with the law as it is and the evidence that is required to establish the offence; we cannot change the law of evidence now in response to the substantive law as we might wish it to become. There will be different views on the matter; for every view expressed on one side of the argument this afternoon, an opposing view is held, both by hon. Members and those outside the House. It will not be easy for the House to arrive at a ready resolution of the undoubted conflict and philosophical differences in the approach to matters of human sexuality and relationships. Nevertheless, it is a course on which we have rightly set out.
<P>
I have already made available to Members of the House and the other place the opportunity to feed directly into the sexual offences review, which several Members of both Houses have done. There will be other such opportunities and it will be useful for Members of both Houses to have a seminar on the issue of rape in which the points that have been made can be explored in depth, with experts, so that the review may take into account the opinions of the House.
<P>
I shall deal now with the points raised about consent and belief in consent and how and when, under existing law, the complainant's behaviour is relevant to whether the complainant consented. First, why the distinction between consent and belief in consent? Rape is an offence of intention, not one of strict liability, in spite of what some may think. Therefore, what is in the mind of the defendant when the alleged offence is being committed is pertinent. What he honestly believes in relation to whether the complainant is consenting is therefore relevant. That belief, and whether it is honest, will be affected to a greater or lesser degree by the defendant's previous knowledge and experience, if any, of the complainant. There may have been a previous relationship between them, or there may be an on-going relationship. The defendant may know of specific instances of past behaviour--with himself or others--which led him to believe that the complainant was consenting to sex with him on the occasion in question. 
<P>
Under the existing law, evidence of the behaviour that led the defendant to form the view that the complainant was consenting can and should be admitted if the defendant can convince the court that it is relevant to his defence of honest belief, that his main purpose in adducing it is not to impugn the complainant's credibility and that its probity and value outweigh the adverse impact that it may have on the jury's view of the complainant.
<P>
Therefore, three hurdles must be overcome. Those hurdles, relating to the defence, will exist just as surely in future as they do now. However, added protection will be afforded by the Bill. The defendant's belief does not need to be reasonable; it need only be honest to succeed as a defence. However, the law allows the jury to assess the credibility of that belief in deciding whether it is honestly held. Should the jury conclude on the evidence presented that a defendant was reckless and could not care less about whether the complainant consented, it must find him guilty.
<P>
The wording of clause 40 does not permit a fishing expedition and does not allow the admission of tittle-tattle, bar room or cloakroom gossip or the suggestion that because the complainant had gone willingly with unnamed people in the past she was willing to go with the defendant. That concern was raised by my hon. Friends the Members for South Swindon, for Don Valley, for Stretford and Urmston, for Luton, South (Ms Moran) and for Basildon. My hon. Friends were right to raise such matters, which are foremost in the mind of any man or woman who, in certain circumstances, is concerned about their son or daughter--under the present law it could be either.
<P>
That is how the law makes a distinction between consent and belief in consent. Some may believe that such a distinction should not exist. That is a perfectly legitimate view; however, it is contentious. Were it to be accepted, there would be a fundamental change in British jurisprudence. That ain't going to happen in Committee this afternoon and will not happen in the course of parliamentary deliberations on the Bill. However, at some point, the House must wrestle with the matter.
<P>
Clearly, the full divergence of views on that matter is not reflected in the composition of the Committee. However, had that composition been otherwise, especially in relation to those silent ones in the Conservative party, there would have been a stout clash this afternoon. There has been no such clash. Indeed, I can think of at least one of my hon. and learned Friends who would have had his tup'penny ha'penny worth. Indeed, what he would have had to say would have been worth considerably more than that. I am a former colleague of his at the Bar, so he will not mind me saying that.
<P>
My hon. and learned Friend holds distinct views, as do other hon. and right hon. Members. However, I must ensure that the Bill achieves the right balance between the evidence and the Government's determination to end the abuse of the existing law that has led to complainants being deterred from coming forward.
<P>
I want to deal with another vexed issue that has been raised. My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston forcefully and properly asked why a complainant's sexual behaviour in the past should ever be relevant to her consent unless it related to a previous false allegation of rape. My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon correctly said that that was a different issue from the complainant's sexual history, but she concurred that sexual history can never be relevant unless it is raised in rebuttal. However, we are not currently able to accede to those views.
<P>
A complainant's sexual behaviour--either with the defendant or with anyone else--might in some circumstances be relevant. Our view is that it is not generally relevant to whether a complainant consented on the occasion in question. What is at issue--I have made this point time and again--is whether the complainant consented with the individual in question on the occasion forming the subject matter of the charge. Therefore, sexual history will not, and should not be, generally relevant. That does not mean that such evidence can never be relevant to consent.
<P>
I have been asked to give examples, so I will. I do so with some reluctance because it is always possible for examples to be misunderstood. I hope that members of the Committee are aware of that when they reflect on my examples or any of their own. That is why I prefer to root my remarks in existing case law. Everybody then understands where we are.
<P>
The complainant and the defendant may have been together for some hours during which the alleged offence took place. If they had consensual sex in that time and shortly before the alleged rape, evidence of that may be relevant to whether the complainant consented or whether the defendant believes that she consented to the alleged offence. It would be unfair to the defendant to exclude such evidence. Similarly, if the defendant can bring evidence or witnesses to show that he and the complainant had been engaged in a sexual activity--heavy petting, for example--other than sex shortly before the alleged offence was committed, that too might be relevant to the defence of consent.
<P>
I have another illustrative example. A group of youngsters go to a pub and two pair off during the course of the evening. They leave before the others, who later pass them on their way home and see them kissing, cuddling and fondling one another in a doorway or on a park bench. That evidence may be pertinent. Therefore, the defendant should be able with the agreement of the court--let us remember that the defendant must lay the ground for adducing such evidence--to bring witnesses to that effect at trial.
<P>
That does not preclude a complainant saying at trial that the petting took place, but that that was as far as she wanted it to go and that the defendant would not take her no for an answer. Of course, the complainant can say that. The jury must decide what weight to place on all the evidence. It would not be fair to deny the complainant the opportunity to test the defendant's assertion, or to prevent the defendant from introducing such evidence. It would not present the whole picture of events that took place on the night.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Evidence that the complainant had had one or more sexual partners in her life, last year, last month or last week would not be admissible as a defence of consent. The implication of such evidence would be that the complainant had consented to the defendant. On strikingly similar behaviour, it would not be relevant if the defendant could produce a friend to say that the complainant had had sex with him during the previous week after leaving the pub and indulging in heavy petting. It is important to make clear that that would not constitute strikingly similar behaviour. The Government are determined to get rid of the notion that consent to one person means consent to another and that sexual activity makes an individual more likely to lie. Both ideas are plainly nonsense.
<P>
I shall now consider the issue of similar evidence under proposed new subsection (3)(c). I have been asked why similar evidence under that provision is not ``strikingly similar''. The test under proposed new subsection (3)(c) allows the court to grant leave to admit evidence of sexual behaviour by the complainant that is so similar to the complainant's behaviour at or about the same time as the event that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as coincidence.
<P>
There is a long history of the court's readiness to accept strikingly similar evidence. The best example is perhaps the DPP v. Boardman in 1975. The strikingly similar test has come under fire in recent years because it has been applied inconsistently. Therefore, we have chosen the test of unlikelihood of coincidence. That is not a new idea; it first surfaced in the Privy Council case of Makin v. the Attorney General of New South Wales in 1894--some time ago. It was most recently approved by the Court of the Appeal in the Groves case in 1998. We have chosen that test because we believe that it is tighter. We do not propose to use the phrase ``strikingly similar'' because proposed new subsection (3)(c) enables us, by introducing the language of the Groves case and that of Makin v. the Attorney General of New South Wales, to provide for additional hurdles that the defendant will have to overcome.
<P>
Under the test, the evidence that the defendant tries to adduce will have to surmount additional hurdles, apart from those for which the clause already provides. I shall outline the hurdles for which the clause provides. Under subsection (2), a refusal of leave might render unsafe the jury's conclusion on a relevant issue at trial; under subsection (4), the main purpose of the evidence must be other than to impugn the witness's credibility; under subsection (6), the evidence must relate to specific instances of sexual behaviour. The additional hurdles are that the evidence must be so similar to what happened during the alleged rape that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence, and that its probative value significantly outweighs the prejudicial impact its introduction might have on the complainant's evidence. That is important.
<P>
The gateway that the subsection creates is narrow, and intentionally so. It does not allow the court to admit evidence, even strikingly similar evidence, that, for instance, the complainant has previously enjoyed one-night stands, has had sex in the open air or in a car with different men on consecutive nights. That could be pure coincidence. It might be coincidental that sex was had in a car in a lovers' lay-by on one occasion, when it is alleged by the defendant that there was consent, and he can show that on another occasion she had sex in the same lay-by in the same car and the friend confirms that she consented and she admits that she consented. That would not be allowed in relation to this clause.
<P>
The clause permits evidence of consensual sexual activity that is unrelated to the alleged offence when it is so similar to the defendant's description events that it cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence. We believe that that meets the requirements of justice and is fair to both the defendant and the complainant, but it is tighter than the previous test and is designed to be so.
<P>
I have been asked some specific questions, not least by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston, about children. For a child aged under 16 evidence about previous sexual behaviour cannot be relevant to consent because the child is deemed incapable of consent. It would not arise then in any event; it would not be allowed under the clause as drafted.
<P>
Where consent is not an issue, the Bill allows sexual behaviour evidence to be admitted only in the following circumstances. It can be admitted to explain or rebut evidence adduced by the prosecution about the sexual behaviour of the complainant or the events that form the subject matter of the charge. That is set out in subsection (5).
<P>
The evidence can be admitted if it relates to a relevant issue in the case and the court does not regard it as reasonable to assume that the main purpose for which it would be adduced is to impugn the credibility of the complainant as a witness. That is set out in subsection (4). It can be admitted if it relates to a specific instance or instances of sexual behaviour on the part of the complainant, That is set out in subsection (6). I know that that will be of particular concern to my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston. I shall come in a moment to why it is unavoidable that such evidence might be admitted, albeit at the discretion of the judge on previous application and only where it is relevant and probative--when all those tests are fulfilled, but it might be admitted. Finally, evidence can be admitted if a refusal of leave to admit it might have resulted in rendering unsafe a conclusion on any relevant issue in the case. Those are the tests.
<P>
Subsection (4) excludes attempts simply to undermine the witness's credibility, an important safeguard against those who might want to claim that a secondary effect of sexual abuse of children is to render them sexualised, unreliable fantasists who may be more likely than most to make false allegations in the future. One cannot say, ``She was abused when she was a child, so she is a fantasist now and you can't believe a word she says'', although I know of attempts to adduce such evidence. That is not possible under subsection (4). Unfortunately, a child who has been victimised in that way is more likely than other children to be victimised by others in the same way in the future. That is one of the tragedies and evils of child abuse.
<P>
The definition of a child in clause 16 as someone who is under 17 includes children who are deemed capable of giving informed consent. Under subsection (3)(b), where the presence or absence of consent is an issue at trial, evidence of previous sexual behaviour will still not be admitted, even after the hurdles described earlier have been surmounted, unless the behaviour in question was so similar to behaviour that took place at or about the same time as the alleged assault that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence.
<P>
I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston that I would explain why we cannot rule out the possibility that a child's previous sexual behaviour, which may be non-consensual, may be relevant to a defence case. If it is relevant and it passes the hurdles in the clause, it will have to be admitted, as otherwise a miscarriage of justice might arise. Not only is the House committed to the notion of fairness between the defence and the prosecution but the burden of proof lies on the prosecution and is present even in the most horrendous of circumstances and horrific of cases. However horrific the circumstances and vulnerable the victims, the rule of law demands that the Crown prove its case and that the defendant do all that is necessary, so far as is compatible with the interests of justice, to contest and challenge the case brought against him. There is a right to a fair trial, and the court should hear evidence about relevant issues. It is a right to which the House is wedded, as it is wedded to the rule of law, and it is a right enshrined in the European convention on human rights. Consistent with that, the clause contains the checks and balances necessary to achieve our objective.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Drown:</B> I seek clarification on one point--pre-trial hearings. The clause tries to restrict the bringing of sexual behaviour into trials. My hon. Friend the Minister has not ruled out witnesses coming to pre-trial hearings. I should be grateful if he would consider applying the restrictions in the clause to pre-trial hearings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It would not be usual for witnesses to attend pre-trial hearings. I shall return to that issue on Report.

Question put and agreed to.
