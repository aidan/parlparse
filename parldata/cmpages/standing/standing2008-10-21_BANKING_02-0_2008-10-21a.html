<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0810222000225"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good afternoon. Welcome to the Committee. I am
sure, Angela, that your two colleagues will not mind me paying you a
particular welcome. It does not seem as though you have been away, but
it is a fair time. Welcome. We will open our session with a question
from Mark
Hoban.</div><a name="0810222000010"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
107107</b><a name="0810222000226"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): This question is for both
Mrs. Knight and Mr. Taylor. Quite a lot of
concerns have been expressed about the proposed changes to
creditors&#146; rights, particularly in the context of the partial
transfer of banks. Have your concerns been satisfactorily addressed in
the
Bill?</div><a name="0810222000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> No. I am sorry, but I do not think that they
have. There has been some movement towards recognising some of the
issues, but in clauses 42 and 43 we get close to the nub of the
problem. Consequent upon those clauses, all the legal netting
agreements that banks have are not necessarily going to be honoured.
That is the important thing. A range of netting agreements is referred
to, but there are more out there. Unless there is a proper agreement
that legally binding netting contracts can stand, the concerns remain
that effectively contracts will be qualified. You will not then be able
to net off. There will not be the certainty of it. In normal business
times that means that you will not be able to net off for the purposes
of capital. While the degree to which that affects banks will depend
upon what business they are doing, about 70 to 80 per cent. of the
relevant business is affected. It is a big effect. Even if we get it
right in clauses 42 and 43, clause 65 as it stands makes it possible to
change everything retrospectively anyway. So those two clauses and
clause 65 need to be addressed; otherwise a permanent prejudice will be
left.</div>
<a name="0810222000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Taylor:</b></i> I very much agree with Angela&#146;s
general remarks on that. This is a point that has been raised a lot in
our various representations. The Government are clearly trying to move
in our direction because they recognise that the issue is a real one.
The problem is that, as Angela says, unless legal firms are able to
provide a so-called clean, unqualified legal opinion on these detailed
netting arrangements, whenever the netting arrangement arises, it will
cause a problem for the firms in relation to their regulators. Under
the capital requirements directive, the firms will need to show their
regulators a clean legal opinion to enable them to net the provisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>for their capital purposes. There is a real problem there. That is why
it is vital that the problem is addressed properly in the secondary
legislation, which we have not yet
seen.</div><a name="0810222000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
108</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000227"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This morning, the Minister said that the draft code
of practice would be produced next Thursday, and that the principles
for the secondary legislation would be ready in time for the debate on
clauses 42 and 43. What principles would you like to see in that
secondary legislation to address the concerns of your
members?</div><a name="0810222000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> Our view is that if you have a netting
contract that is legal&#151;that would stand a legal test&#151;that
needs to be recognised and excluded so that, in effect, that remains
unchanged and creditor rights are preserved. I am very glad to hear
that we will be able to see the secondary legislation and the code
fairly soon, because it is essential that one sees both secondary and
primary legislation together. This is a holistic issue that needs to be
looked at. Certainly, all the lawyers whom we have consulted, who have
no doubt been in touch with various members of this Committee, have
raised both the holistic point and the essential need to ensure that we
do not inadvertently interfere with creditors&#146; rights and end up
with a situation in which there is no clean legal opinion, because the
consequences thereof would be pretty big. Regarding clause 65, we need
to get netting and netting arrangements properly recognised in the
clause as being disapplied from the Henry VIII provisions that it
contains.</div><a name="0810222000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000228"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I go further? On the cost of capital, you have
both referred to the impact that it could have through the capital
requirements directive. I am intrigued to understand how you think that
will work its way through, and what the impact might be. I have spoken
to one international bank, which said that if the right safeguards were
not in place, it would lead to a situation in which you were counting
assets and liabilities on a gross basis, not a net basis. His argument
was that that would make London a pretty unattractive place to do
business. Do you share that
view?</div><a name="0810222000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Taylor:</b></i> Yes, that is exactly right. The way in which
it would work is that unless you can net off your position for credit
risk purposes, your regulator will make you account, on a gross basis,
for your capital, against the credit risk, which you take on by being
the counterparty of a firm that is based here. That would greatly
increase your capital requirement. The result, I am sure, would be that
there would be a great deal less business.</div>
<a name="0810222000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> For the purposes of comparison, although
there are intervention regimes in a lot of countries, some of which are
also being reviewed, there is no intervention regime that we have yet
found that would result in the circumstances that could apply if this
legislation went through as it stands. That is to say, other
people&#146;s intervention regimes do not interfere with
creditors&#146; rights, and netting agreements are preserved so that
there is not the problem of not being able to net off your capital.
Certainly, we have been told by a number of our members that if they
could not net off, they would no longer be able to do that business
here in the UK, so we would see a commensurate loss of a significant
amount of business out of London.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div><a name="0810222000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><a name="0810222000229"></a><b class="B">Sir
Peter Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): Clause 157 imposes an
obligation on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme to contribute
to the costs of resolution under the special resolution regime. Would
you like to comment on
that?</div><a name="0810222000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> We do not think that this clause should be
there at all, I am afraid, the reason being that the special resolution
regime should be paid for by the bank that has got into difficulty.
When companies up and down the country get into difficulty, the costs
of resolving that problem are paid by that company. We are saying that
the compensation scheme is there for depositors&#151;or individuals,
because it is broader than just deposit protection&#151;and that to
broaden it in this way represents a potentially disproportionate
burden. Secondly, the responsibilities for resolution should fall on
the failing institutions anyway. Thirdly, the clause could be read as a
compensation scheme picking up some of the creditor costs of the
failing institutions other than those of just the depositors. It is in
all ways wrong: to us, it does not seem to work in principle&#151;the
principle should be that the resolution is paid for by the entity that
got into difficulty&#151;or in the
content.</div><a name="0810222000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> May I add to that on behalf of the building
societies? Small and medium-sized building societies are particularly
resentful of this, because the chances of one of them entering the
special resolution regime are extremely low, and yet clearly the Bill
states that they would have to pay those costs through the FSCS. On
this matter, therefore, there is particular resentment among those
institutions.</div><a name="0810222000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
111</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000230"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> As drafted, how much ability would you and
your respective bodies have to influence the quantum of the
costing?</div><a name="0810222000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> If a clause of this type must remain, it must
be absolutely clear that the compensation scheme kicks in on the SRR
only when all other avenues for paying for the resolution have been
exhausted. Then, if it must kick in, we must define those costs quite
narrowly, because otherwise, in effect, we would be leaving an open
door for industry to pay for almost everything regarding a failure,
whereas the first responsibility for preventing the failure of an
institution is with its management. One must work one&#146;s way down
a series of questions: &#147;Who does what?&#148;, &#147;Whose
are the responsibilities?&#148;, &#147;Who pays what?&#148; and
so on. If there must be a last resort, there must be a last resort,
although we would argue that that is not right. But if it is necessary,
it must happen only if the assets of that institution cannot pay for
the costs of the SRR. If an ordinary company is wound up, the
liquidator gets paid. It seems to us, therefore, that we have rather
moved away from some of the accepted common principles in this
area.</div><a name="0810222000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
112</b><a name="0810222000231"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): Deposit protection varies
slightly; in the past few months the goalposts have been moving all the
time. In your view, what is the appropriate level of compensation for
deposit
protection?</div><a name="0810222000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> We supported the increase in deposit
protection from &#163;35,000 to &#163;50,000, which covers 97 per
cent. of building society depositors. Building societies believe that
that is an appropriate level. To go to an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>unlimited level of protection would be extremely
expensive and open up significant contingent liabilities on behalf of
those institutions contributing to the deposit protection scheme. To
insure the deposits of 97 per cent. of depositors seems appropriate to
us.</div><a name="0810222000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
113</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000232"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> You have answered on behalf of the building
societies. The point has been made that deposit protection at the
moment covers only your net deposit&#151;not the gross deposit. In
other words, the gross figure is different precisely because you have a
huge loan with a building society as well, so you do not get the level
of deposit protection that you might think that you will get. Are you
happy with that
principle?</div><a name="0810222000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> There is a difference between banks and
building societies. In the banking sector&#151;my colleagues will
correct me if I am wrong&#151;there is an automatic netting off of
the position. As far as we can tell&#151;this is a complex legal
area&#151;in building societies it depends on the terms and
conditions of the individual savings and mortgage accounts of the
individual building society. So the position is not straightforward in
the case of building
societies.</div><a name="0810222000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
114</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000233"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Would you welcome
uniformity?</div><a name="0810222000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> It would probably be helpful for depositors to
know precisely what the position is without having to take legal
advice, but I am not certain that it would be helpful to impose
uniformity through this
legislation.</div><a name="0810222000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
115</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000234"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> To what extent can banks and building societies
quickly identify the extent of deposit insurances by individuals given
the different brands, multiple accounts and so on? How long would they
need to complete an
assessment?</div><a name="0810222000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> That would vary hugely between different sizes
and types of institutions. For a simple one-brand building society,
with perhaps 10,000, 20,000 or 50,000 accounts, that could be a fairly
straightforward exercise. My colleagues may be able to comment on how
simple it might be for a much larger institution with many millions of
accounts.</div><a name="0810222000031"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
116</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000235"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> On the face of it, it sounds a very difficult area
to regulate in any way, given the complexity of financial
products.</div><a name="0810222000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="0810222000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> Perhaps I can answer for the banks on the two
points. First, regarding the depositor protection scheme and the
limits, there have been some noticeable changes in the last year.
Originally, we put out some information into the public
domain&#151;that is, the British Bankers Association&#151;which is
approximately two years old. That information gave the percentage of
individuals who are covered by the &#163;35,000 limit, which was 96
per cent., and at &#163;50,000 it was 98 per cent. In terms of value,
of course, it was significantly
less.</div><a name="0810222000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
one of the effects of the credit crunch over the past year is that
people have moved their money around, to get below the limits. So, in
the Bradford &amp; Bingley case you will have noticed that 80 per cent.
by value was covered by the &#163;35,000 limit. We must recognise
that people have responded to a very strong message, which is,
&#147;Spread it around underneath the limit&#148;, whereas I
suspect that the movement is now slowing down. Actions have been
taken.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div><a name="0810222000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that there is a case for special situations&#151;by that, I
mean when an individual has sold a house, or there is a lump of money
from a will or whatever. We are looking into how we deal with coverage
insurance for special situations.</div>
<a name="0810222000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us move on
to your next point, which is what banks know about the particular
positions of their customers. You are right that most systems have been
built by brand. Therefore, there are various different types of brands
that sit under a bank and usually the systems are built like that. By
&#147;brand&#148; I mean, for example, the NatWest. So it has been
done like that. Perceptionally, that is how individuals look at
it&#151;not always, of course, but it tends to hypothecate straight
up to a banking
licence.</div><a name="0810222000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
it is very difficult to answer your question&#151;how can you bring
everything together and how long will it take? It is difficult to
answer it, not least because there are some other things to consider;
there are regulatory requirements and taxation on some issues. There
are all those sorts of
considerations.</div><a name="0810222000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
other issues, we have some consultants examining this area. The
consultants&#146; report ought to be available relatively shortly. I
am afraid that I cannot give an exact date; consultants are as
consultants are. However, it should certainly be available before you
have finished your
deliberations.</div><a name="0810222000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
117</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000236"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Before Third
Reading?</div><a name="0810222000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> Yes, absolutely. The report delves down into
a number of areas, including what is known as single customer view,
speed and what can and cannot be done. We felt that that was an
important part of this debate and that it would be helpful for us all
if we went in with others and commissioned that work.</div>
<a name="0810222000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> There is one particular aspect that will
affect the speed with which you have a single customer view, and that
is the extent to which there have been recent mergers between two
building societies or two banks. If there has been a recent merger, it
will be much more difficult to get a single customer view, because the
acquiring organisation will not know the circumstances of the customers
of the acquired organisation as well as it knows its own
customers.</div>
<a name="0810222000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> May I just come back in, because there was
one part of your question that I did not answer? That is what nets off.
The view that we have put forward is that what nets off is an overdraft
but that is all, and we think that that is probably the right way. I
think that we need to work through the legalities of offsets, but again
that is something that sits to the side. Netting off the overdraft is
the only one that we are really proposing.</div>
<a name="0810222000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><a name="0810222000237"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): Following on from that,
we heard in previous evidence that there should be a customer-level
test beforehand by the compensation scheme, so that, when a bank goes
under, the scheme can, at the press of a button and in a common format,
produce the amount of money that needs to be given back to an
individual. This issue is very time-sensitive. If someone&#146;s
money is in a bank and that bank has gone bust, they need to access
that money.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div><a name="0810222000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Listening
to your previous argument, it seems that the banks are not very sure
how much money each customer has. You have a problem. Do you think that
there should be a common format and that customer-level information
should be given in
advance?</div><a name="0810222000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> You are absolutely right about customer
information. About 130 million personal accounts are out there. People
are using cash machines. They have cheques and direct debits in the
system. At any one time, quite a lot of movements are hung up in the
system. You are right that we cannot know the precise position at one
moment in time. The debate has looked at the matter the wrong way
round. We should not be considering a system whereby, if a bank goes
bust, the information is passed to the compensation scheme, which
cranks up the cheque-printing equipment and sends out 14 million
cheques by post. That is probably not how to do it. Even if it can be
done quickly, does that really sound
right?</div><a name="0810222000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that, if a bank has failed, the bank&#146;s systems should be
operated by a third party for the purposes of paying out through cash
machines and bank branches in the same way as an individual would be
treated now. That does not mean that they all have to queue up outside
a bank branch; no, because the general payment system has been used. In
effect, that was the case with the Bradford &amp; Bingley. If we
consider from where the Bill&#151;and, indeed, the debate&#151;has
come, it would imply that, in a Bradford &amp; Bingley case, the
information is passed to the compensation scheme, which then fires up
the printing press and sends out all the cheques to people as quickly
as possible. Was it not much more appropriate from the customer side
that they had a seamless, continuous
service?</div><a name="0810222000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should like the Committee to consider an amendment to the Bill that
would provide continuity of service, because that is infinitely more
likely both to give confidence and give people the experience that they
deserve.</div><a name="0810222000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
119</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000238"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> That is a very interesting proposal. May I move away
from that to the funding of the compensation scheme? In the US and
other countries, it is pre-funded, but we really have a pay-as-you-go
model. My constituents would be amazed that the banks are opposed to a
pre-funded scheme. Some of your member banks&#151;not all&#151;have
brought the economy to the verge of disaster. We are going from boom to
bust because of irresponsible bankers and, by the way, the bankers do
not want to fund the compensation scheme in advance. Is that not a very
strange attitude for the banks to
take?</div><a name="0810222000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> I can put it another way: if you want a
system that is pre-funded, it means that you are taking finance out of
the banking arrangements at a time when it is not necessarily needed
and that will flow through inevitably into costs. Is it not more
appropriate to have arrangements that ensure that, if that finance is
available, it is made available, instead of having a sum of money
sitting in mid-air? I agree that there is a debate to be had. Even the
Bill says that it will take a power and think about it. If I were a
customer, what I want is my money quickly. If the arrangement behind
that ensures that I get my money quickly, that is the important
thing.</div><a name="0810222000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000239"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> With due respect, you are missing the point. We all
agree that the money has to come quickly. Let us consider the travel
industry, and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>arrangements of the air travel organiser&#146;s licence and ABTA. That
is effectively paying in during the good years for when something goes
wrong. It is rather like an insurance policy. We all want them paid out
quickly, but why should the money fall on the taxpayer to do it
immediately?</div><a name="0810222000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> I do not think that it does. All the interest
is paid for by the
banks.</div><a name="0810222000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000240"></a>Mr.

not?</div><a name="0810222000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela

Knight:</b></i> There are points on both sides. Two years
ago, perhaps slightly less, there was a consultation by the FSA at
which some of those points were raised. Consultants were asked to look
at some of the issues, such as the size of the pots and how they were
funded. The conclusion from that consultation was that availability was
the important issue. It asked whether arrangements in the UK were such
that first, cash was available, should it be required, and secondly,
that the cost did not fall on the taxpayer. Those two conditions have
been met.</div>
<a name="0810222000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">You might say
that you want X billion pounds out of the banking industry today. If
you do, that is X billion pounds not available for provision for the
people of this country. There is a balance. You will know our view
because we stated it in our earlier representations. However, in our
recent commentary, you will see that equally, we have accepted that a
power can be enacted, should there be the will to do so.</div>
<a name="0810222000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be a
good idea to have a fixed review period&#151;that is a general
comment about a number of issues in the Bill, not only in this area.
Such a provision existed in the FSMA&#151;the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000, where it was written into the legislation that a
review was to take place in a couple of years. There are many issues
here&#151;a lot of &#147;maybe this and maybe thats&#148; and
&#147;how do interacts take place?&#148; Perhaps you would like to
take that thought away.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000245"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Just to nail the point. Last year, one of the banks
that has failed made something like &#163;9 billion
profit. None of that money&#151;none of those billions and billions
of pounds made by the bank&#151;was put away in a protection scheme.
Do the banks think that is right?</div>
<a name="0810222000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> Well, they always knew that they stood liable
for it. They stood liable in good years, bad years, profitable years,
non-profitable years. They always knew that they were liable
regardless.</div>
<a name="0810222000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> I would add from the building society point of
view that the profits that building societies make are added to their
capital. That capital stands there to protect depositors. There is a
choice of whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>to put it in the compensation scheme to protect depositors, or whether
to keep it in the building society balance sheet. At the margin, if the
money is taken out of the building society and put in the compensation
scheme, depositors in the building society are slightly less safe by
the amount that the building society has given to the compensation
scheme. From our point of view, that is moving it around in two
buckets, rather than adding to overall depositor
safety.</div><a name="0810222000063"></a>

123</b><a name="0810222000246"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Taylor:</b></i> They are covered by the Bill in that netting,
which we were talking about earlier on, is extremely important to the
activities of investment banks. Investment banking is an activity
rather than an entity, particularly since a large part is carried out
within universal banks.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000247"></a>Mr.

licensed as deposit takers.</div>
<a name="0810222000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan

<a name="0810222000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan

proven, which is how level the playing field might be, given that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0810222000250"></a>Mr.

<a name="0810222000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela

comment for him to make. It is also perfectly fair for me to say that
we are not actually quite that sure. Some of the difficulties will end
up being not so much with the content of the Bill, but how it is
applied by the regulators. Certainly, it is the regulation side where
most attention needs to be paid.</div>

127</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000252"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> How do the provisions of the Banking Bill
in the United Kingdom compare with the manner in which these issues are
being handled in the United States and in the European
Community?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="0810222000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela

pretend to be word perfect on
this.</div>
<a name="0810222000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0810222000253"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> I can narrow the question if you wish: are
there points of comparison that cause you
concern?</div><a name="0810222000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> There seems to us to be one main difference,
which is that within the Bill it is envisaged that the special
resolution regime could be triggered prior to a bank being in default,
whereas in other jurisdictions the default process takes place first.
The reason the Bill does that is to promote financial stability. It
states that we will not get to the point at which there is a default;
instead, if we think that will happen the tripartite regulatory system
has the right to go in early and take action. In the other
jurisdictions of which I have knowledge, that happens after the bank
has breached the appropriate default triggers, whatever they may be.
That is a difference. It does not make us wrong to do it and them
right, or vice versa, but it is one of the reasons why the whole
netting thing has come so high up the agenda.</div>
<a name="0810222000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
noticeable that by putting this legislation through we are in effect
codifying practices that not only did we understand could take place
prior to Northern Rock, but which the authorities have used since then.
We are putting them into place and codifying them. It seems to us that
the Bill is doing so far more extensively than the existing procedures
in other countries, although I suspect that after the actions that
other countries have had to take, which are similar to our own, they
too will have to look at and revise their
legislation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
128</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000254"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> To what extent have your members reached a
situation where they are confident that they now know the true value of
their assets? To what extent are their balance sheets still
contaminated by toxic assets? By way of illustration, I think that the
nearest analogue to the present situation is Lloyd&#146;s of London.
Lloyd&#146;s made a point of identifying and isolating the toxic
assets in the so-called spiral and then moving on. Are your members at
that stage? Are they doing
that?</div><a name="0810222000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> No. Lloyd&#146;s put them into Equitas and
floated it off as a different vehicle&#151;I recall it as well. We
would say that they know exactly where they stand. There are still a
number of imponderables, however, which are related to the valuation
process of illiquid assets. Illiquid assets are not necessarily bad
assets, but assets for which there is no market at the moment. The
process for how to value them changed from about 10 October,
when the US changed its valuation rules and allowed a valuation that
included a reflection of the income stream. That meant that one went
from having to try to determine the value of a product using mechanisms
that were no longer particularly appropriate, to using mechanisms that
were appropriate. That has started to clarify the issues very
considerably indeed, but the difficulties are not just the result of
exposure to particular types of complex US sub-prime, although that is
where they start, and undoubtedly there is that exposure around the
world. There has also been a loss of confidence in an asset class
generally&#151;that is, housing&#151;in many jurisdictions, which
has fed through to ordinary assets that one would never even remotely
call particularly complex. There are many factors involved. On the
specific question, the new valuation rules are significant.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="0810222000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Taylor:</b></i> I would agree with that general description
of where we are. In other words, I think that at this point there is
something approaching certainty, but I would not want to put it more
strongly than that. I would be comfortable with
that.</div><a name="0810222000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
129</b><a name="0810222000255"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): This is a
question for Adrian. Given that building societies have not had the
same track record of failure, are you concerned that this package of
reforms might be applied to you although you are not part of the
problem?</div><a name="0810222000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> No, we do not believe that we are part of the
problem, although I would not claim that building societies will sail
through the recession without any difficulties whatever. We have
already had announcements of two building society mergers, which were
necessary to ensure that the building society sector maintains its
record as a safe haven for investors&#146;
funds.</div><a name="0810222000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are keen that building societies are perceived to be, and are, as safe
as banks that are covered by the legislation, so we took an early view
that the legislation should cover building societies in exactly the
same way as banks. It would be wrong if some of the mechanisms that
could be applied to a bank in difficulty were not available to a
building society in difficulty and, as a result, some investors somehow
got the perception that a building society investment was less safe
than one in a
bank.</div><a name="0810222000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are supportive of the additional clauses in the legislation that say
that the provisions that apply to the banking sector also apply to the
building society sector. We think that we would be in a weaker position
if they did
not.</div><a name="0810222000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000256"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Are there any aspects of the legislation that are
of concern to your
members?</div><a name="0810222000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> We have already covered one of the most
important ones, and that is the FSCS meeting the costs of a bank or
building society in the SRR. Most building societies will never go into
the SRR but will still have to meet the costs. Also, single customer
information must be kept in the way prescribed by the FSA for FSCS
payout. That could impose significant costs on small institutions, but
the huge likelihood is that a small institution would be taken over by
a larger one rather than go through the FSCS procedures. Therefore, the
effort of organising affairs in a way that the FSA wants would be
wasted for small and medium-sized building
societies.</div><a name="0810222000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
131</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000257"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Are you concerned about the pre-funding
arrangements, if they come in? Given the benign track record that
building societies have had, do you feel that they would be unduly
onerous?</div><a name="0810222000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> As I indicated to Mr. Bone, if we
moved to pre-funding, it would mean taking a lump of money out of
building societies&#146; capital, which is there to protect their
depositors, and putting it into the compensation scheme. I do not think
that is particularly helpful. If there were a requirement to keep
capital&#151;</div><a name="0810222000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0810222000258"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> But that is a general comment. The point about
pre-funding is that, to some extent, the cost has to be related to
risk. The risk for the banks could be quite substantial, but you could
make a case that the risk for the building societies is slighter, given
your track record.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="0810222000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> Yes, I was going to say that if there were a
requirement for pre-funding, and if there were a requirement to keep
capital at the current level in building societies, the only place the
money could come from is higher mortgage rates or lower saving rates
for building society
customers.</div><a name="0810222000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a strong view among many building societies, which I think the
Building Societies Association would now endorse, that there should be
some element&#151;we have not fully worked it out&#151;of
risk-related premiums. Building societies certainly find it galling
that they have to contribute to payments that are being made in respect
of institutions that have not been run as prudently as building
societies.</div><a name="0810222000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
132</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000259"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> On the trigger mechanism, would any variations be
required for triggering the SRR for building societies in comparison to
banks, given the very different sort of
models?</div><a name="0810222000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> Clearly the mechanisms by which the SRR is
implemented and by which public authorities might take control of a
building society will be very different. You cannot buy shares in a
building society, for example, but we have not identified particular
differences in the overall approach that we would wish to apply to a
building society compared to that which we would apply to a
bank.</div><a name="0810222000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
133</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000260"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> To return to a point that was made earlier, I found
the answers that were given to Sir Peter&#146;s question about the
balance sheets of the banks extremely interesting. In the balance
sheets of the banks last year, you had some assets that have turned out
to be worth much less than had been thought, so the banks have now
written those down&#151;as I understand you are saying&#151;and
have really got to a valuation. What was the change in the valuation
rules? Was it a huge
write-down?</div><a name="0810222000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> First, the new guidance on how to value an
illiquid asset held in the trading book, rather than the banking book,
only came in on 10 October, so it has not all been done. What it does
is to take a different method for assessing a more certain valuation
for an illiquid asset, rather than trying to determine what a market
valuation would be when you have no market. If you look at what has
happened in the States, you will see that there has been a constant
spiral-down of assets for which a market could not be found. Although
for various reasons there might have been a fire sale price out there,
everyone knew that value was probably not relevant, but you had to use
it. It is the volatility that mark to market can bring when a market no
longer exists.</div>
<a name="0810222000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
guidance was formulated first in the US under US generally accepted
accounting principles, and then the International Accounting Standards
Board moved to bring its guidance more or less into line&#151;I have
to say &#147;more or less&#148; because there are bound to be some
legal differences. Both the accounting profession and the industry
think that enables the much more certain type of valuation and in due
course we will see the outcome of
that.</div><a name="0810222000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
134</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000261"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Do we have any idea of the level of
write-down?</div><a name="0810222000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> The level of write-down has been very
significant.</div><a name="0810222000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
135</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000262"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b></i> Well, you see that in the public domain
daily, as is evidenced through share prices and all sorts of other
areas, but where we are with more relevant guidance in place for a
current environment will certainly pan out over a period of time. Being
able to use the ongoing cash flow&#151;for the various formulae and
discounts you will have to ask the auditors for the complex
details&#151;seems a much more sensible way of valuing something that
has a value but for which there is no

136</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000263"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> In an early comment by the BBA, you are
quoted as saying that your main reservation related to partial
transfers of banks, nil-rates and creditors. You made that comment in
July. You said that you saw an imperative need for the Government to
give further time for consideration of the partial transfer
arrangements and that they should be stripped out of primary
legislation. Would you like to confirm that that is still your view and
elaborate on
it?</div><a name="0810222000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Angela
Knight:</b></i> If you say where we think the order should
be, the first thing is that the regulators regulate and we do not get
to the SRR. The second is that, if the SRR is triggered, we would like
to see an entire bank move&#151;we hope&#151;into the hands of a
private purchaser. If that has to have stability at some point before
the process can take place&#151;the bridge bank&#151;then so be it.
Partial transfers come rather a long way down the list. Our preference
would be not to have a partial transfer unless there has been a
default. If it is the decision of Parliament that a partial transfer
must remain as part of the SRR tools before a default is triggered, it
is absolutely essential that the creditor&#146;s rights are not
reordered, that the netting is properly taken care of and that the
decisions taken at the time cannot be retrospectively changed by clause
65.</div><a name="0810222000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
137</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000264"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is a question to you, Mr. Taylor.
You said earlier that the provisions of the Bill affect stand-alone
investment banks only to the extent to which they are counterparties in
transactions where there is netting. Are there any tools in the Bill
that you think appropriate to be used if a stand-alone investment bank
suffered a financial problem, or are you happy with the existing regime
for insolvency and
administration?</div><a name="0810222000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Taylor:</b></i> I would be happy with the existing regime,
but I am not sure whether, in practice, the distinction would work in
that way. I am trying to think about
it.</div><a name="0810222000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
138</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000265"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> So, in effect, you anticipate that the tools
available in the Bill could be used in relation to an investment
bank.</div><a name="0810222000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Taylor:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="0810222000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
139</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000266"></a>Mr.

currently
drafted.</div><a name="0810222000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jonathan
Taylor:</b></i> That is right. My point is that, in
particular, the netting arrangements are of direct concern to the
investment bank. Indeed, as Andrew was saying, there is a link between
that and the partial transfer point. That is one of the reasons why the
partial transfer point raises serious
questions.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
140</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000269"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> Mr. Haddrill, the Association of
British Insurers said in its submission to the Treasury Committee in
July that the case for the special resolution regime was &#147;not
fully proven&#148;. What is your view
today?</div><a name="0810222000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> Given the events of recent weeks, we feel
it is right that a resolution regime of some kind is brought forward
and we support the greater part of the Bill. Our anxiety is that there
is a big national, governmental and taxpayers&#146; interest in a
bank that has got into this situation being got back into the market,
being eventually funded by the institutional shareholders and the City
and being got off the state&#146;s hands. Therefore we are concerned
that the regime should generate confidence that a bank will not be put
into special resolution unless it is absolutely necessary. We think
that there are some things in the Bill that could, perhaps, be
strengthened to provide confidence in that respect. If the bank goes
into the regime, to the extent that there is value still left in it
that should be fairly distributed among the creditors, including the
bondholders of the company, if not the shareholders, so that general
confidence about investing in banks is preserved as far as
possible.</div><a name="0810222000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
141</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000270"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> Have you ideas on what steps could be
taken, short of a special resolution
regime?</div><a name="0810222000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> Ahead of the special resolution regime, as
Angela Knight was saying, it is essential that the regulators actually
regulate the industry effectively to ensure that the capital is
adequate and that the risk of a bank failure is minimised. We would
like to see in the Bill a requirement on the FSA to report publicly on
why it has not been possible for the regulatory regime to discharge its
responsibility in that respect, so that sufficient responsibility is
placed on the regulator to keep the bank going, make sure it does not
get into that difficulty and avoid going to the SRR. But we accept,
now, the case for an SRR in
extremis.</div><a name="0810222000121"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
142</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000271"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> Are there areas in the Bill that you think
require further work? Are you content with the shape of the Bill as it
is emerging?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div><a name="0810222000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> One thing that we do not have is the code
of conduct. We certainly want to see that and look at it before fully
answering that question. We would like to see an objective to maximise
the enterprise value while it remains in the SRR, so that the way that
it is managed during that time does not fritter away the existing value
in the business. We would like the hierarchy of creditor interest to be
respected, so that when compensation is paid the bondholders have the
opportunity to get some
compensation.</div><a name="0810222000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also concerned to see as much certainty injected into the Bill as
possible. Clause 65, which was mentioned in the previous sitting,
creates the opportunity for the Government to completely rewrite the
SRR regime. That seems to go much too far in terms of creating
uncertainty for the
future.</div><a name="0810222000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
143</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000272"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Can I ask a supplementary question? I read your
lucid, clear submission carefully. It contains a suggestion that the
first port of call might be a shareholders&#146; meeting to see if
they can divvy up a bit more cash or replace the management, or
whatever. Given the speed with which events have been moving in
financial markets recently, do you now acknowledge that that is a
fairly unrealistic, not a real world,
scenario?</div><a name="0810222000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> No, I do not acknowledge that. I think that
the institutional shareholders are capable of taking a rapid view,
because after all if you hold 3, 4, 5 or 6 per cent. of a
major institution, which some of the big institutional shareholders do,
you know quite a lot about that institution. You saw three of
those&#151;Legal &amp; General, Prudential and Standard
Life&#151;coming together to put more capital into Bradford &amp;
Bingley, although, in the event, of course, it was insufficient. That
was done alongside some capital injection by the banks and it might
have been sufficient; it was not, but it might have been. I think that
such an opportunity should be
provided.</div><a name="0810222000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
144</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000273"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> So it is a real-world scenario when you have a
company that is failing but it has a few big institutional investors
who can get together and sort it out quickly, but not
otherwise.</div><a name="0810222000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> I am not saying that they will be
successful in all cases, but it is worth trying, if only because, if
their money can go in, that is taxpayers&#146; money that will not be
called
upon.</div><a name="0810222000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
145</b><a name="0810222000274"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):
Mr. Haddrill, you have been in a minority in advocating that
the special resolution regime should be administered by the FSA, rather
than the Bank of England. Can you expand on why you think that should
be
so?</div><a name="0810222000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> Initially, we took that view because we
felt that, apart from the responsibility of the bank directors
themselves, the responsibility for ensuring that a bank was not going
into failure was the FSA&#146;s. We were concerned that the FSA would
be reluctant to hand over that responsibility to another institution,
and that if a special resolution regime or another mechanism were
needed, the FSA should be free within its own house to take that view,
and then to deal with the consequences of it&#151;the consequences
partly having been driven by its own actions in the run-up to
that&#151;so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>that responsibility and power were kept in the same place throughout the
process. The Government have clearly taken a different view, but we do
not feel strongly enough about it to continue to argue the
point.</div><a name="0810222000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
146</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000275"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> How do you respond to the view that since 1997, the
Bank of England has been more distant from the banking sector as a
whole, and that has been an adverse
development?</div><a name="0810222000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> I think that the Bank brings a great deal
to such issues, because it is in the market. It trades on its own
account, which gives it a perspective. In retrospect, I believe that it
is right that the Bank should be brought much more firmly into the
system and given a strong financial stability role within the new
tripartite
proposals.</div><a name="0810222000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have reservations about the financial stability committee being a sort
of subsidiary of the court, because we are not convinced that the court
is at the operational heart of the bank. It should be a very senior
committee at the top of the Bank and able to take effective decisions.
We have not seen the court operating in that
way.</div><a name="0810222000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
147</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000276"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I ask both the IMA and the ABI what are the
consequences, from your members&#146; perspective, of the abridgement
of property rights that the Bill sets out, and the way in which it can
disturb the normal ranking of creditors in the event of the SRR being
triggered?</div><a name="0810222000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> We have called for the introduction of the
SRR, and we have resisted getting rid of partial transfers. They are a
necessary power, as is the power to interfere with property rights if
required. For example, the Icelandic banks and Bradford &amp; Bingley
used partial transfers to move &#163;22.2 billion of retail deposits,
and that seems to have been an effective use. We have some
concern&#151;like the ABI, we are waiting for the secondary
legislation to come out and the banking liaison group to
work&#151;about what they mean in the other areas, and what will
actually happen to the cost of capital. At the moment, there is a range
of concerns, such as worry that security will be taken away and you
will be left only with liabilities, which is almost certainly unlawful
under European directives, but there may be instances&#151;we had
change of bond terms in Bradford &amp; Bingley&#151;when, if it is
not predictable and if we do not understand how the tripartite
authorities will use the powers, people will price conservatively, so
the cost of capital will go up. If you know which way a bond may be
affected by collapse, at least that can be priced in slightly more
efficiently. Again, to echo Stephen&#146;s comments, we await sight
of the code and the secondary legislation, which will be critical to
the
Bill.</div><a name="0810222000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
148</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000277"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Would you outline for us what the changes were to
Bradford &amp; Bingley&#146;s bond terms, so that we can understand
the sort of changes that could
happen?</div><a name="0810222000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> Yes. It may have been slightly less
controversial, although some of my firms would not agree with me. The
provision in the transfer order was, from memory, that for the
subordinated loans, dated and undated, the bondholders were not allowed
to treat the non-payment of principal as an event of default. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>Essentially, from the Treasury&#146;s point of view, it wanted to
ensure that subordinated creditors could not hold the new transferor,
or the old Bradford &amp; Bingley&#151;it still exists in
wind-down&#151;to ransom by saying that the transfer had triggered an
event of default and that, therefore, they were entitled to full
payment now rather than over
time.</div><a name="0810222000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
149</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000278"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Did your members who objected to that object in
principle or to the fact that they had lost that
right?</div><a name="0810222000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> A lot of it is that it is almost chance at the
moment whether you are a holder at the minute that such things occur.
There is no predictability. Over time, we will start to learn how
Government will use these measures, and you will therefore know, if you
have a subordinated bond, that the terms can be changed. If we are to
have those powers, it would be useful to see in the code when that will
happen and what might be the circumstances. In other words, perhaps it
would say, &#147;We will only ever change these provisions in so far
as it is necessary to ensure a transfer across, and the provisions we
would change are the following, and you would be entitled to
compensation,&#148; which the Bill does provide. That would start to
give certainty to the market, but at the moment, I think&#151;and
certainly last week&#151;Bradford and Bingley bonds are trading at
almost
nothing.</div><a name="0810222000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
150</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000279"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Almost at nothing?</div>
<a name="0810222000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> Yes. I think that there is a little bit of
payment for the interest that has accrued.</div>
<a name="0810222000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
151</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000280"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> What does that tell us about people&#146;s views
about those bonds being
repaid?</div><a name="0810222000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> Well, certainly, in the pricing last week,
when my firms wrote in, they did not expect to be
repaid.</div><a name="0810222000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
152</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000281"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Yet bondholders would expect those bonds to be paid
in full.</div>
<a name="0810222000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> Yes, but so much of this is about confidence.
What we are trying to do is engender confidence in the financial
system, and we therefore need to protect depositors, but that comes at
a cost. The important thing, we would say&#151;certainly for
Stephen&#146;s members, as our major institutional investors in this
country, and my firms as the asset managers&#151;is that of course
depositors should be protected, but that there is a cost. Pension
schemes and the savers of this country are invested in those banks. You
cannot have things without cost, and there will be cost. If bond terms
are changed and if equity raising is more expensive, that will impact
on the pension schemes and other savings vehicles, and that still comes
back to taxpayers. The question, therefore, is this: what do we need to
do sufficiently to get confidence in depositors, not because depositors
are always meritorious, as such, but because we need to secure
financial stability? That is not to be against depositors; it is to say
that with our other hats on, as the taxpayers, savers and pensioners of
this country, they are impacted by the transfer and the loss of value
that occurs from
that.</div><a name="0810222000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
153</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000282"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Do you think that the Bill reflects that tension
appropriately?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div><a name="0810222000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> We have done a lot of work, before and during
the summer, and the Government have done a lot of work to listen to the
whole industry about concerns. There are a couple of points to repeat,
one of which Stephen has made. There are fire sale concerns&#151;in
other words, let us just get rid of the deposit book as quickly as
possible to whoever will take it without regard to the value that
remains and the damage of that. Fire sale concerns are addressed by
some of the provisions on maximising value, but, again, this is about
confidence. Do we have confidence in the authorities to do that well
enough? There is a concern at the moment regarding those fire sale
concerns.</div><a name="0810222000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a need for various other safeguards to do with knowing
precisely which netting agreements, if any, are going to be affected.
That is why, as you might know, we have proposed what has now been
announced as the banking liaison group. My suggestion was that, not
only would the technicians in the industry work on the secondary
legislation, but that we would need to keep it up to date, because it
would be very easy to pass the Bill and the secondary legislation and
think that we had got it fixed. I assure you of one thing: the markets
will exploit any fissure and they will innovate. We therefore need to
keep things under review. That is our hope from the banking liaison
group.</div><a name="0810222000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="0810222000149"></a>

154</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000283"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Mr. Haddrill, you have described the
authorities&#146; consultation process as paying</div>
<a name="0810222000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only perfunctory
and box-ticking reference to the need to avoid interfering with
property rights in contravention of the Human Rights Act
1998.&#148;</div><a name="0810222000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the Bill any
better?</div><a name="0810222000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> I do not think that the Bill does enough on
protecting property rights, for some of the reasons that I
mentioned earlier. The reference to the Human Rights Act is all very
well, but gaining the confidence of the institutional shareholders
requires rather more specific protection of what they can reasonably
ask for. Some of the things that we have just mentioned are relevant,
in terms of maintaining value where possible, not transferring assets
through a partial transfer and eradicating the rights and values of
bondholders. All those things need to be sorted out, but we do not yet
know exactly how that will be
done.</div><a name="0810222000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
155</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000284"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> A comment was made about the financial

lack of total enthusiasm. What more would you wish to see of the

confident about
it?</div><a name="0810222000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> It is an extremely important part of the
architecture, and we are glad that it is being established, but it
needs to be as important a body within the Bank as the Monetary Policy
Committee. However, it does not appear to us that it is being
established in that way. It looks to have been established as a
sub-committee of the court, and I do not really understand why that
should be
case.</div><a name="0810222000154"></a>

as proposed under the SRR, and ability to exercise the powers, would
mean that it would have to resource up and have the people and skills
there to fulfil that. Whatever role it did have, therefore, the FSC
would have much more weight than you might expect even
now.</div><a name="0810222000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
159</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000288"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Mr. Sears, I want to return to your
remarks about Bradford &amp; Bingley towards which the Government took
an approach different from that taken towards the other banks.
Basically, the good bits were got rid of and sent to Santander, and the
bondholders were left with a huge loss. Under normal circumstances,
would the bondholders have ranked above or level with the deposit
takers?</div><a name="0810222000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> I think that there is a mix, but that some
would have come after the creditors, who of course were the depositors
and who rank with other creditors. In terms of the good and bad bits,
it is a bit more that if you move a deposit book, as they did, of
&#163;14 billion, or &#163;17 billion with the top-up, and move
with it the same value of assets&#151;in other words, if it is one
for one&#151;how the rump ends up depends on whether it was solvent
on an asset and liability basis. If, of course, it was not solvent on
that basis, you will necessarily worsen the position, because those
people have got pound for pound. But that is the world that we are in
at the moment. We need to ensure and secure financial stability. Some
say, &#147;Should depositors have precedence?&#148; My view is that
the Government have sought to preserve creditor rights, through
compensation for those who are worse off by reason of the
transfer&#151;there are safeguards in the Bill for that&#151;but
they have in practice ensured depositor precedence. I think that that
is quite neat, although it is expensive and tricky to work out the
impacts on the Bank. We still have much work to do on
that&#151;Stephen mentioned the secondary legislation. However, it is
a way of securing precedence, at a time of crisis, while ensuring that
they rank equally at the moment of a going
concern.</div>

160</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000289"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> On that last point, could the bondholders expect
compensation?</div><a name="0810222000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Adrian
Coles:</b></i> Yes. A compensation order is to be made, but I
do not think that it has been tabled yet. However, the Government say
that an order is to be made, as they did on Northern Rock. Again, that
throws us back to confidence in the valuation&#151;when will it come
in? There is another difficulty. If you are a bondholder and you expect
to receive compensation&#151;maybe it comes in a
year&#146;s time&#151;what if that bond is underlying a pension
scheme that is paying out annuities and all that in the meanwhile? So
there are lots of real effects for the investors and savers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div><a name="0810222000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> I think that the test really is whether or
not, in a partial transfer, the creditors generally and particularly
the bondholders will be worse off than if it was done as an entirety. I
would like to see some assurance that things will be managed so that
that does not happen.</div>
<a name="0810222000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
161</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000290"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am supposed to be asking about the deposit
protection fund. In the USA and other countries, it is funded in
advance. Here, we have a pay-as-you-go system, or actually a
pay-afterwards system. Would it be practical to have a pre-funded
scheme?</div><a name="0810222000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Haddrill:</b></i> It is clearly possible to have a pre-funded
scheme. We are nervous about it in relation to banking, for the reasons
that were largely given at the previous session, and we totally reject
it in relation to insurance. Of course, the FSCS at the moment operates
a single scheme, with cross-subsidy between different types of sector.
We are worried about it being introduced in banking and it then being
applied in some way to insurance.</div>
<a name="0810222000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
that we do not like a pre-funded scheme in relation to insurance is
that you do not need it in insurance, because the payments you make are
spread over a very long period, as people make claims. You do not get a
run with a queue outside the insurance company as the annuities fall
due, and so on and so on. So you do not need to prepare in advance for
it. I think that it should be clear in the Bill that, if there is
pre-funding, it should be limited to bank deposit protection and not
applied across the other parts of the financial services
sector.</div>
<a name="0810222000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
162</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000291"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> We have seen the FSCS compensation limit go to
&#163;50,000, and the European Commissioner has been talking about a
minimum of €100,000. Moral hazard has been discussed quite
extensively in the run-up to this legislation and there are two
possible moral hazards here. One is moral hazard among the providers,
on the basis that there is a collective insurance here in which there
may be an incentive for poor practice by one of the providers, because
they will not have to bear the total consequence of their foolishness.
The other is among depositors, which assumes that people race to the
best offer without proper regard for any risk analysis. However, that
of course is based on an assumption that people have the tools to work
out these things for themselves anyway.</div>
<a name="0810222000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not
heard from the two wingers in this four-man formation. Can we hear a
little bit from them, particularly on the second possible hazard, which
is the hazard of depositors racing to the top
rates?</div><a name="0810222000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Teresa
Perchard:</b></i> This is the main area of the Bill where
both Which? and Citizens Advice might have some input. However, it
needs to be looked at in the context of the introduction of a special
resolution regime, because, as I understand it, that is designed to
ensure that calls on the FSCS rarely happen, as it is designed to
ensure that somebody takes on the business, rather than letting it go
down, so that people have to queue up to get their money back on a
cheque and open an account with somebody else. That would be the
nightmare scenario.</div>
<a name="0810222000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
one might look at things like pre-funding in the context of having a
special resolution regime. We have not expressed any view on the
pre-funding proposition, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>but we are interested in what happens with the compensation scheme. The
appearance of unlimited compensation for Icelandic savers, with varying
limits across Europe, means that we now need to rethink the
&#163;50,000 limit, although very few citizens advice bureau clients
will have more than &#163;50,000.</div>
<a name="0810222000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you
suggested, it is quite brave to assume that consumers go shopping for
somewhere to put their savings safely, taking with them the sheet I
have before me from the Martin Lewis site, which shows exactly who owns
who. The &#163;50,000 limit applies to a single registered
institution. There is a nice little string of the AA, the Bank of
Scotland, Birmingham Midshires, Saga, Halifax and Intelligent Finance,
which are all in one group and have now been swept up into another
conglomerate. You might have safely tucked away little bits of money up
to the &#163;50,000 limit in different institutions and find that
while you thought you were doing the right thing, you were actually
trading with just one entity. The practice of having a limit works only
if institutions that are taking people&#146;s savings say,
&#147;Oh, you&#146;ve exceeded the protected limit. We suggest that
you put the excess with another institution that is not in our
group.&#148;</div><a name="0810222000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
163</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000292"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> That is a slightly counter-intuitive piece of
advice.</div><a name="0810222000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Teresa
Perchard:</b></i> Absolutely. There has been a lot of debate
about whether the consumer should take some risk. It has been said that
consumers who simply want somewhere safe to put their accumulated
savings should take some risk. If no one will tell them where they can
keep their money safely, other than under the bed, it is difficult to
operate a limit. That is particularly true when limits vary across
Europe. It has become confusing for
consumers.</div><a name="0810222000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Doug
Taylor:</b></i> I am not convinced that moral hazard really
applies in the area of consumers putting money into simple personal
accounts or savings products. In reality, the different interest rates
on savings accounts are not dramatic. Individual consumers are chasing
the best that they can get. I do not think that they are being reckless
in placing their money in savings accounts. Indeed, prior to recent
events with Northern Rock, it would have been hard to find a consumer
who did not think that in putting money into a high street savings
account, they were putting it into something absolutely solid. I do not
think that moral hazard issues that apply in areas of investment apply
to personal accounts and savings. I do not think that consumers have
acted recklessly in this
area.</div><a name="0810222000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the ability of consumers to navigate through the system and decide on a
high street bank, I do not think they are in a position to carry out
due diligence in terms of the liquidity and solvency of the big names.
They assume that the regulatory system will do that for them. When that
fails, a problem arises. At the end of the day the consumer will meet
the bill, either as customer or taxpayer. I hope that I have answered
your question on moral
hazard.</div><a name="0810222000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
164</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000293"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> There was the other element of the moral hazard
among providers. If you have a comprehensive insurance scheme paid for
not on a risk basis, but simply on volume activity, it can encourage
poor behaviour among some providers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="0810222000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> That is an interesting point whether you
support pre-funding or not. Perhaps pre-funding is one of those things
that should be axiomatic. It is seen as a cost of doing business. At
the moment, the compensation scheme is the cost of someone else doing
business. The point you make about the risk basis for collecting the
money is very interesting. Finding the right proxy for banks to reflect
that, whether it is pre or post-default, is an interesting
issue.</div><a name="0810222000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
165</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000294"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> May I clarify what you have said? In connection with
Citizens Advice and Which? we are talking about small depositors
because those are the people whom those organisations
characteristically see when they have a problem. Two different concepts
have emerged so far. We were told by the banks in this morning&#146;s
sitting that people are moving their accounts around quite cleverly. We
were told that they are trying to guess the market and put their
savings in safe places and are consulting the internet and looking at
charts such as the one you brandished a few moments ago. There is the
other perception that they are completely baffled by the system and
that they are likely to use products in Iceland, particularly when
ratings agencies say that it is perfectly safe to do so. Those are two
diametric images of the small depositor. Which do you think is the most
appropriate for legislators to take into
account?</div><a name="0810222000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Teresa
Perchard:</b></i> Most of the policy is played out in the
regulations on the scheme, and the legislation is changing the scheme
to provide more flexibility around what it does, what the compensation
is used for, to fund the special resolution regime or to invest it
partly and have flows of money in and out of the Bank of England. It
seems that we can make changes to the compensation limit quite easily
without
legislation.</div><a name="0810222000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
166</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000295"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> But with no blanket
guarantee?</div><a name="0810222000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Teresa
Perchard:</b></i> Well, most CAB clients would be astonished
to have savings of &#163;50,000, while some would be astonished to
have &#163;500. The changes to the scheme protect many of the people
whom my organisation works with, but we are struck by the fact that
many people are now quite anxious about getting it right. Much media
coverage over the past year has created such high anxiety even about
putting money into a simple savings account that people are unsure
what to do.</div>
<a name="0810222000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
really about who owes who and when the limit actually kicks in. If
there is a limit, and it applies to a business, not an individual brand
with which a customer thinks they are trading, the brands that are
trading with their customers need to tell them when they have exceeded
the protected limit. I am not aware of financial institutions doing
that as a matter of course. Caveat emptor. The consumers cannot know
what they are not being told by the
supplier.</div><a name="0810222000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
167</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000296"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> But is it not worse than that? Even when the bank is
taken into the safe hands of the state, the small investor is often the
last person to find out exactly what has happened. I was contacted by
constituents who were Lloyds TSB customers, so dutifully I went on to
the Lloyds TSB website to see what it was saying, the gist of which
was, &#147;Watch this space&#148;. I did not think 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>that that was wholly satisfactory. A pensioner depending on a limited
amount of interest from a savings account at Lloyds TSB would
presumably take a similar view that, whatever arrangements were made
when taking banks into partial state control or whatever salvation is
offered to banks, the small investor needs to be told up
front.</div><a name="0810222000185"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Teresa
Perchard:</b></i> In our response to the Treasury
consultation, we highlighted the need for good communication with
people who rely on tax credit payments and benefit payments into their
bank accounts. Those people rely on a very small amount of income
coming in, so they have to budget weekly. If they have to open a new
account elsewhere, disruption to that income flow will cause debts. In
any situation in which a bank is failing and people can no longer gain
access to their money, it is those people on the lowest incomes who are
drawing on it frequently who will be hit very
hard.</div><a name="0810222000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
whole compensation scheme needs to be geared around not just a
leisurely way to send out cheques to people, but a way to maintain
payments in and out of the account. That is why the special resolution
regime is actually capable of offering consumers in that situation more
stability than a beefed-up Financial Services Compensation Scheme. It
looks to ensure that banking continues by taking control of the bank
services, so that customers&#146; accounts are not disrupted. Making
sure that it does not happen or that bank account services are managed
is in the better interests of consumers than fixing up a compensation
scheme, although that is needed as an absolute
backdrop.</div><a name="0810222000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
168</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000297"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> My last question is to Mr. Taylor. What
changes in the Financial Services Compensation Scheme are the most
important to restore the public&#146;s confidence in the safety of
their deposits?</div>
<a name="0810222000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Doug
Taylor:</b></i> May I preface my remarks by referring to a
point that was raised
earlier?</div><a name="0810222000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the financial capability of consumers in the UK, we can look
no further than the FSA&#146;s baseline study, which showed that 40
per cent. of consumers with an equity ISA did not realise that it would
be affected by movements in stocks and shares, and 16 per cent. of
people with a cash ISA thought that it could be affected by movements
in stocks and shares. I make that point simply to illustrate that, to
establish something that consumers can understand, we need to start
from where consumers are rather than where we might like them to be.
Indeed, we would like to see consumers more active in using the market
to get a better deal and to create a highly competitive financial
services world but, where we stand at the moment, the level of
understanding is perhaps lower than we would like it to
be.</div><a name="0810222000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
169</b><b class="B"><a name="0810222000298"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> May I stop you there? Whose job is it to address
that low level of financial literacy? Is it the institutions
themselves, the state, or
who?</div><a name="0810222000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Doug
Taylor:</b></i> The FSA is now doing a considerable amount of
work on the issue of financial capability, and the Thoresen review,
which reported recently and which dealt with the creation of an advice
network to help people on the first rung of understanding, is
important. Work is being done in schools by organisations such as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>the Personal Finance Education Group. A whole series of actions can take
place, and I think that the answer to the question is that it is the
responsibility of a large number of people to try to improve
capability.</div><a name="0810222000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should understand that it will take some considerable time before
people&#146;s capability moves up significantly. Therefore, in the
short to medium term, we need to do whatever we can to make information
and the way that people interact with it as simple as
possible.</div><a name="0810222000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have raised a number of issues that we think would help the
compensation scheme. One of them, which has already been referred to by
Teresa, is the question of whether the scheme works on the basis of a
brand or a licence. It is difficult to believe that consumers can
navigate their way through to where an individual limit will end, given
that a number of what they might see as separate brands operate under
the same licence. Teresa illustrated that with the example of AA, Saga
and HBOS, which are all part of the same stable. Issues around
consumers&#146; understanding need to be addressed, and we strongly
believe that any limit should be related to brand. That would allow
consumers at least to have a view, if they were getting to the limit,
of where it
was.</div><a name="0810222000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also an issue related to temporary high balances. For example, if
someone were to sell a house or receive a legacy, they could have a sum
of money in an account for a short time, and it would be unfortunate if
that happened to coincide with a bank failure. Something needs to be
done in that area. We have advocated that institutions should look to
the wholesale market to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>secure insurance, and that the FSA should create a rule so that that
happens for particular areas such as temporary
balances.</div><a name="0810222000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third issue is to do with whether payments should be gross or net. We
strongly believe that it is better to make payments gross rather than
net. A net payment could potentially wipe out the liquidity of the
consumer immediately. That would mean that if they had planned anything
from a home improvement to paying university fees, they would find
themselves bereft of cash. I listened to the session this morning, and
I concur that paying gross would also help in speeding up any
compensation payments. It would make it simpler for financial
institutions to calculate the
amount.</div><a name="0810222000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fourth and final issue is that of banks that are passported into the UK
system, and what should be done about them. We believe that any bank
not currently authorised and regulated in the UK should be, so that
consumers can have confidence that the system operates across the board
in the UK. Indeed, that might require consideration of whether that
part of the scheme should be pre-funded so that any default would not
eventually fall on the UK
taxpayer.</div><a name="0810222000197"></a>
