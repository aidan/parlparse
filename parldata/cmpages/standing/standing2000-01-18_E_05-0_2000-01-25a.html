<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 133, in page 4, line 10, leave out paragraph (a).—[Mr. Portillo.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 142, in page 4, line 40, leave out paragraph (a).
<P>
No. 144, in page 5, line 5, leave out `the Secretary of State or'.
<P>
No. 145, in page 5, line 5, leave out from `CAA' to end of line 6.
<P>
No. 158, in clause 10, page 6, line 27, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
No. 171, in clause 11, page 7, line 15, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
No. 172, in clause 12, page 8, line 31, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Portillo </B>(Kensington and Chelsea): I am sorry that the red-tie brigade sitting below the Gangway on the Labour side of the Committee are absent at present, as they enliven our proceedings. Apparently, they wear the uniform of the red tie to show that they have a little streak of independence from the jack-boot tendency on the upper reaches of the Government Benches. I see one Labour Member, clad, as I predicted, in a red tie entering the Room.
<P>
I was complaining before our lunch break that the Government have included in the Bill powers that they now tell us are to be used in extremis and as a long-stop safeguard. The Bill does not mention that the measures are to be used in such a way. They are simply in the Bill, to be used at any time, as the Secretary of State of the day sees fit.
<P>
In many situations, one thinks of belt and braces as being a wise and commendable measure when special care is needed to ensure that additional supports are in place, but that is not a good thing in legislation. When a Government introduce bits and pieces of proposals that they have difficulty in explaining, which they say they will use only in extremis or as a long-stop safeguard, it smacks to me of laziness, or even of a certain decadence in the drafting of the Bill. It means that elements of the Bill have been put in rather casually, which has dangerous implications.
<P>
The Minister has not dealt satisfactorily with a matter that I raised earlier. The Bill contains a provision for the Secretary of State to veto a decision taken by the Civil Aviation Authority, as regulator, to which the licensee has agreed. Why should the Secretary of State want to overrule his own regulator? What sort of message does that send to the regulator and the regulated, or the travelling public, about the Bill's arrangements? The Minister's explanations were not convincing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): I speak as a member of the red-tie brigade. Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that there is a distinction between the Secretary of State intervening when a change of licence agreement is negotiated between the CAA and the licensee, and interference with the day-to-day management of an existing licence within its terms? The right hon. Gentleman is getting confused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I did not think that I was getting confused. In the spirit of what I said about the hon. Gentleman earlier, that is not a bad argument, as far as it goes. It has a vestige of sense although I do not entirely accept it. As far as I know, it is not the argument that the Government have advanced. Yes, there is some difference, but not a difference of principle, because the Secretary of State will be substituting his judgment for that of the regulator, especially as the Minister told us that the Secretary of State would have no fuuther role as licensor after he had granted the first licence.
<P>
Before the hon. Gentleman intervened, I was about to say that I found some of the Minister's examples extremely unconvincing. He said that in the interests of competition, there might be a suggestion that the air traffic control of helicopters in the North sea—[HON. MEMBERS: ``Over.'']—I think that colloquially one talks about in the North sea. The Minister said that control of helicopters over the North sea—the pedantic tendency of Labour Members must be satisfied—might be carried out by a new provider. However, he could decide that that function is so important that responsibility for it should not be transferred to a new provider.
<P>
That is not what the Bill is about; it is about prohibiting a reference to the Competition Commission. When the Competition Commission makes a recommendation, the Secretary of State—the Government as a whole, for that matter—may not accept it if he believes that, whatever the competition arguments might be, there are other more important arguments. That is routine. No Government are bound to accept the recommendations of the Competition Commission.
<P>
The Minister argued that because the final outcome of a reference might be an unwelcome recommendation, that was a good enough reason for the Secretary of State to ban it. I do not agree. The Government should be bold enough to allow the Competition Commission to do its work. If, when it has made a recommendation within its narrow remit of considering competition policy, the Government believe that broader objectives of public policy require the recommendation to be set aside on competition grounds, they can do so. However, it is extraordinary that they should make up their mind about such issues in advance and ban the reference to the Competition Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): There is an extra conundrum. The Competition Commission might make a recommendation to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on which the Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions reaches a different conclusion. That has happened with planning. The solution is to allow the Competition Commission to do its work and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to come to his own conclusions. If necessary, the Prime Minister or a Cabinet Committee could decide between the two conclusions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I agree, but I get hot under the collar when the Government attempt to explain their legislation in terms that do not hold water. To say, ``We are worried about the national interest. Therefore, we are going to take the power to ban references to the Competition Commission'', is a spurious argument.
<P>
As for public interest, the Minister said that he would defer to me as a former Secretary of State for Defence. That would be welcome—I have no objection to such an arrangement. However, as a former Secretary of State for Defence, I cannot imagine what matters of national security he is worried about. The Government are saying that because an issue might arise in the report of the Competition Commission that touches on national security, they should have the power to exclude paragraphs. What exposes the Minister's desperation and the paucity of his argument is that the Bill reads not national, but ``public interest''. The contention that a national security issue might arise in a Competition Commission report is far fetched, but at least I would understand the argument. However, the Bill says ``public interest'', which is a much broader category.
<P>
The Minister has hit the panic button. In his desperation to explain what was meant by public interest, he reached for the first thing that came to mind, which was national security interest—a completely different kettle of fish. Either the Government do not know why the provision has been drafted as it has, or the term ``public interest'' has been used where the term ``national security interest'' should have been used. Either way, matters are highly unsatisfactory. Will the Minister, who has had time to reflect over lunch, clear up those points?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> It is a great pleasure to give way to the lucid hon. Member for Croydon, Central.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is very generous of the right hon. Gentleman. Does he accept that the expression ``public interest'' already exists in competition law and that the clause, with reference to the Competition Commission, has meaning within the tight parameters of competition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Absolutely, I accept that, but we have not been able to identify how such a matter might arise in a report of the Competition Commission. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comment. He is right to point out that we are dealing with a term of art that exists within competition legislation. However, that only reinforces my point that when the Minister set off down the highways and byways of the national security interest he was way off the mark. That matter is not in the Bill. It is not what the Bill is about. We need an explanation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the Minister wish to respond?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I think that I should. Although the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) did not refer to the questions that he put to me before lunch, they are lively in my recollection and I want to begin by responding to them. He asked, first, about the airspace for which an additional licence might be issued, whether to National Air Traffic Services or another provider. He asked me to confirm that I had in mind airspace for which the United Kingdom might accept responsibility under an international agreement. That is correct. He also asked whether that would probably be international airspace. Again, that is correct.
<P>
Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman asked me to confirm that we do not intend to license National Air Traffic Services to provide air traffic control at airports and that it would need to operate under an exemption order to do that. That is also correct. Thirdly, he challenged me about my comment that once the initial licence was issued the Secretary of State would play no further role in licensing.
<P>
Perhaps I could clarify that matter. The Secretary of State would have no further role as licence guarantor, nor in the enforcement of licence conditions, but he would have the backstop powers that we have been discussing with reference to licence modifications and references to the Competition Commission. It may be of interest to the Committee to know that the Railways Act 1993 and the Electricity Act 1989 both permit a reference to the commission to be vetoed by the Secretary of State, as does the Fair Trading Act 1973 with respect to monopoly references.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman described the backstop provisions as evidence of laziness, decadence, casualness and even danger. However, it is normal to include such provisions in Bills of this sort. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman considers helicopters in or over the North sea an unlikely example. My reference to national security may well also strike him as unlikely. However, that is the point. We are thinking about extreme circumstances, which are unlikely to be invoked. It is right for the Secretary of State to have those backstop powers. They have been included in many other measures and we are right to include them now.

<P>

<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I am deeply dissatisfied with parts of that answer. My point about helicopters was not whether the example was improbable, but that it was not right for the Government to take a view about not allowing a reference to the Competition Commission in a case where they judged that they might not agree with the Commission's recommendation. It is most unfortunate if we are to shut down agencies before they have had chance to comment on an issue. The Minister has not offered any explanation of why he wants to introduce the concept of security interests when the Bill clearly refers to public interests, which is quite different.
<P>
However, I detect that the Minister has probably had enough. We should let him take his towel and sit for a while in the corner of the ring before we subject him to any more punishment. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 4, line 18, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) must specify the period for which the licence is to be valid;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 6 sets out many terms and conditions that would apply to any normal licence, but one would expect most normal applications, whether for a fishing licence or for an air traffic service, to specify a time period. The draft licence sets out that a 30-year licence is likely, with a 10-year notice period for giving up or revoking the licence and a minimum of 20 years before that can happen In effect, that is a 30-year licence. Many of the Bill's provisions become clearer if they are considered in the light of that time span. When I first read the Bill, I thought that a licence would be granted for five or 10 years. I did not understand why so many checks, balances and other mechanisms had been included, especially relating to competition, until I realised that licences would be granted for a much longer time. As was said in this morning's debate, if the licence is for 30 years—especially if the first licence is granted by the Secretary of State—it could mean that it is 30 years or longer before the Civil Aviation Authority gets round to issuing a licence itself.
<P>
The Bill provides that the CAA must keep a register, which will contain the licence and any variation of it. On my first reading of the Bill, I thought that that would be a small, simple document, but I am beginning to think that it will be a large and growing document with attachments, ``Post-Its'' and goodness knows what else added as time goes by. It is inevitable that there will be a lot of changes in 30 years.
<P>
We need a much clearer idea about the Government's thinking. There are certain conflicts between economic regulation and best price. Often, if one sets a longer licence period, it affects the price that one is likely to receive from a strategic partner because there is much greater certainty about the period for which the licence is likely to run. Thirty years is a considerable length of time. We need to know whether the Government have decided on a 30-year period because of the long-term nature of the investment in the industry or because they are anxious to get the best price from the strategic partner and a longer licence will inevitably result in a better price.
<P>
Set against that issue are concerns about economic regulation. If the licence period were much shorter, so that the licence had to be renewed on a five or 10-year basis, it would produce a more rigorous regime, even with all the checks, balances and modifications in the Bill. If the licence extends over a 30-year period, 20 years will have to elapse before one can even think of revoking the licence and giving 10 years' notice. Ten years is probably the equivalent of two and a half Governments. I could not bear to think about how many Governments we could go through in 30 years. We would like the Minister to give us the thinking on having a 30-year period rather than a shorter one.
<P>
Why has the period for the ending of a licence been set at 10 years? That would seem a considerable period if one were dissatisfied with the licensee's service. There is no alternative arrangement aside from the emergency provision for the Secretary of State to take over in a problem such as a bankruptcy. We need answers. The only way to have a nice 10-year period would be if, looking 10 years ahead, the Government thought that there would be a treaty or policy change. However, I cannot see why a Government dissatisfied with the delivery of air traffic control services should decide to give notice to the company and yet sit for 10 years and allow it to work the notice.
<P>
We must be given some idea of the Government's thinking on the 10-year period. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) said earlier, the assets of a commercial television company or railway company that lost its licence would be picked up—the principal buyer would take over the system. Does a 10-„year period have implications for safety and investment, or will parts of the licence and associated agreements ensure that a company given 10 years' notice to surrender its licence carries out its duties to the highest expected standards?
<P>
We are concerned that the provisions will have to be amended because of the long period proposed. Harold Wilson said that a week was a long time in politics; 30 years is a considerable period. Looking around me, I wonder how many hon. Members will be here in 30 years' time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> My hon. Friend says that he will be.
<P>
We must have an idea, especially, of why there should be a 10-year period if the CAA wanted to revoke a licence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I share my hon. Friend's concerns about the duration of a licence and about the length of notice required before the termination of a licence. It seemed odd to hear from the Government this morning that the periods of 20 years for the licence and 10 years for the notice were not yet written in stone but were benchmarks. I think that he said they had not settled on a final number.
<P>
It seems strange, from my experience of the City of London, that such a sale of an asset for an enormous price—the explanatory memorandum to the Finance Act 1999 said that it sought £75 million—is being considered. The Minister for Housing and Planning looks puzzled. I ask him to forgive me if I have made an error.
<P>
The City of London will be asked to stump up a significant sum towards the privatisation. The Government might ask my erstwhile City colleagues to buy the asset. However, the price that they would be prepared to pay would be greatly affected unless they were told for how long they could have it. The longer the licence, the higher the likely price. The Labour party accepted the principle in discussions on the railway companies' franchises—they said that the franchises that we issued at the time of railway privatisation were too short and that they should be longer to achieve better investment in the rail infrastructure.
<P>
It could be argued that the same situation applies here and that the City would pay a higher price for a longer licence if it knew that it would benefit from the profit flow from air traffic services for a longer period. Licences should be granted for as long as possible. Twenty years is an arbitrary figure; we could reasonably argue in favour of an indefinite licence. The Secretary of State could say, ``This licence is indefinite, but here are the notice conditions under which it will be taken from you''. If he did that, he would maximise the price of the licence.
<P>
There are two points to make about the notice period. If the licence is granted for as long as possible, the notice period should be as short as possible. The operator would be kept on his toes. The Secretary of State could say, ``You can have the licence more or less indefinitely, but if you don't achieve the high standards of safety that we demand, we may remove your licence at relatively short notice''. The notice period should be shortened and the licence period lengthened.
<P>
There is another argument in favour of shortening the notice period. If a company is given 10 years' notice that the licence will be withdrawn, it could have catastrophic effects on morale in the company, and possibly even on safety. The company knows that in 10 years from now it will be out of business. The Government will have taken the licence away and will give their sweeties to somebody else. The company is hardly likely to strive to maximise the benefit to the nation and the travelling public during that remaining 10-year period. There is an awkward balance, the length of time is wrong for both the licence and the notice. In considering how to reply to the debate, the Minister might like to give us some idea of how he came up with those benchmarks. What lies behind his thinking? Is he likely to change his mind substantially when the licence is issued?
<P>
It occurred to me that the Bill has been drafted in this way for the wrong reasons. The Government appear to be envisaging one company applying for the licence. If it is then withdrawn, it will wind the business down, sack its employees, sell its equipment and give up the business, and another company will start to employ people and buy new equipment, so that in 10 years' time it can take over the licence of which the first company is being deprived. However, as my hon. Friends have said, that is extremely unlikely. It is more likely that precisely the same machinery will be in place in Swanwick and Prestwick and precisely the same people will operate it. The procedures and everything else will be identical and all that will change are the managers. There will be a small change in the white-collar, top end of the business; new managers will come in and new business practices will be brought to bear. If there is such a small change in the management of the company, the notice period could be extremely short. From the point of view of keeping the company on its toes, an extremely short notice period could have advantages.
<P>
What is the Government's thinking behind the drafting on both the length of the licences and the notice period? There seems to have been some slightly wrong thinking. I noted the Minister for Housing and Planning shaking his head. I look forward to his clarification. It is important for the Government to say precisely how long the licence and the notice period should be.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I was about to conclude, but as I enjoy the interventions of the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies), I shall happily give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the income to the Government from, say, two periods of 15 years might be more than one period of 30 years? Does he agree that the unfortunate wording in the amendment, which states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must specify the period for which the licence is to be valid''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
implies that each applicant must invent his or her own length of application? Perhaps the amendment should say that the Government should determine the period. I think that that was the intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> On the hon. Gentleman's first point, I am not certain that the City of London or other investors work in quite the way he describes. I am not clear why one would maximise the amount of money raised for the sale by making it two short periods rather than a long one. My experience is the contrary. In a full-scale proper privatisation a company can be told, ``We are selling this to you. You may now make a profit out of it and will earn dividends for your life-time, your children's life-time and all time to come.'' The price that the company would be willing to pay would be higher. However, if the licence can be taken away after 15 years, I suspect that the price would be significantly lower. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's point: twice 15 does not equal 30; 30 equals significantly more than twice 15.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The precise wording of the amendment might need to be changed. It is obviously a probing amendment. Our purpose was to seek the Government's reasoning for the length of the licence, so I do not want to get into a semantic argument about the wording. However, the Government should now square up and explain why they chose 30 years as the period for the draft licence: if that is not to be the final period, what will be? Most important, they must explain the thinking behind their choice of licence and period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): The hon. Gentleman touched on an important point, but it was not expanded as I would have liked. We debated in an earlier sitting how much money the Government expect to receive from the part-privatisation, and members of the Committee will recall the confusion about that. The explanatory notes suggested £350 million, but the debt still owed by National Air Traffic Services had to be taken into account. There was then an amazing revelation that that figure was so badly wrong that another £300 million should be added to the likely proceeds.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) rightly made the point that the size of the proceeds would depend significantly on the period of the licence. Clearly, the Minister must explain what length of licence period was used to calculate the likely proceeds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The key point is that the Secretary of State issues the first licence. He is the main recipient of the value of the strategic partner's money. We have already heard that it has been used for transport schemes, so we must be careful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> We are all delighted to have heard another revelation about ring fencing the income. We must, however, know how much flexibility the Government have over the length of the licence. If their calculations demonstrate that the licence is to be for a much shorter—or even marginally shorter—period, it could have a marginal impact on the likely income accrued from the sale.
<P>
The nature of the sale is another issue. The Bill contains no details about the proposed sale of part of NATS to a strategic partner. It is unclear—it is not built into the Bill or in the draft licence—what will happen to the ownership of the capital equipment that will be required to run NATS. The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) alluded to that problem.
<P>
Under the previous Conservative Government, during the early days of privatisation within local government, capital equipment had to be handed over to the purchaser of the service. It became clear with experience that that led to several difficulties, not least the handing over of rubbish services to a private contractor at an agreed price. A few months later, the contractor put the price up, the council opposed it, and the contractor effectively said, ``What are you going to do about it, mate? We now possess the only dust carts in the area. You cannot take them back, so you cannot do anything about it.'' Local government thus had to become more sophisticated about moves towards privatisation.
<P>
A similar level of sophistication—though I was not happy with the details or even the fundamental principle behind it—is discernible in the Railways Act. Capital equipment was kept separate from the train operating companies. The rolling stock operating companies were to have control so that if the train operating companies defaulted, another organisation could come in, and the capital equipment—in this case the rolling stock—would be available. It is not clear what the Government intend to do with the capital equipment currently owned by NATS. If it is to be sold, that will have a bearing on both the amount of money that will be raised and the ability to change the nature of the contract at a later date.
<P>
What is the Minister's thinking in the light of the Government's consultation on the matter? As the Committee will be aware, the Government issued a consultation paper on the proposal, and subsequently published and deposited in the Library a report on the responses to public consultation. The length of the licence was referred to by many of those who responded. Perhaps not surprisingly, the report points out that users of the services tended to favour a shorter term for the licence, whereas potential investors favoured a longer period.
<P>
As the Government's report points out, two other issues were raised. I mentioned the first in an earlier intervention in which I rather tried your patience, Mr. Gale. The first point that respondents made was that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the licence term needed to be long enough for investors to earn an adequate return on their investment but not so long as to rule out effective competition when the licence came up for renewal''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That has, presumably, been very much in the Minister's and the Government's minds in determining that a 20-year-plus-10-year period shall be the preferred option. How does the balance of 20 years plus 10 years address that anxiety?
<P>
Perhaps more important was the other point raised in the consultation, to which we have heard no response. In their summary of the responses, the Government state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there was a risk that maintenance and investment might decline towards the end of the licensing period unless standards were built into the licence itself. A partial solution might be to compensate the licence holder for the residual value of such investments.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Committee would be interested to hear what further thoughts the Minister has and what plans he has to incorporate that suggestion either in the licence or in subsequent amendments to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I understand that the Government cannot be held to account for the figures in the licence—20 years and 10 years—because it is a draft, and the figures are only tentative. However, I should like to discuss the principle. Whether the Government are thinking of a notice period of 10, 8 or 12 years, they are thinking of a long one. The more I listen to the debate, the more I find such a suggestion bizarre. It is not realistic and it does not take account of what would happen in particular circumstances. If the Government decide or the Civil Aviation Authority decides to terminate a licence, the reaction—whether justified or not—of press and public will be that the service provider has in some way failed and is in some way inadequate. Given that reaction, an announcement cannot simply be made that the service provider will continue to do the job for another 10 years.
<P>
Labour Members may doubt what I am saying. Without straying out of order, let us imagine that in the near future the Government decide that Camelot will not continue to run the national lottery—an announcement that would attract a lot of public interest. Let us suppose that at the same time they said, ``We are dissatisfied with Camelot but we intend that it should go on running the lottery for the next 10 years until we bring in another operator.'' That rightly causes amusement on the Labour Benches because it is completely implausible. If the Government are thinking in terms of a long notice period, I am sure that they have got it absolutely wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> With Camelot, there are commercial and fund interests, but in the case of National Air Traffic Services we are talking about public safety, or at least the public's perception of their safety. If the licence is to be withdrawn, there must be a thought in the back of people's minds that travelling by air will no longer be quite so safe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I emphasise that there might not be any implications for safety and that that might not be in the Government's mind when they come to withdraw the licence, but my hon. Friend, being a politician, is right to deduce that the press and public would react with a suspicion that the person who was continuing to provide the service did not enjoy the Government's trust and that that lack of trust must extend even to their ability to operate the service safely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Is not the situation that the right hon. Gentleman describes exactly the same as when, for example, the licence for a train operating company comes to an end? The licence of Connex South Central is about to expire, and we must decide whether to renew it; how is that different?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> The whole spirit in which we entered into that railway legislation was that the public should expect changes in the companies operating the franchises. That was the most natural thing in the world, because we were interested in competition. As train services would be run by different people simultaneously in different parts of the country, there would be competition by comparison and, that being so, it should from time to time be allowed to resolve itself in actual competition for the renewal of the franchises. The example was already familiar to the British public through the franchising of independent television companies within ITV.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, Central will have noticed that the Bill is being introduced in a quite different spirit. We have been told today that the Secretary of State will issue one licence and then step aside; we do not expect there to be any more licensing for perhaps 30 years, or whatever period the Government may specify. In other words, the understanding is that in the provision of a monopoly service concerning almost exclusively safety and the management of air traffic, there is no expectation of frequent change and no different competitors constantly jostling for position behind the scenes and looking forward to the time when the franchise next comes up. It is not like that at all.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Given the right hon. Gentleman's previous argument, is not there a danger that if a company such as Connex South Central felt that competitors were better than it, public sentiment was not with it and its standards of consumer delivery were not sufficient, it might start disinvesting and risking public safety in the same way as he described with NATS? Is not that a structural problem that might also occur with the railways?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> First, I did not mention the argument about disinvesting, although some of my hon. Friends may have done so. As the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said, the rolling stock operating companies are evidence of a completely different set up in the railways which, as the hon. Gentleman generously argued, represents a higher level of sophistication.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, Central has brought me rather neatly to my second point, which is close to what the hon. Member for Bath said. The provisions suddenly throw into relief the fact that we do not know what the transfer terms will be for the passing of assets from one operator to another. That seems to be a central point. I turned to the licence expecting to find a condition on transfer terms, but I could not find it. I guess that it will be covered elsewhere, but it would be interesting to know where.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath made another good point. He said that the Government had promised to include a provision on compensation for investment by operators. Again, I cannot at first glance see where that lies within the licence, even though—if I heard the hon. Gentleman correctly—it was said that it would appear there.
<P>
Will the Government reconsider the 10-year notice period, which is in completely the wrong ball park? Also, simply in the spirit of inquiry, the Committee needs to understand where the terms relating to investment and transfer of assets will appear if they are not in the licence.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): This whole question of the licence period underlines the extremely ambitious nature of the Bill. It goes far beyond the immediate requirement of the challenge of transferring National Air Traffic Services to the private sector. The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), admitted that he does not envisage issuing any other licences in the foreseeable future and that this licence will to all intents and purposes stand for an indefinite period—a 10- or 30-year notice period, depending on the circumstances. Frankly, a 10-„year notice period could cover two Parliaments, and changes in technology, politics and international obligations could affect the structure of civil aviation regulation. We are creating an edifice that is unlikely to last. There should be a more practical way of approaching the term of the licence. It should be open ended, with reasonable notice each way to quit. There can be no conceivable possibility that either party would want to serve notice to quit without the agreement of the other party, so the setting up of a notice period seems artificial.
<P>
The drafters of the Bill seem to be much too ambitious about its scope, as we will discuss later. The priority must be to have a simple and transparent method of holding the provider of air traffic services to account for its performance. The term of the licence should be altogether simpler than that contained in the present draft.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I propose to respond with the spirit of transparency that characterised all my earlier responses. I appreciate that this is a probing amendment and many questions have been asked which I shall do my level best to answer.
<P>
I hope therefore that the hon. Member for Poole will not cavil excessively if I appear to be a little pedantic, but it is important that I explain why the amendment is unsatisfactory. It would require an applicant for a licence—not the granter of it—to specify the duration of the licence in his application.
<P>
I agree that it is likely that an applicant would want to state his preferred duration and might want a longer licence than the regulator thought appropriate, but since the decision rests with the regulator, as the licensing authority, I see no point in setting it down in statute that an application for a licence should so specify the desired duration.
<P>
Other important issues were raised during the debate. The hon. Member for Bath expressed concern about what happened to capital equipment during previous privatisations. However, the proposal is not a privatisation in the same sense as earlier ones. We shall invite a strategic partner to buy into the provider, so the question of disposing of capital equipment does not arise. For a total understanding, however, I should add that safety-net provisions will be made to allow for assets to be transferred to a new licensee—for example, in the event of a breach of duty—to ensure continuity of service. The hon. Gentleman will find the provisions for a special administration regime in clause 23 and succeeding clauses. That regime will be subject to the making of an appropriate order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Under-Secretary said that because the move is a part-privatisation, it is different from previous privatisation and that disposal of assets is therefore not relevant. I find that rather surprising, as the disposal of assets is covered in condition No. 5, on pages 14, 15 and 16. Although the disposal of assets is important, my question is about their ownership. My understanding—I hope that the Minister will confirm that I am right—is that, when the strategic partner buys into the part-privatised NATS, it will have a share in the ownership of the assets, and that that share will be paid for when it hands over the £650 million. That will lead to the problems that I described earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I honestly do not think that there is a problem. We are talking about a partnership in which the strategic partner will have a share of ownership. A proportion of the shares in the company, and of its assets, will accrue to the strategic partner as they would for a shareholder in any company; even a non-majority shareholder would own a proportion of the assets. It is not practical or normal to correspond the ownership of the proportion of the assets of a company to the number of shares held.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The order of this process is quite important. Will the licence be granted to the new NATS company before the shares are sold, or will the shares be sold before the licence is approved? In the latter case, will the strategic partner be in a position to renegotiate the licence? The Under-Secretary is confusing price with economic and safety regulation. Does he get my point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> To be honest, no; I do not entirely get the hon. Gentleman's point. It would help if he spelled it out further. If it is of any comfort to him, the disposal of the company, although intrinsic to the Bill, is not specifically raised by the amendment. Nor has it been raised in the debate, to which I hope to respond.
<P>
I turn to a subject that has received a great deal of attention in our debate: the length of the licence. As all members of the Committee know by now, the draft licence is based on a 30-year-period—but I emphasise that that is an illustrative period, with the similarly illustrative provision of a 10-year period of notice and with the proviso that notice may not be served, subject to the provisions on revocation, before 20 years from the issue of the licence have elapsed. If we go for a 30-„year licence, a 10-year period of notice would not necessarily be unreasonable. A proper period of notice would have to be given in such a major change, in order to allow the transition to the alternative provider.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea seemed to argue that there was almost a matter of unacceptable principle involved in the long notice period. However, the notice period that we envisage for illustrative purposes is somewhat shorter than in other privatisation models. For example, the period of indicative notice in the case of electricity privatisation was 25 years. How could the right hon. Gentleman argue, therefore, that there is impropriety in our illustrative period of 10 years?
<P>
Conservative Members have, reasonably, asked about the period of 30 years. It is a matter of balance and of judgment. Clearly, to be attractive to investors, we need to offer a long enough period of licence-holding. On the other hand, the period of a licence ought not to be so long as to create difficulties in enforcement, with the regulator effectively unable to take action against the licence-holder.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman's point about the regulator not being able to take effective action against default on a licence surely refers to the period of notice, not the length of the licence period? In other words, if the licence were for 100 years or 1,000 years, but the notice period were one year, the regulator would have an extraordinarily effective weapon to use in ensuring that the licence is carried out correctly. On the other hand, if the licence were for 10 years, but the notice period five years, the effectiveness of the regulator's intervention would be greatly weakened. He is making a point about the length not of the licence, but the notice period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We are a listening Government and we are listening seriously, as I shall spell out in due course. I am sure that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire is aware that, under schedule 3(2), there is always the power of revocation at 24 hours' notice. Indeed, the period of notice in extreme circumstances can be a mere 30 days as well, so I suppose that that latent threat hangs over a recalcitrant licence holder.
<P>
I return to the main point, which is whether 30 years is the right period. We are probably talking about a required investment of £1 billion over 10 years. Clearly, we need to build a long period into any licence to ensure that stakeholders should recoup their investments.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment in the light of my technical reservations to its wording. We have listened to the debate carefully, and we value the Opposition's views about the appropriate duration of the licence. Their proposals have ranged from 10 years to the indefinite period suggested by the hon. Member for North Essex. It would be helpful to have more coherent and considered advice from them on such matters, but we are eager to receive their advice. Perhaps they would like to write to me on this occasion.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We have heard that the licence can be revoked in 24 hours, 30 days, 10 years or 10 years after 20 years. The Minister and the hon. Member for Croydon, Central are correct that the amendment's wording is not right; we should have amended clause 5, missed the opportunity and so had to amend clause 6, but it was important to put our minds to the subject of the length of the licences.
<P>
In an intervention on the Minister, I tried to make the point that the period of the licence will inevitably affect the value of any shareholding. The licence is the form of economic regulation that the CAA will use on the new company. Is there a difficulty in the fact that the Secretary of State will grant the first licence and also sell the company? Will there be a strategic partner, a sale agreed, and then the negotiations for the licence regime, or will the licence be granted and the shares sold on the basis of the licence? Clearly, the price is important. Shareholders might buy into a company with a licence for 20 years or into one for which the licence has not been agreed and for which there can be negotiation. It may be sensible for strategic partners to negotiate.
<P>
As has been pointed out, the chairman of the CAA and the head of NATS said in evidence to the Select Committee that they would need £100 million investment a year. Clearly, the strategic partner will have to stump up its share of that investment. Will the regulatory regime begin after or before the sale? The length of time is a determinant factor and I wanted the Minister to give us some answers on that subject.
<P>
I shall refer to an earlier part of the debate on which the hon. Member for Bath spoke. This highly complex Bill does not set out how most of the procedure for the public-private partnership will occur, but is designed to set up the mechanism for it. The chronology of the process is important. NATS ceases to be part of the CAA, the licence is granted; when the strategic partner is involved, no doubt there will be negotiation. Stakeholder councils will be associated with that; it cannot be done completely, but it should be possible to set out clearly in a letter what will kick in. The public would have more confidence if the licence were granted before the shares were sold, not after, when there would be a commercial negotiation on the terms. That is why the debate is important. Perhaps the Minister will answer before I decide whether to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for returning to that important point. It is the purpose of the Committee to tease out such information. His proposal is absolutely right: it is sensible for the licence to be granted and its terms understood, because it will clearly affect the commercial value of the sale. I can reassure him and confirm his instincts in the matter.
<P>
The process will be as follows: first, the licence will be settled; secondly, it will be issued to NATS after discussion with the partner; thirdly, we shall proceed to the sale. That is exactly what the hon. Gentleman was advocating and it seems to be the sensible way to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister has been very clear, and I am grateful to him, but as I have been described as one as stupid as the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea, I am equally a bear with a similarly small-sized brain. Is the Minister telling the Committee that the licence will be awarded by the Secretary of State to an organisation whose membership is not known, as we will not know who the strategic partner is?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman poses the question as though he were operating in a vacuum. We know that NATS is a key element in the operation and will be the licence holder. As the process develops, the identity of the strategic partner will become apparent. In other words, there will be an element of simultaneity in the process, so that the licence will be issued to NATS with full public awareness of the likely identity of the strategic partner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister assure the Committee that the licence will not be issued until he has made public the identity of the preferred strategic partner? That would comfort us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am awaiting inspiration; I may have to undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman on this important matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Ministers need to think carefully about this point. It is extremely important to know whether the licence will be granted when the contractor is identified.
<P>
Given that the Bill envisages the possibility of awarding the licence on a second occasion to someone other than the first licence holder, what regime does the Minister believe will govern the transfer of the assets from one to the other? Is it to be a free sale? Is it to be a regulated sale? Is there to be a formula? What process does he envisage will be used to move the computers and everything else at the centre from the first to the second contractor?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That eventuality is a long way off. That responsibility would fall to the CAA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> These eventualities are indeed a long way off. If the Government are asking a private contractor to come in and, over a period of time, spend many billions of pounds, quite apart from the money that it will cost contractors to get involved in NATS in the first place, that is a relevant issue. It will not be postponed for ever and a day. When the Government seek bids, those bidding will want to know what regime will govern the recovery of their investment and initial outlay should they lose the licence after 20 or 30 years or any other period. The Government cannot just dismiss it as being a long way away because the implications may visit them shortly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I explained to the right hon. Gentleman that responsibility for that transaction will fall to the CAA. That was a crystal clear response. I suspect that we are beginning to dance on the head of the pin. This issue has been relevant to every preceding privatisation. It is not new. A provision along the lines that we have indicated was built into those privatisations. There is no case for me to pursue further hypothetical considerations along those lines, tempting though that might be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister owes it to the Committee to be a little more forthcoming. He perhaps has not understood the full strength of the question asked by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea. As I understand it, and it echoes the concern I expressed earlier, those who want to become strategic partners in NATS will have to lay out a considerable sum of money. The Minister estimates that it will cost about £650 million to get involved in NATS in the first place. Further investment will have to be made, as that is one of the key purposes of bringing partners in, to develop further NATS activities. They will wish to know exactly what is going to happen at the end of the contract period. They will need to know that before they sign up as the strategic partner. Surely the Minister accepts that they will not be prepared to wait for a possible 30 years before someone decides. That is why it is so important to know now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I feel that I have been a very forthcoming Minister. If the hon. Gentleman consults the record, he will find that I have answered his question precisely. As I have been extraordinarily generous in my response to the Committee, this would be a not inappropriate moment to terminate our discussions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> This has been a useful debate. The Government need to get clear in their mind the time scale for doing all these things. For the past 10 minutes, the Minister has been damned if he did and damned if he did not. I was concerned about the strategic partner perhaps influencing the licence, but other hon. Members voiced the opposite concern. The licence can be granted only when we know who the strategic partner is. The best word is choreography, or perhaps symmetry. A time scale is needed that reassures those of us who are concerned about safety and economic regulation as well as those who are concerned that a reputable company is willing to meet the Government's obligations for a decent air traffic service. That is an important point. Although the Minister has already been helpful, it would be even more helpful if he would write to us setting out exactly how that will work.
<P>
Other privatisations were different in that shareholdings were sold to hundreds of people. There have not been too many privatisations with only one, quite powerful, commercial interest as is the case with the strategic partner that is to take over management of the business—with the guarantees that the Government have included in the Bill for vetoes on certain matters. Thus, it is an important issue and the length of the licence will be a material factor. Is the Minister agreeing to write to us?
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I do not want in any way to criticise my hon. Friends on the Front Bench, but I fear that the Minister is taking fright and running for cover because they are pursuing these matters with such vigour. He is beginning to speak rather fast, take fewer interventions and wave his arms around more, as though the object of the game were to get to the end of the debate, but that is not the object of the game. We are holding the debate to elucidate the information that is important. If my hon. Friends could be a little less fierce with the Minister, he would feel a little less discomfited and perhaps more willing to say that these are important points and that, although he still does not have the answer, we have hours and hours ahead of us in Committee and we can return to them on another occasion. I am sorry if my hon. Friend the Member for Poole feels that that is an impertinent intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> No, I am pleased by my right hon. Friend's support. The key point is that unless we get a much clearer indication of how the system will operate than we have had even from this debate—from which we have learnt a great deal—we will return to the issue.
<P>
So much of the Bill is interlinked. Shortly we will deal with the licences. How and in what order these things are done is critical. As the hon. Member for Bath said, it is not entirely clear from the Bill how the public-private partnership will be set up. The licence has been helpful, but we need a few documents, including the licence holder's agreement and the stakeholder's agreement.

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> For the record, l did not suggest that it is not entirely clear how this sale is to proceed; I said that it is not at all clear.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, to expedite our proceedings over the next two months or so, I should like to make a couple of observations. First, interventions, whether from right hon. or hon. Gentlemen, are just that and not speeches, so I would be grateful if they could be contained to that—[HON. MEMBERS: ``Hear, hear.''] Secondly, and for those who shout, ``Hear, hear'', this ruling applies as much to those on the Back Benches as to those on the Front, I well understand that it is on occasion necessary to discuss with colleagues the finer points of the Bill and I appreciate that not everyone in the Room necessarily finds every word that is uttered as compelling as the Chairman. Our forebears, who designed this building with our comfort and facilitation in mind, provided Green Benches in the Corridor outside. If hon. Members on either side of the Committee want to hold private conversations, it would be helpful if they did so there, so that the Chairman can hear the hon. Member who has the Floor. That is a polite way of saying, please do not gossip on the Back Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 4, line 21, leave out paragraph (c).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 146, in page 5, line 7, leave out subsection (10).
<P>
[No. 152, in clause 7, page 5, line 17, after `payment', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for the recovery of or not exceeding the costs in relation to the licence of the grantor'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> As Government are thinking of having one licence—or perhaps a pact for 30 years—why is the licence fee so important? If hundreds or thousands of licences were involved, as with TV licences, the fee would be important, but it is likely that one licence will be granted for a long period. That is why we decided to strike out the provision. The Government are evidently unsure whether there will be a licence fee—hence ``(if any)'' in subsection (3)(c). That explains why we tabled the amendments.
<P>
On amendment No. 152, there may be a need to recover costs from the Civil Aviation Authority. When we first examined the Bill, we were worried about how the authority would recover those costs. I am partly reassured by the fact that page 35 of the draft licence deals with the payment of fees. Within that provision, the CAA would charge National Air Traffic Services for economic and safety regulation to recover its income. In that context, we again wondered why application fees for a licence granted only once every 30 years were relevant or appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I am sorry to return to the subject that I raised some clauses ago, but has the hon. Gentleman considered the implications for the taxpayer of striking out the fee, which provides revenue? Why on earth should the taxpayer incur the charges for a rising burden of costs and administration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The key point is that the CAA is the regulator and NATS, the successor company, is the regulated. Page 35 of the draft licence deals with the payment of fees and makes it clear that the CAA will charge the new company to cover economic regulation and enforcement of the licence, including elements intended to cover clause 64 of the Bill, which deals with airspace policy. In other words, the CAA will recover its income by charging the organisation. It does not make much difference—one way or another, the CAA will recover its income. There may be only one licence in 30 years, so why introduce a charging regime for the application fee? I repeat that the ``(if any)'' shows that the Government are not sure about it themselves. The regime will allow the CAA to recover its income from the company via the licence. It will recover its costs wherever they fall, which is why the provision for an application fee is superfluous. I may change my mind after hearing the Minister's explanation, but we shall see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> If I understand the hon. Gentleman's purpose, he wants to ensure that the grantor of a licence does not milk either the licence holder or anyone who aspires to be one. That is an admirable sentiment, but I am not convinced that his amendments would achieve his purpose.
<P>
The application fee is intended to allow the grantor of the licence to recover administrative costs in carrying out the necessary checks and investigations into the application. The Committee, users of air traffic services and the wider public have every right to expect an application for a licence to provide air traffic services to be thoroughly vetted before it is granted. The licence authority must ensure that a licence is granted only to a suitable person who is capable of providing services that the licence will authorise him to provide. The exercising of that due diligence will incur costs.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) forcefully made the point that the Secretary of State is funded by the taxpayer. The CAA is funded by the aviation industry. Neither the Secretary of State nor the CAA is in the business of making a profit, but the CAA is expected to cover its costs. The Secretary of State—under this Administration, at least—is expected to spend taxpayers' money with care. In the Government's view, the cost of detailed inquiries into an applicant's suitability falls not to the taxpayer or the aviation industry, but to the applicant, even though any cost incurred by a successful applicant will ultimately be included in his charges. Those charges will be regulated.
<P>
The application fee is not sufficiently significant to deter serious applicants, and we do not expect it to do so. However, it will help to deter frivolous and vexatious applications, just as—it might be argued—the deposit deters frivolous aspirants to Parliament. Where the Secretary of State or the CAA spend time considering applications from those who wish only to irritate or make a particular point, or whose conviction in their ability to run an air traffic control system is somewhat wide of the mark, the cost incurred should fall to the applicant himself, not the taxpayer or the aviation industry.
<P>
I turn to the licence fee proper. I agree that the licence holder should pay the cost of regulation that will be incurred by the Secretary of State, the CAA and the Competition Commission in carrying out their functions under chapter 1 of the Bill. Those are the only new costs that will fall on the licence holder. However, the Government are not keen to enshrine in legislation the principle that only regulation costs may be recovered through the licence. There are other sums that it may be convenient to recover through the licence, including the UK's annual contribution to Eurocontrol, the cost to the CAA of obtaining meteorological information and passing it to airmen, and the cost to the CAA of designing and regulating the use of airspace. Those costs are not new: they are already recovered through the Eurocontrol route charges system, and we would like that arrangement to continue because it allows costs to be recovered from the widest possible range of air users, thereby lessening the burden on the individual user. Collecting those costs through the licence may prove the most convenient way to allow the present arrangements to continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not want to discuss Eurocontrol.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We know why the Under-Secretary would prefer me not to raise that subject. Will he confirm that the Government do not intend to allow the grantor of the licence—be it the Secretary of State or the CAA—to milk the licence on an on-going basis, so that a surplus can be transferred to the consolidated fund or other transport schemes? We realise that the sale proceeds are supposed to provide extra Treasury revenue, but the licence proceeds are not. After privatisation, the annual surplus that the Treasury currently takes from NATS will no longer be available. It will serve as future investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Government and I want to see the cost of the licensing regulatory process kept to a minimum. We do not intend to milk the system or secure a surplus from this excise. However, the amendment would not help to achieve that admirable objective, so I invite the Opposition to withdraw it.
<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> When my right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea opened the debate this morning he said that he was honoured to have been entrusted with the task of doing so by the young captain on the Front Bench—my right hon. Friend is the field marshal, but I fear that I am more likely to be the lance bombardier taking the job from the young captain. I shall do the best that I can.
<P>
Today's debates have centred on the notion of whether there should be maximum clarity, transparency and accountability in what the Secretary of State does with regard to the issuing of licences and associated activities. In most everything that we have said, we have tried to show that the clause is drafted in such a way that the Secretary of State will not have to explain his actions.
<P>
The four amendments—a glance at them will make it plain that they all have more or less the same effect in different parts of the clause—are designed to increase the clarity and transparency that the Secretary of State must show when issuing or, in this case, not issuing, the licence. Amendments Nos. 138, 139 and 140 refer respectively to before, during and after the issuing of a licence. Their purpose is to encourage the Secretary of State not to do things behind closed doors, although I know that the natural inclination, particularly of this Secretary of State, is to centralise as much power as he can in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, tell as few people about it as he can and take his own decisions. That may be the best thing from the point of view of the Government of the country, but it is not necessarily the best thing from the point of view of democracy.
<P>
The amendments say that that is not what the Secretary of State should do. Here we are not necessarily dealing simply with what the right decision is but, as we said on an earlier group of amendments, with the public perception of whether it is the correct decision. We are talking not only about safety in the air but about the public perception of such safety, as well as that of the press, which may be different. Therefore, it is vital that the Secretary of State should state plainly why he has decided to issue a licence. We must know that the company to which he has issued the licence is competent and can provide the highest quality of service in terms of minimising delays at airports as well as preserving the high safety standards enjoyed by those who fly in the United Kingdom.
<P>
Almost as important is the fact that a significant number of people would be affected if the Secretary of State turned down an application for a licence. There would be the commercial interests. A company will presumably have been set up to bid for the licence, or it may be done by part of another company. It will need to know why the application has been turned down, as will its employees and those associated with the company. Local people would need to know why one company rather than another had been given the licence. The clause simply states that the Secretary of State must reveal his reasons for granting a licence. We request that he should also have to reveal his reasons for refusing it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> This is a most unusual series of amendments. Can the hon. Gentleman name any other licensing or contracting condition under which reasons for refusal are published in the public arena for everyone to see and digest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I would rather not be sucked down that avenue. However, as the hon. Gentleman takes satisfaction from the fact that I do not want to get into that discussion, I can tell him of one large area where exactly that happen—planning applications. The council says why a planning application has been turned down. Therefore, transparency of the kind that I described seems to be fundamental in government. It does not surprise me to hear that the Labour Government are keen to minimise transparency and not tell the public why they turn applications down, but it is an important principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if notices have to be published for refusals as well as grants of licence, the amendment would add to the administrative costs and, therefore, increase the application fee? Would the hon. Gentleman support a move to increase the fee to recover administration costs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful for that intervention and will make two points in reply. First, the hon. Member for Shipley made a fuss in two debates about the administration costs of setting up the privatisation. We are discussing a deal of around £1 billion, so increasing costs by a few thousand pounds a year is hardly of huge significance. Secondly, as we discovered last week, the Government have increased the cost of administration by a gigantic amount. The cost of running the civil service and the Government has gone through the roof, yet they are bleating about a small increase in costs that would provide a significant contribution to democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman misheard. The cost would fall not on taxpayers but on those who apply for licences. The money would come not from the Exchequer, but from increased costs on those wishing to apply for licences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I did not mishear; I well understood that. None the less, the fuss that the hon. Gentleman is making about minimising the increase in administration when he supports a Government who, not least through the increase in the number of special advisers employed by them, has driven the cost of running the Government through the roof seems to be slightly hollow.
<P>
My first point is the main one. We are discussing a substantial investment of hundreds of millions of pounds—reference has been made colloquially to £1 billion—by a multi-national company. A few thousand pounds to make it plain to the public why a licence has been turned down would be relatively insignificant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I apologise for not having heard the hon. Gentleman's opening comments. The problem with the main thrust of his argument—that there will be a number of competing companies so it is important to understand why one receives a licence and another does not—is that, as we have heard from the Minister, the licence will be awarded before a company becomes involved as a strategic partner and, as the Minister made clear in his opening comments, only one organisation will be given the licence. He said that NATS will receive the licence; no other company need apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That is a reasonable argument and it supports what we are advocating. We should stop all the talk about competition, notice periods and so on, accept that there will be only one bidder, which will be carefully regulated to ensure that it does the job well, and that it may as well have an indefinite licence with a short notice period. The hon. Member for Bath made a good point, but the Bill is drafted to suggest that there will be a number of bidders and that the Secretary of State or the CAA will decide to whom the licence will be issued and will provide reasons for doing so. If that is so, there must be a presumption that there could be more than one bidder and that someone will have his application refused.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point would be sensible if the Government would listen to reason and remove the charade of competition in the bidding process, but while that charade exists, it is important that the Secretary of State and the CAA should be as transparent as possible about the reasons for refusal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> This is a genuine question. What would be the effect on the commercial viability of a company that bids for but is refused a licence if the Government published the reasons behind that company's failure to obtain it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman is suggesting the most speculative possible circumstance. The alternative seems much more worrying. Let us suppose that it was thought that the Secretary of State or the CAA had refused the licence for capricious or improper reasons. That would seem much more worrying to the public, who will then perceive one company with a licence and another company which might, as far as they can make out, be equally well suited to carry out the terms of the licence, but which for reasons unbeknown to them has had the licence turned down. The confidence of the travelling public in safety in the air could be reduced by the capriciousness of the Secretary of State in turning down the licence.
<P>
Of course there would be commercial considerations as the hon. Member for Shipley suggests, and the terms in which the announcement is made could be couched to take account of the commercial confidentiality of the company and also for reasons of security.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Ah, national security!
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I echo the Minister's words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I will in a moment, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to finish my point.
<P>
There may be reasons of commercial confidentiality or—in the extreme case of national security—for not setting out in full the reason for having turned down an application for a licence. For either of those reasons—and I find it hard to imagine what those circumstances would be—I am certain that the learned civil servants in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions would find the wording to make it plain to the public why the licence had been turned down, without breaching any commercial or security confidentiality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument suggests that he wants the reasons for turning down an application to be published except when commercial confidentiality is involved. On the other hand, the hon. Gentleman has already accepted—in reply to the hon. Member for Bath, that there will not be another commercial company. It seems as though he has argued successfully against his own amendment, which he believes that he should not have moved in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a great facility with clever, if rather silly illogical interventions, but he is quite wrong. The Secretary of State's or the CAA's reasons for turning down an application should be made public. There is no question about that. The hon. Member for Shipley said that possibly there would be issues of commercial confidentiality. I replied that civil servants would find ways of making the Secretary of State's reasoning well known, while still safeguarding the commerciality confidentiality of the company. The same applies to national security.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman completely misunderstood the hon. Member for Bath who said that if there were only one bidder, we would not need to produce reasons for turning down any other applications. If there were only one bidder, we would not need to produce reasons for accepting it either. In that case we would not need clause 6 and this basis for this part of the Bill would be nonsense.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath is correct. Every Committee member may realise that there will be only one bidder for NATS. In that case, the Bill needs fundamental restructuring. In the Bill, as drafted, there is a presumption of competition and that one or other of the bidders will lose. The Secretary of State should make it clear to all interested parties—albeit couched in careful language—why the other bidders have failed in their applications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> There is more to the amendment than the hon. Member for North Wiltshire suggests. Clause 6 sets out the procedures attaching to the grant of a licence. In following those procedures, the granter of the licence would do certain things, some of which are set out in the Bill. For example, persons likely to be affected by the grant of a licence should be given an opportunity to make representations to the licence authority before any licence is granted. The licence authority—the Secretary of State—would need to do rather more than is explicitly set out in the Bill if only to protect himself not only from the possibility of being taken to judicial review, but from losing.
<P>
The licence authority will first need to establish the objective criteria which will apply in considering an application for a licence. The Secretary of State will need to take account of his statutory duties as well as the fitness and properness of an applicant, including any security considerations. Having measured an applicant against those criteria, he will—if he is minded to grant a licence—have to invite and take account of any public representations before making a final judgment to grant the licence. That is in the Bill. If he finds that an applicant falls short of his criteria, he will, at some point, be obliged to advise the applicant in question. The Bill does not commit him to that course of action, but, if he did not do it of his own accord, he would certainly have to do so at the urging of the applicant.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The applicant would expect that, if his application were rejected, he would be told the reason why. If he then felt that the Secretary of State, as the licence authority, had acted unfairly, unreasonably, irrationally or outside his statutory powers, the applicant would have the remedy of judicial review. Taking the hypothesis to a conclusion, in the event of a judicial review, the onus would be on the licence authority to justify his original criteria and his reasons for rejecting the application.
<P>
It is not unusual to make explicit provision for the procedures attaching to the refusal of a licence as well as for the granting of one, and I am doubtful of the value of enshrining in statute what the practice of the licence authority should be. Nevertheless, in the interests of transparency, and despite the misgivings of my hon. Friends, the Government will consider what the hon. Gentleman has said, as well as the views expressed by the Committee, and may introduce their own proposals at a later stage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I thought that I was feeling lucky this afternoon, when my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire started to speak to the amendment. I then thought that the pack had been loosed on him, and that it might be time to gloss over the amendment and move on.
<P>
However, I am now moved to raise a point that might possibly provide an opportunity to improve on the drafting of the Railways Act, of which I have a copy here. The imagination of the draftsman of the Bill was obviously inspired by the drafters of the Railways Act, which does not require any disclosure of reasons. I am comforted by what the Minister said, but the question remains as to whether there should be public disclosure.
<P>
Is there an overlap here with the Freedom of Information Bill now being considered by the House? Is it legitimate for the Minister to consider withholding from the public domain the reasons for refusing to grant a licence? That presents a problem for him. It is reasonable that these sensitive issues should remain confidential. Is a business to have any protection, or must it have its dirty linen washed in public, as the hon. Member for Shipley suggested?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I thought that it might be appropriate for my hon. Friend to offer a word of comfort to the hon. Member for Shipley, who made one or two sensible points before being ruthlessly crushed by the hon. Members on the Government Front Bench. It is important, psychologically speaking, that people should not be cut off in that way, and I am pleased that my hon. Friend has shown a great deal of sympathy to the Minister. Perhaps he will be able to forge some sort of alliance with the hon. Member for Shipley in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have a great affinity with the hon. Member for Shipley because, soon after he was elected to the House, he started campaigning for a road. That was not Government policy, but he managed to get the road. I shall not go into the political ins and outs of road campaigning, but I thought that that was an illuminating point.
<P>
When does freedom of information apply, and when does it not? It is ludicrously hypothetical at this stage, because there will be only one licence and only one application. It is a done deal and this is all a charade. But 30 years hence, when we are going through this process again and our children and grandchildren are considering these weighty matters, would it not be reasonable to make the decision public?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> To my hon. Friends who cried out from sedentary positions, ``When do the freedom of information provisions come into effect?'', I reply that it is when it is in the public interest. I am slightly baffled by the position being adopted by the hon. Member for North Essex. After all, his amendment requires a statement of the reasons for rejection. I have said that the Government will consider this question seriously and I cannot see any possible grounds for objection to my generous offer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Perhaps I can clarify the Minister's point. Almost any decision that any Government take can be kept secret on the ground of the risk of judicial review. I was interested to hear the Minister say how concerned he was that the Secretary of State might be subject to judicial review if he allowed the arguments to be public. In an environment of freedom of information such as that which we enjoy under the new Government, I was concerned to hear a Minister in a Committee such as this praying in aid the risk of judicial review as an excuse for possibly considering keeping something secret. That seems to run directly counter to the entire tenor of the Freedom of Information Bill.
<P>
None the less, I was particularly encouraged to hear two things from the Minister. The first is that he intends to lay out in advance and clearly the precise conditions and reasons for a company being issued with a licence. That offers some comfort to companies that may lose the application, because the Government will presumably be able to say, ``This company failed on standard conditions No. 1, 3, 5, 7 and 28'', or whatever it might be, without getting into difficulties with commercial confidentiality or the rest.
<P>
I was also delighted to hear that the Minister was so frustrated by the eloquence of my arguments that he is prepared to consider the four amendments. In the hope that he will come back with a satisfactory solution to the conundrum that he raised, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 4, line 42, leave out subsection (8).
<P>
This is another probing amendment that requires some explanation. Subsection (8) seems to be a further extension of the pantomime that is the question of how many licences shall be granted and for how long. It is rather like the essay on how many children had Lady Macbeth, which seemed to be rather a dead-end inquiry.
<P>
To clear away some of the detritus of this extensive and bureaucratic licence procedure, which is presumably intended to make things easier for the Secretary of State, who will issue the first licence, subsection (8) disapplies certain parts of the Bill. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The following requirements do not apply to applications''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
notice the plural—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and grants relating to licences which need to be granted before the coming into force of section 3''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 3 of the Bill creates the offence of providing air traffic services without an exemption and without a licence. I do not fully understand the drafting of the subsection. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``section 3—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the requirement to consult imposed by subsection (1)(a)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I presume that that is subsection (1)(a) of clause 3, but clause 3 does not have a subsection (1)(a), so it must be subsection (1)(a) of clause 6, which deals with the Secretary of State having to consult the CAA.
<P>
If I have understood it correctly, the subsection of the clause that amendment No. 143 was intended to delete is now being set aside by subsection (8), which makes the amendment appear more prescient than might otherwise have been the case. I do not see why an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult the main regulator before the licence is granted should not remain. Perhaps the Minister has a reason for that.
<P>
The amendment would also set aside the requirements that are imposed by subsection (3), which concerns the prescribed manner, contents and information that must accompany an application for a licence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Including the fee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes; that has already been extensively discussed.
<P>
The amendment would also set aside the requirements imposed by subsections (5) and (6). Subsection (5) deals with publishing a notice in the required manner, and subsection (6) with notice periods.
<P>
It is not envisaged that more than one licence will be granted. Nevertheless, a paraphernalia has been set up that enables the granting of more than one licence and the granting of concurrent licences, allowing the CAA to grant licences after the Bill is enacted. The granting of the single licence to NATS, which, as has been said, is a simple process, would be made simpler by setting aside large parts of the Bill. That emphasises the fact that a sledgehammer is being used to crack a nut.
<P>
Can the Minister say anything that would make this part of the Bill seem more relevant? It is the drafting of the Bill that resembles dancing angels on a pinhead, rather than this debate. Why can we not have a simple process for granting the licence? If, a decade or two hence, more licences might be granted, new legislation to deal with those circumstances might be appropriate. This part of the Bill is overambitious and unlikely to fulfil the purpose for which it was drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> In a nutshell, the amendment would oblige the Government to undertake the full procedure entailed in the granting of a licence in the granting of the first licence. As we have made clear to the Committee, and as the world well knows, that will be given to NATS.
<P>
When the Committee considered clauses 1 and 2, the hon. Member for North Essex tabled amendments designed to make the Secretary of State and the CAA have regard to the administrative and bureaucratic burdens on providers of air traffic services through the regulatory and licensing regime. I sympathised with the thoughts that lay behind those amendments. However, amendment No. 143 would increase the administrative and bureaucratic burdens on the Secretary of State and the CAA, and I have a quarrel with that.
<P>
I accept that the process of granting licences should be open. The Committee may find it helpful if I explain what the Government intend under clause 6(8). We want to be able to grant a licence to NATS for the provision of air traffic services in en-route airspace, and have no plans to extend the licensing regime beyond that. Clause 6(8) allows us to grant a licence to the existing provider to do what it is currently doing without our first having to go through a public consultation procedure.
<P>
When we first announced that we intended to set up a public-private partnership, we undertook a full public consultation. The reaction to the policy proposal was mixed, but there was no hint that NATS was not fit and proper to provide en-route air traffic services in the United Kingdom. We are taking the Committee's views on a draft of the licence; my officials will be talking to other interested parties in the aviation world as the drafting of the licence continues. I cannot see the point of a further exercise to establish whether NATS is fit and proper to provide en-route air traffic services.
<P>
If the hon. Member for North Essex wants an assurance from me that no licence will be issued under clause 6(8) other than to NATS and other than for en-route air traffic services, again he has that assurance. I hope that on that basis he will seek to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Perhaps I can tease the Minister on a small point. In view of what he has just said, it would help the Committee if he gave us a categoric statement that it is definitely and absolutely the Government's intention that the only organisation that will be awarded a licence for the en-route services described will be NATS. Will he say that there is no possibility of any other organisation or any competition being awarded a licence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Clearly and categorically, I confirm that it will be NATS.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I fully understand the reason for the subsection: to de-complicate the incredible complications in the clause. It is an admirable piece of drafting, which retrieves matters. However, I leave the marker that the otiose nature of much of the arrangement remains. I simply wonder whether further legislation will be required because, in the 10 or 20 years that will have elapsed before these rather complicated provisions are used, circumstances will have changed.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
THE CHAIRMAN, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68 (Debate on Clause or Schedule standing part), and Standing Order No. 89 (Procedure in Standing Committees), That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause, which deals substantially with the nature of the licence, deserves closer consideration. The amendments that we have tabled enable us to give the licence that consideration.
<P>
Amendment No. 150 is intended to address what we regard as lax drafting. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A licence may include such provisions as the licence authority thinks are necessary or expedient; and a provision need not relate to services authorised by the licence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an extraordinarily wide definition. It could relate to whether the moon is made of blue cheese. There is no requirement of relevance. Amendment No. 150—together with the others in the group—would create a more satisfactory definition of a licence.
<P>
By improving the drafting, amendment No. 150 would enable the more ambitious draftsman to concentrate on the relevant issues instead of going off on irrelevant drafting sprees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is trying to be more specific about the licence, but what would happen if unforeseen national security issues had to be raised in the licence provisions? I do not see any reference in the amendments, to national security.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman will find that there is nothing in the draft licence about national security, because national security issues are dealt with in the Bill. One issue that is relevant is what is in the licence and what is in the Bill. Far more licence provisions should be in the Bill, because its conditions are relevant for all time. I shall deal with the idea that some of these important issues should be transient and subject to modification, competition and so on, when the travelling public would like to think that such matters are set down in law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does my hon. Friend think it instructive to listen to all the interventions of the hon. Member for Shifley—[HON. MEMBERS: ``Shipley.''] Sorry, I meant to say Shipley, shifty Shipley. Everything that he has spoken in favour of has given the Secretary of State more powers—as yet unknown, secret, centralised powers. Does my hon. Friend agree that that runs entirely counter to what the Labour party constantly tells us about its desire for transparency and accountability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> At the ``Dog and Bucket'' in Shipley they talk of nothing else than the concerns raised by their hon. Member. I look forward to further interventions from him, as he provides us with much entertainment.
<P>
Amendment No. 151 deletes the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and the provision need not relate to services authorised by the licence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 153 is an echo of amendment No. 150. We felt that we wanted to narrow the subsection. Again, it is incumbent on the Minister to explain why the clause needs such a wide ambit.
<P>
I shall concentrate in my comments on amendment No. 170, which amends subsection (1) and sets out which conditions should be in the licence. We have used the headings in the licence to enable us to debate such matters.
<P>
I reiterate my thanks to the Government Front-Bench team for providing us with a draft of the licence, because it has been extremely useful. I propose to look at each of the headings and say whether they are appropriate or whether the public need greater protection in the Bill. I should say first that the licence contains many complex definitions, and we may need to spend a little time clarifying them.
<P>
For example, a number of terms are used in the licence, such as ``Advisory Control Service'', ``Advisory Service'', ``Air Traffic Control Service'', ``air traffic services'', ``Core Services'',
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``En route Air Traffic Services'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``En route Businesses'', ``En route (UK) Business'', ``En route (Oceanic) Business'', 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Oceanic En route Traffic Control Service'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``Terminal Approach Control Service'', and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``UK En route Air Traffic Control Service''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
These all have different meanings.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> Life is like that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes. However, the nature of the licence reflects the ambition of someone wishing to crack a nut with all the force of a sledgehammer. We are discussing a proposal to licence the existing operator, NATS, to carry on doing exactly what it does now. A much simpler and more general licence would have sufficed. Will the Under-Secretary explain why each of those separate definitions is necessary?
<P>
I shall move on to the,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``General obligation to provide Core Services''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am mystified as to why the general obligation of the licence holder is not in the Bill. The draft licence states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Licensee shall make available on a continuing basis, and provide at all times, the Core Services and the Specified Services in respect of each relevant Licensed Area.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is fundamental to the purpose of the licence. We shall issue the licence not to take it away, but to provide the framework for regulation. It seems odd that the obligation on the licence holder that I have just quoted should be available for modification—as the draft licence is—rather than set down in statute. That gives me cause for concern.
<P>
I am also worried that there appears to be a division of responsibilities within that general obligation. Condition 2, clause 3 of the licence states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Licensee shall be relieved of its obligation in paragraph 1 above to the extent that the CAA notifies the Licensee that it satisfied that any reasonable requirement is or is to be met by other means''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we are to place an obligation on the licence holder to provide those core services, it should be up to the licence holder to procure those services by other means, and to satisfy the CAA that they are being provided. Giving the CAA an opportunity to say ``Don't worry, we'll drop that obligation because we know that someone else is doing it,'' will divide the accountability and the responsibility of the licence holder to satisfy those obligations.
<P>
Condition 3 deals with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Changes to Core Services and Specified Services''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems odd that those services should be subject to changes. One could, perhaps, allow for a more general obligation in statute, within which evolution such as ``technical operational change'' or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an actual or anticipated change in the patterns of demand for air traffic services''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
could be covered. Such shifts in demand and technological advances occur in the normal course of business. Setting them down in the licence will allow the process to become bogged down in bureaucracy. I hope that the Under-Secretary will get the gist of my argument. Some of these conditions are clearly immutable and should be set out in statute. Others seem a little excessive in their application through the licence, and should be allowed more flexibility.
<P>
It is extraordinary that the Bill contains no specified services delivery plan, when there is one in the licence. The availability of such a delivery plan should be laid down not only by regulation but in statute. The licence states that the plan should be submitted to the CAA,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``within [six months] of the grant of this Licence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems a little strange.
<P>
One would have thought that the plan ought to be in place before the licence is granted. I am sure that NATS is still thinking about such a plan and would be surprised to discover that one does not already exist. I do not understand why there must be a period of six months' grace before a plan is notified.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On other aspects that should be in the Bill, condition 5, deals with the disposal of relevant assets. We had an extensive discussion on the way in which assets are treated when the licence is withdrawn. I cannot remember whether we have already accepted an assurance on this matter from the Minister; if not, I ask him to write to us. The disposal of assets is a vital aspect of the licence, which should be reflected in the Bill

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> No, we did not receive an assurance from the Minister on that point. We raised the serious question of the way in which the transfer of assets at the end of a licence period will be treated. The hon. Member for Bath—who enters the Room most opportunely—and I argued, he more ably than I, that the matter was relevant to initial applications to become the strategic partner. Rather than providing an assurance, the Minister told us that we were dancing on the head of a pin. That is an extraordinary way in which to describe a matter that involves billions of pounds of investment over a very long period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If a licence holder were able to dispose of relevant assets through, for example, sale and leaseback, or to pass them to an alternative licence holder, so that they were not available at the end of the licence period, that would be a serious matter. As such, it should be reflected in the Bill. After all, according to the draft licence,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Licensee shall not dispose of or relinquish operational control over any relevant asset otherwise than in accordance with the following paragraphs''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Notice periods are required for the CAA to give consent, and provision is made for it to provide confirmation in writing, unless other statutory means by regulation are provided.
<P>
The question of assets extends to value. The licensee cannot
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``create any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or other form of security or encumbrance whatsoever, undertake any indebtedness to any other person or enter into any liability in respect of any obligation of another person in any such case otherwise than . . . on an arm's length basis . . . on normal commercial terms''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for a permitted purpose''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provides a strict framework in which the business of air traffic management is to be conducted. A licensee will not be allowed to create cross-default obligations.
<P>
Condition 6 deals with separate regulatory accounts for separate businesses. Condition 7 deals with restrictions on activity and financial ring fencing, and condition 8 with the availability of resources. Those are extremely important matters—why are they not included in the Bill? I cannot see any circumstances in which the licence would not require proper resources to be made available to the business that carries out air traffic services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> My hon. Friend is doing the Committee a service by examining those provisions, and is demonstrating that they are so basic that they should be in the Bill. He also drew attention to the extraordinariness of the drafting of clause 7(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a provision need not relate to services authorised by the licence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All these matters relate to services authorised by the licence, so how on earth could the licence not refer to such services? My hon. Friend underlined the oddness of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> As drafted, the provisions need not relate to the services provided by licence. I await examples of the types of provision that may be included, because I have not found any in the draft licence.
<P>
On condition 8, the availability of resources seems to be inherent in the duty of the licence holder, which is already set out in the Bill. Either that is of sufficient importance that it needs to be set out in the Bill in more detail, under the duties of the licence holder, or it is too prescriptive, and therefore unnecessary, to have it in the licence. I would like an altogether simpler framework, in which the licensee's obligations are set out in statute. We trust, in general, that the right licence holder has been chosen and there is no need for such a bureaucratic licence.
<P>
Condition 9, on the prohibition of cross subsidies, should be in the Bill. On the other hand, condition 10, which relates to capacity and investment plans, is merely a matter of good business practice—planning to meet capacity and investing to meet that capacity—and it would be excessively regulatory and interfering to have that in the Bill.
<P>
Condition 11 relates to service standards. I think that the travelling public would like such standards to be specified in the Bill. We are not dealing with train timetables, but with matters of far greater importance in safety terms. The condition states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Licensee shall provide each of the Core Services in the manner which it reasonably considers to be best calculated to achieve any standards of service or standards of performance as may be determined by the CAA.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There should be a duty on the CAA to require that those indicators be made, and a duty on the licence holder to provide information so that the indicators can be published.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend says that service standards refers to safety. I am not sure that he is right. Safety is well covered elsewhere in the Bill. In respect of air traffic control, service standards nearly always refers to delays. My hon. Friend made the good point that the travelling public have a right to know that a proper air traffic control system is in operation, which means that they will not face unnecessary delays at the airport. That is just as important as his point about safety.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I do not want to engage too lengthily with my hon. Friend on the matter, but I think that he is wrong. The purpose of air traffic control is unlike that of running a train. A train is run to get people from A to B and is regulated to try to ensure that it is safe. The purpose of air traffic control is not to guarantee getting people from A to B, but to maintain the safe separation of aircraft in our skies. If that is done efficiently, it ensures that aircraft can get from A to B, but it is not the objective of air traffic controllers to help aircraft to meet their timetables if there are too many aircraft in the skies.
<P>
It is important to understand that a safety business, not a transport business, is being privatised. The performance indicators are different to those in a normal business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> While I do not wish to prolong the debate, I should like to follow up my hon. Friend's point. Of course, the primary purpose of air traffic control is to ensure the correct separation between two aeroplanes in the sky. There is no variation in that standard of service—if the separation is not achieved, the air traffic controllers have failed. However, there is variation in the standard of service as it applies to delays at airports. If privatisation does not raise the correct amount of money for Swanwick to operate properly, delays at airports will get longer and longer, especially in the south-east of England. Is it not reasonable for the travelling public to have some guarantee of the standard of service they should expect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes. My hon. Friend raises interesting questions about which indicators should we expect and which are used? I confess that I am ignorant on that point. Obviously, as we have already discussed, there will be safety indicators such as the number of air proxes and the number of overloads. What indicators are used to measure the standards and levels of service offered? The Minister might enlighten us on the matter.
<P>
Condition 12 concerns the restriction on the use of certain information. Again, I cannot understand why the proposal has not been included in the Bill. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Subject to paragraph 7, the provisions of this Condition shall apply to confidential information within the meaning of this Condition, save where the person providing information notifies (or otherwise agrees with) the Licensee that the information need not be treated as confidential.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``Confidential information'' is defined as 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all information relating to or deriving from the management or provision of the Core Services''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The definition seems broad. If some matters must be kept secret, we need a greater specificity—to use my favourite word—as to the extent of the requirement. Proscribing all information and making that a civil obligation in the licence would be a low way catching information that might be required in the public domain. If anything, there is a need for an obligation in the licence to disclose information and to ensure that information finds its way into the public domain. After all, openness rather than secrecy gave the public confidence in the safety of the nuclear industry.
<P>
Conditions 13 and 14, concerning the provision of advice to the Secretary of State and collaboration with other service providers, are surely inherent obligations for any air traffic control business operating in the UK. Again, I cannot understand why the obligations are not immutable in statute, rather than mere conditions in the licence.
<P>
Interestingly, condition 15 is about the recent request of the CAA for licence holders to allow air traffic controllers to be seconded to it. That would seem reasonable. Consultation and the handling of complaints are matters of good business practice that do not need to be in the licence. As the licence holder has only one client—the CAA, as the regulator—one would hope that it would want to ensure that it handled complaints correctly. Condition 17 concerns the provision of information to the CAA; its inclusion in the licence is acceptable. Similarly, fees seem to belong naturally in the licence arrangements rather than in statute.
<P>
Condition 19 deals with pre-notification of changes in shareholders. I am concerned that the provision will not deliver the intentions of clause 5(6), which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A licence may not be transferred.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee will recall that we tabled two amendments concerning a change of control or ownership of a licence, and the beneficial ownership of a licence. Only notice of changes in the control of a licence and in shareholdings will be required. I am not sure that that will provide the necessary assurance that people want.
<P>
A licence may be granted to NATS, which may then join with a new partner that has day-to-day control under its 46 per cent. shareholding. With management support, the new partner would have 51 per cent. control. It may decide to sell the 51 per cent. stake—the 46 per cent. holding plus the proportion held through management support. Such a situation is not covered by the provision. Notice is required, but there is no provision to prevent a change of control.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Is my hon. Friend saying that the effect of condition 19, as far as he is able to tell, is that there is no let or hindrance to a transfer of ownership, with respect to the licensee, to the licensee, to a company and if such a transfer had been proposed in the first place, it might have struck the Secretary of State as contrary to the national security interest?
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That was my thinking. My right hon. Friend has elucidated what I was going to say. Condition 19 requires only that notice should be given. Clause 5(6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A licence may not be transferred.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am advised that that means that the direct ownership of the licence cannot be transferred from ABC plc to XYZ plc, but it does not matter if ABC plc is taken over by XYZ plc. In that instance there would have been a change in the beneficial ownership of the licence and therefore a wholly unconnected company, which might not be a fit and proper one, could take over control of the licence. At least someone would know about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> My hon. Friend's point, that the licence would be granted to an organisation without reference to its shareholder composition, is demonstrable in the light of the clarification that the hon. Member for Bath obtained earlier. He ferreted out from the Government the fact that the licence will be given to NATS, whose share ownership will—not may—change afterwards. Self evidently, the question of share ownership is completely separate from the granting of the licence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes, except that the Secretary of State will not, I am sure, consent to the transfer of the ownership of NATS to a partner of which he does not approve. The question is what happens after that. This matter will occupy the Committee at some length.
<P>
A foreign-owned company, or a company from an unsavoury part of the world, or one that has connections with a foreign Government with a different foreign policy agenda from ours, could become involved. All sorts of concerns arise and I am surprised that the condition on pre-notification of changes in shareholdings is as weak as it seems to be.
<P>
Part III of the licence contains conditions relating to charge control, which it would be inappropriate to include in the Bill. Some explanation of the algebra on pages 42, 43 and onwards would be helpful. I shall not attempt to quote those formulae, which might present a test to the Hansard staff, and I have not attempted to understand what they are intended to do. I shall ask the Under-Secretary to give us a complex maths lesson. In my experience the concepts behind such formulae are much simpler than appears likely in the present case. Will the Under-Secretary just explain the intention, in relation to the charges?
<P>
The draft licence is being established by a clause that is too widely drafted, which enables the licence to be a broader document than necessary. The draft licence outlines many details that the public would expect to be in statute. It imposes excessive bureaucracy and restrictions on the operator. A more explicit explanation of what is required of a licence holder should be in statute. Instead of an enforceable licence, we should have a simpler licence that is based on trust and procedure.
<P>
In my experience, when a licence is used as more than a prompt—the minute we enforce its conditions—the positive relationship that must exist, in this case between the CAA and the licence holder, has broken down. It is like any relationship; the need to resort to enforcement through the law, which goes beyond simple co-operation, signals the end of the positive relationship. If too much emphasis is placed on the operation of the licence rather than the statutory framework, there might not be a sufficient firmness or understanding between the licence holder and the regulator of the real purpose of the directions. With a particular licence holder in mind, improvements should be made that enable the transition to privatisation to take place with the minimum of fuss.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister for Housing and Planning thinks that it will help the Committee if he intervenes now to clarify some issues. That will not preclude a Back Bencher from trying to catch my eye afterwards.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I think that it would be helpful to clarify the objectives of the licence agreement and the relationship between the statute and the licence agreement. I shall respond to the hon. Member for North Essex after I have given a broad outline of the purpose of the licence agreement.
<P>
I am delighted that Committee members found it useful to have a copy of the licence agreement. It is the main tool by which the CAA will conduct the economic regulation of NATS. I should stress that it is an economic regulation licence, not a safety licence or an approval. The safety regime, with its associated licensing and approvals requirements, is established separately under the Civil Aviation Act 1982 and the Air Navigation (No. 2) Order 1995.
<P>
Those safety requirements remain untouched and, lest anyone suggests that they might be diluted or compromised by the incentives or rules of economic regulation, I draw attention to the primary duty imposed on the licence holder by clause 8 which provides the requirement to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``secure that a safe system''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is maintained. No ifs or buts; absolute clarity—safety is fundamental. That is the clearest possible signal that the present licence neither cuts across nor acts as a substitute for any safety licence or approval required pursuant to the 1982 Act.
<P>
I also stress that the document is a working draft, provided for the Committee's information. Much work has gone into it but more remains to be done; it is not the final document. We shall pay attention to the comments made in Committee when working further on the draft, which shows current thinking on the broad scope and content of the economic regulatory licence.
<P>
My officials and the CAA have been working on the document together, and have consulted NATS, as prospective licensee. They have also consulted users on the general approach and will consult more widely now that the initial working draft has been published. That wider consultation, and the views of the Committee, will make a valuable contribution to the further development of the licence.
<P>
The licence is the main tool by which the regulator imposes, monitors and enforces his requirements on the regulated business in order to ensure its continuing financial and operational soundness as a provider of essential services, and to establish the rules under which it operates as a regulated monopoly.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is difficult for me to impose restraint on hon. Members on the Back Benches if those on the Front Benches abuse their position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I was saying, a licence falls into two parts, usually called terms and conditions.
<P>
A licence in itself is a permission to do something, not an obligation. The permission extends to what the licence holder is authorised to do, where he is authorised to do it, for how long the authority is to last, and the circumstances in which the permission may be withdrawn. These constitute the terms of the licence; they are fixed and unchanging over time in order to provide security for the licence holder and absolute certainty about the provisions.
<P>
The licence also sets out the conditions to which the permission is to be subject: in other words, the price the licence holder has to pay for the privilege of having the permission. The conditions are designed to be modified, with proper checks and balances in the regulatory process, such modifications to reflect changing economic or technical conditions, changes in the nature of the business, or necessary developments in the legitimate requirements of the regulator and the public interest.
<P>
The main purpose of the conditions of a licence is to ensure that the licensee arranges its affairs so that adequate volumes and levels of services are available to users; that the business and assets are maintained in a state fit to meet those needs; that appropriate incentives to efficiency are provided; and that there are safeguards against abuse of a monopoly position by the licensee.
<P>
The initial licence will authorise NATS to provide air traffic services in respect of the two major segments of en-route airspace in which it currently provides such services—in the United Kingdom and Shanwick oceanic control areas. Further, it specifically requires the licensee to provide the core air traffic services and enshrines its commitment to provide specified other services listed in schedule 5 to the licence. The licence does not extend to air traffic control at airports, which is already carried out under contractual arrangements between the airports concerned and NATS and other providers. That and other certain activities around the margins of NATS' en-route business, would be exempt from the requirement for a licence, hence the separate provision for exemption.
<P>
It is envisaged that NATS would be the only en-route licensee initially, and probably for some time to come, in relation to the airspace for which the UK currently has responsibility. If the UK acquired responsibility for another tranche of international airspace, the licence holder would need a licence for that new airspace. They would be committing an offence under clause 3 if they provided air traffic services without one, hence the provision for an additional licence, if appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I have been following the Minister closely. He said, reasonably, that if some new airspace comes into our national domain, the licence holder would require a new licence. Was he implying that the licence would automatically go to the licence holder of the first licence—NATS—or did he mean that a new licence holder in a new area, either NATS or someone else, would require a licence?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has rightly raised an acute point. I stress that there would be a requirement for a new licence. It could be extended to the existing licence holder if there is just one, or it could be a new holder. The key point is that either eventuality would require a new licence.
<P>
The Government are considering the most appropriate length for the licence—
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I cannot understand why the draft licence separates the en-route and oceanic sectors and cross-subsidy is not allowed. Will the Minister explain why, bearing in mind that we are discussing a 30-year licence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> They are two separate operations; one covers exclusively United Kingdom airspace; the other has an international ramification. They are currently operated separately; the international operation involves co-operation with other countries—obviously, with the Republic of Ireland—and it is appropriate that the two should be managed separately. Hence the two separate licences. We envisage a framework in which NATS, which currently operates the two, holds a licence to operate the two services. It is the eventuality of a possible new area that creates the framework for the additional licence to which I have already referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> The Minister made a slip of the tongue when he referred to the two areas alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole as requiring two separate licences. I think that what the hon. Gentleman meant was simply that they were two separate regimes within one licence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Once again, I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for clarifying the matter. There are two separate regimes defined separately within the licence agreement—a point that his hon. Friend the Member for Poole raised when asking why separate definition was needed. I was explaining why there was a separate definition within the licence agreement. The right hon. Gentleman is right: the proposal is that there should be one licence for the two areas.
<P>
The Government are considering the most appropriate length for the licence where there are a number of conflicting considerations to be taken into account—the need to encourage and maintain investment, for example. For the purposes of illustration, the suggestion in the draft licence is that the licence should be of indefinite duration, but that the regulator should be able to terminate it by giving notice of termination after no less than 20 years. A period of notice of 10 years is proposed, as we have already discussed; if those figures are finally adopted, the initial licence would run for no less than 30 years.
<P>
However, as I made clear earlier, there are separate provisions in the licence agreement for termination at a much earlier date if there is a failure by the licensee to discharge serious responsibilities. There is thus a safeguard against a failure of any part by the licensee.
<P>
As I said, the licence contains a wide range of modifiable conditions governing how the licensee conducts his business. These include, first, a general service obligation to provide the core and other services that the licence holder is authorised to provide, to meet all reasonable demand for those services, to ensure continuity in the supply of the licensed services, and to provide services in a non-discriminatory manner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister deserves to be listened to carefully. He made it clear that there are two separate aspects of the contract: the core services and the specified services. In the application to obtain the licence in the first instance from the Secretary of State, it is to be a requirement that the bidder forwards details of how it intends to deliver the core services. Given the importance of many of the other specified services in the back of the licence, will the Minister explain why condition 4 requires the licence holder to give a service delivery plan six months after being awarded the licence? Why is it not necessary for the potential licence holder to explain in advance how he will deliver those important services?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Rather uncharacteristically, the hon. Gentleman has piggybacked on to the question already posed by the hon. Member for North Essex, which I did intend to answer, but I shall give the hon. Member for Bath the benefit of an answer now. The current services and plans of CAA/NATS are set out in several publications, but at the present time, they are not all firm obligations. We want to be absolutely sure that those services and plans are all coherently set out, approved by the regulator and enforceable, but that will take a little time. Therefore, the six months' provision has been included to ensure that the process can be conducted in a way that guarantees a set of watertight definitions. Preparations that are rushed may lead to subsequent regret that the necessary conditions have not been properly specified. I hope that the hon. Member for Bath will recognise that that is common sense. It does not create uncertainty because the services are already being provided by NATS, but we do need to be certain about the definition before we include it in the document. That is the reason for the six months' provision. It does not mean that there will necessarily be such a period, but it provides a safeguard to ensure that the work is done thoroughly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The licence and any modifications will be kept in the register, which will be open to public inspection. Does the Minister envisage that the service delivery plans will also be open to public inspection or does he think that that document will remain internal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is the type of document that would remain internal, but there is no question in my mind that if hon. Members wish to have access to it, an appropriate provision could be included. I do not believe that the document would be of great interest to the wider public. Certainly, the Secretary of State will want to be satisfied that the agreement is appropriate, but I do not see any reason why Members of the House should not have equal access to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am still mystified regarding my original question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am sorry, but I was out of the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is perfectly all right; I do not object at all. I think we make a good Opposition together.
<P>
On the issue of the six months, it will probably be at least a year before the transfer of business to the private sector and, therefore, at least a year before the licence is granted. It seems extraordinary that, between now and then, there cannot be agreement on the definition and the plan. Given that the plan probably already exists, it seems extraordinary that it cannot be put into the required terms and delivered before the licence is granted. That would just seem to be good practice. We are left with the residual anxiety that we do not know what the Government's real agenda is on this issue because the arrangement for granting licences seems to be much more complicated than is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We do know what the agenda is. I refer the hon. Gentleman to schedule 5, with which he will be familiar because he has ensured that his own assistants have typed it out religiously to provide the basis for an amendment that he tabled. He will be aware of the complexity and variety of the services covered. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the Member for Streatham highlighted this earlier in the debate, he will also know that there might be some uncertainty about how some of the services, such as the North sea helicopter advisory service, should best be operated in future. It is absolutely right that such matters should be carefully considered before the document is finalised and becomes the basis for the licensee's obligation for service delivery for a period of up to 30 years. I have already said that we do not regard the period of six months as something that must be adhered to, but we are treating it as a necessary safeguard to ensure that there is sufficient time to put the paperwork in order. It must be thoroughly and rigorously checked by the regulator. We need to be satisfied that all eventualities are covered before it becomes part of the contractual arrangement. That is a reasonable and prudent approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No doubt I am taking the words out of the mouth of the hon. Member for North Essex, but I am surprised by the Minister's answer. He said that it is important to sort out the details of the specified services before they form part of the contractual obligations. Both sides of the Committee would agree with that. What confuses me, however, given how important it is that they are part of the contractual obligations, is how the licence can be issued before they have been specified. How can they become part of the contractual obligations if they have not been sorted out prior to the awarding of the licence?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I remind hon. Members that they must use the centre Door? I do not want those who enter the Public Gallery to think that it is in order to go under the rope barrier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Bath asked why the details could not be put into a written form sooner. I have answered that. The services, which are already being provided, are regulated by separate documents. It will be open to NATS, which is fully aware of the situation because it delivers those services, and the private partner to inspect them. They should be fully aware of what is involved. The precise statement in the documentation, which forms the basis of the long-term contract, should be subject to rigorous checks before it is finalised. That is our only purpose. It is not an unreasonable provision because it is sensible to ensure that the public interest is protected. Surely the hon. Member for Bath welcomes that.
<P>
In addition to the general service obligations, the licence agreement contains other important modifiable conditions. One provision relates to the ring fencing of monopoly business. The licence holder must maintain the business and assets to ensure the continued proper functioning of the business without exploiting the monopoly, for example, by raising revenue from the monopoly business to subsidise other businesses. I shall explain in a moment when that might be problematic.
<P>
The third modifiable condition is the way in which charges are to be regulated. That includes the length of the review period, which is expected to be five years, the basic form of the charge caps for the current review period, the application of the charges and the information that is to be provided to the regulator so that he can assure himself of the licensee's compliance.
<P>
The fourth modifiable condition relates to service standards and user relations. The licensee must meet agreed service standards. It will be necessary to monitor and report on its performance and to set out on what issues the licensee should consult users and other aviation interests.
<P>
Operational issues must also be considered, including the licensee's investment plans and how they are communicated to users and the regulator. It will be necessary to collaborate with the Secretary of State for Defence to maintain joint and integrated civil military provision of services.
<P>
The licence also includes provisions on its termination other than by notice. Those are, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham and I have stressed, important. They allow termination at short notice in some circumstances, such as a serious and sustained failure to comply with statutory duties, the insolvency of a licensee or a change of ownership of the licensee that the Secretary of State deems to be contrary to the interests of national security or foreign relations, which was raised by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea. The safety net provisions in the Bill that establish a special administration regime, which we will discuss later, will take effect to ensure the continuity of air traffic services, which must be maintained.
<P>
Finally, specific provisions in clauses 10 to 14 relate to the modification of the licence. Clause 7(3) makes separate provision to allow changes to core services or specified services in line with condition 3 of the draft licence agreement.
