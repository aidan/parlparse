<H4><center>Thursday 23 April 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/148/1998148.htm">National Lottery Bill [Lords]</a></center></H3>

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I say now that hon. Members may remove items of apparel such that they can maintain decency, yet increase comfort. I have been advised that there may be a fire drill at 11 am. In that event, I shall suspend the sitting for 30 minutes.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Sport (Mr. Tony Banks):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That during the proceedings on the National Lottery Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have been a member of many Standing Committees, but this is the first time that I have led for the Government so I hope that you, Mr. Gale, will be gentle with me. It is a pleasure to be a member of a Committee under your chairmanship. We have shared many experiences in Committees and you are a fair, impartial and, indeed, splendid Chairman. I am sure that all new Labour Members, many of whom are Committee virgins, will find the experience as uplifting as they possibly could do under any Committee Chairman.
<P>
I understand that we shall be sitting this morning but, not this afternoon, given that it is our first Committee sitting and notwithstanding a half-hour break for a fire drill. That will probably be the only excitement that we shall experience this morning--it will certainly be enough for me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Spring: </B>(West Suffolk): Really?
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggested from a sedentary position that he has far more fun than I have--a point on which I naturally give way. I am sure that, under your expert guidance, Mr. Gale, we shall make good progress on the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind words which, I am sure, also embraced my colleague, Mr. Benton, who will be in the Chair next Tuesday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I endorse all that the Minister said. It will be a great pleasure to serve on the Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, which I know you will undertake in an exemplary manner with your characteristic firmness and fairness. We look forward to an open and comprehensive debate. We shall not be opposing the sittings motion as want to give the Bill a fair wind in Committee.
<P>
I welcome all hon. Members to the Committee and look forward to hearing the views of those on the Government side. Whether they remain on or off message is something that we shall be listening to with considerable anticipation. What is most exciting about the Bill initially is the sight that greets us this morning: that of the two Ministers who will speak in support of the Bill. I wondered whether I could find an appropriate analogy to describe them, but did not think that Siamese twins would be entirely appropriate, nor Tweedledum and Tweedledee. However, the Ministers make an unlikely couple, one being an urbane and understated person--by whom of course I mean the Minister for Sport. We look forward to a friendly, lively and constructive debate.
<P>
I trust that our amendments will encourage Labour Members to consider carefully the importance of the Bill, which is significant because of its impact on many spheres of national life. I hope that some of the points that hon. Members omitted to raise on Second Reading will be considered. The Bill is important because it touches on various crucially important parts of our national life. That is why it must given a fair wind. Labour Members were assiduous in scrutinising the National Lottery etc. Act 1993, and we shall do the same with this Bill in Committee.
<P>
I welcome the two Liberal Democrat Members to the Committee, although only one of them is here now. I hope that they will listen carefully to the debates on the amendments that we shall move. We shall, of course, consider sympathetically any amendments that they may move. I hope that we can find common ground.
<P>
Our approach is essentially based on the determination to preserve the best aspects of the national lottery, which has become something of a national institution. However, I have reread the long speech that the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) made on Second Reading, and I am concerned because he seemed to get lost in the woods. He found himself in a quandary and said in conclusion that he could neither support the Bill nor vote against it. I hope that, if possible, Liberal Democrat Members will clarify their position further.
<P>
It is right that the Committee should consider the Bill fully. On Second Reading, we made it clear that we take issue with the Government on several important matters. We hope that during these sittings we can persuade them to modify their stance. In doing so, I hope that they will ensure that the credibility of the national lottery, which has been such an enormous success and is widely supported by the public, can be enhanced rather than endangered, which is my fear if the Bill is not amended. We hope to persuade the Government of the wisdom of our views.
<P>
We seek to defend the principles that have been essential to the national lottery's success, including, absolutely set in stone, the arm's length principle between the Government and the national lottery and its distribution mechanisms, and the principle of additionality. Our central objection to the Bill is that the national lottery is being effectively turned not into the people's lottery, as was suggested so disingenuously in the White Paper, but into the Government's lottery. That is why we need time to consider such matters in Committee.
<P>
An unprecedented array of powers for the Secretary of State is proposed. The Bill flies in the face of the arm's length principle on which the lottery was set up and it threatens to undermine the independence of the lottery and reduce it to a form of voluntary taxation.
<P>
The national lottery has been a considerable success, and I pay tribute to the nobility of purpose of the original founders of the national lottery--namely, my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), the former Prime Minister, who set up the lottery with true integrity of purpose, and my right hon. Friends the Members for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) and for South-West Surrey (Mrs. Bottomley).
<P>
In contrast to what happened when we were in government, the Opposition are concerned that, under the Bill, the lottery will increasingly become the Government's lottery and that, in particular, the new opportunities fund will increasingly become the Secretary of State's fund. Given the eloquence with which my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) made the Opposition's case, it was almost unnecessary to listen to the many other speeches on Second Reading.
<P>
To understand the import of the Bill, it is sufficient to recall the procession of pork barrel supplications by members of the Government, each commending the Government for finally getting to grips with the lottery and each earnestly hoping that the Secretary of State would roll a log towards his or her constituency. Our fundamental objection to the Bill is that it undermines the principle of additionality upon which the lottery was founded and which has made it such a success. In justifying the Bill, the Secretary of State said that there would be no breach of that principle and the Prime Minister is quoted in the White Paper, ``The People's Lottery'' as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We don't believe it would be right to use Lottery money to pay for things which are the Government's responsibilities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That principle is correct, but is undermined by the Bill. That is why we need to give it adequate consideration.
<P>
Despite their protestations, Ministers cannot be under the illusion that the additionality principle is not being flouted; as so many commentators, including Peter Riddell who is not automatically opposed to the Government, have pointed out. It is unhealthy for the lottery to fund services such as health and education, which are core Government responsibilities. The Bill flouts the spirit on which the lottery was founded, which was bi-partisan and achieved remarkable consensus across the political divide. We shall table amendments that seek to preserve the principle of additionality--a principle that the Government supported when they were in opposition, at the time of the original lottery Bill. We hope that on further reflection they will support the amendments.
<P>
In their manifesto, the Government said that they were not satisfied with the way in which lottery money was being distributed, and the Bill is their solution to that. It will allow the Secretary of State to take direct control of up to 80 per cent. of lottery proceeds and spend them as he or other members of the Government see fit. That is why the Bill needs to be considered with care. All Labour Members made it clear on Second Reading that they understood that. They want the Secretary of State empowered to react to special pleading. Part of the political agenda underlying the Bill is an attack on the arm's-length principle. That principle has had a hard time of it of late; it has been more honoured in the breach than the observance. Our amendments also seek to highlight that.
<P>
We believe that the Bill is the thin end of the wedge and that if it is passed in its present form, it will increase the Secretary of State's powers in a way that would undermine the foundations of the success of the national lottery. The Department of National Heritage was given charge of the lottery--rather than the Treasury--so that the principles of arm's length and additionality could be maintained. The Bill breaks that relationship.
<P>
Stategic plans, initiatives specified by order and the power to divert more money to Government purposes lie behind the Bill. It would be more honest if the Government increased the amount of money taken from the lottery in taxation and left the original good causes intact; and that would be less costly to administer. The real good causes will now have a smaller share of the money.
<P>
I understand the Government's embarrassment on education and health. In the largest town in my constituency, ambulance cover has recently been withdrawn. In the past six months, waiting lists in Suffolk have doubled. That has come about under a Government who made expansive promises about 14 days to save the NHS. Similar changes have occurred in education. Higher education has been attacked, teachers have been sacked and class sizes have increased despite the cry of ``Education, education, education''.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Every hon. Member knows perfectly well that that is happening. The Bill is an attempt to fill a gap in public perception. It is slowly dawning on people that Government policies are wholly unsatisfactory in practice in those specific regards.
<P>
The good causes are simply losing out. It is not just me who is saying that. Lord Rothschild made the same point in another place. We have had correspondence with the Sports Council and many others who made assumptions about spending plans that are now under threat and attack because the money will be diverted. That is why the Opposition are tabling amendments to limit the damage to good causes by postponing the introduction of the New Opportunities Fund.
<P>
As it has been said, the Bill is a &#163;1 billion raid on the lottery. It entirely destroys the basis on which the lottery was set up, and on which it maintains its public credibility. The Opposition plan to press the Government hard to commit themselves and to give specific assurances about the percentages that they will guarantee for the five original good causes. We seek clarification and assurance because the matter is crucial to the sustained credibility of the lottery. The Secretary of State persists in saying that the good causes will get the money that was originally promised. They will not get their promised share, as the Government want a share--it is as simple as that.
<P>
The Opposition look forward to pressing those points, and to hearing the Government's answers. We look forward to testing the strength of their commitment to their election promises and to some of the principles that they espoused when the lottery was introduced. We make no apology for tabling amendments considered in another place. The arguments were advanced and rejected, but we believe that the Government were incoherent and confused. We will seek clarification.
<P>
Thank you, Mr. Gale, for giving me the opportunity to set out the Opposition's principled objections to the Bill. We will vigorously fight it. I hope that the Government can be persuaded to think again about some of the key matters about which I have spoken.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> It is traditional that the sittings motion is used as a preliminary skirmish involving broad issues. I am anxious, however, that the discussion does not turn into yet another Second Reading debate. Hon. Members should be aware that the Minister will respond, if he chooses to catch my eye. I should not wish the proceedings to be over prolonged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ronnie Fearn (Southport):</B> First, I congratulate you, Mr. Gale, and Mr. Benton, with whom I have worked on Sefton borough council and here, on being our Chairmen. The Committee will have a smooth passage with the Chairmen and the two Ministers, but I cannot say that there will not be one or two bumpy rides on the way.
<P>
The lottery has so far been a success. It is one of the most successful lotteries in the world, if not the most successful. Hon. Members must bear that in mind throughout these deliberations. I have always thought that money comes into the lottery from people who are least able to afford it. Liberal Democrats hope that some change can be brought about in the way that it operates. Camelot has been a successful operator. When the licence is renewed and the new contract is drawn up, others may come on the scene, but Camelot has been most successful so far.
<P>
The Government have already said that they intend to substitute a commission for the director general. New clause 2 provides for that and we shall certainly support it. There should also be a much wider geographical spread of money away from London and other cities. Large sums have been given to the Royal Opera house and for the Churchill papers, which the public did not like. We must bear that in mind and ensure that funding goes to the rest of the country, especially the north.
<P>
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts will miss out when a new cause is introduced, because 20 per cent. of the funding will disappear. It is concerned about that, and as a sports person and an arts person, I will listen carefully to what the Minister has to say on the matter. The Secretary of State has said that lottery moneys are for people, not for buildings, and I hope that that principle will be maintained consistently.
<P>
We will have no reservations about criticising some parts of the Bill, but on the whole it appears to be a great improvement on what has gone before--although, as I said, the lottery has been successful. The New Opportunities Fund will take away about 20 per cent. of the funding and that serious matter must be debated fully. We know that the Arts Council has lost about &#163;8 million in real terms during the past 12 months, and that must surely be rectified. We will criticise the Bill where necessary, but on the whole it represents a great improvement.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin).
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Thank you--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> I am sorry, but there is just one more thing. When dates were mentioned I wondered whether the Committee would sit on 7 May. That is the day of the local government elections, so might we not sit on that day?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That will be a matter for the usual channels to determine. I call the hon. Member for Hove.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. That was almost my shortest speech in Committee. I am fortunate in already having served on two Committees during my 12 months in the House, in one of which both you and my hon. Friend the Minister for Sport took considerable interest--the Committee considering the Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill. As I said during that Committee, the Committee stage of any Bill is important because it involves scrutiny of legislation. Scrutiny is important to our whole democratic process.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) mentioned the matter of quoting and misquoting. I was not present for the whole of the debate on Second Reading, because I had other commitments once the Secretary of State had made his opening statement. When I was on the train back to my constituency, I received a phone call telling me that the right hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) had quoted me in the House. It turned out that he had misquoted me in the House--a matter for which he has apologised to me, to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and to the Speaker. I hope that Conservative Members will not engage in misquoting people because that brings into disrepute both Second Reading and the scrutiny stage of the Bill.
<P>
I shall pick up one or two points that emerged on Second Reading. I have spoken to the Sports Council about its funding mechanism. Indeed, I attended the sports journalism awards, at which the hon. Member for West Suffolk was meant to join me, but was not able to make it. The Sports Council told me that it had been preparing for changes to the lottery. Any organisation worth its salt considered the possible impact of a Labour Government as long ago as 1996.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> As the hon. Gentleman referred to me twice and also to the Sports Council, I shall read the Committee a note that I received from the English Sports Council about the Bill. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We seek clarification that sport will be guaranteed long term funding post 2001 through its percentage share of Lottery income at no less than current levels.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I want to move on because there is not much time left before the fire drill takes place and I have a few more points to make. No doubt the issue raised by the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) will be debated later in our proceedings. We are now discussing the sittings motion, to determine how much time we should spend on such issues. If I went down the track of public spending limits and health and education, it would lengthen the Committee stage--in fact, we would probably still be in Committee in August.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman agreed with the public spending limits set by the previous Government, surely he should not be surprised at their impact on education and health, given that we have stuck to those limits. There is significant and fundamental disagreement across the political divide on several matters. I disagreed almost entirely with the hon. Gentleman's speech and I look forward to future debates about the important way in which the operation of the lottery can develop.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk accepted, however, that we would have to see whether the Labour party fulfils its election promises. That showed an acceptance by Conservative Members that they understood that we gave a clear commitment at the general election about how we would respond to the national lottery. That has been the subject of public consultation and there is a need for the measure to be properly scrutinised. I am looking forward to debating the Bill and I welcome you, Mr. Gale, and your co-Chairman, Mr. Benton, to the Committee. I hope that our proceedings will not be as arduous as my previous Committee outing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> May I welcome you, Mr. Gale, and your fellow Chairman, Mr. Benton, to the Committee. Having seen you control meetings of Kent Members of Parliament--not necessarily those from different parties--I know that you will find our proceedings relaxing and easy in comparison. The Minister referred earlier to various hon. Members who are new to Standing Committees. Indeed, a couple of my hon. Friends are, to use the hon. Gentleman's words, ``Committee virgins''. I regret to say that a consequence of being one of the depleted ranks of the Conservative party in this Parliament is that, although I have been a Member for less than a year, this is the third time that I have been a member of a Standing Committee. I suppose that that makes me, like the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin), Committee promiscuous. However, I shall not pursue such an analogy.
<P>
Conservative Members support the sittings motion because it is important that the Bill receives detailed consideration. It raises many significant issues, many of which are causing great concern among those who have benefited from the lottery during the past four years, both within the distribution bodies and, more importantly, those who have benefited from the distribution of the lottery money. As we discuss the various clauses, I hope that the Government can justify the need for widespread change. Much of the rhetoric that we have heard about the Bill implies that enormous, sweeping radical changes are required to the lottery system, suggesting that its operation has been going wrong and that it has not been doing what it was set up to do. That is a fundamental misconception and a wrong analysis of what has happened. By any objective standards, the national lottery set up by the Administration of my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) has been a howling success. At the time, enormous doubts were raised about whether people would be interested and about whether the use of soft gambling to raise money for good causes was proper. There were also doubts about whether the lottery could work technically, with many thousands of terminals and the need for instant and accurate information to be conveyed across Britain. Those doubts were proved rapidly to be a misapprehension. I hope that the Opposition will extract an acknowledgement from Labour Members--however grudging--that Camelot has done a good job. It was given the job of running a decent lottery that would raise lots of money for good causes and it has done so.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is important for the Committee to consider, during what I hope will be a full set of sittings, how to preserve the interests of the good causes that have done so much good work in various fields of endeavour since the lottery was set up. It is slightly disingenuous of the hon. Member for Hove to say that the Sports Council and other good causes have been planning for the Bill. The organisations involved can indeed read the manifesto and see that they are about to be clobbered and that they had better prepare, but preparing for something unpleasant does not mean that it is welcomed. It is clear that many aspects of the Bill will disadvantage existing good causes.
<P>
Distribution is another point that the Committee needs a full set of sittings to discuss. On Second Reading, hon. Members realised that many Labour Members regard the lottery as a pot from which they will be able to extract more in future by influencing the Secretary of State. I would be especially interested to hear the Minister's view about how London will be affected. One of the principal complaints about the lottery has been that London has had more than its fair share. Does he believe that London will do less well in future, given his potential interests in the matter?
<P>
The Committee will obviously have many important debates about the additionality principle. It is genuinely difficult to define additionality.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bernie Grant </B>(Tottenham): To take you back to your point about London--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not taking me back to anything. He should address the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green).
<P>
<B>Mr. Grant:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I take the hon Member for Ashford back to his point about London. Certain parts of London have received excessive amounts from the lottery. Areas such as my constituency have not. When speaking about London, he should not cast his net too widely. Will he concentrate on Westminster, Camden, Kensington and Chelsea?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I do not agree with the argument that London has had too much money. Much of the money that has come to London and to the parts that the hon. Gentleman believes to have been oversupplied, has come because of the location of large-scale national institutions. To take one analogy, a big grant has recently gone to Gateshead.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I allowed the hon. Gentleman to intervene because he is a London Member and London was referred to. The debate should not go too far down that road.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall of course accept your guidance, Mr. Gale. The hon. Member for Tottenham will agree that the complaint that London is overprovided-for is extremely arguable, in his terms and mine. It would be especially interesting to hear the Minister's views about the issue.
<P>
I shall return to my point about additionality, which will infuse many of our debates. It is difficult to define what is additional to core public spending. There is no doubt, however, that the Government are moving the boundaries towards the use of lottery money for causes that the public regard as a core responsibility of the Government that should be funded by core public spending. That breach of the additionality principle endangers the ethos of the lottery. The other principal point, which will be made throughout our debates, is the greater central control of the lottery created by the Bill. The White Paper was predictably and drearily called ``The People's Lottery''--in fact, the Bill creates the Treasury's lottery. Indeed, within the overall spending limits over which the Treasury will have control, it will be the Secretary of State's lottery. He will have much greater control over the distribution of lottery funds. The whole tendency of the Bill is towards greater centralisation.
<P>
The Opposition will probe the Government on their views on particular issues and we hope that they will accept some of our detailed amendments so that we can emerge with a better Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): This is my first Committee, after a year in the House. One of the exciting things about being a new Member is the opportunity to lose one's virginity in terms of parliamentary life so many times in so many ways. That must be a unique experience.
<P>
I was sceptical about the lottery when it was first mooted, but everyone would agree that it has been a great success in getting funding to good causes and to where it is needed. However, it can always be improved and I believe that the Bill does that. The hon. Member for West Suffolk referred to slogans, such as ``Education, education, education'', or the thumping rhythm of ``Things can only get better''; as the Government's first anniversary approaches, the song is being played on the radio and television in celebration.
<P>
I am the vice-chairman of the all-party group on the voluntary sector and charities. We discussed the lottery at one of our earliest meetings because it affects the voluntary sector in many ways. It has become a lifeline and many voluntary organisations have no choice but to consider lottery funding to ensure that they fulfil their function. However, we want less of a lottery when it comes to the distribution of funds. We want a process of distribution that is more transparent, easier, more targeted and focused on the greatest need. We want greater devolution of the way in which funds are distributed--contrary to what the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) said about centralisation. The Bill does not centralise; it takes decision-making nearer to the organisations that are involved and which benefit from it.
<P>
Yesterday, the Secretary of State announced that a pilot scheme would be set up in the east midlands later this year to examine new ways of improving funding for voluntary sector and other organisations. I welcome that pilot, which is an essential part of ensuring that the proposals work, and I particularly welcome the choice of the east midlands. It is an area that has not done well from lottery funding. As the only Member of the Committee who represents an east midlands constituency, I am particularly pleased that we are to be allowed to play our part in the improvements.
<P>
In the months before I became a Member of Parliament, I conducted surveys of the voluntary sector organisations in my constituency. Their conclusions on what improvements they wanted are the same as those proposed in the Bill.
<P>
The pilot and the Bill will be met with good will by the distributing bodies and prospective recipients, because they will provide new opportunities for all who seek lottery funding--not just those who will benefit from the New Opportunities Fund. There are opportunities in the sectors for which the New Opportunities Fund will provide--health, education, the environment, and so on--for organisations that may under the present rules make an arts, sports or charities bid to tap into the New Opportunities Fund. For example, a voluntary sector organisation may establish a healthy living centre and obtain funding from the new fund, rather than relying only on the existing funds for good causes.
<P>
Four years is a good period after which to review the structures, to praise what has gone well and to consider how they can be improved. We could not expect to get every structure right first time. The National Lottery etc. Act 1993 came from the same Government who created the Child Support Agency--which illustrates that we do not always get legislation right first time.
<P>
There is much good will for the Bill, and for the lottery. Our only aim is to make the lottery better--more effective and more in line with what people want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): May I also say, Mr. Gale, how agreeable it is to have you in the Chair? We have sat opposite each other on many occasions, and I propose to adopt an extremely deferential attitude to you in your new role.
<P>
I am glad that the Government have published their proposals for the change to regulation in good time. I note from the sittings motion that it is intended that we meet frequently. I have no idea--it is not entirely in the Government's control--how long it will take us to reach those regulatory matters, but there should be time to consult those who are interested in them. The Government were right to propose to adjust the Bill as they have. As the Minister knows, I have welcomed the proposed changes to regulation so far as they go; I may have further suggestions to make later.
<P>
I found the attitude of the hon. Member for West Suffolk to my speech on Second Reading somewhat astonishing, on two counts. First, the hon. Gentleman spoke of my speech's ``unusual length''. In fact, it took precisely the same time as his speech, and was less than half as long as the speech by the right hon. Member for Horsham. Secondly, I made my reasoned decision to abstain, which I explained at some length, because I approve of some of the Bill's aspects but not of others. It was therefore not sensible for me to play the Opposition game in the way that the Conservative party has played it. Although I may be slightly ambivalent about the advantages and disadvantages of the national lottery, I am wholly opposed to what can only be described as the one-man-bandit approach to opposition, which can find no virtue in a Bill and must find reasons to oppose everything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman did not note--I do not think that he was here at the time--that I said that we would listen constructively to his amendments and that I hoped that he would return the compliment. He might want to incorporate in his comments about my observations the balance that he assiduously sought to achieve in summing up his speech on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The more the hon. Member for West Suffolk listens in Committee, the better we shall all be pleased.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne):</B> I, too, appreciate that we have won the Standing Committee lottery in having you, Mr. Gale, and Mr. Benton presiding over our debates. I am sure that I shall find the experience of my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk leading for the Opposition inspirational. I am looking forward to seeing how the Ministers' complementary qualities will be focused on the Bill. No doubt, Labour Members will be surprised and disappointed that I shall not assume any Trappist vow as Opposition Whip; I shall contribute in the same way as other hon. Members.
<P>
I speak as a former member of the then Select Committee on National Heritage and as the representative of Eastbourne--a town very much reliant on tourism, which has a thriving arts sector such as that referred to by the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn). I also speak as someone who was parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of State, Department of Health in the previous Government and vividly remembers the promises and pledges, especially on the national health service, that Labour Members made in the general election campaign. My hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk touched on that in his speech, and I suspect that it will be a recurrent theme in Committee. Even leaving aside the question of raiding lottery funds, there was a clear promise to reduce waiting lists by 100,000, but they have increased by 100,000. When we talk of celebrating--if that is the right word--the anniversary of the elelction of a Labour Government, it is not a matter of things only getting better; things are getting worse.
<P>
Another theme which is appropriate to this general, opening debate and that will surface from time to time in Committee is that of public spending plans. I suspect that the ultimate defence of Labour Members, especially Ministers, is that they inherited Conservative spending plans. Let us explode that myth straight away; it is, and always has been, nonsense. Just as no Parliament can bind its successor, no Government can bind their successor. The Government are in the business of making choices--although they do not do so often--and any excuse of inheriting certain public spending plans will not wash.

<P>

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> On that important point, which is a recurring theme that Labour Members use, does my hon. Friend recall that a European Union rebate of &#163;400 million found its way to the Chancellor's coffers and that there was a &#163;1.5 billion underspend on last year's public spending estimates? In other words, there was a substantial unexpected increase in the money available to the Chancellor to dispose of as he saw fit. It is interesting that the sum total that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport was able to obtain for his Department was only &#163;2 million, which says something about his departmental credibility.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the thrust of the Opposition's argument, but hon. Members must deal with the main content of the Bill and speak to the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to you for your guidance, Mr. Gale. I shall limit myself to saying that what my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk says is absolutely correct.
<P>
Another theme--a flavour of which we experienced in the intervention of the hon. Member for Tottenham--that will surface over and again is the pork barrel politics aspect of the Bill. Of course, that is an American expression, but the Bill offers great scope for all hon. Members to press their case and grind their axes for their constituencies. In principle, that might be no bad thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grant:</B> That is what we are here for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Exactly. I bow to no one in my enthusiasm for pressing the interests of my constituents in Eastbourne and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman feels the same about his constituents in Tottenham. The problem is that, with more than 650 constituencies, even the massive success of the Conservative-founded national lottery cannot meet all the demands. Ministers will live to rue the day that they sought to undermine the arm's-length principle.
<P>
We have had two contributions from the Liberal Democrats. As usual, there was an element of ``having it both ways'', but it sounded as though the two hon. Gentlemen broadly support the Bill and that was only one aspect of the Lib-Lab pact that we have experienced in this Parliament. The Conservative Government said when they set it up that they would review the working of the national lottery--a point made fairly by the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt). Nothing is perfect in this life and I suspect that our deliberations in Committee will not produce a perfect Bill--no matter how hard we try.
<P>
Broadly speaking, the national lottery has been a great British success story and I hope that that will be recognised repeatedly by Labour Members. Despite the constant carping at the time from the Labour and Liberal Democrat Benches, we established the national lottery. It has been a great success and Conservative Members will do all that we can to protect that inheritance and ensure that it is not undermined or ripped off by a Labour Government who are hungry to get their hands on the large bag of money produced annually by the lottery and use it for political purposes. Finally, under your benign gaze, Mr. Gale, I hope that we shall manage to disagree without being disagreeable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser (Mid-Dorset and North Poole):</B> I am honoured to participate in the Committee proceedings. As to what the Minister said earlier, this may be my first Standing Committee but, as I have a wife and two children, a virgin is not something that I have been described as recently.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southport referred to the local elections on 7 May. I note from his biography that he is a district councillor; it would be interesting to know whether he is standing for election on 7 May or whether he will simply prop up the Liberal Democrat party in Southport at the time, whose votes at local elections are eroding nationally.
<P>
Comments that were made on Second Reading are worth discussing in Committee. No one questions the success of the national lottery. It is worth remembering that 94 per cent. of the population play the lottery. More people take part in it on a national basis than voted at the general election; it is incumbent on us all to remember that life did not start on 1 May last year. The lottery has become a national institution. It has a major impact on people's lives.
<P>
We must be mindful that the lottery raises significant sums for the five causes that were set up. It strengthens community ties by improving access to cultural and leisure facilities. It promotes economic regeneration and jobs, and it boosts retail trade. Many thousands of our constituents embrace the principle that the national lottery was set up to restore our heritage and promote projects that will become a source of national pride. However, the Bill proposes to tamper with and undermine our national institutions by creating--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a limit to the number of private conversations that I am prepared to tolerate from the Front and Back Benches during our proceedings. Hon. Members have a right to be heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I appreciate your ruling. The new cause that is being presented to us goes some way to undermine the other causes in terms of the money going to them. I agree with my hon. Friends who said that the Bill is Treasury-led. Proceeds from the lottery will be diverted into lottery so-called good causes, in addition to the money that the Treasury receives from ticket sales because it does not have the political will to raise taxation. The Bill will turn the national lottery into a Government lottery, which will fund mainstream spending projects, despite the Prime Minister's affirmation, quoted in the White Paper, ``The People's Lottery'', that it would not be right.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to use Lottery money to pay for things which are the Government's responsibilities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another reason why we must have full discussion is that the principles of the national lottery are to be overturned at a stroke. In particular, the principle of additionality--that the lottery should not be used to supplement core spending programmes--is totally abandoned. The principle that lottery funds should be distributed by bodies operating independently of the Government is also overturned. The whole idea of promoting local initiatives that strengthen the community will therefore be lost; that is an important aspect of the Bill.
<P>
The Bill is another example of the Government's determination to centralise power under the cloak of the words ``the people's''. It is no good claiming that the New Opportunities Fund initiatives are optional, or additional to initiatives already funded from the public purse. Public spending programmes constantly evolve--a point made by many hon. Members on Second Reading. Even the most creative accounting cannot rightly transfer to the national lottery the cost of such evolution. New social aspects of spending programmes, such as the training of teachers, librarians and others, must of course be carefully considered, but they must not be funded by the lottery, which has been successful as it was initially set up.
<P>
Matters such as healthy living centres must be considered. On Second Reading, I asked exactly what such centres would be. Unfortunately, the Minister ran out of time before he could answer that question. I would appreciate hearing in Committee exactly what healthy living centres will be and how they will impact on existing funding for GP practices. Will that be another way to divert money from one cause to another? I do not want us to be begging from Peter to pay Paul.
<P>
The Secretary of State proposes to acquire the power to exercise much greater control over how lottery money is spent--not only on his own pet projects but geographically. The Secretary of State has pointed out that he wants to deal with the regional imbalance in the distribution of lottery money, which has been mentioned this morning. By considering the distribution of money geographically, we are in danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water. The diversity inherent in voluntary and community initiatives will be removed, because they will not be considered on their merits.
<P>
The lottery was set up to stimulate community activity by creating the opportunity for local people to form groups, find matching funds and then apply for grants. There must be flexibility for that system to operate. That opportunity has been seized successfully throughout the country and many awards are made. We must be careful about tampering with that process.
<P>
The Government appear to believe that local initiatives can be imposed from the centre. That is a fundamental mistake. As I said on Second Reading, most of the 320 completed projects under the lottery sports fund concerned bricks and mortar, but we were told on Second Reading that we must invest in people. If we invest in bricks and mortar, we are investing in people by default; we must be mindful of that. People's participation has increased because of investment in bricks and mortar. The Bill does not take that into account.
<P>
By committing the distributing bodies to consider soliciting bids, the Government are increasing their own power. Demand for lottery grants will always exceed supply. The present approach has worked well; I do not want the Government to move the goalposts for their own purposes. If applications are solicited when there is no shortage of them, the lottery may start to become Government-led and operate at the whim and fancy of individuals, not for the good of the nation as a whole.
<P>
I should like to make a couple of quick points. There is a sixth good cause, as well as the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts. Because of the sixth cause, the original five causes' share will fall and they will lose out.
<P>
On Second Reading, we were informed that the original concept of the lottery and the money that it will raise will still be guaranteed. The lottery has exceeded expectations. The introduction of the sixth cause does not allow the original causes to achieve the full potential of the funds. They will get less--[Interruption.]

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Officers of the House will secure hon. Members' papers during their absence. Members and their staff are required to gather in New Palace Yard, adjacent to the fountain on the lawn opposite Members' Entrance. The Commitee is suspended for half an hour or until five minutes after the all-clear has sounded, whichever is later.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I shall not detain the Committee longer than necessary, given that I have to remember where I left off before we were suspended for the fire drill.
<P>
The Secretary of State said that he sees his role as restoring public confidence in the lottery. It is important to remember that the numbers of people playing the lottery and the prizes awarded have never been greater. All the evidence points to the fact that people are happy with the lottery without the Government meddling in it. The Bill's diversion of money to prop up Government spending threatens the principles on which the lottery is based.
<P>
I should like the Minister to consider four questions. What happens if proceeds exceed &#163;10 billion; will the good causes get the percentage suggested by the Bill, or will the Government take more money for the New Opportunities Fund? Can we have any confidence that the original good causes will get any more after 2001, when the current licence expires? Will the Government put any limit, in percentage terms, on the amount given to the new opportunities fund? If there is any shortfall in the money coming into the lottery so that the predicted &#163;10 billion is not achieved, will the Government still give &#163;1 billion to the New Opportunities Fund, which is effectively a public spending commitment? If they do so, the other good causes will take a further cut.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Diana Organ </B>(Forest of Dean): I welcome you as Chairman, Mr. Gale. There has been much talk about Committee virgins. I have never considered myself a Committee virgin; I have just been celibate until now.
<P>
I welcome the opportunity to sit on the Committee. Opposition Members have said that the lottery has been an overwhelming success and the hon. Member for Ashford said that the Bill implies that the lottery has been going wrong. I think that it has gone wrong in one or two areas. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser) also said that everyone was very happy with the national lottery. Some people in my constituency would thoroughly disagree with that. Communities can make successful bids and find matching funding if they are well-connected, well organised, experienced in making bids and have a network of partnerships. However, small villages in a rural area, such as the Forest of Dean, do not have such a network or such opportunities. It is all much easier if one comes from a leafy suburb or metropolitan area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I accept that some local communities are not as effective in presenting their case, but is it not more appropriate for the proposal for a locally-based initiative to come from that local community, rather than the Government pronouncing on what will and will not be funded?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Organ:</B> Small communities in areas such as the Forest of Dean want to come together, but have not had the experience of doing so. They therefore fail in their bid, through lack of assistance, support and expertise.
<P>
I shall give one specific example. I visited a small group of women in Joy's Green; a small, run-down estate with no community centre and no parish hall. The only building is an old school hall. The women wanted a community centre for luncheon clubs for elderly people and for scout and football club meetings. They wanted to extend and develop an area of the school that was not being used for educational purposes. They wanted to put together a lottery bid and they did not know how to do so. It was difficult for them to find a mechanism for coming together.
<P>
Three or four women on the estate were involved. They wanted to be able to offer a luncheon club facility for their friends and neighbours and for the disabled and elderly people around them. They were at a loss about what to do. The idea that they could come together and find matched funding for their very poor community was very difficult for them. They will especially welcome the fast-track, small communities grant in the reformed national lottery. It will give them the opportunity to put together the facility that they want.
<P>
It has been argued that the new thrust of the distribution is to carry out the Secretary of State's directions rather than to assist communities. I wholly disagree, partly because the distributing bodies are in favour of the extension of soliciting bids. Many small community groups, such as the one that I mentioned, welcome the change. They realise that distribution has not been the success that was spoken of this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I do not believe that the hon. Lady's remarks are entirely accurate. I shall quote again from the Sports Council's submission to me. It is clear that it does not agree, as a distributing body, with the hon. Lady's point. The submission states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe that the arm's length principle between government and the Lottery distributing bodies should be maintained, and that the new powers given to the Secretary of State to instruct us to `comply' with directions to delegate to specific organisations is too prescriptive.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Sports Council states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are also concerned that the powers on the Secretary of State to issue directions to us in relation to our distributing strategies should not be too prescriptive. Delegate bodies must demonstrate that they can effectively account for expenditure of lottery funds.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Organ:</B> That is not the point that I was making. Distributing bodies and local communities will welcome the new opportunity for soliciting of bids and the process not being driven by large organisations that are able to make large and successful bids. The Bill will bring bids through from the grass roots and enable a more even distribution of funds.
<P>
The Committee discussed the fact that funds have not been distributed evenly regionally. Distribution has been metrocentric, to use a rather ugly word. Funds have tended to go to large urban areas--the metrolands--rather than to small rural communities.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) said that the Bill will start pork barrel politics, with hon. Members grinding on the particular axes of their own constituencies. I intend to do that; it is part of my job. I am here to grind on and on and on for the people of my constituency to ensure that they get their fair share of national lottery funds. I make no apology for that, partly because people in rural areas such as the Forest of Dean have felt that they have been ignored in the distribution of funds. I intend to redress that imbalance.
<P>
A more strategic approach to the distribution of funds is important. Areas such as my constituency should have their fair share of lottery funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Thank you. I do not mean to keep intervening in your speech. I apologise for doing so a second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not making a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I beg your pardon--your comments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not commenting either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> The point has been made about whether applications might or might not be difficult to make. However, it is incumbent on hon. Members to help the communities that they serve. I have helped my community, and I would stongly recommend the hon. Lady to be at the forefront of any local initiative, rather than allowing the Government to tell her what to do in her community.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Organ:</B> I have helped many of the groups in my constituency with their lottery bids. However, I am talking about how such bids are initiated. Under the present regime, one or two people need only a small sum to assist their community, it is difficult for them to put together a bid and find matching funds. The small communities grant will assist such people in their applications.
<P>
The distribution of funds has been uneven. Those without the expertise needed to put together a bid and those who cannot enter an easy partnership with local authorities are losing out against other organisations that are far more experienced in such matters.
<P>
I welcome the fact that the distributing bodies can solicit bids. I am sure that that will benefit many rural areas, such as the Forest of Dean. It is inaccurate to say that the Bill will increase central control; it will give more control to small community groups in rural areas so that they can take forward their bids and share in the national lottery's success.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Prior </B>(North Norfolk): I am new to Standing Committees, so I am delighted that you, Mr. Gale, are chairing the first Standing Committee on which I have served. I welcome the outbreak of celibacy among the Labour Benches. I wonder whether candidates for mayor of London should take a vow of celibacy--that might thin out the field.
<P>
We must remember that the lottery has been a great success. Of course, we all accept that it can be improved, but there is cross-party consensus that it has performed well. Above all, there is consensus on two important principles, the first of which is that money for the good causes should be additional to normal Government spending. In rural constituencies such as mine, that has meant that many unfashionable projects, on which money would not normally be spent, have managed to raise significant sums. Projects such as a homeless centre in North Walsham or the environmental improvement of one of the broads would not normally have received money. It is a great tragedy that the principle of additionality will be compromised under the Bill.
<P>
The second important principle is that the money should be distributed independently of the Government so that they are unable to spend money on their own pet projects. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne mentioned pork barrel politics. It is odd that the Government, who are hell bent on removing beef from our menu, should put pork back on it in another guise. It is a great pity that the two important principles underlying the lottery--additionality and independence--are being compromised.

<B>Mr. Jim Murphy </B>(Eastwood): I have had the privilege of serving on previous Standing Committees. Indeed, this is the third Standing Committee on which I have served. I have also served on the Committees that considered the Bank of England Bill and the Finance (No. 2) Act 1997. On all three occasions, that privilege has been shared by the hon. Member for Ashford, who has spoken far more often than I have. Indeed, this is the first speech that I have made in any of the Standing Committees on which I have served. I do not know what that says about Standing Committees, the Whips or the way in which I have been virginal in my abstinence from speaking in debate. I spoke at some length on Second Reading--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is making his maiden speech in Committee; it would be nice if the Committee listened to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I found the spat between the hon. Member for West Suffolk and the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) about who had spoken longer on Second Reading interesting. I believe that I spoke for longer than both of them combined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> It felt like it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> It may have felt like it to my hon. Friend; it certainly felt like it to me. I took out my lottery ticket and regaled everyone with my numbers. Suffice it to say that I have not been successful since then with any of my numbers including in yesterday evening's draw. I have spent most of today trying a different lottery of 13 numbers, phoning France to try to get some world cup tickets. I understand that the odds of success are about 2.5 million to one. I do not expect to be in any way critical in Committee with the Minister for Sport in attendance, because I believe that the Committee will end well in advance of the world cup.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Given the accent in which the hon. Gentleman is making his most interesting speech, I can guarantee that he need not be interested in the world cup for very long.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) for that comment. I was full of great cheer for about 45 minutes last night. Until Alan Shearer performed his wizardry, I thought that my adopted second nation of Portugal was about to be successful. I will have at least three more adopted nations during the world cup.
<P>
I want to respond to comments made by the hon. Members for West Suffolk and for Ashford. The hon. Member for West Suffolk properly made great play of the issue of additionality, but then insisted on regaling us about the health crisis in his constituency concerning waiting lists. Perhaps disingenuously, he failed to mention that his health authority has received &#163;11.1 million in new money as a consequence of the Chancellor's actions, including more than &#163;120,000 for breast cancer care. We cannot ignore those figures, and the hon. Gentleman was disingenuous in claiming that there is a crisis in relation to the New Opportunities Fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I do not want to test your indulgence, Mr. Gale, because I dare say that we are getting lost in the woods on this issue. May I say frankly and directly to the hon. Gentleman--I mean this sincerely--that in aggregate, the Government are currently spending two thirds of the average spent during the preceding 18 years? In the county of Suffolk, taking inflation into account the settlement of 1.35 per cent. will probably amount to the first real terms cut in the NHS since its inception. That is an absolute disgrace.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. When an hon. Gentleman provokes another hon. Gentleman, it is customary for the Chair to allow the second hon. Gentleman to reply, and I have done so. The hon. Member for Eastwood made the point that he hoped that the Bill will be out of the Committee in time for the world cup. It would be nice, therefore, if we could at least complete the sittings motion this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I am not sure if the Committee will finish by the start of the world cup or by its completion.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk made a ponit about the New Opportunities Fund, and I was simply pointing out that the Government have already given additional funds to the health service. The hon. Gentleman ignored the fact that we have given more than &#163;500,000 to a new orthopaedic unit in his health authority.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford talked about his concern that organisations that currently receive lottery funds would no longer be successful as a consequence of the Bill. He is right to be vigilant about that matter, but his concern is ill-founded. We should principally be concerned about individuals who have never received lottery funding. The Bill will do much to address that concern.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mrs. Organ) commented at length on smaller voluntary organisations, so I shall merely say that I agree that they do not have access to the legal advice, support networks and opportunities enjoyed by larger, better-funded organisations. The Bill will make a significant change in that area and no member of the Committee, regardless of party or of the region of the country he or she represents, should ignore that. All parts of the country will benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grant:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I have not sat on a Standing Committee for some time--by choice, I hasten to add--but I know that we normally get parliamentary profiles of the Committee so that we know Members' interests and so on. I have not received one on this occasion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman raises a valid point, but the list of Committee Members is published in the Official Report and it is open to any hon. Member to scrutinise that and to undertake independent research on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grant:</B> It was the practice in the past to issue such profiles and I wondered if there had been a change.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have ruled on the point. Neither the Chairman nor the Officers of the House are responsible for the provision of profiles. As I said, it is open to hon. Members to look through the Register of Members' Interests or other information available in the Library on the basis of the list published in the Official Report. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to make such a contribution in the form of a speech, I should be delighted to hear him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grant:</B> I do not want to start by clashing with you, Mr. Gale, but I am surprised that you are adopting such a hostile attitude in response to a simple request for something that has been provided in the past. However, I accept what you say.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It has not happened in the past. It is not and never has been the custom or practice of the House to provide Members' profiles for the benefit of Members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grant:</B> That is news to me.
<P>
I had not intended to speak, but some comments made by Opposition Members have forced me to do so. I wish to begin by making two concessions: first, that the lottery has been a national success and secondly, that Camelot has made a good job of it, although if I were paid what they are paid, I too would make a good job of it, so there is nothing special about its performance.
<P>
However, the lottery needs reform and I welcome the opportunity to discuss that. One point that concerns me is the unequal distribution of lottery funding. I speak as someone who represents a London constituency that has suffered in the distribution, partly because other areas of London contain national institutions that have been funded by the lottery. I make no apology for supporting my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean by saying that I also intend to fight tooth and nail to get resources for my constituency. I make no apologies for that. Opposition Members are perpetrating the myth that the lottery is non-political and that it is operated on the arm's length principle. That is not true. The previous Secretary of State for National Heritage, the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey, was the chair of a major lottery committee and Conservative peers were chairs of other lottery committees. For people to tell me that such action is non-political does not wash. Furthermore, given that a former Conservative Member of Parliament, Mr. Winston Churchill, obtained &#163;13 million for the Churchill papers, there is no doubt that the lottery is political.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made the most appalling attack on the distribution bodies, not on Ministers in the previous Government. He is accusing those bodies of being unfair and politically biased. Indeed, he is coming close to accusing them of being corrupt. I should like to give him the opportunity to make it clear that he is not trying to attack the distribution bodies, which have done an extremely good job. During the past four years, they have helped millions of people throughout the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grant:</B> The hon. Gentleman can put the blame wherever it lies, but the lottery was not operated at arm's length under the previous Government. There were political appointees to the lottery board. The rich and famous have benefited from the lottery. For example, the American owner of a huge country mansion in Scotland received a tremendous handout from the lottery to repair his stately home. If that is not a political act, I do not know what is.
<P>
Let us consider the people who regularly play the lottery. They are from poor working-class areas and from ethnic minorities. By and large, rich people do not. There needs to be equalisation in the distribution of lottery funding.
<P>
The lottery has become a charter for professional people. An architect can make a huge killing out of it, as can a consultant. Apart from the charities board, if organisations want substantial sums from the lottery, they have to take on consultancy firms, which have sprung up everywhere, or a firm of architects and so on. That is a fact. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean that ordinary people from small community groups have taken a hell of a bashing from the lottery because, in some instances, they have not been able to afford the services of professionals and have not had access to lottery funds.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> A project in my constituency is seeking lottery funding to move a few yards inland an old lighthouse ``Belle Tout'', which is in danger of falling into the sea. Who does the hon. Gentleman suggest should be undertaking the calculations and the drawings for that scheme? Me?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grant:</B> If I had the hon. Gentleman's parliamentary profile, I would know what his professional position is. That is my point. I do not know the hon. Gentleman from Adam.
<P>
If a building is to be designed, there must be an architect--no one disputes that. It appeared under the lottery boards that unless people had such professional assistance, they would not receive lottery funding. That meant that there was a huge upsurge in the activity of consultants and architects, who became quite rich under the lottery.
<P>
The other problem that I have experienced with the lottery in my area is that of matched funding. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was concerned about that matter when he was shadow Secretary of State for National Heritage, as my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean mentioned. People who are poor, who are not necessarily able to organise themselves in the way that suits the lottery boards, have in some instances been required to obtain matched funding. That is a major problem, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider it.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Some people say that the lottery is a tax on poor people. I do not hold that view; it gives poor people an opportunity to dream that they can be rich. If people want to dream, that is fine by me. I play the lottery myself and if I win, I can assure the Committee that Conservative members of the Committee will not receive anything. I will not go round with a pot of money and hand it out to people. Conservative Members have been responsible for some difficulties with the lottery, for example Camelot and its subsidiary taking vast sums of money from the pockets of poor people.
<P>
I support the Bill and the New Opportunities Fund. The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts will be especially helpful for individuals in poor areas. I have no problem with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and his Ministers being in charge of the lottery and distributing money--one of the major points made by the hon. Member for West Suffolk. After all, they were elected by a large number of people and a large number of people support our policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kerry Pollard </B>(St. Albans): It is my first time in Committee and as a happily married man for 32 years with seven children, the concepts of celibacy and virginity are long gone for me.
<P>
Every Friday night, I shop at Savacentre, which is my local supermarket, and there is always a queue of people buying their lottery tickets. They are generally poor, working-class people who can ill afford lottery tickets and who are spending money that should go towards other things, but that is a matter for them. I have never bought a lottery ticket, although the lottery provides money for good causes. I want briefly to mention two of them.
<P>
I am a member of a group called Homes for Homeless People--a recognised national charity that provides care and support for people who have no roof over their head. Two years ago, we received a grant of about &#163;30,000 a year to open a national helpline for homeless people. That is working well, and we have received much support from those who administer the lottery, for which I am grateful.
<P>
I especially welcome the fast-track small communities grant. There is a small village called Bedmond which is half in the borough of Watford, half in the borough of Three Rivers and it is in my constituency of St. Albans--it falls between three stools. The village hall is falling down and needs to be put back together. Interestingly, Pope Adrian IV was born in Bedmond; it is the only place in England where a pope was born and bred. We want to commemorate Pope Adrian IV in the village hall, but it cannot obtain support because it does not fall into any of the categories that can be supported. The fast-track small communities grant will help such projects. I am pleased to support the motion and hope that the Committee will do so too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> This has been a good debate. More important, it has been good natured. Obviously, the debate on a sittings motion provides an opportunity to revisit Second Reading and Opposition and Labour Members have taken that opportunity enthusiastically. I do not intend to deal with all the points that hon. Members have raised because, as they are the essence of the Bill, we shall have a chance to return to them in considering the Bill, clause by clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne said that ``pork barrel'' was an American term. I can only assume that the suntan of the hon. Member for West Suffolk came from a boondoggle, to use another American term. He is suntanned and glowing--indeed, he looks as though he could be sitting on a sofa, introducing a early-morning television breakfast show.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk said that he expected good consideration of the Bill in Committee. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hove said, Committee is where the serious business on a Bill is done. We have to move away from the generalities and get down to the detail, and we shall do so. My hon. Friend also said that he hoped that the Bill would not leave the Committee unamended. There is no chance of that happening because the Government have tabled a series of amendments and--even with the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham--I expect there will be consensus on them.
<P>
Opposition Members repeatedly made the point that this is the people's--not the Government's--lottery. It has always been the people's lottery and the people want to change it. Hon. Members will know from experience that their constituents continually ask, ``Why can't the Government spend lottery money on the national health service?'' Indeed, it is hon. Members who tend to resist that; they know that we do not want to concede additionality. Indeed, we say that that is impossible. Additionality means that money is spent that the Government would not otherwise spend. Money could be spent on every area of expenditure, either by local authorities or by central Government.
<P>
The former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Huntingdon, said that, if the Conservative party had won the election, he would have used the lottery to put sports teachers into schools. That is fine. I am sure that we could have found a way to do that, but it would have been a breach of additionality.
<P>
I am not sure that anyone understands what additionality really means--we all seem to have our own definition. However, in the Government's definition, the lottery must not be used as a subsitute for central Government funding. If the Chancellor were to say, ``I'm cutting out an area of expenditure and we expect the lottery to act as a substitute'', it would be a clear breach of additionality and all parties would resist it.
<P>
It has been said that it is a Treasury lottery. I cannot think this now, but when the lottery was set up I thought that there would be only one clear winner each week--the Treasury, which takes 12 per cent. tax. Conservative Members had an opportunity not to give that 12 per cent. to the Treasury. They cannot expect us to take that money away from the Treasury, even though some of us--not necessarily me--might have thought it a good idea.
<P>
We are working with the legislation and distribution that we inherited. We are making changes where we divine them to be necessary, in response to criticism of the lottery. We accept that it has been a success. As Opposition Members have said, although it is a success story, no structure is incapable of improvement. That is what the Bill is all about. We expect Opposition Members to help us to improve the lottery.
<P>
With regard to pork barrel speeches on Second Reading and to hon. Members' attitudes, I accept that we fight for our own constituencies. I should tell Opposition Members that I receive letters--I would not call them begging letters--in almost equal proportion from Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour Members asking why schemes have not been funded and why they have been turned down. Hon. Members always want the lottery to fund schemes in our own constituencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Does the Minister not see the distinction between present circumstances and those thay may well apply when the Bill is enacted? At present, hon. Members can write to people saying that their concerns are matters for the distributing bodies. When the Bill is enacted, people will realise that writing to the Minister, having meetings and making representations through their Member of Parliament or otherwise will influence the decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> All hon. Members seek to influence. Hon. Members who want to get money from the lottery for a venture or scheme in their own constituencies should make as much noise as possible, so that the people who make the decisions at least hear their voices and may be influenced. That is all that any of us can do.
<P>
The Bill does not allow for the Secretary of State to require distributors to delegate or to solicit, as hon. Members have suggested. It does not contain a power of direction. Existing distributors and the new one will have the choice to use the powers, but they will do so only when they consider it appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> May I refer the Minister to the Bill? Clause 6 defines the New Opportunities Fund. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The New Opportunities Fund--
<P>
(a) may make grants out of any money they receive to fund or assist in the funding of projects, or
<P>
(b) may make or enter into arrangements,
<P>
which are designed to give effect to such initiatives concerned or connected with health, education or the environment as may from time to time be specified in an order made by the Secretary of State.''<P>

It is the thin end of the wedge.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Banks:</B> We shall come to that. The Opposition will table amendments with regard to that point. The Bill deals with general guidance. It does mean that the Secretary of State or Ministers will say to a distributor, existing or new, ``You will fund that''. The word ``may'' keeps coming into the matter. We will give guidance. Existing legislation allows a Secretary of State to give guidance. The specific decision making will remain with the lottery distributor.
<P>
I am conscious of what you said, Mr. Gale. I must respond to one or two other points.
<P>
We will come back to the question of good causes losing out time and again. The Government guarantee that each good cause will get the &#163;1.8 billion that they assumed that they would receive under the current licence. Existing legislation, passed by the previous Government, gave powers to vary the percentages that go to the various causes. The previous Government could have enshrined the percentage, but they did not seek to do so. That is perfectly right. They could also have given guarantees with regard to the length and to other aspects of the funding period. They did not, partly because Governments cannot bind their successors.
<P>
The Government's proposals are in keeping with the thinking and powers in the original legislation. The Conservative Government gave no guarantees to the good causes. This Government will seek to give as many assurances as we can during the passage of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southport said that the Bill will provide improvements and that any objective person examining it would only agree with him. The hon. Gentleman said that the lottery was successful, but that those who become involved in it are perhaps the least able to pay for it. That may be true, given the proportion of income spent, but the point of the good causes and the new good cause is to ensure that, when people gamble on the lottery, they know that they will be putting something back into their communities.
<P>
When people feel like that, they know that they are winning even if they do not get the big cash awards that my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham is looking to receive--as, indeed, am I. It would be a strange, but happy, coincidence if we both came up trumps during our proceedings on the Bill. I suspect that the Committee would then be deficient of two hon. Members, plus any other members that we might wish to take with us to our holiday island in the West Indies. I look to my hon. Friend to guide me as to the appropriate island to visit.
<P>
We want the lottery distributors to take a strategic view of the way in which lottery funds are distributed in answer to the criticisms made by people who play the lottery and those who observe it. A strategic view must be taken, otherwise we will run into difficulties. As the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said, we shall deprive communities that do not have the wherewithal to find matching funds and which are not well-heeled enough to do so. We must ensure a fair distribution of the money from the lottery and make certain that no one feels that he is precluded from receiving it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford referred to London receiving too much money from the lottery. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham mentioned certain parts of London that get too much. It is a fact that boroughs such as Westminster and Camden secure significant amounts of lottery funds, because huge, prestigious arts institutions are located within their boundaries. My hon. Friend knows, as I do, that we can attract significant funds to Haringey and Newham for sports distribution projects. My borough has done extraordinarily well in its applications for sports lottery funding. That was nothing to do with me--I wish that it were--but if my constitutents wish to interpret the position differently, I am happy for them to continue to delude themselves because that can only be to my benefit at the next general election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grant:</B> As for London, the fact that Camden and Westminster have national institutions within their boundaries means that the money is not benefiting London as such. People come from all over the country to visit those institutions. Does my hon. Friend understand what I mean?
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Absolutely. I made that point in response to those who say that London receives an unfair amount of lottery money. Because London is the capital city, it has to fund a range of services and facilities that other cities do not have to--it may have to fund a mayor when the matter has been decided after the referendum is held on 7 May. [Interruption.] Indeed, who knows who it will be? We shall no doubt return to that question.
<P>
In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood, who referred to tickets for the world cup, there will be no need to set up a hot line for tickets to gain admission to the Committee stage of the Bill. He might like to know that I am meeting Madame Buffet this afternoon, the appropriately named French Foreign Minister, when I shall put to her the various points that people have been making ad nauseam to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> For lunch?
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> No, I am meeting her apres lunch.
<P>
In conclusion, I look forward to our forthcoming lively Committee proceedings. How could I expect anything other than that, when my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham is a member of the Committee. We can always rely on his making a hard-hitting and controversial speech. To paraphrase the words of the Duke of Wellington, I do not know what effect he has on Opposition Members but, by God, he frightens me.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That during the proceedings on the National Lottery Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 5 to 7, Schedule 2, Clauses 8 to 11, Schedule 3, Clauses 12 to 24, Schedule 4, Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clauses 2 to 4, Clause 25, Schedule 5, Clause 26, new Clauses, new Schedules.<P>

<P>
Members of the Committee will be aware, from the announcement of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 1 April and from the Second Reading debate, that we propose to replace the Director General of the National Lottery with the new National Lottery Commission. The amendments giving effect to the proposal affect clause 1. Because the change is significant and to ensure that the Committee has sufficient time to consider and debate the amendments, I propose that we begin our consideration at clause 5 rather than clause 1. I hope that all members of the Committee have received the explanatory memorandum--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Just.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> I apologise for that; it was agreed only last night and we got it out as quickly as possible. However, that is another reason for accepting the order of consideration because it would give members of the Committee longer to consider.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> May I ask the Minister a simple question? He correctly stated that the Secretary of State said on 1 April that that was the direction in which he wished to travel in regard to the setting up of the commission and we had further details about that on 7 April. Why does the Minister seek to reposition the amendments on clause 1 from the beginning of our proceedings to the end?
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> I thought that I had explained: it will give us more time to consider that significant change. I should have hoped that Opposition Members would appreciate the reasoning behind the change, which arose out of developments in Camelot and the GTech case. If the hon. Gentleman reads the Secretary of State's Second Reading speech, he will see that he said that he had announced the setting up of the commission in a written answer. The Bill therefore needs to be changed and it is easier to do so by amendments, rather than by starting from the beginning with another Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Of course we shall examine the proposals carefully and doubtless agree with aspects of them. That is not the point at issue. The Minister has had plenty of time to prepare, yet I understand that the amendments were tabled only 48 hours ago--
<P>
<B>The Minister for Arts (Mr. Mark Fisher):</B> It takes time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that it takes time; the entire month of April could have been devoted to the matter.
<P>
We are not quarrelling with the substance of the order of consideration, but we believe that it is discourteous and unhelpful. It would have helped the smooth running of the Committee had the Minister not introduced it. Since 1 May, we have seen repeatedly that his Department's decisions have not been followed by any substance. Following the announcement before Christmas about the UK Sports Institute, for example, we now know that no contracts have been signed. We have seen a pattern of extremely flabby management in the Minister's Department and the present case is entirely characteristic. While we do not wish to delay proceedings by pressing the matter to a Division, we wish to make it absolutely plain that the Committee has not been treated appropriately. That is symptomatic of the Department's announcements and conduct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I totally dissociate myself from the remarks of the hon. Member for West Suffolk, who is once again showing signs of one-armed banditry. The attitude that he has struck is preposterous, and shows only how little he understands the ways of government and the need for proper deliberation and consultation when a major issue--regulation of the lottery--is being addressed by the Government in response to a fast-moving situation in which Camelot was taking over the shares in GTech. The hon. Gentleman is engaging in utterly ridiculous and irresponsible opposition. It is not without precedent to change the order of consideration of clauses in a Bill, and it is highly suitable to do so in this case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Banks:</B> I said that our deliberations on the sittings motion had been good natured, and it is a pity that the hon. Member for West Suffolk has proved me wrong so quickly. I have already apologised for what might be considered to be late delivery of explanatory memoranda. I reiterate that apology; no rudeness was meant to Conservative or other members of the Committee. We all have a part to play, and I have apologised for the fact that those papers were not in the Committee's possession earlier.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said, we were caught somewhat on the hop by the movements and developments within Camelot and we tried to respond as quickly and appropriately as possible. I cannot accept the strictures that the hon. Member for West Suffolk laid on us concerning the running of the Department. It is nonsense to suggest that because we have taken time to consider implications, that somehow means that we do not know our own minds or that we are being discourteous to hon. Members. The trouble with the previous Government was that they did too much stuff in a rush. Legislation was rushed through Parliament without full consideration, and repentance followed. We can all think of examples of that; I have a list as long as my arm of examples that show that it is better to delay in order to consider than to rush into legislation.
<P>
In those circumstances, I would hope that rather than seeing our proposal today as a discourtesy, the Committee would consider our proposal to have been tabled to facilitate better deliberations, so that when the Bill emerges from the Committee it is one to which we would all want to put our names.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 5 to 7, Schedule 2, Clauses 8 to 11, Schedule 3, Clauses 12 to 24, Schedule 4, Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clauses 2 to 4, Clause 25, Schedule 5, Clause 26, new Clauses, new Schedules.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Grant:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I now understand that the parliamentary profiles were provided by a different source. My confusion arose because they were placed on the table with the official documents. I apologise for any difficulties that I may have caused the Chair.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 9, in page 7, line 26, at beginning insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1) In relation to any sum that is paid into the Distribution Fund under section 21(2) of the 1993 Act after 31st December 2000, section 22(3)(e) of that Act shall have effect as if for ``on projects to mark the year 2000 and the beginning of the third millennium'' there were substituted ``on or connected with education, environment and public health, including children's play.<P>

<P></UL></FONT>
No. 8, in page 8, leave out lines 1 to 6.
<P>
No. 11, in page 8, leave out lines 12 to 14.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Obviously, we hope and intend to continue our discussions and analysis of the Bill in a friendly and constructive spirit. We are concerned and unhappy, but the Minister has apologised and we will now move on in what I hope is a constructive manner.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to give the Government the opportunity to honour their manifesto commitment on the lottery. We have heard a great deal from the Government about seeking to ensure that their manifesto commitments are carried out and we shall not get carried away with mentioning what they have failed to produce so far. The amendments are intended to honour a real manifesto commitment, rather than what has been passed off as one. That commitment was to create a new millennium fund--what is now called the New Opportunities Fund--to replace the existing millennium fund. The Labour party manifesto could not have been clearer. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Labour has already proposed a new millennium commission to commence after the closure of the Millennium Exhibition, to provide direct support for a range of education, environment and public health projects, including those directed at children's play''--<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a misprint on the Order Paper suggesting that the Committee will be sitting this afternoon. In fact, the Committee will observe the normal convention and not sit in the afternoon on the first day. That should give members of the Committee ample opportunity to study the papers.
