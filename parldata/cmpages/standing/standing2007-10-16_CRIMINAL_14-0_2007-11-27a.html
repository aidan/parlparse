rollercoaster ride to the end of the Bill. We are getting
there.</div>
					<a name="07112811000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind hon.
Members that the schedule relates to clause 74, which deals with
offences relating to the physical protection of nuclear material and
nuclear facilities. The amendments will ensure that the convention on
the physical protection of nuclear material, including the 2005
amendments thereto, is fully implemented into UK law. They will allow
prosecutions for incitement to commit offences against nuclear
facilities, as is required by the amended convention. However, in such
cases, it must be proved that the individual intended or believed that
the offence would be committed. If the offence is not committed as
incited, the inciter can still be prosecuted. They are basically
transitional arrangements until the Serious Crime Act 2007 comes into
force.</div>
					<a name="07112811000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
245 makes consequential amendments to the definition of convention
offences in schedule 1 to the Terrorism Act 2006. The amendment ensures
that the schedule accurately reflects the new list of offences that
will be set out in the amended Nuclear Material (Offences) Act 1983 and
Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column574" />Column number: 574</div>
					<a name="07112811000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
creates new criminal offences and extends existing ones under the
Nuclear Material (Offences) Act 1983, which is necessary for the UK to
ratify the 2005 amendments to the convention on the physical protection
of nuclear material. We are bringing UK law into line with certain
changes made to the convention.</div>
					<a name="07112811000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might help
if I give some background information on the changes. The convention
was concluded under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy
Agency in 1980. It came into force in 1987 and currently has just under
130 parties, of which the UK is one, having signed it in 1980 and
ratified it in 1991. The amended convention requires each state party
to establish, implement and maintain an appropriate physical protection
regime for civil nuclear material and facilities under its
jurisdiction, with the aim of protecting against theft, recovering
missing or stolen material, protecting material and facilities against
sabotage, and mitigating or minimising the radiological consequences of
sabotage. It also provides for co-operation between states in the event
of nuclear sabotage. It also incorporates a longer list of nuclear
offences than the original.</div>
					<a name="07112811000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
diplomatic conference of 2005 marked the end of a process initiated by
calls for amendment of the convention from the IAEA director general in
1999, and given impetus by enhanced concern for nuclear security
following the terrorist attacks in the United States in
September 2001.</div>
					<a name="07112811000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new and
extended offences cover the following broad areas of activity: misusing
nuclear material here or abroad intending damage to be caused to the
environment, or being reckless about whether it will be caused; doing
something outside the UK that involves moving nuclear material into or
out of a state without lawful authority; attacking a nuclear facility
here or abroad intending that damage will be caused to the environment
by exposure to radiation, or being reckless about whether such damage
will be caused; attacking a nuclear facility abroad and intentionally
or recklessly causing death, injury or damage to property as a result
of exposure to radiation; attacking a nuclear facility here or abroad,
intending that death, injury or property damage will be caused by
exposure to radiation, or being reckless about whether that is the
outcome, even if no such injury or damage
occurs.</div>

						<a name="07112811000905"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hollobone</b> (Kettering) (Con): Those are some very
serious offences. I have two questions. Why, at the end of 2007, are we
getting round for the first time to implementing what the convention
asked the Government to do about these very serious offences? Secondly,
how many of the 130 signatories have already passed the measures into
their
law?</div>
					<a name="07112811000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000906"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> State parties that have been involved in the
negotiation of the amendments will have their own ways
of extending the offences to be able to deal with the
issue. My understanding is that about 10 to 15 have managed to ratify,
so we are not that far behind. This is the first opportunity that we
have had to deal with the matter, which is why, although it is a
somewhat strange clause to include in this Bill, I hope that the
Committee will accept it. What is happening is about extending
co-operation across borders so that activities of the kind in question
can be clamped down on properly by the authorities, without running
into problems of jurisdiction, or of incompatible laws across state
boundaries, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column575" />Column number: 575</div>given that the relevant matters cross boundaries very easily. We are
fairly well up on the list of those who  have got around to
implementing the changes. It is simply a matter of appropriate
legislative vehicles, which, as I hope the hon. Gentleman understands,
can often be a
problem.</div>
					<a name="07112811000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman may know, the existing convention has largely been
about transport of nuclear material. It is partly the developments
since 2001, and the increased security that states have decided, for
obvious reasons, is required around nuclear material, that have led to
the diplomatic conference and the amended convention, which we want now
to implement. The director general of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, Mohamed el-Baradei, said of the amended convention:</div>
					<a name="07112811000775"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
new and stronger treaty is an important step towards greater nuclear
security by combating, preventing and ultimately punishing those who
would engage in nuclear theft, sabotage or even
terrorism.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is on that
basis that I commend the schedule and the amendments to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07112811000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07112811000907"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): I welcome you to
the Committee this afternoon, Mr. O&#146;Hara. Do not the
provisions show the extraordinary nature of the Bill&#151;that part 6
can go from extreme pornography to prostitution and street offences,
and then to protection of nuclear material in a universal jurisdiction?
Later, of course, we shall go on to consider the penalties for
unlawfully obtaining personal data. All that is included in a single
part of the Bill&#151;a Bill without a theme, as has been
said.</div>
					<a name="07112811000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some questions on the schedule. I thought that I would be
extraordinarily clever, but it turns out that I am not. I was going to
query the word &#147;nuclide&#148; in proposed new subsection (8)
of section 6 of the Nuclear Material (Offences) Act 1983, because I had
always used the word &#147;nucleide&#148; when I learned chemistry
many years ago, and I thought it was a misprint, but it turns out that
they have changed the word. I hope that I shall get the credit at least
for having done my research to ensure that I did not query the use of a
word whose usage had changed. I should probably blame the Americans for
eliding the perfectly serviceable word &#147;nucleide&#148; into
&#147;nuclide&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112811000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
is extraordinary in the context of British law, which is not to say
that I shall argue against it. The measure provides universal
jurisdiction, which is familiar in American law, but which is rarely
used in this country. It does not matter where offences occur&#151;it
could be anywhere in the world&#151;they will be indictable in a
British court, and it will not matter who in the world is alleged to
have committed offences because anyone can be tried for them in a
British court. It is a substantial undertaking. A matter that has no
connection to the United Kingdom or any of its subjects could be put
before a British court. We should at least be aware of the breadth of
the applicability of the schedule as we debate it.</div>
					<a name="07112811000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also
address one specific measure in the schedule. Paragraph 6 on page 186
deals with nuclear facilities, which are explicitly defined
as</div>
					<a name="07112811000776"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a facility used for
peaceful purposes&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column576" />Column number: 576</div>
					<a name="07112811000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, a facility is excluded if
it is not used for peaceful purposes, which is to say</div>
					<a name="07112811000777"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if it contains any nuclear
material which is used or retained for military
purposes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">That proposal
seems to be an oddity. If a nuclear facility can in any way be
described as having a military application, either in itself or any
material contained in the facility, it falls outside the scope of the
offence and of the legislation.</div>
					<a name="07112811000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">It raises
some interesting questions of applicability. For example, what about
the nuclear facilities that we believe are being built in Iran. The
President of Iran tells us that the facilities are being built
exclusively for peaceful purposes, which would make removal of material
from those facilities an offence under the schedule. On the other hand,
the Government&#146;s position is that the facilities are not for
peaceful purposes; rather, they have a military purpose, in which case,
in a British court, it could be adduced that they do not fall within
the definition because some would argue that they have a military
utility.</div>
					<a name="07112811000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There might
be a perfectly proper reason for the specific definition, but it seems
curious and perhaps less well specified than it might
be.</div>
					<a name="07112811000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000908"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> The reason is perfectly simple: the convention does
not apply to military sites or materials, so the measures cannot do so.
We are simply amending the convention as all agree it should be
amended, which does not relate to military
facilities.</div>
					<a name="07112811000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000909"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am simply making the point that that exclusion
makes it more difficult to bring an effective prosecution. There will
be grey areas of definition. For instance, is a civilian institute that
uses nuclear material to develop nuclear safety and protection for our
troops in the field a peaceful or a military institution? It is
difficult to establish on which side of the line such an institution
will lie in terms of the definition. It would in some respects be a
purely defensive, almost academic institution, but it would use the
research that it undertook for military purposes&#151;the proper
protection of our servicemen and women when they are in the
field&#151;and therefore fall foul of the
clause.</div>
				
					<a name="07112811000855"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07112811000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am simply saying that however well the provision may have read in the
treaty and in the convention, in British law it is a bit of a nonsense.
We should at least be aware that we are passing nonsense, even if we
think it a good idea to pass the nonsense to bring ourselves into line
with our international obligations.</div>
					<a name="07112811000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point
is made in response to the intervention by the hon. Member for
Kettering. There have been perfectly good previous statutory and
legislative vehicles for the measure. If it was agreed in 2005, we have
had anti-terrorism legislation that could easily have been used for the
purpose, raising the question why the Government did not feel it
necessary to enact the measure until now, in this compendious
cornucopia that we call the Criminal Justice and Immigration
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112811000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07112811000910"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): I want to ask the
Minister a couple of questions. We must be careful when we extend the
jurisdiction of our courts to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 577</div>extraterritorial offences, although I fully accept that it is necessary,
for example, to protect our armed forces from charges under this aspect
of the Bill in the event of our being at war. It raises the question
whether anybody who does anything against us, albeit in the course of a
military conflict, is protected from prosecution. I presume that they
are, unless the Secretary of State issues a certificate exempting them
from the protection. Let us not worry about that too much,
however.</div>
					<a name="07112811000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
I really want to ask is this. Assuming that the offence is committed
overseas, but by virtue of the Bill is prosecutable in this
jurisdiction, would our prosecutors wait to see whether the country
where the act took place prosecuted, and prosecute in this country only
if there were no prosecution in the country where the act took place?
Alternatively, would there or could there be a prosecution in
both?</div>
					<a name="07112811000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000911"></a>Maria

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000913"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> In that case, the hon. and learned Gentleman has
been remarkably succinct, for which I thank him. His
first scenario is correct: we would wait to see whether there were a
prosecution in the jurisdiction where the event took place. If there
were not, and we had the person in our grasp, the prosecution could be
undertaken in this
country.</div>
					<a name="07112811000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have dealt to the extent that I can with the points that the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome made. I cannot extend the
convention&#146;s reach beyond that for which it was originally
negotiated, so it is not possible for the offences, which are an
amendment to the convention, to range more widely than its ambit. In
that sense, parameters have been drawn. He may not like the fact
that&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>He is chuntering, so he obviously
has not received a good enough answer.</div>
					<a name="07112811000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000914"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but that
argument is demonstrably not true. We are bound by our signing of the
convention to put into effect that which is in the convention. Our
signing does not limit us to that which is in the convention if it is
better to extend it through statute law in this
country.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000915"></a>Maria

						</b> No, indeed. However, the hon. Gentleman may recall
my saying that the clause is designed to put into effect the amendments
to the convention&#151;simply that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000917"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> If the hon. Gentleman will give me a moment to
finish my sentence, I shall happily give way to him.</div>
					<a name="07112811000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
commenting on the range and ambit of the entire policy; I am simply
saying that the clause and schedule 15 are about implementing the
offences that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 578</div>we must implement to ratify the amended convention. That is simply what
the Bill does, and in that sense I do not seek to go further. In the
broader policy sense, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is
perfectly right to say that, if one wished to apply offences to a wider
range of activities or places, Parliament could do
that&#151;Parliament is sovereign&#151;but that is not what we are
seeking to do in the Bill. There is not much more I can say about
that.</div>

Howarth:
						</b> I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary
answered a general question, either now or later. Does the treaty
require the regime of conclusive certifying by the Secretary of State?
If it does not, the question arises whether that is the right
approach.</div>
					<a name="07112811000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I put a hypothetical case to the Under-Secretary? It may be fanciful,
given present Government policy, but a future Government might take a
different view. Let us say that a country&#151;perhaps the United
States&#151;bombed an Iranian nuclear facility. If the question
whether that was an action by armed forces arose and, for some reason
best known to the Government of the day, the Secretary of State refused
to issue a certificate under the appropriate section&#151;new section
3A to the Nuclear Material (Offences) Act 1983, inserted by paragraph 5
of the schedule&#151;there would then be a question whether the
facility was military or peaceful. That matter is also, as I understand
it, to be determined conclusively by the Secretary of State. A future
Secretary of State could determine conclusively that such a facility
was not military and was therefore peaceful. At that point, the armed
forces of the other country would become subject to the universal
jurisdiction that my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome
mentioned and a case in the British courts becomes a
possibility.</div>

							<a name="07112811000924"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I want to discuss an anomaly that arises between
the current civil liability under the Data Protection Act 1998, section
55, and the intended criminal liability that will emerge from clause
75, if and when it becomes the law of the land.</div>
					<a name="07112811000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I have
an interest, or used to have an interest, in this area of the law. I
want to talk particularly about journalistic endeavour and activity, so
I am speaking as someone who acts for and against newspaper
journalists, publishers of one sort of another and it is right that I
should put that on the record.</div>
					<a name="07112811000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
want to clarify a point that the Under-Secretary of State for Justice
and I were discussing last week on the nature of the privilege that
attaches to fair and accurate reports of the proceedings of Parliament.
She was correct to say that in relation to Parliament, even
contemporaneous fair and accurate reports are covered only by qualified
privilege. However&#151;this is where I confess to the
confusion&#151;judicial proceedings, when reported fairly, accurately
and contemporaneously are covered by absolute privilege. Since we last
met to discuss that subject I have yet to find a logical explanation of
that difference; I think that it is one of those historical accidents
where the statute law, which has amended the common law, has not caught
up with itself. There may come a time when it does. I am happy to
correct my earlier mistake.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 580</div>
					<a name="07112811000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I approach
this discussion purely from the angle of journalistic activity; I am
not concerned with discussing the fiasco over the data issues relating
to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, which is causing the
Government and the Chancellor of the Exchequer rather a lot of
embarrassment. I am not talking about data theft by malevolent people
who wish to mine other people&#146;s data sources and make improper
use of data and sell it. Other occasions may come when others will want
to talk about the Chancellor, the HMRC fiasco and so on, but today I do
not want to deal with that.</div>
					<a name="07112811000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000925"></a>The

						</b> As long as they are in order when they do so,
they
may.</div>
					<a name="07112811000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000926"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> When I said &#147;on other
occasions&#148;, I meant on other parliamentary occasions. If others
want to talk about it and they are in order today, I am sure that you
would be very pleased to hear what they have to say, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, but I say for the third or fourth time that I am
specifically referring to journalistic activity.</div>
					<a name="07112811000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
necessarily a surprising thing to do because the Human Rights Act 1998
makes specific reference to journalistic activity. When we have a
collision, as we frequently do, between competing rights&#151;the
right of free expression and the right of privacy&#151;it is
important that we as law makers get it right when we have the
opportunity. Certainly under the common law, but now under the European
convention where articles 8 and 10 come into play, there is that
dispute between free expression and privacy. Under clause 75 and the
underlying legislation, the Data Protection Act 1998, we have a similar
collision.</div>
					<a name="07112811000856"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07112811000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State for Justice has acknowledged that difficulty.
Recently&#151;I do not know when; I should have checked, but it may
well have been on Second Reading&#151;he said that there were
concerns about the misuse of personal data and that new rules in the
Bill had caused concern because they might impede legitimate
investigative journalism. As far as I can remember, he did not come up
with any solutions for dealing with that difficulty. Relatively
recently&#151;in October&#151;the Prime Minister also acknowledged
it. You will remember, Mr. O&#146;Hara, that the Prime
Minister appointed the editor of the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i>, Paul Dacre to
review the 30-year rule on releasing secret papers. In a speech on
liberty in modern Britain, the Prime Minister also said that a review
of data protection law would be carried out by the Information
Commissioner, Mr. Richard Thomas, who will also seek to
protect legitimate investigative journalists from a planned crackdown
on the trade in personal data, such as bills and health records. The
Prime Minister announced a three-month public consultation on extending
the scope of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which allows the
public to request confidential information from public
bodies.</div>
					<a name="07112811000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why has
clause 75 been made part of the Bill before the consultation process
that was announced in October by the Prime Minister is completed? The
answer to that may well be, as it so often is, that Bills are not
implemented. Therefore, if this provision is passed into law, it may
not be implemented until after the consultation process is complete. If
it is, I suspect that the Government are putting the cart before the
horse.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column581" />Column number: 581</div>
					<a name="07112811000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we want,
certainly in relation to journalistic activity, is a proper balance and
sense of proportion. The Bill should allow for vigorous, journalistic
and investigative activity which is in the public interest, and/or
which the investigating journalist considers to be in the public
interest during his investigation, while at the same time affording all
proper protection to the data subject.</div>
					<a name="07112811000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, since 2004 there have been 26 prosecutions under section
55 of the Data Protection Act 1998, brought by the Information
Commissioner. Of those prosecutions, only four have been in the Crown
court&#151;the others have all been in the magistrates
courts&#151;and only two have resulted in fines of more than
&#163;5,000. Where is the pressing social need to introduce, on
summary conviction, a term of imprisonment &#147;not exceeding 12
months&#148;, or</div>
					<a name="07112811000778"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
fine not exceeding the statutory maximum,
or...both&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">but,
&#147;on conviction on indictment&#148;&#151; in the Crown
court&#151;</div>
					<a name="07112811000779"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;imprisonment for a term not
exceeding two years&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112811000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
an unlimited fine? We must ask whether this measure is necessary and
proportionate when we are dealing with legitimate investigative
journalism, and when there is a difference between the civil and the
criminal regimes&#151;the civil regime as it currently is, and the
criminal regime as it is intended to be under the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112811000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">In making
these remarks, I am relying upon assistance from the Newspaper
Publishers Association, the Newspaper Society, the Periodical
Publishers Association, the Scottish Newspaper Publishers Association
and the Society of Editors. They have responded to the consultation
paper, &#147;Increasing penalties for deliberate and wilful misuse of
personal data&#148;, issued by the Government and the Information
Commissioner. My concern, which is both informed by my own practical
experience as a newspaper lawyer and based upon the advice of those
groups, is that to introduce without justification a disproportionate
sanction capable of discouraging the press from investigating matters
of legitimate public concern, could have chilling effect on press
freedom in this country.</div>
					<a name="07112811000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000927"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> Does the hon. and learned Gentleman not believe
that the defences already available under section 55 of the Data
Protection Act are adequate? Is he just making the point about a
chilling effect, or is he saying that the defences available are not
sufficient to enable journalists to pursue legitimate matters of public
interest?</div>
					<a name="07112811000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000928"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> As I hope to explain as I develop my case, there
is a distinction between the defences available at criminal law and at
civil law. It seems to us that there should be no higher test in
defending a criminal prosecution than in resisting liability under a
claim for civil compensation. The Minister will know that a charge can
be defended under section 55(2)(d) of the Data Protection Act when it
can be shown</div>
					<a name="07112811000780"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that in the
particular circumstances the obtaining, disclosing or procuring was
justified as being in the public
interest.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">That language
is to be contrasted with the language in section 32(1) of that Act,
which states that the requirement for exemption from civil liability
depends upon a journalist showing that he reasonably believed that
publication would be in the public interest.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 582</div>
					<a name="07112811000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difference
in statutory language between those two sections produces the bizarre
result that if a journalist investigating accusations of improper
conduct, for example by a business man or a senior politician,
proceeded in the honest and reasonable but mistaken belief that
publication would be in the public interest, he would be able to
establish an exemption from civil liability but not a defence against a
criminal charge arising from the same facts. That anomaly, to which I
referred at the outset, is a matter of serious concern. It will be
significantly more serious if clause 75 is accepted and increases the
penalty for offences under section 55 of the Data Protection Act from a
fine to a sentence of
imprisonment.</div>
					<a name="07112811000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to the Minister&#146;s points, every newspaper or magazine
publisher is a data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection
Act. Many journalists, particularly those operating on a freelance
basis, are also data controllers for the purposes of that Act. The
courts have held that the operations involved in producing a printed
newspaper using electronic equipment inevitably amount to processing of
data for the purposes of the Act and that that processing will include
the acquisition, recording and use of information by journalists. Under
the provisions of the Act, such processing may potentially give rise to
both civil and criminal liability.</div>
					<a name="07112811000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Civil
liability may arise if the publisher or journalist breaches the
statutory duty imposed by section 4(4) of the Act, which requires
compliance with the data protection principle set out in part I of
schedule 1. The Court of Appeal has recognised that in the operations
required for the production and publication of a
newspaper,</div>
					<a name="07112811000781"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it will be
impractical to comply with many of the data processing
principles.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
follows that publishers and journalists are likely to incur civil
liability for breaches of the Data Protection Act unless the exemption
relating to journalism provided by section 32 can be
invoked.</div>
					<a name="07112811000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Naomi Campbell case against Mirror Group Newspapers&#151;I do not
know whether the Minister remembers it&#151;the Court of Appeal held
that the provisions of section 32 of the Act
provide</div>
					<a name="07112811000782"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;widespread
exemption from the duty to comply with the provisions that impose
substantive obligations upon the data
controller&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112811000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that
that widespread exemption applied both before and after publication. In
practical terms the effect of section 32, as interpreted by the Court
of Appeal in the case of Campbell, is to make available an exemption
from civil liability for publishers and journalists, subject only to
the following simple conditions set out in section 32(1)(b) and (c):
first, that</div>
					<a name="07112811000783"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the data
controller reasonably believes that, having regard in particular to the
special importance of the public interest in freedom of expression,
publication would be in the public interest&#148;;</div>
					<a name="07112811000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">and secondly,
that</div>
					<a name="07112811000784"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the data controller
reasonably believes that, in all the circumstances,
compliance&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">with the data
protection principles is incompatible with the purposes of journalism.
The vital words contained in those conditions
are</div>
					<a name="07112811000785"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the data controller
reasonably
believes&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112811000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of those words is that to invoke the exemption, the data
controller does not have to prove that the publication to which the
process relates would be in the public interest, only that he
&#147;reasonably believes&#148; that it would be in the public
interest.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column583" />Column number: 583</div>
					<a name="07112811000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
acknowledges the reality of deadline journalism. In the early stages of
investigating a story, there may be reasonable grounds to believe that
publication would be in the public interest, although it may ultimately
transpire after full investigation that that is not so. It also avoids
the imposition of civil liability on the journalist who honestly and
reasonably, but mistakenly, believes that publication would be in the
public interest.</div>
					<a name="07112811000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
importance of that approach and the latitude that it allows to
responsible journalists was expressly recognised by the then
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office Department, the right hon.
Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth),
in the Standing Committee that scrutinised the Data Protection Bill. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07112811000786"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
the high importance of freedom of inquiry and expression to our
society, we must, on balance, favour publication, subject to reasonable
restraint on the journalist's actions. The present test has been
designed with some care to do that. Of course journalists might get it
wrong that is in the nature of things. But they need to get it
significantly wrong before the law should intervene...We should
maintain a proper emphasis on freedom of expression&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 21 May 1998; c.
213.]</div>
					<a name="07112811000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what the then
Minister said when dealing with the civil regime under the 1998
Act.</div>
					<a name="07112811000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
it is obvious that potential criminal liability might have more serious
consequences for a journalist than potential civil liability, one would
expect the same or a greater degree of latitude to be offered to a
journalist in the provisions of the Act relating to criminal liability,
but that is not the case, as we know. Section 55(1) of the Data
Protection Act makes it a criminal offence for a person
to</div>
					<a name="07112811000787"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;knowingly or
recklessly, without the consent of the data
controller&#151;</div>
					<a name="07112811000788"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) obtain or
disclose personal data or the information contained in personal data,
or</div>
					<a name="07112811000789"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
procure the disclosure to another person of the information contained
in personal
data&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112811000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
investigative journalists may often obtain information directly or
through a source without seeking the consent of the data controller
holding the data containing that information. One has only to 
take the common example of an investigation into allegations of
improper or unethical practices within a business organisation. Such a
story could not be investigated effectively, particularly if a source
within the business organisation was involved, without risking criminal
liability under section 55 of the 1998 Act. Obtaining the information
will almost certainly also give rise to potential civil liability, as
it will be impracticable to comply with the data protection principles.
The journalist will be able to invoke the provisions of section 32 to
secure exemption from civil liability on the grounds that he reasonably
believes that publication would be in the public interest, so why
should he not also have at least the same level of protection from
potential criminal liability arising from the same
facts?</div>
					<a name="07112811000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
anomaly is a matter of serious concern as the Act stands, and it will
be exacerbated by implementation of clause 75. I have informed the
Committee of the genesis or origin of those concerns, which I share,
both as a newspaper lawyer and as a citizen. As I understand it, we
have yet to see&#151;certainly the people advising me on the issue
have yet to receive&#151;a rational response to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 584</div>their concerns, which they have passed to the Government. I shall leave
it to the Minister to explain the Government&#146;s response to my
points, although I am sure that I know what it
is.</div>
					<a name="07112811000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
the imprisonment sanction will have the chilling effect that the
Minister mentioned in her intervention. To introduce imprisonment for
investigative journalists who obtain information without the consent of
the data controller who holds the data containing that information in
circumstances when the journalist may be unable to establish that the
obtaining was justified in the public interest is self-evidently
capable of discouraging the press from actively pursuing the
investigation of allegations raising matters of legitimate public
interest, and accordingly is capable of having a chilling effect on
press freedom.</div>

Garnier:
						</b> No they are not. This is a public duty, which I
enjoy.</div>
					<a name="07112811000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my view,
it follows that the introduction of custodial sentences for section 55
offences committed by journalists is capable of interfering with their
article 10 rights. Accordingly, under the consistent jurisprudence of
the European Court of Human Rights, the introduction of those sanctions
cannot be justified, unless there is a pressing social need and the
interference is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
Furthermore, the reasons for introducing those sanctions must be
relevant and sufficient.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 585</div>
					<a name="07112811000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The inclusion
of a penalty of imprisonment within the civil liability deterrent
regime has not been shown to be a necessary response to any pressing
social need, or to be proportionate or otherwise justified. I said at
the beginning of my remarks that there have been only 26 prosecutions
under section 55 of the 1998 Act and that only two of those resulted in
fines of more than &#163;5,000. If that is correct, and on the facts
as we know them, there does not seem to be a need to ratchet up the
criminal regime so
dramatically.</div>
					<a name="07112811000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to the Government&#146;s response to the consultation process, or at
least to the remarks from the groups that I mentioned before&#151;the
editors and so forth&#151;they do not expect the number of
prosecutions to increase if custodial sentences are made available. It
must follow, therefore, that the prosecution of offences has not been
discouraged by the lack of custodial sentences. Furthermore, in view of
the few prosecutions that have taken place, the penalties imposed have
tended to be modest fines&#151;some in the low hundreds&#151;even
though a conviction on indictment makes an unlimited fine
available.</div>
					<a name="07112811000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The facts and
arguments that I have presented to the Committee suggest that existing
penalties are more than sufficient to deal with offences under section
55. On that basis, I urge the Government to rethink clause
75 and to consider whether their proposals are necessary and
justified.</div>
					<a name="07112811000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000931"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I have been listening intently and shall try to
deal with the points that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough
made. However, it might be helpful if first I set out what we are doing
in clause 75 and
why.</div>
					<a name="07112811000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause amends section 60 of the Data Protection Act 1998 to increase
the penalties for offences under section 55 of the Act to allow for a
period of imprisonment of six months in a magistrates court up to two
years on indictment. It increases the current penalty, as the hon. and
learned Gentleman said, which is limited at present to fines in either
a magistrates or Crown
court.</div>
					<a name="07112811000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
55(1) and (3) of the Act provide that a person is guilty of an offence
if they knowingly or recklessly, without the consent of the data
controller, obtain or disclose or procure the disclosure of personal
data to another person. Section 55(4) and (5) provide that a person is
guilty of an offence if they sell or offer to sell personal data
obtained in breach of section
55(1).</div>
					<a name="07112811000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to make it absolutely clear that the origin of the clause has
nothing to do with trying to create a chilling effect on the legitimate
activity of investigative journalism. It has nothing to do with that at
all. The Information Commissioner&#146;s report &#147;What price
privacy? The unlawful trade in confidential personal
information&#148;, which was laid before Parliament on 10 May 2006,
highlighted the extent of the illegal trade in personal data and
recommended custodial sentences for offences relating to its misuse, as
the existing financial penalties were not sufficiently protecting
individuals&#146;
rights.</div>
					<a name="07112811000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
24 July 2006, the Government published a consultation paper
&#147;Increasing penalties for deliberate and wilful misuse of
personal data&#148;. They invited comments on proposals to increase
the penalties available to include 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column586" />Column number: 586</div>custodial sentences. The consultation closed on 30 October 2006. The
majority of responses&#151;not all of them&#151;welcomed the
introduction of custodial penalties to provide a greater deterrent to
potential offenders and public reassurance that offenders would receive
the appropriate sentence, and to achieve parity with several disparate
pieces of legislation that deal with similar types of
offence.</div>
					<a name="07112811000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the origin of clause 75. I reiterate that the intention is not to
try to undermine or chill in any way legitimate investigative
journalism, nor do we wish inadvertently to cause problems in that
regard. As the Committee will be aware, the clause does not create any
new criminal offences. The hon. and learned Gentleman did not say that
it did&#151;I am not suggesting that he said
that.</div>

							<a name="07112811000933"></a>Maria
Eagle:

I do sometimes read out paragraphs, but I am not doing so at present.
The hon. and learned Gentleman was doing a fair amount of reading
himself. I am sure that it was stuff that he had prepared
earlier.</div>
					<a name="07112811000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not creating a new criminal offence.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> Everyone is chuntering this
afternoon, Mr. O&#146;Hara. It must be something to do
with the time. In any event, I shall try to deal with some of the
points that the hon. and learned Gentleman
made.</div>
					<a name="07112811000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not creating a new criminal offence. As a result of the process, we
are increasing the penalty because we have been convinced that we need
to do so. I do not want us to have too arcane an argument, but the hon.
and learned Gentleman suggested that the defence for the civil offence
under section 32 of the 1998 Act was of a higher threshold than the
defence for the criminal offence under section 55. I am not convinced
of that. We could debate exactly where the threshold is, but the point
of much of what he was saying was bound up in that. If there are civil
and criminal penalties for similar offences, one can understand why the
threshold for the civil offence ought to be lower than for the criminal
offence. That is common sense under our system of
law.</div>
					<a name="07112811000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
sections 32 and 55 of the 1998 Act are different in numerous respects.
Section 32 gives media organisations exemption from some parts of the
Act that apply to them as data controllers. It exempts them from most
of the data protection principles and certain other provisions of the
1998 Act if, after due regard to the public interest and freedom of
expression and publication, they reasonably believe that publication is
in the public interest.</div>
					<a name="07112811000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 55,
however, is not about the normal business of being a newspaper in the
same way. It concerns a wilful obtaining, disclosing or procuring of
information without the data controllers&#146; consent. The
prohibitions in this section apply equally to everyone, as do the
defences listed in 55(2). Section 55(2)(D) requires that the knowing or
reckless obtaining, disclosing or procuring of information without the
consent of the data controller to be justified in the public
interest.</div>
					<a name="07112811000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purposes of those two provisions are very different. Section 32 ensures
that the data protection principles do not prevent or inhibit
responsible journalism, while 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 587</div>section 55 ensures that the prohibition on the misuse of personal data
does not prevent disclosures that are in the public interest. The
Government do not believe that it is necessary to amend section 55 and
to extend the exemption in section 32. We are not proposing to
criminalise any behaviour that is not currently against the law. The
section 55 offence with its public interest and other defences is a
proportionate measure to deal with the risk to people&#146;s
privacy.</div>
					<a name="07112811000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that not everyone will agree with that. The hon. and learned
Gentleman set out in great detail the reasons why he does not. Let me
assure him that there is no intention to create a chilling effect, and
to inhibit in any way responsible investigative journalism. Not
everyone accepts that there would be a chilling effect. When the
Committee on Culture, Media and Sport was considering self-regulation
for the press, it looked at this provision and suggested that the
penalty did not have a chilling effect, and it welcomed the amendment.
There are other reasons of public policy for signalling very strongly
that the obtaining and selling of public or private data is not only a
breach of human rights, but a matter that causes a great deal of damage
and it ought to be treated as seriously as the provision
suggests.</div>
					<a name="07112811000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. and learned Gentleman knows, because of his close interest in
this matter, there have been meetings between newspapers and various
interests who believe very strongly what he, the former Lord
Chancellor, former Ministers and the Department for Constitutional
Affairs put forward in respect of this. I am not saying that we will
all agree, but we have considered the matter very carefully. We believe
that the current clause is correct. While I am not promising to make
any changes, I am perfectly happy to look very closely at what has been
said today. I do not feel convinced that the hon. and learned Gentleman
is right, but I will look very closely at what he has said and talk to
him and the Newspaper Society further about it. However, we believe
that clause 75 is the right provision. I have heard what the hon. and
learned Gentleman has had to say, but I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

position?</div>
					<a name="07112811000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are a number of illogicalities and inconsistencies in the
Government&#146;s approach. It may be that in the rush to make laws
and so forth, No. 10 is not talking to the Ministry of Justice and vice
versa. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I interpret what the Minister of State is
saying and that is not in the least bit unusual. It is interesting that
the Prime Minister has said that he wants a further consultation period
and an investigation or inquiry into the way in which the Freedom of
Information Act and its provisions work and has asked Paul Dacre, the
editor-in-chief of the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i> to chair that
investigation.</div>

deliberately ill-motivated conduct by data processors&#151;I would
call it Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs&#146; story and the
Minister will doubtless hear more of it in due course because the

said all that, I am grateful to the Minister for indicating that she
would be prepared to read carefully the report of our discussions with
her officials and the Department&#146;s lawyers, and also for
offering me the opportunity to have further meetings with the Fleet
Street Lawyers&#146; Society. I mentioned Alastair Brett, who is the
secretary of that group; he is also legal manager of <i class="I">The Times
</i>newspaper group, so I am talking about major media operators, not
irresponsible, dodgy, fly-by-night members of the yellow press. Such
people have a legitimate and responsible attitude toward both the need
to protect people&#146;s privacy and the need to take a proper
interest in maintaining, and fighting hard for, the fundamental right
of freedom of
expression.</div>
					<a name="07112811000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall take up the Minister&#146;s offer and get back to those who
have been in touch with me to see whether they would like to meet the
Minister. Perhaps meetings can take place between now and Report, or at
least before the Bill leaves this House and goes to the other place. I
am reasonably sure that the clause will receive close attention in the
other place, whose Members will not be under the same time constraints
as us. I suspect that that will be the case because Lord Lester of
Herne Hill was very busy during the deliberations on the Human Rights
Act 1998 when discussing journalistic endeavour, as was my noble Friend
Lord Fowler, who is both an ex-journalist and a newspaper executive.
There 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column589" />Column number: 589</div>will be plenty of interest in the clause in the other place, so it would
be useful if the Minister would hold those meetings before the Bill

Cohen:
						</b> My amendments are probing
amendments, although they are a little radical. At least one of them
would wipe out clauses 83 to 102, which I thought might appeal to my
hon. Friend the Whip, as well as  to other members of the
Committee, because it would save
time.</div>
					<a name="07112811000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want the Government to justify and explain how they will use violent
offender orders. As with earlier amendments, I tabled these on behalf
of Liberty, which has raised several concerns. It is not that I am
trying to get rid of violent offender orders, but Liberty has made the
case that non-molestation orders could be used as an alternative
approach. However, that amendment  has not been chosen for
discussion, although it will be part of the package of proposals that I
shall be speaking about.</div>
					<a name="07112811000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000943"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman knows that I agree that the
extension of non-molestation orders might prove an acceptable
alternative to, or substitute for, the clause. Does he agree that it
would be helpful if the Minister could say whether the Government even
considered such a proposal before they drafted this new class of order,
which seems to many of us superfluous?
</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000944"></a>Harry
Cohen:
						</b> The point has been made and I hope that, when the
Government respond in the clause stand part debate, they will at least
say how they view the non-molestation order.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 593</div>
					<a name="07112811000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
violent offender orders continue the trend of creating civil orders, a
breach of which would become a criminal offence. I share
Liberty&#146;s view that the orders could become too broad in their
application and breach some of the conventions that we are rightly tied
up to. Liberty also makes the point that, if the order is too broad, it
is more likely to be breached. A person can get caught up in just too
many things, instead of the order covering something specific so they
know where they are. It said that extraordinary scope will be available
for the imposition of restrictions on individual freedom under the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07112811000859"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07112811000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
is saying that the order is unnecessary in some ways because the
Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides for anyone convicted of specified
offences, punishable by more than 10 years&#146;
imprisonment&#151;violent offences&#151;will be given an indefinite
period of imprisonment for public protection and, once released from
prison, will be on licence for a minimum of 10 more years. After that,
they can apply to the Parole Board for termination of the licence, but
the Parole Board might not decide to do so if it regards the person as
such a risk. If it does not do so, the person would still be subject to
conditions and to recall. The necessity of the orders is in
question.</div>
					<a name="07112811000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like a response from the Under-Secretary about a good point that
Liberty makes about retrospection. It seems that, at least initially,
the orders could be used retrospectively. Prisoners coming out of
prison who were sentenced under the old system may suddenly find orders
applied to them under this legislation. That would be a retrospective
application of the provision. Again, that could put us in breach of our
international legal obligations. Will the Under-Secretary say something
about whether that is the intention? That may be justified, but I am
not entering the argument on that point: I am just saying that there
are problems with retrospection, if that is what is
intended.</div>
					<a name="07112811000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
says that the provision raises the possibility of the order being
applied for at any time and thinks it more appropriate for there to be
a window of time, particularly when a licence is coming under review.
That is the time for the orders to be applied for, if they are going to
be in place at all. There should not be an open-ended approach, meaning
that they could be applied for at any
time.</div>
					<a name="07112811000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
also says that the danger with the orders lies in a risk assessment
taking place that identifies someone as being a &#147;risk of serious
harm&#148;, without needing to identify a particular person or
persons that they are a risk to. That is where the non-molestation
orders would come into play, because they would specify the individual.
However, the provision becomes too broad, in Liberty&#146;s view,
when it relates to risk to the
public.</div>
					<a name="07112811000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have mentioned Liberty&#146;s main points as succinctly as I can.
There are questions on this set of clauses for the Under-Secretary to
respond
to.</div>
					<a name="07112811000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000945"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I shall also speak to clause stand part.
I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Leyton
and Wanstead, particularly in relation to seeking vainly, on one hand,
to restrict the breadth of the order, while 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column594" />Column number: 594</div>on the other hand&#151;although a particular amendment was not
selected&#151;seeking to remove it completely from the Bill. On both
those counts, I endorse his
approach.</div>
					<a name="07112811000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
20 April 2006, the then Home Secretary indicated that there was a
strong case for the introduction of violent offender orders along the
same lines that have proved effective for sex offenders. The issue is
primarily whether that strong case exists. Certainly, a long and
extended family of civil orders is being built up, whether they be
banning orders, ASBOs, sex offender prevention orders, foreign travel
orders, risk of sexual harm orders or control orders. Indeed, it may be
more appropriate to follow the title of the Home Office review with a
rebalancing the criminal justice system in favour of the law-abiding
majority order. Perhaps that would be the best way of grouping
everything.</div>
					<a name="07112811000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
question is whether the provision is needed. The hon. Members for
Leyton and Wanstead and for Somerton and Frome, made the point that
there are public protection offences on the statute book: the Criminal
Justice Act 2003, the non-molestation orders in the Family Law Act 1996
and the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 all contain
elements of public protection.</div>
					<a name="07112811000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
respondents to the Government&#146;s review were sceptical about the
need to legislate, but how do the Government aim to deal with the
perceived problem? Their response appears to be inconsistent. On the
one hand, they say that there remain gaps into which some offenders may
fall. The Government say:</div>
					<a name="07112811000802"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
example, some may have been convicted of a schedule 15 offence before
April 2005 and therefore not eligible for the public protection
sentences. Others may not have been assessed as sufficiently dangerous
at conviction, but their risk has increased since that
time.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore invite
the Minister to state clearly how many people fall into the gap that
needs to be plugged. The indication is that as a result of the
provision, there would be some 100 orders each year. Of those 100 in
the gap, how many would not have been party to the conviction rate
before April 2005?</div>
					<a name="07112811000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further on,
the Government&#146;s response suggests that there is a gap in public
protection sentences. It talks the language of a
sentence&#151;indeed, of a punitive sanction and a criminal sentence.
However, further on, it makes it clear that</div>
					<a name="07112811000803"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a Violent Offender Order is not a
punishment but a civil preventative
measure.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div>
					<a name="07112811000804"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
VOO is not imposed as an additional punishment for a Schedule 15
offence,&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">despite the
Government saying that they needed to plug the gap in public protection
sentences. Even at the early stage of their response to the public
consultation, there appears to be inconsistency about the nature of the
order, which perhaps is inherent when one seeks to bring in a civil
order in a quasi-criminal manner.</div>
					<a name="07112811000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
mirrors other civil orders. Indeed, one could enter the debate during
the passage of the Serious Crime Act 2007 into the record, sit down and
carry on. That would be an easy but perhaps too brief way of doing it,
and we would not go to the depths and lengths to which my hon. Friends,
with great consideration, dealt with that Act.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column595" />Column number: 595</div>
					<a name="07112811000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I highlight
three points. The hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead made the point
about the order applying at any time. The concern is that the order
will be applied for, not at the conclusion of the sentence, when it has
had its true effect, in order to determine whether there is a
continuing public risk at the appropriate time, but at any time. The
court will be able to determine the issue before the sentence has had
an effect, which suggests that the violent offender order will at best
add unnecessarily to a criminal sanction, and at worse circumvent and
undermine the criminal justice process. That process is the crucial
part of the order, and the one that raises most concerns.</div>
					<a name="07112811000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will no doubt want to emphasise time and again that the provision is
preventive not punitive, but subsection 1(a) states that the
order</div>
					<a name="07112811000805"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;contains such
prohibitions, restrictions or conditions as the court making the order
considers necessary.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
conditions and examples of those prohibitions, restrictions or
requirements were made explicit in the 2007 Act, so will the Minister
explain why they are not made explicit in the violent offender order
aspect of this Bill? Those requirements could affect an
individual&#146;s working arrangements, communication and association
with others, access to and use of certain premises, travel, financial
property, and business dealings or holdings. The liberty of such an
offender could be
circumscribed.</div>
					<a name="07112811000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to go into too much detail about the preventive and
punitive elements of the debate, but perhaps the orders could be made
in line with community orders, which can contain preventive and
punitive elements, but which are nevertheless dealt with in the
criminal courts and with appropriate burdens of proof. No doubt we will
return to that matter during our discussions on amendments Nos. 364 and
365 when we can debate the appropriate burden of proof&#151;whether
it is a civil or criminal
burden.</div>
					<a name="07112811000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Key
to the process are the length of orders, which have no time limit that
could be renewed indefinitely, and the resources needed to make such an
order effective. It has been indicated that the police will be
responsible for applying for, monitoring and enforcing an order. That
will place a burden upon the police&#146;s existing activities. Will
the Minister confirm whether existing resources will be made available
to deal with the effectiveness of such
orders?</div>
					<a name="07112811000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
bottom line is that there is no convincing evidence that the orders are
necessary. Certainly some violent offenders are prevalent after
sentencing and the public need protecting from them. However, the focus
should be on ensuring that the criminal sanctions and sentences are
effective and that the public are fully protected, rather than on
establishing new legislative processes that blur the distinctions
between the civil and criminal fields and between fundamental
rights.</div>

							<a name="07112811000946"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I shall be brief because the hon.
Members for Leyton and Wanstead and for Enfield, Southgate have covered
most of the points that I wished to raise.</div>
					<a name="07112811000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberal
Democrat Members have had long-term anxieties about the proliferation
of injunctions against future offending. This is just the latest
example of the way in which increasingly the Government see such
injunctions as a means of reducing offending without having recourse 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column596" />Column number: 596</div>to the criminal courts. It is hard to see their justification, because
other measures are available. I repeat my request to the Minister
concerning new clause 52, which was not selected for debate, but it is
relevant to the clause stand part debate because it would provide an
alternative way in which to address a problem
identified&#151;presumably&#151;by the Government. However, it
would do so by using existing laws and by extending provisions that are
already on the statute book, and without increasing&#151;yet
again&#151;the number of effectively non-criminal sanctions available
for dealing with criminal behaviour, which is what most concerns us.
Has the Minister considered that option, or indeed any other options?
What is the distinctive nature of the new orders that makes them
preferable to alternative disposals, available through existing
practice or the courts, when dealing with those who break the law? What
is wrong with the old-fashioned method of indicting them and letting a
jury and a court determine the correct
disposal?</div>

							<a name="07112811000947"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank the Committee for continuing with the
constructive way in which it deliberated the Bill this morning. From
the start, I accept that there is a difference between the Government
and the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Enfield, Southgate.
I do not try to minimise it. All I want to do is to put the
Government&#146;s case and the alternative point of view in respect
of the use of civil orders. I preface my comments with that because
there is a very real difference&#151;I understand that&#151;but it
is important to make the case again for the use of civil orders,
notwithstanding the difference between
us.</div>
					<a name="07112811000860"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07112811000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we consider the use of civil orders&#151;antisocial behaviour orders
are the ones most often referred to&#151;I think that generally
speaking they have been successful. In fact, the cry about the use of
civil orders in my and other people&#146;s constituencies is not that
we should not have them because they are civil orders but that they
want more of them. They do not argue about whether antisocial behaviour
orders are civil or criminal orders. They just see them as a useful way
to control antisocial
behaviour.</div>
					<a name="07112811000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
football banning orders have been hugely successful in controlling
behaviour, and they are civil orders. Sexual offences prevention
orders&#151;again, very successful&#151;control sex offenders.
Civil orders make a real difference to preventing harm in our
communities and, therefore, to protecting the
public.</div>
					<a name="07112811000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate mentioned again the debate that we
had on the Serious Crime Act 2007. If people read it, they will find
that it, too, involved a clash of views, opinions and deeply held
beliefs. None the less, views and opinions were logically argued and,
in the end, tested with a vote. People disagreed. The serious crime
prevention orders that were passed during that Bill are another example
of a civil order that we think will prevent
crime.</div>
					<a name="07112811000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman says, &#147;The Minister will no doubt say that the
orders are not punishments for past offences but preventive
measures.&#148; Of course that is the case that I will make. We are
not saying that somebody who is a qualifying offender should be
punished again for an offence that they committed. We are saying that
if the chief police officer thinks that by going to the court 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 597</div>he can prevent harm that may occur in the future, either to an
individual&#151;I shall come to the points made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Leyton and Wanstead and the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome&#151;or to the public, making this measure available to the
courts, where there is a right of appeal, will be of benefit to the
community.</div>
					<a name="07112811000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate, we expect about 100
such orders a year. We are not sure exactly what the breakdown of the
orders is, but that is our best estimate at
present.</div>
					<a name="07112811000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000948"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Subsection (3) sets out the specified offences:
manslaughter, offences under the Offences against the Person Act 1861,
wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, malicious wounding
and attempted murder. If the Minister does not think that those
offences either under common law or under statute are not sufficient to
prevent people from committing those crimes, why does he think that the
imposition of a violent offender order will have any more
effect?</div>
					<a name="07112811000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000949"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The argument is that the specified offences laid
out in subsection (3) are the offences for the purposes of the order.
People will have been punished for those offences through the criminal
justice system. They will have been given prison sentences and perhaps
allowed out on licence at the end of their prison sentences, depending
on what happened. To qualify, the offender must have committed one of
the specified offences, but this is not about punishing those
offenders. Of course, it is about deterring people from committing such
crimes, but the orders are for people who, in the eyes of the court,
still pose a risk to others when the various punishments that they have
been given for committing those offences have finished. The hon. and
learned Gentleman will know that violent offender orders cannot be
enforced while offenders are subject to a punishment imposed by a
court. I reiterate that these offenders will already have been punished
for committing a specified offence; the measures are about preventing
future
harm.</div>
				
					<a name="07112811000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000950"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> It is probably entirely my fault, but I do not
think that the Minister quite understood my question. Let us assume, as
we must, that the specified offender has committed a specified offence
in the past. On that basis, he is brought within the remit of the
violent offender order system, and the court, if it is satisfied that
it should do so, can impose certain restrictions on his movement and
with whom he may associate. If he is sufficiently careless or mindless
of the law, or knowledgeable about the law and prepared to breach it,
to the extent that he will commit a specified offence, and has in the
past, why do the Government think that he will pay the slightest
attention to a violent offender order that seeks to prevent him from
going to a particular address or associating with certain people?
</div>
					<a name="07112811000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
someone is minded to commit one of the serious offences in subsection
(3), he will not be bothered by a violent offender order. The
Government will fill our prisons with people who have breached these
orders, as has happened with ASBOs. A great many people have been sent
to prison for up to five years for breaching ASBOs, not because they
fall under the categories in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 598</div>subsection (3), but because they are mentally ill, alcoholics or
substance abusers. Such people have social or other issues that need to
be dealt with, but not necessarily by a term of imprisonment. That is a
different issue, but the same principle
applies.</div>
					<a name="07112811000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000951"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I did understand the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s point, and apologise if I did not answer it
particularly well. I thought that I was explaining that the court would
make a judgment on whether making someone who has been found guilty of
a specified offence subject to an order under subsection (1) would
prevent future harm and protect the public. That is why we have made
the breach of such an order a criminal offence. If someone breaches a
violent offender order, they could be subject to a term of imprisonment
of up to five years.</div>
					<a name="07112811000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest
that whether or not someone has been found guilty of a specified
offence, if a court told them that they could not associate with
certain people or go to a certain place because the court believed that
they might cause harm to an individual or others, they would take note
of that order if they were threatened with imprisonment if they did
not. I take the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s point about filling
up the prisons, however. We think that a small number&#151;about 100
people&#151;might breach orders and be subject to a term of
imprisonment, but that is a price worth paying to protect the public
from certain individuals.</div>
					<a name="07112811000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead, the
conditions linked to a violent offender order will always be linked
with the specific risk posed by the individual. They will be a matter
for the courts to determine, and of course they will need to be
proportionate as the court will have to act in a way that is consistent
with the Human Rights Act. The procedure will be exactly the same as
that which operates for a whole range of other civil orders that the
Government have introduced, whether antisocial behaviour orders or
others.</div>
					<a name="07112811000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with just using non-molestation orders instead of violent
offender orders would be that they can be used only to protect named
individuals or individuals known to the person in question.
Non-molestation orders may therefore not be able to protect individuals
not known to the person subject to the order. Of course,
non-molestation orders do not apply to the public. A person who is made
the subject of a violent offender order will be someone who is believed
to be a danger to the public. In that respect, a non-molestation order
would not be appropriate and could not be used. I loved what my hon.
Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead said&#151;it was a bit of a
radical proposal. I think that it was the nuclear option. He wanted the
whole of part 8 struck out of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112811000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Violent
offender orders are intended to build on and complement other public
protection measures, including determinate extended and indeterminate
sentences, which were introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2003.
Whereas those measures are applied at the point of sentencing, the
principal aim of the violent offender order is to protect the public
from the most dangerous violent offenders who still present a risk of
serious, violent harm at the end of their sentences, when there is no
other risk management mechanism in place. We are introducing the orders
to manage the risk of the most 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column599" />Column number: 599</div>serious violent offenders, who fall into three main categories:
individuals who were sentenced for a serious violent offence prior to
the introduction of public protection measures in April 2005;
individuals whose risk level was not considered high enough to warrant
an indeterminate or extended sentence at the point of conviction, but
who are now deemed to be at risk of causing serious violent harm, and
individuals whose determinate extended or indeterminate sentences for a
qualifying offence has expired but whose behaviour has come to the
attention of the police as being high-risk. By closing those current
gaps in supervision, violent offender orders will be an essential risk
management tool in addition to existing public protection
measures.</div>
					<a name="07112811000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000952"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> The Minister refers to gaps in supervision. Is
it not true that the genesis of the violent offender order was the
tragic John Monckton case, which caused great concern across the House
and among the general public? The response to that was the initiative
of the order. Is not the gap in supervision the result of a gap not in
legislation but in the resources going to the probation service to
enable the proper face-to-face supervision that the public and victims
should ordinarily get through a sentence imposed by a court? Should not
the focus be on proper supervision, licence provision and the like in
sentencing, rather than on extra
legislation?</div>
					<a name="07112811000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000953"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I have tried to make the point that violent
offender orders are supposed to be used where there is no other
supervisory arrangement available. They are to fill that
gap&#151;&#151;for when somebody has finished their sentence,
licence conditions are over and there is nothing else left with which
to supervise or look after somebody. There will be a violent offender
order when a chief police officer believes that an individual poses a
risk, and takes the matter to the court. It will be when everything
else has finished and there is nothing else left. There may be some
people who are convicted offenders, who have committed specific
offences and who have acted in a way that suggests that they may pose a
danger to other individuals or to the public. This provision fills that
gap and that is why we have introduced these violent offender
orders.</div>
					<a name="07112811000861"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000954"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I hear the point that it is about when
supervision has ended, but is not the issue less about the fact that
the supervision period has ended than that the quality of supervision
is lacking? We need to look at how, within the time available, we can
have higher-quality and properly carried out supervision. That brings
us back to the Monckton case where that supervision was identified as
lacking. We need to deal with that gap, rather than saying that the
time has ended for licensed supervision, and moving on to another
order.</div>
					<a name="07112811000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000955"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> That is a reasonable point&#151;we must ensure
that any supervisory arrangements that are in place for somebody who
poses a risk are of high quality. It is a fair point, and one that we
are all determined to improve on. However, when the period of licensed
supervision is over, there is a gap. Therefore, whatever the quality of
supervision&#151;and one would hope that it would be such that in
future there will be fewer people who pose a risk when it is
finished&#151;there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column600" />Column number: 600</div>still may be a problem with some individuals. The violent offender order
is designed to fill that gap. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
but it does not mean that violent offender orders are not necessary in
any circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07112811000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
consulted a wide range of stakeholders in drafting the provisions and
violent offender orders have received broad support. They are intended
to protect the general public, or any particular member of the public,
from the risk of serious physical or psychological harm caused by an
individual committing one or more specified serious offences. The
orders will be made on the basis of an up-to-date assessment of risk at
the end of an individual&#146;s sentence. Violent offender orders
will enable the court to impose negative requirements, such as
prohibitions, restrictions or conditions. The conditions of an order
will be determined on the basis of risk, and imposed only when a court
is satisfied that they are necessary to manage the behaviour of an
individual in order to protect the public from the risk of serious
violent harm. A violent offender order will be effective for at least
two years, unless it is deemed appropriate to renew or discharge it
before this time.</div>
					<a name="07112811000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat that
I do not believe that non-molestation orders are an adequate substitute
for violent offender orders. Non-molestation orders can be made by
courts to protect an individual from molestation by a known person.
That person must essentially be within the family sphere. The
individual requiring protection will always be connected to the
offender, for example a current or former spouse, cohabitant or
relative child. The key point is that non-molestation orders must be
used specifically to protect named persons. Currently, they can only be
only be applied for by the person that is at risk of harm or on their
behalf by a person who is associated with the offender. My hon. Friend
the Member for Leyton and Wanstead suggests that a chief police officer
should be able to apply to court for a non-molestation order for the
benefit of an individual. There are undoubtedly wider benefits to such
an amendment, particularly as it would mean that additional protection
could be granted to individuals who are either unwilling or unable to
apply for a non-molestation order themselves&#151;for example, when
an individual is too afraid to apply for an order.</div>
					<a name="07112811000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to my
hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead and the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome that while the non-molestation order is not
something that could be used instead of a violent offender order, the
point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome about others being
able to apply for non-molestation orders is an idea that could be
explored further. It is an extremely valid point and something that I
am willing to look at to see how it could be taken forward.</div>
					<a name="07112811000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the violent offender order is to provide a means of continuously
protecting the public from the most dangerous violent offenders who
still present a high risk at the end of their sentence. It would be
used when there are no other means for public protection authorities to
manage that risk.</div>
					<a name="07112811000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000956"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> The Minister says that breaches of the
order would lead to some 20 additional prison places
being required, but the National Association of Probation Officers
estimates that around 3,000 additional places will be required in any
one year. There is a big difference 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 601</div>between 20 and 3,000, so is not an independent assessment of the
provisions necessary to clarify accurately the potential increase in
the prison population to provide confidence that there is capacity to
deal with violent offender orders? The point also relates generally to
other parts of the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000957"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> There is a huge discrepancy, as
the hon. Gentleman said. We used the template of sexual offences
prevention orders to guide us, and we made the best estimate. The idea
is not for someone to breach the orders. They are preventive orders and
I do not believe that many people will breach them, but we must have a
sanction. We have used our best estimate and other civil orders to
guide us. We estimate that 100 such orders might be made, requiring
approximately 20 prison places. We will continue to keep the matter
under
review.</div>
					<a name="07112811000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have told my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead and the

							<a name="07112811000979"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> We are back to the issue of how we apply the
various criminal sanctions to those who are under 18, as opposed to
those who are 18 and over, and whether a difference should apply now. I
feel that perhaps I am pushing a slightly open door because I have
looked carefully at the Government&#146;s amendments, which spend 50
or 60 lines moving in the direction of my simple amendment consisting
of five words. Perhaps there is an element of doubt in the mind of the
Minister as to whether it is appropriate to apply violent offender
orders to those who are under 18 at the time of the implementation of
the order. I emphasise that point because there will be some young
people who have served a sentence for a violent offence, who would be
subject to a qualifying offence but will have passed their 18th
birthday by the time they can receive an order. I will state very
quickly why it would be sensible to make the
limitation.</div>
				
					<a name="07112811000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
point is the general case, which we have explored several times in the
Committee, that there should be a different penal system for young
people from that which applies to adults. The second point is about the
number of people who are under 18 to whom violent offender orders would
apply. In a moment I will ask the Minister to justify the existence of
these orders, particularly with the further restrictions that he is
proposing through the amendments, but I am advised by the Standing
Committee for Youth Justice, which has done some work on this regarding
criminal statistics, that well under 1,000 young people commit a range
of offences that are eligible for VOOs. Of those, only a few dozen
receive a qualifying sentence&#151;one of 12 months or more. Of those
few dozen, very few will not be over 18 by the time they are released,
so the measure will apply to very few individuals, unless we get the
sort of inflation that there has been in the world of ASBOs. It is a
shame that the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth is not
with us because he would have a lot to tell us about ASBOs and how they
were never intended to apply to young people. Perhaps that is why he
has been allowed a leave of absence for this afternoon&#146;s
sitting; the fact that he is unavailable to make that speech has
reduced our proceedings considerably. I will presume to make the point
for him, as it is one that he has made forcefully on a number of
occasions.</div>
					<a name="07112811000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
point is whether a violent offender order is likely to be either
appropriate or effective in the case of a young person. I accept that
within the orders there are positives as well as prohibitions, and
therefore there are some aspects that could be seen as of value to a
young person. Having said that, there are other ways of achieving those
objectives without applying a violent offender order as a
mechanism.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 603</div>
					<a name="07112811000862"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6 pm</div>
					<a name="07112811000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, we
already have a different way of managing young people on release if
they represent a risk to others. We have reporting requirements that
are more stringent for young people than for adults, and we have youth
offending teams, which the Government always seem to forget until they
bring back a proposal and then are reminded that such teams
exist&#151;perhaps they should listen to what they have to say in
respect of young people. Such teams were the invention of this
Government and their role is to assess the risk of serious harm and to
develop a risk management plan. That is exactly the area in which the
violent offender orders are intended to work. If the risk is really
serious, we are talking about multi-agency public protection
arrangements as well. They are a much more stringent regime than
anything that a violent offender order is likely to offer.</div>
					<a name="07112811000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever the
justification for violent offender orders in respect of adults, it is
thus hard to substantiate a case for applying them to a person under
the age of 18. It is hard to read the Government&#146;s amendments
without forming the view that they have reached the same conclusion.
New clause 37 sets out a long list of requirements for under-18s.
Government amendment No. 212 will introduce the need to consult youth
offending teams. Quite honestly, if all the Government amendments are
necessary, would it not be better to say that the violent offender
order does not apply to young people and that we use the youth
offending teams and multi-agency public protection arrangements in the
case of more serious risk? In other cases we use the apparatus that the
Government have put in place, which has not been deficient in this
specific area and which will do the job extremely well. I look forward
to hearing the Minister&#146;s convoluted way of justifying something
that is very hard to
justify.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000980"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I endorse many of the comments made by
the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. The convoluted way in which the
Government have sought to deal with young offenders might be a response
to the amendment that he tabled. It also illustrates the problems
inherent within the violent offender orders. The more they try to deal
with offenders who need special consideration, the more one sees that
they have problems. That seems to be highlighted by the new clause and
the way in which it will deal with those who are under 18, and those
who are under 17 when the orders are made, and the complications that
arise. I will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to
amendment No. 352 and his justification for the new clause. Although it
might improve the situation, it could raise more questions than answers
about the need for offender orders in the first
place.</div>
					<a name="07112811000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000981"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Just because ideas are proposed by other
hon. Members, it does not mean that I will reject them&#151;that is
one of the things that I try to bring to Committees. There are issues
about under-18s that need to be considered. I do not believe that
anyone here wants to criminalise young people. In fact, in our earlier
proceedings, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State spent a
considerable amount of time debating that whole issue. Without
digressing too far, because I will speak to the amendments about the
application of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column604" />Column number: 604</div>violent offender orders to under-18s, we need to consider how we deal
with young offenders. There is a real dilemma here. The Government have
introduced all sorts of measures to try to ensure that we keep young
people out of prison&#151;or out of the criminal justice
system&#151;as far as we can. When addressing the small number of
people who may cause a problem&#151;I shall mention the numbers in a
minute&#151;it is incumbent on us to ensure that we protect
communities. That is something to reflect
on.</div>
					<a name="07112811000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall put this thought into the minds of Committee members, including
the hon. Members for Enfield, Southgate and for Somerton and Frome:
there are some quite dangerous, violent young people under 18&#151;I
am not saying that hon. Members would disagree with that&#151;and
many of their victims are not 70-year-old pensioners, although that is
what people believe from reading the newspapers, but other young people
who are under 18. That is a huge dilemma. That is part of what this
discussion and debate are about. Although we do not want to criminalise
young people and make them subject to violent offender orders, it is
because of our desire not to do so that we need to ensure that we have
in place processes, procedures, a criminal justice system, and other
civil orders, that protect other young
people.</div>
					<a name="07112811000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a difficult balance to strike and this is a difficult debate. I do
not for one moment suggest that either of the hon. Gentlemen who have
spoken want to put other young people in danger, but there is tension
and difficulty here. Although we do not want many young people to be
subject to violent offender orders, our view is that, for a very small
number, those orders should be available to the
courts.</div>
					<a name="07112811000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
give a specific answer to the question that the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome asked, we estimate that the number is 20. That
estimate in respect of such people for whom violent offender orders may
be appropriate came from the Youth Justice Board, which also advised us
that the figure could be less than 20. I hope that that answers the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific point about the
numbers.</div>
					<a name="07112811000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the amendment tabled by the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for
Cambridge&#151;and, indeed, the Government amendments&#151;we have
considered in detail whether violent offender orders should apply to
young people. That matter was specifically raised as part of the
Government&#146;s consultation on the orders earlier this year. This
is a difficult issue that none of us likes to contemplate. The
Committee will be aware that the primary aim of violent offender orders
is to protect the public from the most serious violent offenders, a
small number of whom, unfortunately, will inevitably be under 18. We
therefore believe that violent offender orders must apply to both
adults and young
people.</div>
					<a name="07112811000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
than 70 per cent. of respondents to the consultation, including the
Crown Prosecution Service, the Association of Chief Police Officers,
the Police Federation, Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of probation
and the Association of District Judges, agreed that violent offender
orders should be applied to young people in some way. We have no wish
to apply new interventions such as violent offender orders to young
people without due thought and consideration about their
appropriateness. Because of that, and in recognition of the dynamic
nature of risk and risk management in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column605" />Column number: 605</div>respect of young people, we have been working closely with the Youth
Justice Board to develop the appropriate, effective procedures and
practices for the application of violent offender orders to young
people that are set out in the Government amendments. We are trying to
reflect some of the issues that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome
has raised. The provisions will not go as far as he wants, but they
will hopefully include some
safeguards.</div>
					<a name="07112811000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 212 will require the chief police officer to consult a
member of a youth offending team prior to making an application for a
violent offender order in respect of an individual under 18 to ensure
that an order is necessary and appropriate. A youth offending team
would already have been managing the young person following their
serious offence and throughout their time in custody. That
team&#146;s advice on whether an order would be necessary or
appropriate would be based on its extensive knowledge of the
individual, including their offending history, family, accommodation,
education, health, and needs with regard to substance misuse. It will
also know what work has gone on with the young person to tackle their
violent behaviour during the course of their sentence. It is important
that all that information is taken into account when deciding whether
to apply for a violent offender order for a young
person.</div>
					<a name="07112811000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 239 will amend section 38 of the Crime and Disorder Act
1998 to enable youth offending teams to provide support to individuals
below the age of 18 who are subject to such an order or interim order.
Section 38(1) of the Act places a statutory duty on local authorities
to make specified youth justice services available in the local area.
The amendment adds to that list of specified youth justice services and
requires the youth offending team to co-ordinate the provision of
support for children and young people subject to an order or interim
order.</div>
					<a name="07112811000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already explained how a youth offending team manages a young
person following their serious offence and throughout their time in
custody, and how it will have built up an extensive knowledge of that
young person. Inevitably there will be instances when a young person
refuses that support. We cannot, of course, compel a young person to
accept an offer of support, but none the less we feel that it should be
made available in all
cases.</div>
					<a name="07112811000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are currently working with the Youth Justice Board to consider the
types of support packages that could be offered to
individuals.</div>
					<a name="07112811000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07112811000982"></a>
							<b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Will my hon.
Friend tell us what attention is being paid to ensuring that the youth
offending teams are adequately staffed? Some have mentioned the
considerable pressures in dealing with their current work loads. How
will that work in
practice?</div>
					<a name="07112811000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000983"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> We are talking to the Youth
Justice Board about how to ensure that those subject to violent
offender orders can be properly managed by the youth offending teams
using the resources available to them. We do not think that that will
involve a huge number of young people, but I take the point that many
of them will be quite resource intensive. We are discussing that with
the board, however, to ensure that adequate resources are
available.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column606" />Column number: 606</div>
					<a name="07112811000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, new
clause 37 introduces mandatory annual reviews of violent offender
orders for individuals below the age of 17, which will help to ensure
that orders made in respect of young people apply only for as long as
the risk posed by them is assessed as sufficiently high to warrant it.
That mirrors annual reviews for antisocial behaviour orders for
individuals below the age of 18, which are being introduced by this
Bill. A review will take place every 12 months after a violent offender
order, or interim violent offender order, has been made, or was last
varied or renewed, provided that the young person is still under
18.</div>
					<a name="07112811000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take to
heart the points made about under-18s. We do not want them made subject
to violent offender orders, but believe that that will be appropriate
for a small number. We have tried, through the Government amendments,
to take into account the concerns of people such as the hon. Members
for Somerton and Frome and for Enfield, Southgate. We have tried to
introduce into the Bill various safeguards that we hope go some way
towards meeting those concerns while also ensuring that we do what we
can to protect the public. With those remarks, I hope that the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000984"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> It is difficult to pick a fight
with the Minister. He presents himself extremely reasonably. I think
that the Government amendments are a clear admission of the fact that
the provision is unnecessary and that other routes are available. The
case is self-evident. Having said that, my amendment would change the
terms of the orders&#151;admittedly in a very longwinded and complex
way&#151;and address a lot of my points. I shall reflect on whether
there are circumstances for the fewer than 20 young people&#151;so we
are told&#151;in which the violent offender order takes us any
further than the existing reporting structures, risk assessments and
the rest of the panoply associated with a youth offending team&#146;s
management of a case and the MAPPA restrictions. If it is clear that
the order makes a significant difference to even a few, I shall not
return to the issue on Report.</div>

					<a name="07112811000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall reconsider the issue, and reconsider very carefully the
amendments, which I shall not oppose, because they represent movement
in the right direction. However, if I feel that the case has still not
been made, I shall return to the matter because I feel very strongly
that we must be very careful indeed when applying yet more criminal law
to young people&#151;even when they are pretty horrible young people
who commit serious offences and from whom the public need protection.
Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

					<a name="07112811000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
try to help the Minister curtail his response, I can tell him that I
know that he will say that it is unnecessary to state explicitly in the
Bill that the standard of proof should be &#147;beyond reasonable
doubt&#148;, and that there is a sliding scale of burden of proof
dependent on facts and criminality. We might well wish to consider the
case of McCann, in which consideration was given to the burden of proof
in relation to antisocial behaviour orders, because it is
relevant.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column608" />Column number: 608</div>
					<a name="07112811000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to incorporate in legislation the required standard of proof.
We need to clarify that burden so that, when lawyers and others come to
practise it and courts consider making an order, they know clearly
where the House is coming from. That is important for a number of
reasons. Violent offender orders will have a significant impact on
individuals&#146; liberty, not least when one considers the penalties
available for a breach of the order: in a magistrates court, a 12-month
sentence of imprisonment or the statutory maximum fine; or, on
indictment in the Crown court, a maximum of five years, a fine, or
both.</div>
					<a name="07112811000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must consider whether there is a need to state the proof needed in the
Bill, or whether we can leave the matter to a sliding scale that will
be subject to various vagaries. The concern is the time available for
the order. It is a minimum of two years. How long will an order last?
One sees that it will be renewable indefinitely. That must lead us to
be cautious about going down the route of civil law by way of a
quasi-criminal
remedy.</div>
					<a name="07112811000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is concern that the courts might seek to use the balance of
probabilities as their level of proof. They might consider whether it
is more likely than not that it is necessary to protect the public from
the risk of serious violent harm. That is important, because the
definition of the purposes of the order in clause 83(2) is wide. We
need as much clarity in the Bill as possible. No new offence may be
committed after the appropriate date, and we need greater clarity,
given the consequences of any
breach.</div>

					<a name="07112811000806"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in my view
pragmatism dictates that the task of magistrates should be made more
straightforward by ruling that they must in all cases under section 1
apply the criminal
standard.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was
section 1 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, under which ASBOs can be
made. That was echoed by others, notably Lord Hope, who
said:</div>
					<a name="07112811000807"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
would hold that the standard of proof that ought to be applied in these
cases to allegations about the defendant&#146;s conduct is the
criminal standard.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need properly to recognise those judgments, not least because of the
seriousness of violent offender orders. There are significant
restrictions that are not necessarily explicit in the Bill, but will
have an impact on an individual&#146;s liberty. It is important to
reflect that properly and to achieve clarity, not only because of the
seriousness of the orders and the impact of a civil order being a
quasi-criminal remedy, but because of the general way in which the Bill
deals with assessments.</div>
					<a name="07112811000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty has
registered its concern about the process leading to the making of an
order. An order will be made following an assessment by a court of
whether the risk posed by an offender justifies an order to protect the
public. Liberty argues that it will be based primarily on a
psychological evaluation, rather than on proof of particular behaviour.
The concern is that there should be greater clarity regarding the
standard of proof. Given the seriousness of the order and its impact on
the individual, that should properly be done by following the McCann
judgment in the Bill and having a standard of &#147;beyond reasonable
doubt&#148;, which the amendment would
achieve.</div>

							<a name="07112811000994"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I entirely associate myself with the comments of
the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate on amendment No. 364. We should
have an appropriate burden of proof for the orders, which are
effectively taking the place of criminal proceedings in a preventive
way. They are something akin to a criminal injunction. The insertion of
the words &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148; after
&#147;satisfied&#148; would mean that the court would have to take
proper cognisance of the evidence of propensity because that would be
nothing more than propensity&#151;there would be no evidence of
wrongdoing, other than previous behaviour. As the courts are being
asked to determine propensity, the condition needs to be in
place.</div>
					<a name="07112811000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have more problems with amendment No. 365, which I should like to
examine for a moment, if I may. Please advise me, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, if I stray too far into matters that should be discussed
in the stand part debate on clause 88.</div>
					<a name="07112811000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000995"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. Should that happen, I shall rule that we
should move formally to the clause stand part debate. Do not feel
constrained.</div>
					<a name="07112811000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811000996"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am most grateful, because it is quite difficult
to dissociate the two issues. Amendment No. 365 would also insert the
words &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148; into a clause. The
consequence of that change would be that a court would have to be
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a person to whom an application
related was a qualifying offender, but that is rather simple to
establish beyond reasonable doubt. Given that the qualification is
simply whether they have previously been convicted of a qualifying
offence, it is almost a redundant issue. However, I understand the
intention behind the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112811000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
worries me that the more one looks at clause 88, the more one realises
that interim violent offender orders are not even to be based on any
proof of propensity, as far as the courts are concerned, let alone an
actual offence having been committed. Applications are to be made
purely on the basis of previous convictions, and the court is asked
simply to consider whether it is just to grant an order. It is
interesting to consider under what circumstances a court would consider
it just to do so, in the absence of any other consideration.</div>
					<a name="07112811000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, the court
is asked to do two things: to establish whether the relevant person is
a qualifying offender, and whether it is just to grant an interim
order. I am concerned that although the interim orders have effect
for</div>
					<a name="07112811000808"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not more than 4
weeks&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112811000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">they
may be renewed on &#147;one or more occasions&#148;. So, in the
absence of a substantive order being made, there could be a running
interim order, which could produce the same effects as a full order,
being renewed over several weeks, months or even years if the courts
were so minded, although I do not believe that they would
be.</div>
					<a name="07112811000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">My reason for
putting the matter forward is because, although I entirely supported
the initial premise of the hon. Member for Enfield, the more that I see
how it would be applied to clause 88, the more I feel that there is
something more inherently wrong with the interim violent offender order
clause, even above and beyond what we have already debated in respect
of the general 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column610" />Column number: 610</div>violent offender orders. It is hard to see how the court will assess the
justice provision within the clause in a way that is consistent with
justice.</div>

							<a name="07112811000997"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> This is a genuine unprovoked intervention, not
least because my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate dealt
fully with the issue. However, the matters raised by the hon. Member
for Somerton and Frome lead me to mention again the concerns that I
expressed about another aspect of the Bill. We are considering interim
injunctions. The applicant says to the court, &#147;While we get our
evidence completely in order&#151;and we have material to satisfy the
court that this man will, unless he is constrained by various
conditions, probably do the following&#151;will you please freeze the
position?&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be interesting to find out from the Minister whether the interim
orders can be made only on an inter partes basis with both the
complaint and respondent present or whether they can be made on an ex
parte basis. There is probably a different way in which to describe the
position when the applicant is there without the respondent. For an
interim injunction, other than in defamation, the relevant expression
that is used quite frequently is &#147;the balance of
convenience&#148;. That could be where the balance of justice lies,
but the Government must tell us what precisely they intend by the
interim violent offender orders. Is it anticipated that they will be
made on a continuous basis, allowing the Government without having
foolproof&#151;although reasonable&#151;grounds on which to base
their application? They should be made more or less on a rolling basis.
Are they limited to a certain
number?</div>

						</b> There we are; the position gets worse and worse.
I am amazed that we do not have interim nuclear facilities orders or
interim prostitution orders. I think that I have made my point. We need
to be sure what the Government want to do. If they are making a genuine
attempt to prevent something from getting worse while evidence is being
brought to court, that is understandable, although not very attractive.
The combined arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield,
Southgate and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome require careful
responses from the Government and some rather better thinking than is
evident from the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="07112811001000"></a>Mr.

given that I have been asked about such matters, perhaps it is
appropriate if I make my response
now.</div>

							<a name="07112811001002"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> In answer to the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough and the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome, our intention in respect of interim 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column611" />Column number: 611</div>violent offender orders is for them to be available to the courts as an
emergency measure. I shall come to the standard of proof in a moment,
but it would be a matter for the courts to determine whether the orders
should be renewed. The Government or the chief police officer would not
renew them. We would assume therefore that although we can say, for the
purposes of argument, that four weeks, four weeks, four weeks and so on
would be possible, my view is that a court would not consider that
appropriate or
proportionate.</div>
					<a name="07112811000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001003"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I entirely accept that argument; my difficulty is
with the question of the test that the clause requires the courts to
apply, because it is by no means clear what test is to be applied to
assess whether an interim order should be made. As far as a full order
is concerned, there is at least clarity as to the matters to be taken
into account and how that is to be done, although my party would prefer
a strengthening of the provisions in that regard. Under clause 88,
however, those matters do not apply.</div>
					<a name="07112811000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001004"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The test is whether, in the
court&#146;s view, an individual poses a serious risk to another
person or to the public. The evidence to demonstrate that would have to
be put before the court before an interim order could be made. The
order is an emergency measure that would be available for the courts to
impose temporarily while a full violent offender order was being
applied for.</div>
					<a name="07112811000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">I respect the
positions that have been set out by the hon. Members for Somerton and
Frome and for Enfield, Southgate, but let me restate what I said about
violent offender orders: there are clearly differences between us. That
emerged in discussions about serious crime prevention orders during
passage of the Serious Crime Act 2007, when there was disagreement
about the standard of proof that should be applied. The Government
considered that, as the orders should be civil orders, the relevant
standard was the civil one, whereas the hon. Gentlemen thought that the
standard should be the criminal test of reasonable doubt. The debate is
similar this
time.</div>
					<a name="07112811000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001005"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> Let us set aside our differences over whether
violent offender orders should be made at all. I would understand the
Minister&#146;s argument if the conditions set out in clause 85(2)
both applied in relation to interim orders. That provision requires
additionally that the person
has</div>
					<a name="07112811000809"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;since the
appropriate date, acted in such a way as to give reasonable cause to
believe that it is necessary for a violent offender order to be made in
respect of the
person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that requirement applied to applications for an interim order, evidence
would have to be presented for an interim order in the same way as for
a full order, which is exactly what the Minister said, and I would
understand that he was suggesting that the same test should be applied.
However, the requirement is absent from clause 88, so I ask the
Minister to explain to us why a different test should be applied, given
what he has told us about the evidential test for the making of an
interim order.</div>
					<a name="07112811000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001006"></a>Mr.

						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that
there is a difference, so I will reflect on his point in the spirit of
my general approach to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column612" />Column number: 612</div>Committee. His point might be important. I am not saying that I will
agree with him, but I shall explain on Report whether a change is
needed. However, I hope that he will forgive me for repeating that the
whole point of interim violent offender orders is to put something in
place quickly if the court considers that there is a possible serious
risk to the public.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001009"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> That will do very well, yes. The debate is
throwing up quite a number of knotty problems that the Government need
to be clear about before we put the clause to bed. The comparison
between clauses 85 and 88 is worth exploring. In any event, we need to
know whether the application for an order will be made orally, with the
evidence also being oral and subject to cross-examination.
Alternatively, will it be on the basis of statements? Is a police
officer simply going to read from his notebook or will there be
verified statements or sworn affidavits that are not susceptible to
cross-examination?</div>
					<a name="07112811000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
order to fulfil the conditions of clause 85(2)(b), it has to be shown
that the person
has</div>
					<a name="07112811000810"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;acted in such a way
as to give reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary for a
violent offender order to be made in respect of that
person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will we
therefore be looking for more than the fact that the designated offence
has occurred? Clause 88 deals with interim violent offender orders, and
subsection (3)(b) states that if the court</div>
					<a name="07112811000811"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;considers it just to do so, the
court may make an interim violent offender order in respect of the
person containing such prohibitions, restrictions or conditions as the
court considers necessary for the purpose of protecting the public from
the risk of serious violent harm caused by that
person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is the material? Is it evidence that that person, since he has been
released from prison, has done something that leads the applicant to
suspect that he might do something and, therefore, needs to be
prohibited from going from place A or talking to person B? Or is the
evidence of a rather higher level, which clause 85(2)(b) seems to imply
but is not clear about? Those differences need to be resolved with
regard to the nature of the evidence and how it is presented to the
court, which may or may not grant the violent offender order. Whether
the respondent should know in advance that he is either going to be
subjected to such an order or has a right to appear and argue against
the evidence must also be
considered.</div>
					<a name="07112811000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001010"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Clearly, we will put the guidance out to the
courts in the normal way that they receive guidance
on how to process all sorts of different procedures. With regard to
evidence, my understanding is that one would not expect evidence in
such matters to be oral. One would expect written evidence also to be
made available to the courts so that judgments can be made with regard
to it. We intend to ensure, through guidance, that many of the points
that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough has made are
covered.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column613" />Column number: 613</div>
					<a name="07112811000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
standard of proof, as I said earlier to the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate, we used the standard of proof argument that was used in the
McCann judgment. We believe that that judgement, which was made in the
House of Lords, is the appropriate one to use. Although it referred to
antisocial behaviour orders, it was clearly stated that proceedings
were civil under domestic law, that they complied with the European
convention on human rights and that they were civil orders rather than
criminal orders.</div>
					<a name="07112811000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it came
to the actual standard of proof that was available, the hon. Member for
Enfield, Southgate quoted from the judgments. The judgment
stated:</div>
					<a name="07112811000812"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Lord
Bingham of Cornhill has observed that the heightened civil standard and
the criminal standard are virtually
indistinguishable.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not disagree with his view. Lord Hope
said:</div>
					<a name="07112811000813"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is not an
invariable rule that the lower standard of proof must be applied in
civil proceedings. I think that there are good reasons, in the
interests of fairness, for applying the higher standard when
allegations are made of criminal or quasi-criminal conduct which, if
proved, would have serious consequences for the person against whom
they are made.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">We went
through that and said that the judgment that we use from the House of
Lords with regard to civil orders, which we would expect to be applied
to violent offender orders, demonstrates that there is a sliding scale
and that a standard of proof virtually indistinguishable from the
criminal standard should be the standard of proof that is used. I put
that on the record with regard to violent offender orders, as I did
with regard to serious crime prevention
orders.</div>

1999&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112811000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">The McCann
judgment covers the situation. We would expect the way in which the
McCann judgment laid out the standard of proof for civil proceedings to
be used in respect of violent offender
orders.</div>
					<a name="07112811000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 364 and 365 both relate to the standard of proof required for
court decisions on violent offender orders. Currently, before making a
violent offender order, a magistrates court must be satisfied that the
person is a qualifying offender and has, since conviction for the
qualifying offence as set out in clause 83, acted in such a way as to
make an order necessary for the protection of the public from the risk
of serious violent harm. Amendment No. 364 requires that a magistrates
court makes a violent offender order in respect of an individual only
if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is the
case.</div>
					<a name="07112811000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 365 makes the same change in the case of interim violent offender
orders. Currently, before making an interim violent offender order, a
magistrates court must be satisfied that the person to whom the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column614" />Column number: 614</div>main application relates is a qualifying offender, and must consider it
just to grant an interim order while the main application is being
determined.</div>
					<a name="07112811000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had a considerable debate on the standard of proof. The hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate believes that we need a criminal standard
in the Bill, but we do not wish to include one for what is a civil
order. We believe that the McCann judgment sets out clearly that the
standard of proof for violent offender orders should be virtually
indistinguishable from the criminal
standard.</div>
					<a name="07112811000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those remarks, and a reminder to the Committee that violent offender
orders are preventive not punitive&#151;that is something that we
need continually to remind ourselves of&#151;I ask the hon. Gentleman

							<a name="07112811001013"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> We have had an important debate on significant
issues that go to the heart of concerns about the violent offender
order. It was good to hear from the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome.
I welcome his support for amendment No. 364 and take on board concerns
about the detail of amendment No. 365. The intention is to apply
properly the standard of proof for interim orders as well as full
orders. The purpose of the debate was highlighted by the intervention
of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough, which I
welcomed, on the disparities between the burdens that are already in
the Bill, let alone imposing a criminal standard that would improve the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112811000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate highlights why we need more clarity in the Bill. The Minister
tries to provide reassurance through the McCann case and makes the
point that the standard of proof is indistinguishable from the criminal
standard, but that leads me to ask why that cannot be made explicit in
the Bill. Then, soon after saying that the difference was
indistinguishable, the Minister spoke about a sliding scale. That
raised
concerns.</div>
					<a name="07112811000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns
raised during the passage of the Serious Crime Act 2007 remain. Given
the fact that the violent offender order is a civil order, given the
serious criminal sanction should such an order be breached, and given
the restrictions that can be placed on individuals and the operation of
the order, I wish to press amendment No. 364 to a

							<a name="07112811001029"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 213 to 216 provide the Secretary
of State with the power to add to the notification requirements of
violent offender orders by secondary legislation. The clause will
require that all individuals subject to a violent offender order or an
interim violent offender order are also subject to notification
requirements. Additions to the existing notification requirements are
currently made only by primary legislation, but the Government feel
that the police and public would benefit from the greater flexibility
offered by the measures.</div>
					<a name="07112811000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
notification requirements imposed on sex offenders as introduced by the
Sex Offenders Act 1997 have proved an effective method by which to
manage the risks posed by sex offenders in the community. We have
previously strengthened the requirements through the Sexual Offences
Act 2003 by requiring sex offenders to register more information with
the police and by shortening the time scales by which information must
be provided. However, the protection of children from sex offenders
review identified the benefits of requiring offenders to register more
information, which could mean offenders providing more personal details
and so on. To enable the requirements to be changed more easily, the
review recommended that we should take a power to amend them by
secondary legislation. That will enable us to respond more quickly to
technological developments and new patterns of behaviour. Government
new clause 40 will provide that power. The Association of Chief Police
Officers expressed its support for the review&#146;s commitment to
the additional requirements.</div>
					<a name="07112811000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
242 will allow the Secretary of State to make transitional arrangements
when prescribing additional information that must be notified by sex
offenders and to create different requirements for different types of
offender. A power to allow the Secretary of State to amend the
notification requirements of the 2003 Act by secondary legislation is
provided by new clause 40 and Government amendment No. 242. It makes it
clear that the amendment to the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which states
explicitly that transitional provisions can be made through
regulations, does not affect the validity of transitional provisions in
regulations that have already been passed under the Act&#151;for
example, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Travel Notification Regulations)
2004.</div>
					<a name="07112811000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 250 would repeal sections 86(4) and 87(6) of the Sexual Offences
Act 2003, which allow regulations made under those
sections&#151;foreign travel notifications&#151;to make different
provisions for different categories of
persons.</div>

						</b> Subsection (6) sets out the penalties for

make is that if the offence were as trivial as that, the court would

							<a name="07112811001034"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I do not mind being rebuked by the Minister or
anyone else, but he has put in the Bill a potential five-year term of
imprisonment for failing to comply with a notification requirement.
Presumably the assumption is that there will be circumstances in which
it is appropriate for the courts to give a five-year term to someone
who has failed to notify the material under clause 91, or the provision
would not be in the Bill. Will he explain in what circumstances he
would hope to find the courts dishing out a five-year
sentence?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001035"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I did not mean to rebuke the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#151;far be it from me to attempt to do that. I cannot
possible imagine every circumstance that might come before the court. I
repeat the point that I made earlier. If the offence was as trivial as
that which the hon. and learned Gentleman has just described, we would
not expect the court to impose a five-year sentence. I am sure that he
would not do that in the courts in which he acts as a recorder, even if
the power were available to him. I cannot envisage all the
circumstances, but I repeat that the period is of up to five
years.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001036"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I think that I have made my point. The measure
looks rather heavy-handed. Will the Minister consider what will allow a
sentence of imprisonment, let alone a five-year sentence, for the
offences described in clause 98? We are told, although I find it
difficult to believe, that this is essentially a civil process.
However, it is a civil process whereby people get banged up for five
years if they do not notify the authorities of some relevant
information. We need to keep some balance. It is either a civil process
or it is not. It is either a serious crime or it is not. A five-year
maximum is a heavy maximum. People can commit serious muggings,
burglaries and drug offences and still not get five years.
</div>
					<a name="07112811000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
five years is to be the maximum sentence for simply not notifying
people, that brings me back to the data protection issue that I did not
talk about under clause 75. If we are to see fiascos such as
the HMRC disaster, we need to be clear about the circumstances in which
people will potentially be given quite heavy jail sentences.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001037"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman makes a point, but
I say again that if he reads the whole of clause 98 and other parts of
the Bill, as I know that he has, he will see that the penalty will
match the severity of the offence. As clause 98 makes it
clear:</div>
					<a name="07112811000816"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a person fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with any

expect some of the provisions, prohibitions, restrictions or conditions
that are breached to be more serious than the examples given by the

orders have that level of punishment if they are breached. As we know,
the breach of the order is the criminal offence.</div>
					<a name="07112811000455"></a><div class="hs_Para">In reply to

							<a name="07112811001040"></a>Harry
Cohen:
						</b> My amendments relate to the power of closure
orders. Amendment No. 329, which is the key amendment, refers to
vulnerable people and their families who might be a nuisance and could
therefore be subject to a closure order.</div>
					<a name="07112811000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">Closure
orders combined with antisocial behaviour orders have been very
successful. They provide the power to close premises for three months
and, in exceptional circumstances, for six months. They have been
appropriate, particularly for premises in which there have been drug
problems, although sometimes premises can be closed for too long, and
they blight the rest of the neighbourhood. However, the orders have
solved problems and they are popular. The Minister was right to say
that orders such as ASBOs and closure orders are popular when a
nuisance has been caused.</div>
					<a name="07112811000466"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are problems relating to the orders. One is the issue of
vulnerable people; the other is what Liberty calls
&#147;cuckooing&#148;, which means displacement. That is an
unfortunate consequence. Once premises are closed down, people who are
the subject of the order may then target very vulnerable people and
move into their premises. On one level, the Government or the police
authorities need to deal with that problem and be alert to the danger
of cuckooing, which is the unfortunate consequence of a closure
order.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column619" />Column number: 619</div>
					<a name="07112811000467"></a><div class="hs_Para">The orders
also provide powers to close premises for activities that are not
unlawful. For example, lots of people coming in and out of premises
might not necessarily be a sign that antisocial behaviour is going on.
It might be that lots of parties are going on. I agree that they are a
nuisance, but in themselves they are not necessarily unlawful. In a
sense, that is a precedent that needs to be
considered.</div>
					<a name="07112811000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only other point that I want to make is that when the original
consultation came out, it included very strong safeguards. I will not
take up the time of the Committee and read the whole report, but it
mentioned putting in robust guidelines for the consideration and
operation of the closure process, such as considering whether closure
is the most appropriate course of action and addressing the needs of
vulnerable people in the household, including children and young
people. There was quite a detailed statement in relation to the
original consultation, which is not reflected in the Bill. That is the
point that I am most concerned about.</div>
					<a name="07112811000469"></a><div class="hs_Para">Vulnerable
people are potentially involved&#151;they are not necessarily the
ones causing the nuisance, but may be relatives or others who live in
the house. They could all be thrown out and made homeless. My amendment
says that there should be provision to look after them and, if
necessary, the local authority should provide alternative accommodation
for vulnerable
people.</div>
					<a name="07112811000470"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001041"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I seem to spend a lot of time in this Committee
asking, &#147;What about the children?&#148; In this instance, I am
talking about children who have not been accused of any crime or even
of any potentially offending behaviour, but who merely happen to reside
in the house or premises that are subject to a closure
order.</div>
					<a name="07112811000471"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead has already made a number of the
points that I wanted to make. Amendment No. 354 is a probing amendment
to see how the Government intend, first, to assess the needs of
vulnerable people on such premises and, secondly, to cater for them if
a closure order is made. As the hon. Gentleman said, this issue was
recognised in the Government&#146;s own consultation paper,
&#147;Strengthening powers to tackle anti-social behaviour&#148;,
which the Home Office published in 2006. He quoted part of a passage
from it that I had intended to quote when he
said:</div>
					<a name="07112811000817"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
needs of any vulnerable people in the household, including children and
young people, will need to be
considered.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on
to
say:</div>
					<a name="07112811000818"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Their
safety must not be compromised and a clear plan needs to be put in
place to safeguard them and promote their welfare if the closure goes
ahead.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amen to that. It
is exactly what the Government should be considering in this context,
but at the moment there is no mention as far as I can see, in either
the parent clause or the schedule, to that assessment being
made.</div>
					<a name="07112811000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other legislation of a broadly similar type, that linkage is made. Let
us consider, for instance, housing benefit sanctions under section 31
of the Welfare Reform Act 2007. There is a link between the sanction
and helping the family in question to deal with the consequences, but
in the Bill no link is made between the closure order and
rehabilitative services. In my view, there should be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column620" />Column number: 620</div>such a link. The Government appear to have at least considered it at an
earlier stage, but it does not appear in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112811000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">How does the
Minister propose to ensure that vulnerable people, such as children,
who reside in the same premises are safeguarded in relation to actions
that may be completely beyond their control&#151;actions that are
committed by another person, perhaps a parent or another relative, who
is resident in the same premises? I ask that because we do not believe
in collective punishment in this country. It is not appropriate that we
should not have regard for the interests of innocent
parties.</div>

							<a name="07112811001042"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I welcome the amendments to clarify what happens
when closure orders have unintended consequences that affect the most
vulnerable people. I am referring to family members or other residents
of the premises who are not in any way associated with the behaviour
that is the basis for the closure order. I also wish to take the
opportunity to assert our support for the principle of closure orders
and to acknowledge the success of similar orders in the
past.</div>
					<a name="07112811000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
points made by the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Leyton
and Wanstead on the two amendments were very well made. It is
interesting to consider closure orders in Scotland. There, unlike in
England and Wales, the sheriff must have regard to these two factors
when determining whether to make a closure order: first, the ability of
any person who habitually resides in a premises to find alternative
accommodation and, secondly, any vulnerability of any such person who
has not been engaged in antisocial behaviour that has occurred in the
premises.</div>
					<a name="07112811000868"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07112811000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
two additional requirements would not water down the purposes of
closure orders, but they would deal with hon. Gentlemen&#146;s
concerns. They would explicitly make clear what would happen to
vulnerable people who are not engaged in antisocial behaviour. Will the
Minister say why a measure that is in place and explicit in Scotland is
not proposed for England and Wales? The Home Office lauds the success
with which the Scottish powers have been used, so perhaps the guidance
that is available there should also be available in England.</div>
					<a name="07112811000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
practical point relates to homelessness&#151;those who are
unintentionally made homeless by closure orders. It is accepted that
there should be no statutory duty to house those who have brought
homelessness upon themselves through antisocial behaviour, but if local
authorities increasingly implement closure orders, they will have to
deal with the practical matter of housing vulnerable individuals who
are left without a home because of the orders. I want the Minister to
clarify that question and to provide some reassurance on guidance. Will
additional or amended guidance be provided to local authorities for
when they make decisions on housing people who, through no fault of
their own, are as much the victims as the rest of the community are of
behaviour that takes place in houses that become subject to
orders.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001043"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Welcome back,
everyone.</div>
					<a name="07112811000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I begin by saying to the hon. Members for Enfield, Southgate, and for
Somerton and Frome, and my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and
Wanstead, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column621" />Column number: 621</div>that I welcome their support for the principle of premises closure
orders? I also welcome the recognition that, alongside crack house
closures, they have made a real difference in many communities and have
dealt with problems. Some premises in all hon. Members&#146;
constituencies cause huge difficulties&#151;we accept that. We are
left with the question of what to do about the problem. I accept that
any action must be proportionate and reasonable, but it must be
effective. Sometimes, not addressing a problem can cause it to
continue.</div>
					<a name="07112811000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all face
the question of how many warnings to issue. When does the end point
come? It is quite difficult to decide and, in fact, the question is
rhetorical. I can think of examples from my constituency, as I am sure
others can, in which the various measures that we might wish to take
have been taken, yet the antisocial, disruptive behaviour continues.
Sometimes, people are at a loss, and when they ask me why nobody is
doing anything about the problem, I am forced to reply that lots of
people are doing something, but we are left with the fact that it is
not working. Allowing such problems to continue&#151;I am not
suggesting that hon. Members believe that it should be
allowed&#151;does not do a great deal for the children who live in
such houses or those who live in the area. We are left with a huge
dilemma for public policy and sometimes one wonders what can be
done.</div>
					<a name="07112811000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">Premises
closure orders are an attempt to plug a difficult gap and they had huge
public support. The question is, how do we make them work
proportionately and in a way that we can all feel comfortable with? The
hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate, if I remember rightly, asked
whether there will be guidance and rules and what the guidance will
include. There will be robust guidance on how the orders operate and
how the process is put into practice. I will ensure that we include
housing considerations as part of the guidance. I make that commitment
to the hon. Gentleman because he specifically asked about that.
However, as part of the guidance we would also expect the police, the
local authority and all of the other statutory agencies to show that
consideration has been given to every other possible intervention prior
to a premises closure order being applied for. In other words, the
guidance will say that this process is only appropriate if it is an
absolute last resort and nothing else seems to be
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07112811000484"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some
circumstances, although this sounds contradictory, actually closing the
premises will force the system to deal with the needs of children and
vulnerable people. I say that as a teacher. I make the analogy that, as
a deputy head teacher, I never wanted to exclude young people from
school, but in one or two instances the only way to force a resolution
to the problem was to take what I regarded as a draconian step. In
respect of premises closure orders, in some circumstances, that point
will be reached. In other words, the order can act as a
catalyst.</div>
					<a name="07112811000485"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know what
my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead is trying to do, and,
as the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Enfield, Southgate
said, we have to protect children and vulnerable people. I believe that
through guidance we can ensure that we do that, even though the
safeguards are not necessarily on the face of the Bill. However, I
point out to the hon. Gentleman and to my hon. Friend that new
section 11B(7) 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column622" />Column number: 622</div>of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, inserted by schedule 17, states
that upon application to the court for a closure
order:</div>
					<a name="07112811000819"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
magistrates&#146; court may adjourn the hearing on the application
for a period of not more than 14 days to

					<a name="07112811000820"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
the occupier of the
premises,</div>
					<a name="07112811000821"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
the person who has control of or responsibility for the premises,
or...any other person with an interest in the
premises&#151;</div>
					<a name="07112811000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would expect
that to be a parent, whether a mother or a father, of children
involved&#151;</div>
					<a name="07112811000822"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to show
why a Part 1A closure order should not be
made.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would expect
that in those circumstances people could make representations to the
magistrates court. The magistrate can adjourn and, which may include
children, people can then make representations to say that the premises
closure order should not go ahead because proper consideration has not
been given to the vulnerable people in the household that is to be
shut.</div>
					<a name="07112811000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001044"></a>Ms
Keeble:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that if serious
consideration is to be given to not giving a premises closure order
because there are young children in a house that is being used in
certain ways, for example in crack houses, would it not be advisable at
that stage for the medical safeguarding children board to be involved,
to make an assessment of whether the premises should be closed, and to
make proper arrangements for the protection of the
children?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001045"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> That is a good point and I will take it on board.
It should certainly state within the guidance that all along the way,
local safeguarding children boards and such like should be available.
As I have said, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and
Wanstead will be able to withdraw his amendment. There are safeguards
in the Bill and there will be guidance, although I take the point that
alongside what is a good power, we must ensure that we protect the
vulnerable.</div>

							<a name="07112811001047"></a>Mr.

states:</div>

					<a name="07112811000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
definition of premises has a wide remit, and I would like the Minister
to comment on that and on the intentions behind giving such a wide
ambit in relation to premises. Is it part of the purpose of that wide
ambit to include open land that might be owned privately or publicly
and which may, for example, include a Travellers&#146; site where
there has been evidence of persistent disorder or nuisance? Would that
type of persistent disorder or nuisance come within the ambit of
premises closure orders?</div>

					<a name="07112811000505"></a><div class="hs_Para">The lead
amendment would simply insert the word &#147;and&#148;, which is of
limited value. However, I want to explain my concerns about the clause.
Let me say at the start that nothing I say should in any way be
interpreted as to suggest that I do not recognise the real problem of
people causing nuisance or disturbance in hospitals and other NHS
premises. It is absolutely deplorable when that happens, but
unfortunately it is a growing trend. It worries me as much as I am sure
it worries other members of the Committee. I am therefore intent on
ensuring that if there are ways of reducing the risk of such a
disturbance, we should take
them.</div>
					<a name="07112811000869"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8
pm</div>
					<a name="07112811000506"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
start from the premise that I am not convinced that we need a change in
the law to achieve the Government&#146;s objective. My fear is that
we are back in the wonderful world of sending signals. The clause is
sending a signal that one must not be naughty in hospital. However,
nobody is taking the trouble to ascertain whether the change in law
will help the authorities to investigate, arrest or prosecute
successfully.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column624" />Column number: 624</div>
					<a name="07112811000507"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, I drew the attention of the Lord Chancellor to what appeared
to me to be the extremely pertinent case of Porter <i class="I">v.</i>
Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis, 1999. The reason that I drew
attention to that case was that it very clearly set out that where
there is a breach of the peace, a civil trespass and a person refusing
to leave the premises after being asked to leave, the attendance of the
police and an arrest for breach of the peace are entirely in order.
Therefore, there is no problem at the moment with the police
intervening in precisely those
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07112811000508"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether anybody has had a chance to look at the case since
the Second Reading debate and to see why it should not be applicable in
the case of health service premises as opposed to any other premises.
It seems to me that it gives a clear indication that the police would
not be acting improperly if they were asked to deal with such a
disturbance and to apply existing law. That is the first
point.</div>
					<a name="07112811000509"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point is that if there are, for some reason, the police or
anybody connected with the health service have insufficient powers, why
are the Government seeking to address this nuisance in respect only of
NHS premises rather than other public premises and other Government
offices? As we all know, there are premises run by the Department for
Work and Pensions, for instance, where there is every bit as much of a
risk of violent and disturbing behaviour on the part of the occasional
client as there is in a hospital. Why is the protection afforded by the
clause not open to other premises that are run by the state for the
benefit of the citizen? There is no obvious
answer.</div>
					<a name="07112811000510"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come to the third question. If the Minister can satisfy me that it is
necessary to deal with health service premises and not any other
Government premises, why does he restrict the application of this
clause to hospitals? This point was made by hon. Members on both sides
of the House on Second Reading. If the provision applies to hospitals,
it should surely apply to other premises on which treatment is carried
out on behalf of the health service, which are not described as
hospitals: surgeries, clinics and any other premises where a doctor,
nurse or paramedic of one kind or another
practices.</div>
					<a name="07112811000511"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
I should declare my interest as a qualified optician, although I have
not practiced within the health service, or anywhere else, for a very
long time. Presumably, there may be circumstances in which I
re-register and provide services under contract to the health service
again. If I did, why would I not be protected; why would a GP not be
protected; why would the practice nurse not be protected in the same
way as a hospital? That is why I tabled amendment No. 339, which covers
all treatment provided by NHS staff members, who are defined in the
clause as anyone working directly for the NHS or under contract to it,
which covers every possible NHS treatment that might be provided. Why
are those other NHS staff members
excluded?</div>
					<a name="07112811000512"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 337 and 338 would remove subsection (1)(c), which makes the
extraordinary exclusion that the one type of person who cannot be
subject to the provision is someone who arrives at a hospital seeking
treatment. An awful lot of the people who cause disturbances in
hospitals arrive seeking treatment&#151;ask anyone who works in
accident and emergency or trauma units and they will confirm that.
Those people are specifically exempt from the provisions of the clause,
which seems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column625" />Column number: 625</div>extraordinary. I suspect that it is to avoid any potential human rights
implications of effectively refusing treatment to someone who has
suffered a serious injury. I can only presume that that is the
rationale, but it makes the clause almost ineffective. It means that
staff can shoo off people who are so-called friends of a patient, but
when patients&#151;they may be intoxicated or simply fed up with
waiting, and expressing themselves violently or not liking the
treatment that they are getting&#151;start throwing their weight
around and causing a disturbance, the clause will not apply. A
policeman, if called, will be required to assess whether the person
causing the affray requires treatment and whether they are seeking
it&#151;a diagnosis that I would suggest the average police constable
is not well equipped to
make.</div>
					<a name="07112811000513"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
seem to be a number of anomalies in the clause, well intentioned though
its. I support the intention behind it, but the Minister needs to
explain why it has been framed as it has and allay my suspicion that it
is another press release translated into statute rather than a serious
attempt to mitigate a real
nuisance.</div>
					<a name="07112811000514"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001054"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I largely agree with the thrust of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s points. Like him, I fully accept that there are NHS
staff who live in genuine fear of violence and abuse, particularly on
Friday and Saturday nights in some of our inner-city accident and
emergency units. They deserve all the protection that any public
servant should get when looking after the
public.</div>
					<a name="07112811000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know from the consultation document, &#147;Tackling nuisance and
disturbance behaviour on NHS premises&#148;, that violence against
staff is estimated to cost the NHS between &#163;10 million and
&#163;270 million per annum, depending on the degree of absenteeism
due to sickness that can be attributed to an assault. It is quite a
wide margin, but there is clearly a genuine problem.</div>
					<a name="07112811000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know from
my constituency experience that the accident and emergency unit at
Leicester Royal infirmary is not a nice place to be on a Friday night
once the pubs have emptied, now that the Government&#146;s 24-hour
binge drinking is&#151;no, that was a cheeky remark. We all
understand that a lot of people who are high on drugs injure themselves
for one reason or another and end up in the accident and emergency
room. They cause injury not only to themselves but to the hospital and
ambulance staff who do their best to assist them. I, like the hon.
Gentleman, think that the staff deserve every protection. However,
there is plenty of criminal legislation on the statute book already
that can assist
them.</div>
					<a name="07112811000517"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem lies not so much in the need for new laws, but in the need for
sufficient security staff employed directly by the hospital, or police
officers, to sort people out when they are causing a nuisance. The
police could arrest people and take them away and the security staff
could presumably remove them from the hospital if they were causing a
nuisance, threatening violence or using foul and abusive language and
refusing to leave the premises when invited to do so. I do not think
that there is an absolute right to receive hospital treatment. Is
there? Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell me. People have no
right to remain on hospital premises and to threaten to commit crimes
or to commit them. I would not have any sympathy with anybody, even if
he had a broken arm, who took a swipe at a nurse or was abusive to a
porter and was asked to leave the premises. It must be a condition of
entering the premises that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column626" />Column number: 626</div>people behave themselves. I do not see why we should be in the least bit
sympathetic to people who need treatment but refuse to behave properly,
especially if they have, of their own free will, got drunk or taken
drugs that have loosened their
inhibition.</div>
					<a name="07112811000518"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the motive behind the measure is good, we need some persuading that it
is necessary, or we will just clutter the statute book with yet more
Acts. About 3,000 additional criminal offences have been created since
the Labour Government came into office. We really need to implement a
few of those. I cite the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which is still not
implemented to a considerable
extent.</div>
					<a name="07112811000519"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have just become the patron of the Lambeth branch of the
Alzheimer&#146;s Society. That encourages me to remind the Committee
about something in the House of Commons Library brief, on page
91:</div>
					<a name="07112811000826"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A

that:</div>
					<a name="07112811000827"></a><div class="hs_brev">We
agree that nuisance and disturbance behaviour on NHS premises is a
problem. But we do not support these proposals, which we believe are
unnecessary and badly thought-through, and which we fear will fail to
have the intended effect on nuisance and disturbance behaviour on

patients.&#148;</div>

people to do the making safe: passing laws does not necessarily do
that.</div>

we need hospitals to be sufficiently funded so that they can employ

						</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman makes an extremely
important point about those with mental health problems. Under
subsection (1)(a), a person commits an offence if they act

							<a name="07112811001058"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I do not think that we need to prolong this
conversation for too long. We all agree that NHS staff need protecting,
just as we all agree that DWP staff and library staff in town halls
need protection. That is not the issue. The question is whether clause
104 and its successor clauses are apt to do what the Government and
everyone else would like. I have my doubts. Essentially, it is a
question of the police and NHS security staff doing the job that the
public employ them to do. I agree that that is not easy and that
primary care trusts and hospital trusts are either running a deficit or
strapped for cash. If there is money to spare, they will spend it first
on hospital equipment or medical procedures, rather than on security
staff, who very often are the first to go if there is a need to make
cutbacks. Again, however, that is a wider issue for the
Government.</div>
					<a name="07112811000528"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome, I accept that the clause has not been
put in for a wrong or improper purpose, but I have grave doubts about
whether it will improve the situation. To use an expression that is
often used in defence debates, unless we have troops on the ground, we
will not achieve very much. It might make us feel better, but it will
not achieve anything. I am not going to vote against clause 104; I just
think that it is one of those things that is nice to have, but which
does not achieve
much.</div>

							<a name="07112811001059"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I thank hon. Members for
their comments.</div>
					<a name="07112811000530"></a><div class="hs_Para">The majority
of health bodies that responded to the 2006 consultation, which dealt
with tackling nuisance behaviour and disturbances on NHS health care
premises, felt that the existing law was inadequate for dealing with
low-level nuisance behaviour and that something needed to be done. We
have tried to respond to points put to us by NHS staff about problems
that they experience. I accept that if a doctor, nurse, cleaner or
anybody on NHS premises is attacked&#151;in the sense that we all
understand that word&#151;or violently abused, we would expect the
police to be called. That is the right and proper response. However,
the clauses before us deal with lower-level nuisance behaviour and
disturbances that could escalate into something more serious if they
are not stopped. I take the point that criminal sanctions are available
for serious breaches of the peace and disturbances, but the clauses
address what we were told is a very real need to deal with low-level
nuisance behaviour. I think that they will make an important
difference.</div>
					<a name="07112811000531"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accepting the
amendments would run a significant risk of criminalising the actions of
a person seeking medical treatment or advice, or of denying them a
service, because they display low-level nuisance or disturbance
behaviour. I say to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that I do
not think that it is acceptable to deny medical treatment to those who
need 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column628" />Column number: 628</div>it. It may be vital to that person&#146;s health and well-being that
they receive the medical advice or treatment that they have sought by
attending hospital. Their need for treatment may far outweigh any need
to remove them from the premises for having committed the offence of
causing a nuisance or disturbance on the premises. This is a strange
reversal of the role, but it may be disproportionate to allow people to
move those who are in need of that medical treatment.</div>
					<a name="07112811000532"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
application of this offence to non-patients only is a targeted response
to a specific problem. Our primary focus is to ensure that patients
receive the care they need and that staff can work in NHS premises
without risk of that disturbance and low-level
nuisance.</div>

							<a name="07112811001061"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Will the hon. Gentleman bear with me until the
end? I just want to put a couple of arguments against the points that
he made and then to say something that might be more helpful.</div>
					<a name="07112811000535"></a><div class="hs_Para">Widening the
scope of the offence to apply to a broad range of NHS health care
settings would prove impractical. GP surgeries, for example, exist in a
different environment from hospital premises. Most hospitals have
full-time security guards and CCTV coverage to protect staff from those
causing a nuisance or disturbance and to deter potential offenders. In
a hospital setting therefore, trained security staff could assist in
exercising the power to remove a person from the premises should they
commit the
offence.</div>
					<a name="07112811000536"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
all GP practices&#151;not many in my experience&#151;have such
security services available to them. Therefore enabling the offence to
be committed on such premises would prove problematic as there would be
no guarantee that a correctly trained person would be available to
remove an offender from the premises, using reasonable force if
necessary. Applying these proposals to GP practices would potentially
put the safety of GPs and their practice staff at risk if they were to
use these powers. Applying the offence to a pharmacy setting would also
prove impractical, as it would be difficult to distinguish between
whether the offence was committed against the pharmacist in their
capacity for dispensing NHS prescriptions in their role as an NHS staff
member, or in their capacity for selling general retail goods as a
private business
person.</div>
					<a name="07112811000537"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that I am trying to make to the hon. Gentleman is that there are
issues with respect to extending the scope of the offence outside NHS
premises but, as the Lord Chancellor said, we will reflect on this. I
know that the hon. Gentleman shrugged a little at a couple of the
points I was making, but there are difficulties with extending this. It
is more complicated than simply saying that the offence will be
extended to premises such as NHS doctors&#146; surgeries or some
others that might be considered to be associated with the NHS. The Lord
Chancellor committed to looking at this and certainly I will commit to
do that
too.</div>
					<a name="07112811000538"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to go into too much other detail about clause 104. I
welcome the points that have been made in the sense that the issue is
not that people oppose the clause, but whether they believe it will add
anything to the safety of staff and the security of those who act
appropriately in hospitals. All I can say is that this is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column629" />Column number: 629</div>serious attempt to plug what we see as a gap. It is not in place of the
police. It is an attempt to prevent the escalation of nuisance
behaviour into more serious behaviour that might require the attendance
of police officers. I hope that in the light of those comments the hon.
Gentleman will consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112811000539"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001062"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I was not
desperately convinced by some of his arguments. I wonder whether he
entirely convinced himself. The idea that a pharmacist does not need
protection if he happens to be selling a comb with the packet of
aspirins that he is selling at the time seems a threadbare argument. I
am also concerned that a Home Office Minister should come out with what
is to me at least the novel argument that a person can commit an
offence only if there are security staff available to detain him or to
notify a constable. That appeared to be what he was saying. He seemed
to be saying that that could be an offence if it was in a hospital,
because there were security staff and CCTV, but if it was in a place
where there happened not to be security staff and CCTV, it would not be
an offence at all. I think that, if we require the attendance of a
police officer for an offence to be committed, that has rendered most
of the criminal law inoperable in most of my constituency. That seems a
novel concept in the interpretation of statutory
offences.</div>
					<a name="07112811000540"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also think that the Home Office has not cottoned on to changes in the
way that we operate medicine in this country. I say that because
hospitals will be, if Lord Darzi of Denham has his way, a thing of the
past. We are going to move away from hospital provision towards smaller
units, the so-called polyclinic. The polyclinic does not constitute a
hospital and it is available for a particular range of medical or
surgical procedures, but I would say that it falls between hospital
provision and a general practice surgery. All those polyclinics, which
the Government now have as a stated policy for the provision of
services, will fall outside the ambit of the clause. Therefore, I think
that the Minister needs to look seriously at how he chooses to define
NHS premises for the purposes of this clause.</div>
					<a name="07112811000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point
concerns people with mental health problems, dementias and the like.
The Minister drew our attention to clause 105(4)(b) in that respect. I
doubt very much whether it is appropriate to require an
&#147;authorised officer&#148;, by which we can assume that we mean
a security officer, to have the necessary training to form a view that
has any validity in law as to what damage he or she may cause to the
&#147;physical or mental health&#148; of a patient by any action
that he or she may take.</div>

think

					<a name="07112811000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to say one particular thing in conclusion: the Minister
makes his entire argument on the basis that there is no provision at
the moment for dealing with low-level nuisance. He says that we are
covered for assault; we all know that and we know that we are covered
for serious violence offered to members of staff. However, he says that
we are not covered for low-level nuisance. I believe that we are. The
Minister has not addressed that issue. He has also not explained why,
when the NHS bodies come to the Home Office and say that they have a
problem in this regard, the Home Office does not answer,
&#147;Actually, you haven&#146;t if the law is interpreted
properly, and we will issue new guidance to the police and to your
security services, so that you know where you stand.&#148; Instead,
he simply says, &#147;Oh, you say you have a problem, so let&#146;s
change the law.&#148; I think that that is rather a superficial
approach for the Home Office to take, and he still has not convinced me
of the utility of the clause in its present
form.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001069"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I rise to draw attention to the reservations
expressed by the Standing Committee for Youth Justice about the clause.
It is concerned that individual support orders have not proved a great
success. The clause would allow ISOs to be made more than once, not
only simultaneously with an ASBO, and to be attached
to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column631" />Column number: 631</div>ASBOs that are obtained on conviction or in the county court, whereas at
present they are available only in civil proceedings in the magistrates
courts.</div>
					<a name="07112811000558"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
committee says that only a limited number of ISOs have been used and
suggests that the low take-up rate reflects a lack of knowledge about
ISOs among sentencers and youth offending team duty officers. It also
suggests that, in cases when a young person had contact with the youth
offending team through an existing court order, there was a general
assumption that an ISO was unnecessary because it would add nothing to
services that were already in
place.</div>
					<a name="07112811000559"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
committee put it to me that the Government&#146;s proposals might
increase the number of ISOs to an extent, but that they would not deal
either of those issues and would reinforce the current perception that
support for vulnerable young people subject to ISOs should be provided
through the youth justice system, and youth offending teams in
particular. It argues that it is a matter for other support services
and that the requirements within ISOs could make matters
worse&#151;not better&#151;because there could be breach
proceedings if the requirements of the ISO were not carried out by the
young person. The committee believes that the support services should
be available, irrespective of the behaviour of the young person, as a
necessary part of rehabilitation. I welcome any comments that the
Minister might have about my
remarks.</div>
					<a name="07112811000560"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001070"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> In some respects, I agree with the hon. Gentleman.
He is right to say that individual support orders are not used to the
extent that we would hope. Part of the intention behind the clause is
to increase the number of ISOs that are issued. There is a lack of
knowledge. That is a fair point. It is something that we have addressed
through the Home Office, but it will now also be dealt with through
other Departments, including the Ministry of Justice. The whole point
of individual support orders is to deal with some of the criticisms
that have been made and ensure that young people subject to antisocial
behaviour orders are given the support that they need to help them
address their antisocial behaviour. The individual support orders try
to achieve some of the things that he and other members of the
Committee have argued, throughout today, are necessary if we are to
divert young people away from antisocial behaviour and criminal
activity. The clause extends the use of individual support orders and
makes them available for antisocial behaviour orders, on
conviction.</div>
					<a name="07112811000561"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument for individual support orders is one of resources and of
agencies working together, but we need to ensure that more of them are
used, because they are often very successful and it is a source of
regret that they are not used in more
cases.</div>

							<a name="07112811001074"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I do not wish to take up too much time.
Nevertheless, it is important to register some points about this part
of the Bill, albeit that it is one on which we can reach agreement, and
there is consensus on the need for reform of procedures concerning
police misconduct and performance in the investigation of complaints of
police
misconduct.</div>
					<a name="07112811000580"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to avoid the situation which has been referred to in past debates
and reviews as the extreme end, in which a police officer who has
completed two years&#146; probation and become a full constable is
referred to as almost unsackable. There are also other cases of
low-level misconduct that need to be dealt with expeditiously, properly
and with early resolution at the lowest level. We must respond to
concerns that hearings should be less formal and not over-adversarial,
and ensure that a quasi-judicial adversarial manner, not dissimilar
from a military court tribunal, is not adopted in all cases. We welcome
the moves, following the recommendation of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column633" />Column number: 633</div>the Taylor review, to ensure that the mechanism for disciplining
officers is proportionate, timely, transparent, fair and
cost-effective.</div>
				
					<a name="07112811000581"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a need to ensure that investigations proceed expeditiously and that
time limits are in place. Concerns have been raised about the prolonged
amount of time for which police officers are subject to investigation,
particularly those who are suspended&#151;they are referred to as
&#147;gated&#148;&#151;and subject to conditions. For example,
one condition is that they cannot take on any front-line duties. The
concern relayed to me is that the position has been accepted and has
then continued for several months&#151;indeed, for a year in some
cases. The officers have not had a formal resolution while they have
been gated, and they have been in an invidious position while not
knowing the outcome of their misconduct hearing. They are suspended
with conditions.</div>
					<a name="07112811000582"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to deal with the issue in a timely manner and across the
board&#151;for police officers at the lower as well as the higher end
of the scale. It would be helpful to receive an assurance from the
Minister about the introduction of time limits. They would be helpful
in such situations and would ensure that we would proceed, as we all
would wish, to a quick resolution with a proper, accountable and
transparent approach throughout the
hearings.</div>
					<a name="07112811000583"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001075"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Schedule 19 makes several amendments to the Police
Act 1996 to enable changes to be made to the procedures for dealing
with police conduct, efficiency and performance. The schedule also
makes equivalent changes to the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987 for
the purposes of the Ministry of Defence police, and to the Railways and
Transport Safety Act 2003 for the purposes of the British Transport
police. The changes arise out of the recommendations of the Taylor
review into disciplinary arrangements, which was published in January
2005. The recommendations are aimed at improving and modernising police
disciplinary and performance procedures, and they have received the
full support of the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales.
Current procedures for dealing with police officer discipline and poor
performance issues are set out in the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2004
and the Police (Efficiency) (Amendment) Regulations 1999. New proposed
conduct and performance regulations, which are being prepared and are
available for viewing, set out the proposed procedures for dealing with
discipline and performance issues. The proposed regulations will
implement the recommendations of the Taylor review, and they have been
prepared with and approved by the Police Advisory Board for England and
Wales.</div>
					<a name="07112811000584"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments to the Police Act 1996 in the schedule will permit the
Secretary of State to make regulations setting out new procedures. Time
limits&#151;this has just arrived in my brain&#151;are covered in
draft regulations made under the Bill. They have been consulted on and
we will share them with the Committee in due course.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001076"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 340, in
clause 114, page 78, line 6, at end
add&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2AA) In carrying out
an inspection of a police authority under subsection (2A), the
inspectors of constabulary may request one or more other police
authorities (or their representatives) to assess any aspect of
performance and to make a
report.&#148;&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07112811000591"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ought to declare my &#147;previous&#148; at the beginning: I was
formerly chair of a police authority and a member of the Audit
Commission, so I have seen the process from both
ends.</div>
					<a name="07112811000872"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07112811000592"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a general view among police authorities that they have no problem
with the sort of joint inspection procedure that the Government have
mind. Indeed, they see advantages in Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate
of constabulary joining forces with the Audit Commission to look at how
a police authority discharges its
duties.</div>
					<a name="07112811000593"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reasons for that are fairly clear: a police authority does not fall
into the normal category of local authorities that are the subject of
Audit Commission work. It is a form of local authority, but it is a
very specialist one that deals with areas that are beyond the normal
range of matters considered by the Audit Commission because of its
policing element. We have an inspectorate&#151;Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectorate of constabulary&#151;that is specifically charged with
looking at policing issues, but nevertheless has little understanding
of the issues relating to local authorities. So, putting the two
together would produce an inspection regime that would cover all
aspects of a police authority&#146;s
role.</div>
					<a name="07112811000594"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
has been a long-term objective of the Government. They intended to
create the joint procedure in the context of the Police and Justice Act
2006, but the proposal was dropped when there was a substantial change
in that Bill on criminal justice inspections and, save for section 29
of that Bill, the matter was put on the back burner, albeit, I believe,
with the intention of bringing it back at the first opportunity. This
Bill is that
opportunity.</div>
					<a name="07112811000595"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am going to argue against not the principle of the proposal, but the
detail in the Bill, because the drafting is somewhat obscure. It relies
on people putting together several different enactments in order to see
exactly what is proposed. Indeed, if one were to read the Bill without
looking at other enactments, one would assume that Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectorate of constabulary was taking over the role of the Audit
Commission and excluding it from the inspection role.</div>
					<a name="07112811000596"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
believe that that is what the Government intend. My understanding is
that they are relying on section 10 of the Local Government Act 1999 to
give the Audit Commission the power to inspect police authorities, and
on section 29 of the Police and Justice Act 2006 to enable Her
Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary to act jointly with a
public authority&#151;in this instance, the Audit Commission. That
forms the structure around which the joint inspections will take place.
It would have been better to have expressed that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column635" />Column number: 635</div>explicitly in the Bill, rather than people having to hunt around three
different enactments to find out what the situation
is.</div>
					<a name="07112811000597"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment deals with something that is, to the Association of Police
Authorities, a specific omission: peer review. I hope that the Minister
will accept that I constructed the amendment myself to provide an
opportunity to discuss the matter. The amendment might not be perfect,
so I will accept any drafting amendments that he wishes to make, if he
accepts the principle.</div>
					<a name="07112811000598"></a><div class="hs_Para">The peer
review element is important. The Association of Police Authorities
thought that it had secured the agreement of the Home Office that peer
review would form part of the inspection process. It was extremely
pleased about that because it had pressed for it for a long time. It
felt that if there was to be a robust investigation process putting
together HMIC and the Audit Commission, while at the same time giving
other police authorities that face the same problems a role in
assessing the performance of a police authority, that would give the
best guarantee of a successful
outcome.</div>
					<a name="07112811000599"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
association is very disappointed that the Bill does not reflect what it
thought had been agreed with the Home Office. It might still be the
Government&#146;s intention that a peer review should take place, but
the statutory basis on which it would be constructed is not clear. It
would be better if that were made explicit in the clause, which is why
I have tabled the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112811000600"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will accept the amendment or, if he accepts the
principle of it, come back with a proposal with an alternative wording.
If he feels that that is not necessary because the objective can be
secured by other means, it would still be helpful if he were to make it
clear to the Committee that it is the Government&#146;s view that
peer review should form an essential part of the inspection process. If
he were to do that, I would not press my amendment to a
Division.</div>
					<a name="07112811000601"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001077"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I apologise to the Committee, but this important
amendment would have an impact on police authorities across the country
and I need to read my response into the record. When I have done so, I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel reassured. Given that my
comments will be read by many people, I hope that the Committee will
bear with me, notwithstanding the lateness of the
hour.</div>
					<a name="07112811000602"></a><div class="hs_Para">Police
authorities play a critical role in securing continuous improvement in
the police service, and we need to ensure that they are performing
their functions effectively. A systematic process for the assessment of
police authority performance would enable judgments and comparisons to
be made about performance, help to drive further performance
improvement, and make it possible to target support to poorly
performing authorities. It is our intention, therefore, to make it
possible for inspections to be carried out jointly by Her
Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary and the Audit Commission
across the full range of police authority
functions.</div>
					<a name="07112811000603"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the inspectorate of constabulary and the Audit Commission between them
will bring to bear wide professional expertise and knowledge of
policing and the inspection of police authorities, we agree that police
authorities provide valuable experience that should be available as
part of any inspection process. We see peer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column636" />Column number: 636</div>review by authorities forming an integral part of the programme of
inspections carried out by the inspectorate of constabulary and the
Audit Commission. However, it is right that legislation specifies at
this stage only the bodies that will have responsibility for inspecting
authorities and the extent of the inspection
process.</div>
					<a name="07112811000604"></a><div class="hs_Para">Giving
an element of the inspection process legislative force, as is suggested
by the amendment, would confer unnecessary prominence, reduce
flexibility and limit the ability to take account of different
circumstances in different police authorities. I would argue that that
sort of detail is best set out in the joint inspection framework and
methodology that will be developed to inform the work. A protocol will
be drawn up by all those involved and will provide a clear basis on
which to manage a programme of inspection activities. It will set out
the respective roles and responsibilities of all the bodies involved
and ensure that all appropriate skills and knowledge are
available.</div>
					<a name="07112811000605"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
protocol will be developed with the Association of Police Authorities
to ensure that its knowledge and understanding of the work of
authorities is reflected. The role of peer review will be spelled out.
The inspectorate of constabulary and the Audit Commission are ready to
explore how best to bring that into the inspection
process.</div>
					<a name="07112811000606"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
might further add that the Home Affairs Committee report on police
funding welcomed the development of an inspection framework by the
inspectorate of constabulary and the Audit Commission, and supported
its speedy implementation. I hope that with my reference to the
importance of peer review, the hon. Gentleman will feel sufficiently
reassured.</div>
					<a name="07112811000607"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001078"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> That was an extremely helpful recital of the
Government&#146;s position. It is also possible to take perverse
pleasure in the fact that Ministers and shadow Ministers can sometimes
aggravate Whips who do not provide sufficient time for proper
consideration by increasing the length of our consideration of such
matters. That is quite apart from the intrinsic importance of the
announcement that the Minister just made, but, in both respects, the
Minister&#146;s response has been helpful, so I thank him for it. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

							<a name="07112811001081"></a>Harry
Cohen:
						</b> I have tabled amendments to four of the next five
clauses, so I shall try to be succinct. They have mainly been tabled on
behalf of Liberty, as the Committee knows. A couple have been tabled on
behalf of the Refugee Council. I have also received representations in
recent days from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, and I
might mention a couple of its points.</div>
					<a name="07112811000615"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments particularly concern the definition of a family of a person
designated with special immigration status. They are meant to relate to
foreign criminals who are liable to deportation, but cannot be deported
for all sorts of reasons&#151;perhaps because of their human rights,
or because of the risk of going back to a country where they will be
tortured or killed. Such people are not necessarily criminals, by the
way, but we will come on to that later. There might be a suspicion that
they have been involved in something that has led to their designation
under that status.</div>
					<a name="07112811000616"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
mentions the family of a person, and by that the Government have
included a person&#146;s spouse and children. My amendments would
delete any reference to children. The UN convention on the rights of
the child makes specific provision to ensure that children are not
disadvantaged as a consequence of the actions of their parents. Article
2.2
states:</div>
					<a name="07112811000832"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;States
Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is
protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the
basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the
child&#146;s parents, legal guardians, or family
members.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000617"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is clear.
Special immigration status should not apply to children just because it
has been applied to their parents&#151;or to just one parent. That
would be wrong. The child would be left in limbo and under all sorts of
restrictions, perhaps severe restrictions. The status would apply to
children under 18, but people who are under 18 can work and 16 or
17-year-olds could have a restriction placed on their ability to work.
They might not have access to education or to child care. All sorts of
other restrictions could be imposed, and that is a serious point. The
Government should say why they are breaching the UN convention on the
rights of the child through this clause.</div>
					<a name="07112811000618"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001082"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I rise to support some of the contentions made by
the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead. Indeed, I am a co-signatory to
amendment No. 330. As is not unusual in my part of the world, I was
brought up a nonconformist. I believe that the Catholic Church has now
abandoned the concept of limbo as a waiting room in which nothing can
happen between death and the transfer to paradise. The Government,
however, are attempting to introduce their own equivalent of limbo in
these clauses with a new, unique status that effectively prevents
anyone with this special immigration status from having any capacity to
do what might be normal for a person who is resident in this country.
It is difficult to see the justification for the proposal. I assume
that we will have a stand part debate on this clause, so I shall not
cover all my points at this
stage.</div>
					<a name="07112811000873"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9

					<a name="07112811000619"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

familial relationship than the wider family concept. We are otherwise
in danger of extending the provisions more widely than could possibly
be justified by the difficulties caused by a few cases that have been
fairly well publicised. The Minister should clarify what may and may
not be appropriate or applicable to an individual who is the principal
holder of this new status and to any other person who has a familial
connection with them. We are getting dangerously close to having a form
of punitive action based on a sort of collective responsibility that is
alien to the traditions of this country&#146;s justice
system.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001083"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I welcome the opportunity that the amendment
gives us to debate the problematic issues concerning the family members
of designated people. I acknowledge that the amendment is intended to
distinguish the circumstances of such family members and to deal with
them proportionately and fairly. It is also intended to amend the
Government&#146;s approach on dealing with people whom they do not
wish to give ordinary leave to remain&#151;perhaps due to a lack of
ability to remove them. Let us not avoid the need to deal carefully
with family members.</div>
					<a name="07112811000622"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the clause has been discussed, and we might debate it in more detail
during the stand part debate. That issue is relevant when considering
how to deal properly with family members. I understand from the
research paper that the measures are intended to cover about 50 people.
I am concerned whether they are intended to deal with those 50 people
proportionately, or whether they are a response to the Afghan and other
cases, which have caused public concern. It is important that the
pressure to deal with this problem does not bring in its wake
associated problems with family members. I look forward to hearing the
Minister&#146;s
reply.</div>
					<a name="07112811000623"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001084"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> In answer to the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate, we anticipate that about 50 people will be subject to the
special immigration status. I shall answer his other point when I
remember
it.</div>
					<a name="07112811000624"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might assist the Committee if I clarify why the Bill provides for the
designation of family members. Special immigration status is, as the
term implies, an immigration measure, and it was&#151;I remember the
point now&#151;introduced as a result of the Afghan hijack and the
various problems that arose from that.</div>
					<a name="07112811000625"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a matter
of policy, the Border and Immigration Agency does not grant dependants
with leave in line&#151;a form of leave that is more favourable than
that given to the principal applicant. A person&#146;s claim to apply
for leave as the dependant of another person stands or falls with that
of their spouse, parent or partner. They cannot expect to emerge from
the process with more than the person on whose claim their own claim is
based. Consequently, if the principal applicant is given a new special
immigration status, we must have the power to designate the family as
well as the foreign criminal. I should make it clear that that is the
only reason for extending designation beyond a foreign
criminal.</div>
					<a name="07112811000626"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also make it clear that we will designate family members only if
the principal applicant is designated, and that a family member who has
been designated will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 639</div>be able to apply for leave in their own right and, if they qualify, be
granted it. There is nothing to prevent a family member from applying
in their own right before they are designated if it seems likely that
the principal applicant will be designated. There are two aims behind
the conditions that can be imposed: first, to prevent a foreign
criminal from establishing links with this country that might
constitute an additional obstacle to his eventual deportation; and,
secondly, to maintain contact with a foreign criminal and his immediate
family until such time as his removal becomes possible. The purpose of
the conditions is not punishment, but merely to allow a situation to be
managed.</div>
					<a name="07112811000627"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill creates a support regime to ensure that designated persons,
whether a single adult or a family group, have access to some support.
Children who are designated may be required to live with their parents,
but one would expect that to happen anyway. Depending on their age,
they may have to accompany a designated person when the latter attends
a reporting centre, but that could apply even when the children are not
required to report. That might be regrettable, but it is not a reason
for not requiring the parents to
report.</div>
					<a name="07112811000628"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the provision is to deal with an anomaly that arose
following the Afghan hijack case. It is designed to manage the
situation, not to punish. Other members of the family, other than the
foreign criminal, can apply in their own right, and the various support
and processes will be available to them, including if they are
children. The UK Borders Act 2007, as I am sure my hon. Friend the
Member for Leyton and Wanstead knows, introduces a code of practice to
keep children safe from
harm.</div>
					<a name="07112811000629"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is difficult, and no one intends to put children or others at a
disadvantage. We believe that we have made a proportionate response to
an anomaly that arose as a result of a particular
circumstance.</div>

						 I appreciate the Minister&#146;s response,
but I am not convinced. He says that he does not want to give links to
a parent who is a designated foreign criminal by giving rights to a
child by way of not designating the child. The solution is simple: do
not allow the parents those rights in such circumstances, but do not
take that out on the child. We could legislate, or have it as an
administrative policy, that that link will not be made. The child
should not necessarily be subject to the same special designated
status.</div>
					<a name="07112811000631"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
children approach 18 and beyond they will become increasingly
independent and will expect their own rights, but they could face
designation through no fault of their own for a long time and have
their activities, chances and income restricted in their growing
independence, thus keeping them in the same sort of poverty as their
parents. I am not happy with the provision, and I hope that the
Minister will ask his colleagues who deal specifically with immigration
to look at that aspect again. I shall take a close look in
<i class="I">Hansard</i> at what he said.</div>

							<a name="07112811001088"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> This is the opportunity to widen the debate on this
aspect of the Bill a little. As always, I accept the Minister&#146;s
good faith in proposing the clause and I appreciate that it is not his
part of the Ministry that is pressing the proposal. Having said that, I
find it impossible to reconcile the Secretary of State&#146;s stated
objective of simplifying immigration law with the inclusion in the Bill
of this provision, which makes the law in that area more complex. It is
complex enough already, yet the Bill will introduce an entirely new
status.</div>
					<a name="07112811000637"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government intended to deal with the issue, it is hard to find adequate
reason why that did not happen in the context of the UK Borders Act
2007, which could have dealt with it from the point of view of an Act
concerning immigration. Instead, the provision is tacked on to a
criminal justice Bill&#151;although its presence means that this is
actually the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. The Bill now
contains a leftover from previous legislation that has been
spatchcocked into the middle in the form of part 11.</div>
					<a name="07112811000638"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
perfectly sound argument that the issue was, in fact, already dealt
with by section 16 of the UK Borders Act, which provides for
restrictions on residence and reporting. A new status is not needed in
law to provide the sorts of safeguard that the Government believe are
necessary to achieve their objectives.</div>
					<a name="07112811000639"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that the Minister knows that the provision has caused a great deal of
concern among those who have a particular interest in refugee matters.
The hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead has already mentioned the
Refugee Council, and he could have mentioned the Immigration Law
Practitioners Association, too. He could also have mentioned something
that we shall come on to when we debate the next clause: the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I do not like receiving a
briefing from the UNHCR that points out deficiencies in a proposal to
change British law. It is not appropriate for this Government or
Parliament to be addressing proposals that fall foul of the
commissioner, yet that is the position in which we find
ourselves.</div>
					<a name="07112811000640"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arguments against the proposal can be summarised quite briefly. There
is the argument that the status is unnecessary, and there is the
argument that it is disproportionate and will affect members of
extended families, as we have discussed. There is also the argument
that it is a punitive sanction without an offence for which it is the
punishment, in that it provides for people to be put into legal and
economic limbo. There is an argument, too, on the support that will be
given to the people affected. We thought that, except in exceptional
circumstances, we had got rid of the voucher system, given the problems
that it caused, but the Government are now bringing it back for this
specific class of people. As the level of support is very limited, we
are effectively condemning these criminals to progressive poverty
without any expectation that their circumstances can change in the near
future.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07112811000641"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have specific issues concerning the right of appeal. I know that the
Government are always loth to provide any right of appeal in
immigration cases, for fear that that will extend the process. However,
it is a matter of natural justice that there should be a right of
appeal against designation. There are abundant reasons why this House
should not accept this proposal as being the best way of dealing with
the problem that the Government have identified and for which I think
there are other
remedies.</div>
					<a name="07112811000642"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001089"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I want to make two comments. The first is in
relation to the UK Borders Act 2007. Why is it necessary to define
foreign criminals in a different way from the definition within the
2007 Act? This issue moves into the debate on clause 116, but perhaps I
could raise it now and not repeat it when we get to that clause. The
2007 Act is relevant when considering this part of the Bill because the
issue of the definition of foreign criminals was considered in detail.
There was pre-legislative scrutiny in which there was much
consideration of the definition. It is important to draw the Minister,
either now or when we discuss clause 116, on why there is a different
definition for the purposes of automatic deportation within the 2007
Act, which excludes the categories that are within the designation and
the definition of &#147;foreign criminal&#148; in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112811000643"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point on which I ask the Minister for some guidance is on the
right of appeal. It may well be that in the concern to deal
expeditiously and appropriately with these designated foreign
criminals, the Government will store up for themselves problems in
relation to appeals. While the Bill does not provide for any normal
route of appeal, it would still be open, through the administrative
route, for an application to be made by way of judicial review. That
process is lengthy and may well lead to those 50 or so cases a year
being dealt with in a lengthy manner, while the right of appeal might
be able to deal with them in a much more appropriate and expeditious
manner. That would also be consistent with the principles of natural
justice.</div>
					<a name="07112811000644"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001090"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank hon. Members for their comments. To spell
it out, the purpose of the part on special immigration status, as hon.
Members know, is to deny immigration leave and its benefits to foreign
criminals. That cannot be achieved through existing legislation. The
denial of leave is necessary to demonstrate that, although these people
cannot be removed because of our obligations under the European
convention on human rights, they remain in the UK, to a certain extent
only because we cannot remove them. The provisions will help to ensure
that those people do not put down roots in this country by taking up
employment and establish themselves here, which would make it difficult
to remove them when the original barrier to deportation no longer
applies.</div>
					<a name="07112811000645"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
11, of which clause 115 is the first clause, creates the new
immigration status in response to two rulings by the High Court and the
Court of Appeal in 2006 in a case relating to the immigration status to
be afforded to a group of men who arrived in the UK in February 2000,
having seized control of an aircraft on an internal domestic flight in
Afghanistan. The High Court ruled, and the Court of Appeal confirmed,
that as these men 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column642" />Column number: 642</div>had won their appeals against the decision to refuse them leave to enter
the UK, it was not open to the Government to leave them on temporary
admission. The Court of Appeal commented that if the Secretary of State
wanted to be able to withhold immigration leave, it was open to him to
legislate to that effect. That is what part 11 will
do.</div>
					<a name="07112811000646"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not believe that it is appropriate that we should be put in a
position where there is no option but to grant immigration leave, with
all the advantages that flow from it, to individuals whose presence in
the UK we consider undesirable and whom we would remove if there were
no ECHR barrier to doing so. A person will be given the new status by
being designated. Accordingly, the clause provides that certain persons
may be designated by the Secretary of State. It allows him to designate
a person who is a foreign criminal&#151;a term defined in clause
116&#151;who is liable to deportation but cannot be removed from the
United Kingdom because of section 6 of the Human Rights
Act.</div>
					<a name="07112811000647"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
family members&#151;that is to say the spouse or civil partner and
any children under 18&#151;of a foreign criminal liable to
deportation may also be designated. As I have said, that is necessary
to cover cases in which a person&#146;s dependents have applied for
immigration leave. As a matter of policy, the Border and Immigration
Agency does not grant dependents who apply for leave &#147;in
line&#148;&#151;a form of leave that is more favourable than that
given to the principal applicant. However, they may claim in their own
right.</div>
					<a name="07112811000648"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
person with the right of abode in the UK may not be designated, nor may
designation occur if the Secretary of State thinks it would breach the
UK&#146;s obligations under the refugee convention or the
person&#146;s right under Community treaties. One effect of
designation provided for by clause 117 is that individuals concerned do
not have leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. In the normal
course of events, foreign criminals who are guilty of serious crimes
will face deportation, and there will be no question of granting any
leave.</div>
					<a name="07112811000649"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that it is wrong that foreign criminals who cannot be deported
should receive leave for which they would not otherwise qualify solely
and simply because they cannot be removed. As I have said, we will not
designate if it would breach the UK&#146;s obligations under the
refugee convention. In practice, that means that we will not designate
a recognised refugee. Of course, if we discover that a person who has
been recognised as a refugee falls within the scope of the exclusion
clause in article 1F of the refugee convention, we may decide to revoke
his refugee
status.</div>
					<a name="07112811000650"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, the provision will enable us to place someone who is liable to
be deported, but cannot be removed from the UK because of rights under
the ECHR, on a new immigration status. It will not apply to British
citizens, recognised refugees or persons in the UK exercising treaty
rights. Subsection (1) states that the Secretary of
State</div>
					<a name="07112811000834"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may designate a
person who satisfies Condition 1 or
2&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112811000651"></a><div class="hs_Para">It does not state
that the Secretary of State will designate that person. There is
discretion available to the Secretary of State all the way through the
clauses, and the word &#147;may&#148; is often used deliberately,
rather than
&#147;will&#148;.</div>

with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering

a crime and so on. There needs only be a suspicion that there are
serious reasons for considering that&#151;it does not say that the
person must have committed a crime. As I understand it, there will be
no hearing or a chance for people to defend themselves against the
charge. That is why Liberty makes the point that the special
immigration status with which a person could be designated can be
applied to people with no conviction at all or convicted of a
relatively minor offence. That represents inappropriate and excessive
conditions upon
them.</div>
					<a name="07112811000657"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Refugee Council has gone through the history of the matter. The
Minister mentioned the Stansted Afghans, whose case was obvious in some
respects&#151;they would have fallen under article 1F. The United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has emphasised that the
exclusion clauses should be interpreted narrowly, in particular Article
1F (c) which is</div>
					<a name="07112811000836"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only triggered
in extreme circumstances by activities which attack the very basis of
the international community&#146;s coexistence. Such activity must
have an international dimension. Crimes capable of affecting
international peace, security and peaceable relations between states as
well as serious and sustained violation of human rights would fall
under that
category.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000658"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have not interpreted it in that narrow way. They have taken
it as broadly as possible and it could even extend to unacceptable
behaviour as far as I understand it and as the Refugee Council
suggests. There is an important point that it could include acts such
as encouraging criminal damage in order to coerce the state. It may
readily include many political refugees who have opposed repressive
regimes in their home countries.</div>
					<a name="07112811000659"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Joint
Committee for Human Rights fears that</div>
					<a name="07112811000837"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it will be used to deny asylum to
individuals who may have been engaged abroad in resistance to an
oppressive regime, but are caught by the UK&#146;s very broad
definition of
terrorism.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000660"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
signals some problems. It is very easy to talk about foreign criminals
when we are dealing with convicted foreign criminals, but if some of
them have not been proved to be criminals, there are problems. Again,
it is incumbent on the Government to give a clearer explanation of
their position in this
regard.</div>

							<a name="07112811001094"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I want to speak about the UNHCR concerns about
article 1F. I want to read into the record its concern about the way
that the British Government have interpreted article 1F in previous 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column644" />Column number: 644</div>UK legislation. It draws attention to section 54 of the Immigration,
Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, where article 1F(c), which deals with
persons</div>
					<a name="07112811000838"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;guilty of acts
contrary to the purposes and principles of the United

					<a name="07112811000662"></a><div class="hs_Para">is then extended
and expanded to encompass</div>
					<a name="07112811000839"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;acts of committing, preparing or
instigating terrorism (whether or not the acts amount to an actual or
inchoate offence)&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000663"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
well as acts of encouraging or inducing others to do the
same.</div>
					<a name="07112811000664"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
UNHCR says that there is a very good reason why article 1F is a
narrowly drawn provision. While it accepts that any participating state
under the convention</div>
					<a name="07112811000840"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has the prerogative to define
terrorist acts more broadly to encompass acts that may not have an
international dimension, not all acts so defined as
&#145;terrorist&#146; would fall under Article 1F
(c).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000665"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there are two
subsets that are not coterminous in terms of interpretation. The UNHCR
states:</div>
					<a name="07112811000841"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
has been a long-standing practice of many states party to the 1951
convention to maintain a restrictive interpretation and application of
article 1F (c), especially given its vague nature and potentially grave
consequences. It is UNHCR&#146;s position that article 1F(c) must be
read narrowly. Furthermore, UNHCR is concerned that exclusion from the
protection of the 1951 Refugee Convention should not be equated with
conviction for the excludable acts, due to the contrast between the
lower standard of proof in deciding Article 1F cases (clear and
credible evidence is required, no conviction is necessary)
<i class="I">vis- -vis</i> the &#145;beyond reasonable doubt&#146;
standard for criminal convictions in the
UK.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000666"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result of those
reservations the UNHCR says that it</div>
					<a name="07112811000842"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;questions whether it is
appropriate to designate persons excluded under Article 1F as foreign
&#145;criminals&#146;.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112811000667"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I say, this is a serious criticism from an impeccable source. If we are
sensible in our interpretation of the law and in our commitment to the
1951 refugee convention, we must have regard to what the body charged
with interpreting that convention has to say about the proposals. The
Minister needs to respond directly to the criticisms from the UNHCR,
and to accept that it has reservations about the way in which we have
interpreted the convention&#146;s requirements on our domestic
legislation, and that it has raised a serious issue of compliance. Our
legislation does not require a certificate of compliance with the
refugee convention in the way that Ministers are required to certify
that provisions comply with the convention on human rights. However, if
we are party to such agreements, we should have regard to its
provisions and seek to ensure that our domestic law is compliant with
it. The UNHCR is saying that it will not be, if we accept the
provisions before
us.</div>

Member for Somerton and Frome. He mentioned the concerns of the UNHCR,
but subsection (4) stipulates that a person cannot be designated if it
would breach his rights under the refugee convention. It has been
suggested that anyone considered for designation could be excluded from
protection under the convention. I do not want to get the Minister out
of jail, but it seems to be explicit in the Bill that such a

contravened. Having said that, I would be interested to hear his

Wanstead for tabling his amendments and for raising these important
matters. He has given me the opportunity to comment on them. They would
strike out the exclusion from refugee status, granted by article 1F of
the refugee convention, as one of the grounds for designation for the
purposes of special immigration status. I know that he will be aware of
the wording, but it is worth bearing mind that article 1F
says:</div>
					<a name="07112811000843"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of
the United
Nations.&#148;</div>

where a person had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for two
years or more for any offence, either in the UK or overseas, or to
imprisonment for an offence specified in the order made under section
72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, or for an
analogous offence
overseas.</div>
				
					<a name="07112811000674"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend says that designation should be limited to cases where we
are certain that a criminal offence has been committed, as evidenced by
the fact of the conviction. However, we are not talking about cases in
which there is a vague suspicion of wrongdoing on the part of an
individual, but about cases where there are serious grounds for
considering that an individual is guilty of actions so serious that
even if he has a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of
nationality, he is to be denied the protection normally afforded to a
refugee by the international community. The requirement to have serious
grounds before making any consideration means that there will need to
be clear and credible evidence on which to base a decision to exclude.
Often, people will not have been prosecuted, still less convicted.
Indeed, sometimes, the reason why such people cannot be prosecuted is
that they are in the United Kingdom. We are unable to bring them to
trial here, and we are unable to remove them for human rights
reasons.</div>
					<a name="07112811000675"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes,
people cannot be tried here for procedural reasons: in other words, the
events happened abroad and the evidence was gathered there, and
witnesses would have to be brought here. In other instances, our courts
do not have jurisdiction, even for serious offences. For example, our
courts have no jurisdiction to try a foreign national for a murder
committed overseas. Ideally, we would prefer to deport rather than
designate such individuals, but if our international human rights
obligations mean that we cannot deport a person, we want to be in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column646" />Column number: 646</div>a position to designate, so we are not forced into a position whereby we
are forced to grant leave for the person to remain here.</div>
					<a name="07112811000676"></a><div class="hs_Para">I need hardly
remind the Committee that this new status is being created in response
to the Court of Appeal ruling on the Afghan hijackers. If the conduct
in question is sufficiently serious to debar a person from the
protection of the international community as expressed in the refugee
convention, we believe that it is also sufficiently serious to
disentitle them to enter or remain in the UK. With those remarks, I
hope that my hon. Friend feels able to withdraw the

that the measure would be rarely used, and I was going to ask how rare

						<b class="B"> </b>It is known that I tabled
the amendment on behalf of Liberty. Basically, it would mean that any
condition that imposes someone&#146;s designation would not be
&#147;excessively restrictive&#148; or &#147;have a punitive
impact&#148;, bearing it in mind that the measures will bring people
to trial or judicial hearing. I shall not go further than that other
than to take the opportunity to ask for an assurance, which has been
asked for by the JCWI. If the clause is to remain part of the Bill,
JCWI wishes to seek an assurance that the measure allowing designation
with special immigration status will not in any circumstances be
employed against refugees. Using the measure against
refugees would extend it beyond the focus on foreign

							<a name="07112811001110"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I tabled amendment No. 341; the more assiduous and
less myopic Members will have noticed that it bears a marked
resemblance to amendment No. 333, with the exception that subsection
(c) is missing. I thought that it was worth tabling it to deal with the
issues of appropriateness and proportionality without introducing the
further complication of whether it is appropriate to provide a
pre-emptive condition to prevent further reoffending on the part of a
person who has already been defined as an offender under the terms of
the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112811000697"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment will allow us to explore with the Minister whether the
concept of proportionality and appropriateness might find favour.
Amendment No. 333, tabled by the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead,
is more encompassing&#151;I agree with it, incidentally&#151;but
might fall foul on the basis that the Minister is determined that it
would be appropriate to have a condition that attempts to prevent the
commission of further offences by the person when in this country. Mine
is a sort of Cohen-lite amendment, in an attempt to curry favour with
the
Minister.</div>

that I will consider them, but it is getting late and we are all
getting a bit tetchy. On the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column648" />Column number: 648</div>face of it they appear reasonable, but they are unnecessary, to some
extent undesirable and overall they appear to be based on a
misunderstanding of the new status.</div>
					<a name="07112811000699"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph (a)
is unnecessary. Without the amendment, the conditions imposed must be
reasonable and cannot be excessively restrictive. That is clear. The
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome may say that that depends on the
circumstances of the case, but those circumstances will be taken into
account when imposing the conditions. I do not consider that the
limitation that paragraph (a) imposes would necessarily assist in that
respect.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001112"></a>Mr.

						</b> Can the Minister show where it is clear that the
conditions must be reasonable and not excessively restrictive, and what
possibility is there for challenging the view that a condition, when
imposed, is excessively
restrictive?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112811001113"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The conditions that may be imposed match those
which apply to individuals with temporary admissions under the
Immigration Act 1971, which have been in operation successfully for
over a third of a century. We do not, therefore, believe that it is
necessary to alter wording that is already established in immigration
law. Also, the Human Rights Act 1998 makes it unlawful for public
authorities to act in a way that is incompatible with the
convention.</div>
					<a name="07112811000702"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
(b) of amendment No. 341 suggests a possible confusion about the
purposes of designation and conditions. The new status is not an
additional punishment, and the purpose of the conditions that might be
imposed is not to punish. The condition relating to employment is
designed to prevent the designated person establishing firm roots
within the UK, as I have already said. The conditions relating to
residence and reporting are designed to enable the BIA to maintain
contact until such time as the ECHR barrier to removal has passed, so
that the removal can be effected. If a condition is considered
necessary to achieve those aims, we should not prevent it from being
imposed.</div>
					<a name="07112811000876"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07112811000703"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I am happy to make it clear that the purpose of any conditions that may
be imposed is not to prevent the commission of further offences. Again,
discussion on that has revealed a misunderstanding of the purpose of
creating the new status. As it is has been stated, the aim of imposing
conditions is not crime prevention or reduction, and that holds good
whether or not the clause is amended to state that explicitly. The
purpose of conditions is to manage the
situation.</div>

					<a name="07112811000849"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
use of vouchers as a form of support for asylum seekers was ended
following considerable concerns about its stigmatising and
impoverishing impact. Currently it is only used for refused asylum

proposed to reintroduce the use of vouchers for a whole class of people

							<a name="07112811001125"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I rise to support the hon. Gentleman. It seems to
me, reading this element of part 11, that not only is there no appeal
against designation but there is no potential challenge to any part of
the process, which is all dealt with by Executive action, including any
conditions that may be applied as part of that process. At no stage,
other than by recourse to the Human Rights Act 1998 or, presumably,
judicial review of a decision taken by the Secretary of State or an
immigration officer, is there any capacity for any challenge to be made
to anything that he has done to a person who is designated as having
special immigration status. Of course, there is the very real
assumption that in the absence of any form of legal aid provision,
there is no capacity&#151;unless the person has particularly deep
pockets from elsewhere, which is unlikely in this context&#151;to
mount a judicial review application or an application under the Human
Rights Act in any case. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the
lack of an appeal is very serious, but I would go wider and say that it
is not simply the issue of designation that is relevant, but the other
factors encompassed in this part of the
Bill.</div>

Burrowes:
						</b> I wish to follow on from those remarks, rather
than repeat them. They are valuable in relation to the lack of appeal.
I ask the Minister to consider whether by not having an appeal
mechanism, we may have built a delay into the process when the only
option left to an applicant is to go to the European Court of Human
Rights or seek judicial review. Would it not be appropriate to have an
appeal mechanism at least to allow any challenge to proceed
expeditiously and
appropriately?</div>

							<a name="07112811001127"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I am sorry to disappoint hon. Members, but the
Government&#146;s view is that someone who fulfils those criteria
should expect to be deported. If that is not possible for ECHR reasons,
we should not be obliged, as we currently are, to grant them leave
under the Immigration Acts. In many cases, judicial review is open to
them, and those people would have legal aid available to them. I am
sorry to disappoint hon. Members, but we feel that it is appropriate in
the circumstances.</div>

Eagle:
						</b> It is great to be back on my feet
again, Mr. O&#146;Hara, and I am going to be succinct. The
purpose of these measures is to make a similar provision for Northern
Ireland to the measures in part 4. Hon. Members will recall
that part 4 of the Bill puts prisons and probations ombudsman on a
statutory footing. The effect of the measures will be to place the
office of the prisoner ombudsman for Northern Ireland on a statutory
footing on very similar terms to those that we have discussed. The
office holder will be known as the Northern Ireland commissioner for
prisoner complaints, and his main function will be to deal with
eligible complaints from prisoners, investigate deaths in custody and
carry out other investigations at the request of the Secretary of
State. The amendments make broadly similar provisions to those
discussed, although there are some minor differences which I would be
happy to deal with in detail if hon. Members are
interested.</div>
