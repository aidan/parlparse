                  </span> At the end of this
morning’s debate, I was complimenting the hon. Member for Dover
on the very sound case he has made in his amendments. I was
congratulating him on managing to get many of the agencies involved in
the port of Dover to come together to support it being owned by the
local community. I also want to congratulate him on putting together
what looks like a very sound financial package in support of the
initiative. He could have another career in consultancy for MPs and in
giving information to all of us on how we might put such funding
packages together, because he did indeed seem to offer a possible way
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
shall conclude by saying that the hon. Gentleman has proposed a model
that will not only be good for Dover but can be applied to other areas.
I certainly hope that the Government will back his
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000044">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It
is good to see you back in the Chair, Mr Amess. Hon. Members
from all parties—and, I suspect, you, Mr Amess—were
impressed by the contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Dover this morning. It was impressive both for its power and its
sincerity.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I start by
thanking my hon. Friend for the ridiculously nice things he said about
me. The Paymaster General is already aware that my hon. Friend came to
the Committee brandishing amendments that are designed to be helpful. I
think that was the word he used, which has some resonance in the Whips
Office, if I remember it correctly. I hope I am not taking a step too
far in saying that, on behalf of the whole Committee, I thank my hon.
Friend for enlivening our proceedings during the days and weeks of our
sittings. We have tended to the dry and dusty at times, and he has
helped to enliven proceedings 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 256<a class="bkMark" name="Column256">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and has shared with us his habit of watching a television channel
broadcast in a language he does not understand. The motivation for that
remains unclear. However, the motivation for the amendments is
extremely
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend is leading a very heartfelt and powerful campaign for the
port of Dover to become a port owned by the community. He clearly has
strong community support for that notion, on a North Korean scale. A
huge amount of effort and work has gone into the structuring of the
proposal and the partnership building required to make that work. We
have been listening to the words and work of an outstanding
constituency MP. I have put that on the record just in case it may
deter the hon. Member for Leicester South from acting on his pledge to
go down to Dover and campaign against my hon. Friend. I would hate to
see him waste a train
ticket.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friend said, amendment 36 would add Dover Harbour Board to
schedule 5, enabling its functions to be modified or transferred to an
eligible person.  As he said, amendment 37 is consequential and
would be relevant only if amendment 36 were accepted. The provision
would allow the transfer of functions to be made without the agreement
of the transferee and would permit the transfer of certain functions
that might not otherwise be possible. We all understand the motives
behind the amendments and commend my hon. Friend for his continuing
work to find a solution to his constituents’ concerns about the
future of the port. Occasionally, the chance comes to us MPs to make a
big difference to the communities we serve, and I sense that my hon.
Friend feels that this is exactly that opportunity to secure something
important for the town of
Dover.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that my hon. Friend recalls that, in an earlier debate, in the
spirit of being helpful I agreed to consider his amendment 35, which
sought to add community benefit societies and co-operatives to the list
of eligible persons to whom an order under the Bill could transfer
functions. I hope that that will be seen to be what it was, which was
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for City of Durham speculated about whether I would succumb
to the considerable flattery running through the speech of my hon.
Friend the Member for Dover. I am afraid to say that, unlike you, Mr
Amess, I am immune to flattery. I must inform the Committee and my hon.
Friend that the Government’s view of the proposals in amendments
36 and 37 is that they are not appropriate for inclusion in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
the Bill is being used to further proposals to reform public bodies if
existing legislative vehicles are not available or appropriate. That is
what the Bill is for. For the Dover Harbour Board, existing legislation
already provides for the types of changes that would be allowed by
inclusion in the Bill. Specifically, with an existing mechanism under
the Ports Act 1991, trust ports may bring forward schemes to transfer
their functions, duties, assets and liabilities to an entity that can
then be sold or transferred to other parties. I assure the Committee
that the provisions of the Ports Act do not preclude a not-for-profit
body, such as one registered under the Co-operative and Community
Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 1965, from acquiring a port. In
addition, a harbour revision order under the Harbours Act 1964 may
change or modify the legislation under 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 257<a class="bkMark" name="Column257">&#160;</a>
                  </div>which a trust port operates. The Government therefore consider that
further legislation is not
required.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
while I understand that the inclusion of the Dover Harbour Board in
schedule 5 could provide an alternative route for achieving my hon.
Friend’s preferred outcome through an order made by Government,
the Government are not convinced that trust ports are suitable
candidates for inclusion in the Bill’s schedules. I can explain.
The purpose of the Bill is to progress a series of proposed reforms to
public bodies that were part of the public bodies review which reported
in October 2010. Trust ports are not owned by nor established by
Government, and they were not in the scope of the public bodies review.
Trust ports are independent statutory bodies and the Government have
limited involvement in the different trust ports, as provided for by
their local legislation. It would be out of step to take such a broad
path in relation to the trust port of Dover
alone.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend is aware that an application for a transfer scheme for the
port of Dover is still under consideration by the Secretary of State
for Transport. The process might be moving slower than he would like,
but it is moving. He is aware, and the Committee should be aware, that
the decision is quasi-judicial and, as such, it would be wrong for the
Government to express a position, either in relation to that
application or to the proposals for a people’s port for
Dover.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
stress to the Committee, however, that at the beginning of last month
the Secretary of State announced the new criteria that would be used
when considering applications for a transfer scheme by a trust port.
One of the essential criteria that are to be met before a transfer
scheme will be approved is that the sale is considered likely to
deliver an enduring and significant level of community participation in
the port. I hope that provides some reassurance to my hon. Friend that
the Government recognise the value of ports to the communities in which
they are based and are seeking to reflect that in
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend also speculated whether the Ports Act could allow a nuanced
approach. He should be aware that under the Ports Act a Minister can
make a “minded to” decision on a transfer scheme, and can
set out matters on which he would require further assurance or action
before confirming a transfer scheme order. Such conditions might allow
for alternative ownership models to be considered beyond simple private
ownership. In the light of those comments, my commitment to consider
further amendment 36, and with my genuine admiration for the diligence
of my hon. Friend’s work on behalf of the people of Dover, I
hope he will feel able to withdraw his
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">

                  </span> It is a pleasure to serve again
under your chairmanship, Mr Amess. My hon. Friend the Minister is
right: the section 9 process is under way and was started under the
previous Government. He is also right that it is seen as a
quasi-judicial decision, subject to the criteria set down by the
Secretary of State, and that substantial community involvement is
included in the criteria. That substantial community involvement, which
has been debated here and in Dover, stands at about 15% community
ownership. That is not going to be the most substantial community
involvement there could be.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000056">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">According to
company law, to turn a port into a company in any
other form of trade—a tennis ball company, for
example—could be done by changing the articles, which requires
75% ownership. Therefore, 15% would not be even a blocking minority; it
would not, to my mind, be a substantial shareholding in the port that
would enable the community to have a sense of determination and
connection with the port’s future. I seek to give the
transportation Department pause for thought regarding the direction of
travel and the policy, started under the previous Government, of a
simple sale. Instead, we should do something more in line with the
principles, set out by the new Government, of co-operatives, social
enterprises and mutuals. That is really important.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I touched
earlier on the issue of inertia in government and the difficulty of
turning around a supertanker, and the difficulty of ensuring that new
policies are pushed through quickly when we have a Government who are
committed to such a vision and to changing the politics. If we are to
have that kind of social enterprise, mutualisation, localism and
decentralisation, and if we are to build the big society, giving
communities a greater say over their sense of destiny, we need to send
a clear message that the Cabinet Office should have the power to force
the Government’s will on other Departments. At the moment, I do
not feel that the Cabinet Office has enough strength and support to do
that. I worry that if we do not ensure today that that strong
message—on the direction of travel and the delivery of the Prime
Minister’s amazing vision of the sort of society we could
build— is heard across the whole of Government, we will not be
stepping up to the plate.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000058">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There is
nothing more powerful in this place than an MP advancing constituency
interests. I feel that I have no choice but to accept the mandate of
98% of the people of Dover who voted in a referendum for this vision.
The vision that the people of Dover and I have is the same as the Prime
Minister’s. I know that this power in the Bill is simply
additional. It does not technically affect the 1991 Act, and the
Transport Secretary could just carry on regardless with the kind of
plan that has been set in train. However, we are in a Committee that is
about not only law but also politics, and the message will be heard far
and wide across Whitehall that Parliament is serious about the Prime
Minister’s vision and that it wants to strengthen the hand of
the Cabinet Office and its excellent Ministers and give them the
ability and power to ensure that the Prime Minister’s will is
executed, despite any inertia on the part of Ministers or civil
servants and despite any risk of backsliding. We want to ensure that a
strong message is
sent.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000059">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
47 will list Her Majesty’s Stationery Office in schedule 5 to
the Bill, which enables the modification or transfer of functions. The
amendment is minor and technical, rather than a substantive policy
change. The reform it will facilitate constitutes a straightforward and
hopefully uncontroversial legal tidying-up exercise. The proposed
reforms have been led by the chief executive of the National Archives,
who is also the keeper of the public records, and they have been agreed
with the
palace.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000087">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">HMSO
was founded in 1786. It is the holder of the Crown copyright and has
been the official printer and publisher of all Acts of Parliament since
1889. Indeed, sharp-eyed members of the Committee will be able to see
its imprint on the back of the Bill under consideration today. HMSO was
one of four bodies that came together between 2003 and 2006 to form the
National Archives, joining with the Public Record Office, the Office of
Public Sector Information and the royal commission on historical
manuscripts. Most of HMSO’s functions are conferred on the
controller of HMSO, an officer within the National Archives, via royal
letters patent. Those functions will remain unchanged. A small number
of HMSO’s functions are conferred by statute, and it is
envisaged that those will be transferred to the Public Record Office by
order under the powers in clause 5. It is also envisaged that, when an
appropriate transfer of functions is achieved through such an order,
the PRO will be legally renamed as the National Archives. Looking
closely at our proposals, we have established that HMSO’s
statutory functions cannot be transferred by order under clause 5
without HMSO itself being included in schedule 5, hence its
proposed inclusion in the schedule at this later date.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000088">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment and the reform are consistent with announcements made by the
Government, and with previous statements that the existing
administrative arrangements for the National Archives will, where
possible, be placed on a clearer statutory footing.  The aim is
to provide clarity for the public and to  formalise the merger
process begun under the previous Administration. The proposal will
strengthen the National Archives’ ability to perform functions
that the Government believe to be of immense value. Accordingly, the
amendment 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 260<a class="bkMark" name="Column260">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Both
the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Human Tissue
Authority are astonished to be in the Bill, and both bodies were
astonished not even to be consulted on their inclusion. Both have an
international reputation, and their advice is sought on all aspects of
tissues and embryology. Other countries seek their advice on how best
to address moral issues. Both these organisations deal with medical,
legal and ethical issues, and they are, importantly,
independent—from politicians and from Government.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
helpful to look at the background to how those bodies were first
formed. The HTA was founded as a result of organs being removed from
children’s bodies without the consent of their parents. At
Bristol Royal 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 261<a class="bkMark" name="Column261">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Infirmary, 170 hearts from children who had been operated on at that
hospital were retained without the consent of their grieving
parents.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The HFEA was
born as result of the work of Baroness Warnock of the other place.
Highly respected and—dare I say it?—a national icon, she
is world-renowned as a major philosopher. She conducted a report into
the special status of the embryo. The Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 1990 was passed—I know this seems to be a running
thread in this Committee—by the former Prime Minister, Margaret
Thatcher, and her Conservative Government. It is a very important piece
of legislation; for once I can say that I actually agreed with Mrs
Thatcher.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">These
bodies were born not out of political ideology but of certain serious
moral and ethical issues. They are there to protect the public.
Therefore, what one has to look at is, what is actually driving this
proposal? Why are these bodies in the Bill? It cannot be money: the
HFEA receives just £2 million, and makes up the rest of its
income from fees. The HTA receives just £1 million from the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">I
would just like to mention what the Department of Health said about the
HFEA in “Liberating the NHS: Report of the arm’s-length
bodies review”. I shall read it out because it is quite
instructive, and then perhaps we can work out why the Department has
changed its mind. Paragraph 3.29
states:</p>
               <p class="hs_brevIndent">“The
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority is responsible for
licensing fertility treatments and research conducted using human
embryos. As such, it deals with issues that are judicially and
ethically complex and contentious. By being at arm’s-length, the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority separates sensitive issues
from government and its independence is trusted. The Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority’s functions satisfy the
criteria for being undertaken by an arm’s-length
body”.</p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">That was in July
2010. It is a ringing endorsement by any account, so it is perplexing
to everybody concerned that the HFEA is included in the
Bill.</p>

                  </span> The hon. Lady makes the
point very strongly about the need for that arm’s length
relationship and for independence. Before she leaves the argument about
cost, has she reflected, as I have, on the likely increase in cost of
transferring those responsibilities from the HFEA to the Care Quality
Commission? This is a new remit for the CQC, which will have big
resource implications. They will admittedly be positive ones; but it
does raise, once more, the issue of
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000103">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I
will come on to the Care Quality Commission, its function and how these
costs will be absorbed. I do have deep concerns about that. The fact is
that both the HTA and the HFEA can stand alone and pay for themselves,
so I think there will be more costs if this
happens.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
HTA can best be described as the guardian of consent. It has public
confidence: a recent MORI poll showed an increase in confidence in
human tissue regulation from 52% in 2007 to 57% in 2010.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I have
already mentioned, both the HFEA and the HTA have a unique position of
independence, which enables the discussion of sensitive issues. An
example 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 262<a class="bkMark" name="Column262">&#160;</a>
                  </div>might be the debate about extending the service for multiple births.
There has now been a debate about the difficulties experienced by women
in multiple births where more than one embryo has been implanted, and
the HFEA has made a decision about that. More recently—indeed,
it was in the news today—there has been the issue of organ
donation. Such matters need to be discussed away from the political
limelight, which is what these bodies do. They have boards with proper
governance, and proper experts who can sit quietly, discuss huge moral
issues and show their independence. That is why it is important that
they be retained. They take their decisions not on the basis of
commercial interest but in the public interest, which is what makes
them so important. What about their future? What have the Government
decided to do with these two bodies? They intend to separate the
regulatory functions from the research functions. The regulatory
functions will go to the CQC and the research part will go into a
proposed health research authority, which has not yet even been set up.
It is not clear what its function is, who will be in it and who will
govern
it.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000106">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Where
will the CQC go? It is a massive regulator. I am not deriding members
of the CQC, because they  are public servants and they work in
the public interest. I am a member of the Health Committee, however,
and we concluded in our most recent report that<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000107">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the bias in
the work of the CQC away from its core function  of inspection
and towards the essentially administrative task of registration
represented a significant distortion of
priorities.”<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000430">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
CQC spent all its time registering dentists instead of going and
investigating homes. The Committee also
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We
are extremely concerned that CQC's compliance activity fell to such low
levels in the course of 2010-11…the fact that this was done to
the extent that inspections fell by an unacceptable 70% demonstrates a
failure to manage resource and activity in line with the main statutory
objective of the CQC to ‘protect and promote the health, safety
and welfare of people who use health and social care
services’.”<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000431">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
CQC failed to act when a whistleblower approached it about the
Winterbourne View care home. The worrying thing about the CQC is that
total establishment vacancies moved from 148 in June 2010 to 297 in
June 2011. Its compliance inspector and registration assessor
vacancies—the core part of what it was set up to do—moved
from 96 to 133 over the same period. Clearly, some work needs to be
done to ensure that the CQC is a proper regulatory organisation that
protects the public.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have heard
from the HFEA, which has said that it is already trying to streamline
some of its work and costs. It has moved into the CQC so that it can
share back office functions. The key point is that it does not
particularly want to be part of the CQC; it wants to report directly to
the Secretary of State for Health. Here is the science bit: I see it as
a carbon atom with four little spokes coming out, among which are the
HFEA and the Human Tissue Authority. They are all stand-alone
organisations that are accountable straight to the Secretary of State.
If they are put into the CQC, they will become part of a sub-committee.
We will not get the full range of expertise; we will get a
sub-committee that does not really know what is happening in the
discussions that are going on. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 263<a class="bkMark" name="Column263">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Then there will probably be rubber-stamping by the board of the CQC.
That is not the way to do such important work.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000110">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The HFEA
does some important work, and I will draw the Committee’s
attention to a couple of aspects of it. It found, for example, that two
embryos were placed under a hood. We have all heard awful stories about
what happens in America, where embryos have been mixed up, and a white
mother has given birth to children who are of a different colour from
her. Those are the kind of mistakes that the HFEA is trying to avoid,
which is why it is such an important
body.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
clinicians do not want the HFEA. Some feel that it will hamper
research, and that the regulation will stop them working. It is
important, however, because it is about the future generation. We may
make rushed decisions now in Committee, which is what we appear to be
doing, rather than thinking about the future. The worst thing would be
to look back afterwards and wish that we had held back a bit and left
things as they were. That is crucial. Fertility and organ donation are
emotive subjects, which must be left to these independent
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, there is little overlap between the regulatory functions of
the two organisations and any other organisations. As most Members will
know, the bodies that we are discussing do not engender mass e-mails;
we have not been bombarded, as we are by the Forestry Commission. They
are niche organisations that give the public confidence through their
work, both now and for the future, because a lot of ethical issues will
come up that will need to be discussed. They can be discussed by those
bodies away from political pressures and away from lobbying. They
discuss the policy and the issues, and turn that into a code of
practice that people can abide by. They both have chairs who are well
respected, both in their fields and for the work that they do on those
committees.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There has
been some concern about the evidence put before the Committee by the
HFEA, but it is entitled to submit evidence to us in writing. It has a
worldwide reputation. No other country has a body with such respect and
independence. Other countries come to us for advice. We want to keep it
that way. All that would be lost if it was absorbed into the CQC. The
chairs have presided over very lean organisations—I have given
the Committee the figures. The issue is emotive, but all that they have
done is act in the public interest to protect us all. I urge the
Minister to respect their work, let them get on with it, and leave them
out of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000114">&#160;</a>

clinicians and by the general public who take an interest in these

why all of the bodies that seem to engender enormous respect across the

                  <em>]</em> As
I think my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office,
said, this is coalition government. On a serious note, just because
bodies are doing a good job, it does not mean that we do not need to
look intelligently and analytically at what they do, how they perform
their functions and whether those functions 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 264<a class="bkMark" name="Column264">&#160;</a>
                  </div>can be performed with the same degree of success in a different way that
is either more effective or more cost-effective.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Lady said that both bodies were astonished to be included in the Bill.
That astonishment must have been qualified, surely, by the consultation
that had already taken place in the advanced arm’s length body
review. It looked at both bodies, took a view from them, and looked at
whether there were synergies in the two regulatory bodies, particularly
in the context of whether the research elements were taken out. That
was one of the conclusions of the ALB
review.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady explained that amendment 52 would remove the Human Tissue
Authority from the Bill. Amendment 53 would put in place additional
requirements before an order can be made to transfer the functions of
the HFEA to other bodies under clause 5. Amendment 60 would
remove the HFEA from the Bill. Let me deal first with removing the
bodies completely from the Bill. The Government set out our intentions
to simplify and reduce radically the number of NHS bodies in
“Liberating the NHS: Report of the arms-length bodies
review”, which was published in July 2010. In the ALB review
report, we set out our proposals for retaining the Human Tissue
Authority and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority as
separate arm’s length bodies in the short term, with a view to
transferring their functions to the Care Quality Commission and the
prospective health research authority.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In answer to
what the hon. Lady said about decisions being taken in a rushed way in
this Committee, we cannot repeat sufficiently often that the Committee
is not deciding to deal with bodies in this way, but merely provides
the paving legislation for a subsequent decision that may involve a
number of iterations and will certainly involve consultation. All
implications of the legislation will be considered, not only by the
sponsoring Department but by the House, before a decision is
reached.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Most people
understand the contribution made by the Human Tissue Authority and the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which have established
robust systems of regulation for activities at the cutting edge of
medical science, ethical consideration and public debate that were
appropriate for their time. I stress our agreement that the important
function of those bodies should continue, although we must ensure that
regulation keeps up with changing times and the principles of best
practice. We must have a robust system of regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Over time,
for perfectly understandable and legitimate reasons, there has been an
increase in the number of regulatory bodies that operate in medical
science and health care delivery. All were set up with the best
intentions to address and meet what was seen as an emerging need. The
hon. Lady mentioned some reasons why those bodies were set up, which
were important at the time. However, a considerable number of hospitals
are currently regulated by the Care Quality Commission, the Human
Tissue Authority and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority,
all of which were set up as public bodies, work at arm’s length
from the Government, and receive fees from the establishments that they
regulate, as well as Government funding.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
objective is to streamline health care and medical research regulation
and reduce bureaucracy; we take the view that we cannot simply continue
with the current system of regulation. The Government must take the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 265<a class="bkMark" name="Column265">&#160;</a>
                  </div>opportunity to streamline the process of regulation
and consequently reduce costs and the administrative burden on
establishments, while continuing to offer protection to the public. The
bodies are not expensive in the great scheme of things, but the total
budget for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the
Human Tissue Authority is £13.6 million—a significant
amount of public money. There is scope for some of that to be
reduced—not removed completely—by streamlining and the
formation of a single body for some of their functions.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000121">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We estimate
that in England, more than 60% of the centres currently licensed by the
Human Tissue Authority are also regulated by the Care Quality
Commission or are in premises regulated by it. Over 90% of
establishments licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority are similarly covered by the Care Quality Commission. There
should be scope for rationalisation to relieve the overall burden on
those regulated. The removal of those bodies from schedule 5, as
suggested in the amendment, would mean that we could not proceed with
plans to streamline regulation, and could not realise the consequential
benefits for those who are being regulated.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000122">&#160;</a>

the Minister’s powerful argument, which is really an
administrative one. Streamlining administration is a good objective;
nobody is in favour of bureaucracy, except perhaps bureaucrats. We are
dealing, however, with the most sensitive and delicate ethical matters
imaginable, such as the creation of life. How does the Minister respond
to the argument that the committee would effectively become a

thing is that people with expertise in the area are doing the job and
have the resources to do it effectively. That needs to be teased out
through the consultation process, which will precede any
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000124">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
are not talking about something happening overnight. We are
deliberately not moving ahead at a rate of knots. There is a two-stage
process, as I have indicated. There will also be two stages of
consultation on the proposed changes. An extensive consultation will
take place shortly, focusing on where the functions are best
transferred, and that is when we will take into account the concerns of
the hon. Member for Walsall South. I understand why she is concerned
about whether the CQC will be overstretched. A subsequent consultation
will then focus on using the powers under the Public Bodies
Bill—if the Committee allows the bodies to remain in the
Bill—to effect the
transfer.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
public consultation document will include a consultation impact
assessment, which will give a view on the cost-effectiveness of options
for transfer, comparing them with the organisations’ existing
plans for rationalisation. The impact assessment process has been
accepted by Parliament for general legislative and policy changes, and
I see no reason why it is not appropriate to test the benefits of these
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000126">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">A separate,
formal, independent assessment of cost-effectiveness is likely to be
costly to the public purse. That relates to the amendment tabled by the
hon. Members for Hemsworth and for City of Durham. We also need to take
care that the legislation does not set conditions that are impossible
to meet. Our existing safeguards are
sufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
year’s initial consultation will take into account the strength
of feeling expressed on keeping functions together. As the hon. Member
for Walsall South will know, there were powerful voices speaking to
that effect when the matter was discussed in another place. We will
proceed on the basis that our preferred option is to transfer to the
CQC the functions of both the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority and the Human Tissue Authority, except for certain HFEA
research-related functions, which will transfer to the health research
authority. We will consult on that basis, but remain open to receiving
views on the way forward from all stakeholders through the
consultation. The preferred option will address concerns about the
potential impact of
fragmentation.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me be clear that the vital function of the bodies, as required under
the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 and the Human Tissue
Act 2004, will continue. That should address any concerns about, for
example, the HFEA’s registers and databases being lost in the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
recognise the concerns behind amendment 53, which is about testing the
cost-effectiveness of proposed legislative changes. There is scope,
however, for direct savings to be made from the total budgets for the
HFEA and the HTA, which, as I have said, amount to £13.6
million. Through the streamlining of regulatory functions, we envisage
scope for savings beyond those that each organisation is planning to
make individually. That will be achieved by reducing overall running
costs. For instance, we envisage that there will be significant savings
as a result of reducing three senior management teams and boards to
one. We also envisage opportunities for regulated bodies to make
savings in regard to licence fees and the preparation and demonstration
of compliance with the regulatory system. The Department of Health will
undertake more detailed analysis of current costs and potential savings
to inform the consultation impact
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Turning
to the proposed health research authority, the Government’s
document, “The Plan for Growth”, which was published at
this year’s Budget, recognised the urgent need to reform
research regulation and reduce the regulatory burden on research bodies
for the benefit of the wider economy. As part of its measures, the
creation of a health research authority was announced, which will
combine and streamline approvals for health
research.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
a first step, the Government will establish this year a special health
authority, with the National Research Ethics Service at its core. That
will reduce the regulatory burden on firms, and improve the timeliness
of decisions about clinical trials and hence the cost-effectiveness of
their delivery in the UK. It has clear support from the Academy of
Medical Sciences review of medical research regulation and governance.
In line with the academy’s recommendations that there are
significant benefits  in bringing together all medical research
regulation,  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 267<a class="bkMark" name="Column267">&#160;</a>
                  </div>we propose that functions supporting the regulation of embryo research,
currently undertaken by the HFEA, be transferred to the remit of the
health research
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While
the creation of the health research authority has been widely welcomed,
there have been concerns about its readiness to take on the sensitive
function of embryo research. We recognise that. The Government
therefore made the firm commitment in an earlier debate to proceed with
the transfer of research-related functions from the HFEA, subject to
the will and views of Parliament, only once the health research
authority is established in legislation. We see the reform of research
regulation as complementing and supporting the Care Quality
Commission’s focus on the essential levels for safety and
quality of care. Within that, we fully recognise the need to retain
regulatory rigour and expertise in the fields of embryology and human
tissue. It is envisaged that the expertise invested in individuals will
follow functions, for instance through staff transfers and retaining
access to expert advisory groups. There will be a carefully managed
transition between regulators, which will ensure that key skills and
knowledge are passed on to the receiving
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I will deal with the reservations that the hon. Member for Walsall
South expressed about the Care Quality Commission’s capacity to
deal with more functions, when it already has a number of new functions
and extensions to its regulatory role to cope with. The Government are
committed to developing the role of the Care Quality Commission as the
independent regulator of health and adult social care in England. The
proposed changes to the Care Quality Commission, through the transfer
of functions from the HTA and the HFEA, and the provisions in the
Health and Social Care Bill will strengthen its role in ensuring the
safety and quality of health and adult social care services.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Care
Quality Commission will have a number  of years to prepare for
the transfer of these functions, and to assess the resources needed to
carry them out. As I have said, this is not an overnight transition;
this is a staged process. During that time, the Department of Health
will work with the commission to ensure its readiness to take on the
functions. That will include the Department working with the commission
to agree its business plan and financial allocation, as it does each
year. There will then be an ongoing dialogue with the Care Quality
Commission, with its financial position kept under constant review
throughout the financial year. The Care Quality Commission will remain
accountable to the Secretary of State for the effective delivery of its
functions. The hon. Member for Walsall South mentioned concerns that
have been expressed with regard to other areas of the Care Quality
Commission’s work. It is absolutely crucial that we get this
right and get a regulator that is capable of doing effectively the job
that we as a country want it to do. That is why that dialogue is so
important.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
a Committee, we are not abolishing these bodies. We are providing the
framework that will allow that to happen, at some future stage, if the
two sets of consultations and the dialogue suggest that that is the
best way of maintaining the sensitive, important functions that we have
discussed. If it happens, it will happen at a future point, when
Parliament and the stakeholders have had their say. If we accepted the
amendments, that route would be removed, and would no longer be
available to

intentions to consult on the proposed transfers of functions, I hope
that the hon. Lady will feel able to withdraw her

                  </strong> I thank the Minister for his response. I appreciate
what he is saying and how he has said it. If we return to how these
bodies came into existence, we should remember that
sometimes—very often, I think—Members of Parliament,
legislatures and politicians do not know everything. Sometimes it takes
members of the public to tell us what to do. Both these bodies have
been born out of the fact that something disastrous happened to a
family, children died and things were done without the parents’
consent in Alder Hey and in Bristol. We make decisions in the name of
the people, and those decisions are sometimes not right. All of this
has come from parents’ grief. The Government responded in the
right way in 1990, and the bodies that were set up had an amazing
reputation.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The same
thing happened in mid-Staffordshire. Again, I do not want to talk about
individuals, but the person who was chief executive there—and, a
huge amount of public money is being spent on that inquiry—is
now head of the Care Quality Commission, so she has her work cut out.
She needs help, resources, and support. I put that point to the
Committee, because I do not want future generations to look back and
say, “Why are we having this inquiry? Parliament sat there. They
had the ability to do something about that and they didn’t. They
acted in haste.” That is what we have to be careful
about.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Call me
naive, but what I see is that anything with the word
“public” in it is up for grabs, and that is a concern. I
appreciate what the Minister is saying, but why have these bodies been
included in the first place? They did not want to be. They were not
consulted. I have read out exactly what the Department of Health has
said about them, which is that these public bodies have the
Department’s full confidence. Including them in the first place
is very
curious.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000139">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This is not intended to be a silly, party-political
point, but it is a fact that the previous Government looked to merge
these two bodies. They did not do so because they decided that it would
not have been the most sensible outcome. We agree, which is why this
alternative proposal is now being considered, but the two bodies were
not considered inviolate by the Government that she
supported.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000140">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The Minister has answered the question himself by
saying that we did not proceed. There is the rub: the previous
Government consulted and did not proceed, because they knew after
consulting the bodies that doing so would not be possible. There is no
overlap; they both do different things and both need the environment in
which to discuss these important, ethical
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am not sure where the Minister’s figure of £13
million comes from. The cost to the public purse is
just £3 million —£2 million for
one, and £1 million for the other—and, as they are
stand-alone bodies that raise their own fees, there is actually no cost
to the public purse. They do different work and are regulated in
different ways. The Minister talks about the establishment being
regulated, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 269<a class="bkMark" name="Column269">&#160;</a>
                  </div>but it is not about the specific work. One body deals with organs and
the other with embryos. They are different matters and take different
expertise, so he is not quite right on that matter.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
generation has to be careful. We have to be able to think first and act
later, but we must discuss this issue—I know that the Minister
is saying something about consultation, but that consultation should
have happened before. The fact that Baroness Warwick was in the House
of Lords and was able to discuss the proposals meant that the HTA had a
voice and could put forward its case, but as far as the HFEA is
concerned, no such voice was present in the other place, where the Bill
started. The HFEA was taken by surprise, and I ask why we have to wait
until a few years down the line, when you have decided what the
research authority is going to look like. We do not even have terms of
reference. You—the Minister does not even know what they are
going to do. Please forgive me, Mr Amess, for saying
“you”, and not “the
Minister”.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have made the case about the CQC. I have real concerns about it and its
difficulties—not about what the CQC is and what it does, but
something needs to be done about that organisation. The Minister has
not even touched on another regulatory organisation, Monitor, which has
similar functions to the CQC. I follow Sir Ian Kennedy’s
evidence to the Mid Staffordshire inquiry in saying that something
needs to be looked at in terms of those two organisations. I am not in
the business of doing the Government’s work for them, but if one
is talking about looking at regulators, rather than having one great
big regulator in the sky, the regulators have to be there to do the
specific jobs that they are intended to do.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000144">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope that
I have made the case that these are different functions, bodies and
cases. I can only add that I hope the Minister will think again about
the role of the two bodies. They do specialised work. It is an ethical
and moral issue and a question of independence. They should be left
alone to do their work and be left out of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000145">&#160;</a>

amendment deals with the last of the long list of bodies concerned with
the environment, which we have discussed in the Committee. It is
largely a probing amendment to elicit a response from the Government to
determine why internal drainage boards are included in schedule 5. We
know that the boards work effectively locally to reduce flood risk and
there seems to be an enormous body of opinion and evidence that they do
so very well. Indeed, when people have studied them, they have said
that they are astonished by what the boards manage to achieve in
particular localities.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000150">&#160;</a>

volunteers who have professional, historical and local knowledge and
they involve local communities very well. They seem to be an excellent
example of localism and the big society, which Government Members were
waxing lyrical about earlier. That prompts the question of why the
Government wish to change them at all. They protect agricultural,
commercial and domestic property, and they are developing a new role
for themselves protecting particular
habitats.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000151">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have several questions for the Minister. First, why are the boards in
the Bill? Secondly, what do the Government intend the Environment
Agency to do in respect of changing internal drainage boards? Thirdly,
will the Environment Agency have to get the consent of internal
drainage boards before changing them in any way at

need some clarity about savings. The opinion seems to have been put
fairly forcefully to Government that if they want to change internal
drainage boards in England, they should do so through primary
legislation and not through the inclusion of the boards in the Bill.
There is considerable concern that the savings that DEFRA has estimated
of about £225,000 can be made only if there is further amendment
to primary legislation. I would be grateful if the Minister clearly
outlined what savings the Government intend to make, how they will be
made and whether additional legislation is
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000153">&#160;</a>

are at the end of the rather long list of bodies we are considering in
the Committee. Last, but not least, are the internal drainage boards. I
know that Lord Taylor of Holbeach was absolutely thrilled to be dealing
with internal drainage boards, on which he has great expertise. I
cannot claim the same level of expertise, but they certainly are a fact
of life in the Somerset Levels. As she may have heard, people from the
area are born with webbed feet because they stand in puddles most of
the time, despite the best endeavours of the internal drainage boards.
They are therefore very much a matter of importance to
us.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady basically asked why and what, which are perfectly proper
questions. If the amendment were to succeed, we would not be able to do
what we intend to do. That is why I am going to oppose her amendment,
although I understand that it is essentially a probing amendment. We
very much support the important work that internal drainage boards do
to manage water levels and reduce flood risk. In fact, I entirely agree
with the hon. Lady: they are a good example of the big society in
action. They provide a valuable service for local communities and they
play a vital role in local flood risk partnerships and in developing
wider environmental benefits. So why do we want to change them? The
answer is that we want to be able to give them more scope for doing
their work, not less. If we have the ability to modify functions, it is
possible to ensure that IDBs can adapt and respond to change and that
we can strengthen these important local
bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000155">&#160;</a>

say categorically to the hon. Lady that we do not intend to use these
powers to reduce the functions of IDBs. What we are looking to do, and
giving due consideration to, is adding to the powers of IDBs to allow
them to carry out other water management functions that could improve
water management in a cost-effective way. IDBs already have a
sustainability duty that applies

			Column number: 271<a class="bkMark" name="Column271">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to the flood risk management functions. We will also explore the
opportunities for IDBs to achieve sustainable outcomes through land
drainage activity. In discussion with IDBs, consideration will be given
to expanding the sustainability duty to include all IDB activity.
Without the inclusion of IDBs in this schedule, the Government would
not be able to make those additions to IDB functions, where it makes
sense both financially and in terms of managing water in the
area.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000156">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
current best estimate is that we will save around £225,000 over
the spending review period by simplifying some of the administrative
procedures for IDBs. Perhaps I ought to make a distinction here. That
is one of the other proposals that are not part of the schedule 5
proposals. Other proposals that have been dealt with in previous
statements in the other place are planned in relation to IDBs,
including simplifying some of the burdensome procedures for changing
boundaries, amalgamations and reconstitutions and other arrangements.
In addition, there are plans to simplify changes to the rules of
procedure and to provide for less restrictive arrangements on
governance, for example, in relation to board membership. It is likely
that we will deal with those proposals via a legislative reform order,
in addition to an order that will be introduced under the powers in the
Bill. That is where the principal savings will be made. It is difficult
to quantify other savings at this stage. That will largely be a matter
for consultation with the boards themselves regarding what can be
done.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000157">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me recap. The IDBs are doing a great job and we want them to be able to
do an even greater job in providing an essential service for those
local areas where we have problems with an excess of water, of which
there are a substantial number around the country. The inclusion of
IDBs in this part of the Bill will enable their functions to be
enhanced, not reduced. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Lady will be
satisfied and even perhaps hang out a small flag in recognition of the
fact that we are doing exactly what she wants us to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000158">&#160;</a>

by the Government after listening to the concerns of peers, the
Constitution Committee and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform

                  </strong> That is certainly the case. The amendment provides
for a body with no members or an office that is vacant, but a temporary
vacancy does not mean that the body has no members. It would be an
extraordinary position, would it not, if a committee or statutory body
were to have no members whatever and all its places vacant at the same
time? That might suggest that the body was in need of reform in any
case, so in that very example a consultation perhaps ought to be
carried out. However, I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. Our
purpose is simply to stop the nonsense whereby we are required to
consult someone who does not exist. Even in English law, it is best to
avoid such circumstances, if

guidance, which I have already had informally from the Clerk. I sought

them in time. No doubt you will have noticed that they are starred,

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
background to the whole Bill involves two articles written by senior
members of the Government in March 2011. One was written by the Prime
Minister himself in <em>The Sun</em> and, a couple of days before that,
an article was placed in the <em>Daily Mail</em>. The articles claimed
various savings from the quangos. The savings were
£30 billion if we believe the Prime Minister, who
wrote the article two days after the Minister for the Cabinet Office
had claimed a figure of £20 billion. I do not know what happened
in the two days between those two articles, but further savings had
been identified in what was described as a “bonfire of the
quangos”. The figure was claimed to be four times the amount of
money that Ministers had originally promised to save.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We would
like to see savings being accrued, too, and we are no friends of the
quango state as a whole, but we have had some interesting debates about
specific matters. From the beginning, we have said that we want to look
carefully at each decision to ensure that it is the right one. I was
surprised to discover that there was £30 billion to
be saved from the quangos—even though that figure is over a
number of years—and I was also interested  to see the
disagreement, which no one else has seemed to point out, between the
Prime Minister and the Minister for the Cabinet Office, because it is
hard to see how £30 billion could be
saved.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000210">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Members
present will have heard the debates and probing questions that the
Opposition have sought to put in Committee—we have tried to do
so in a positive and constructive way wherever possible—and it
is notable that few savings have been identified. I suppose the
Ministers may riposte by saying that this is all to be done through
further legislation and that this is only an empowering Bill, but even
if it were speculation, it would have been interesting to see what
savings might be
made.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
therefore decided to table a series of questions in Parliament to try
to establish the facts. You, Mr Amess, will from time to time have been
as frustrated as I was with the responses from Labour Ministers when we
were in power, and from Ministers in the current Government. We now
have something interesting called the Freedom of Information Act, which
I suppose was a major Labour achievement, but in the darkest of nights
one sometimes wonders whether it was an entirely brilliant achievement.
I therefore also tabled a series of freedom of information requests. It
is wasteful to have to go through FOIs, and it would be better if
Ministers just gave the answers, because they will come out anyway. The
truth is that barely any savings have been identified at all. That is
why I want the Minister to tell me how the clause will operate in
practice when announcements are made after the legislation is
implemented.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000212">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Given
that part of the justification for the Bill was that savings would be
identified, I want the Minister to consider tabling an amendment of the
kind I have put forward—even at this late stage, or on
Report—although 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 275<a class="bkMark" name="Column275">&#160;</a>
                  </div>we will probably not debate it. The country is in financial
difficulties. We will no doubt disagree on exactly how that came about,
but that is not the subject of today’s debate. However, there is
agreement across the Chamber that savings need to be identified. Even
if we were not in a crisis, efficiency would be desirable, so I do not
think that the clause is adequate for what is required. I want some
indication from the Government of the savings that will be made, if not
now, then as the orders come through one by one, dealing with each of
the bodies in the schedules. There is an interesting amendment later in
the Bill that appears to say that some decisions may entail further
costs in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
it will be deleted by amendment 21, clause 32(2) currently
states:<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000214">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Nothing
in this Act shall impose any charge on the people or on public
funds”.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000433">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
Bill, as seen in clause 32, originally stated that there would no
charge to the public purse for any decision taken under the Bill. In
other words, savings would be made. We now have an amendment that will
remove that subsection. As they have given notice that they intend to
remove that subsection, it is not unreasonable to say that the
Government, who have made much of wanting to attack waste and so-called
inefficiency, should indicate to the Committee the savings they intend
to
make.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have some notes in front of me, although what I can and cannot say is
slightly circumscribed. However, it is impossible to identify savings
of anything like £20 billion. In answer to questions that I
posed, the Cabinet Office itself only established £2.6 billion
of savings over the whole of the review period. The truth is that the
Cabinet Office figures are wrong, and I say that advisedly. We have
asked questions of every Department, and the Cabinet Office’s
response was the worst. I say that in the gentlest way possible. The
most that one can identify is £1.5 billion of savings, which is
£1 billion less than the Cabinet Office’s own estimate.
It is striking that, even if we take the Cabinet Office’s
estimate as being correct, £2.5 billion is slightly short of the
£20 billion to £30 billion that the Government
claimed when they announced the bonfire of
quangos.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
issue may appear to have a slightly elliptical relationship to clause
11, but I want the Government to indicate what savings they intend to
make, which, frankly, they have failed to do in this Committee.
Otherwise, this is smoke and mirrors. There is still a case for
tidying  up quangos, reducing bureaucracy and streamlining
administration—of course there is. There is also a case for
accountability in a democratic century such as the one we now inhabit.
There is a case for all of that, but it is not the case upon which the
Government rested their argument when they announced that spectacular
sum of money in <em>The Sun</em>. The editor of <em>The Sun </em>might be
somewhat irritated to discover that the savings are perhaps a 30th of
those claimed by the Prime Minister. There is only one way to clarify
the savings, which is for the Minister to agree to set out in the Bill
the Government’s intended efficiencies and economies, so that we
can clearly measure the Government against the claims made for the Bill
at the beginning of the process.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000217">&#160;</a>

members of the Committee who are not familiar with the so-called
privilege clause within Bills that start in the House of Lords to
enable it to discuss matters that may have financial consequences,
which the Lords would otherwise be precluded from doing. Such privilege
clauses are probably a result of the Parliament Act 1911—that
great unfinished piece of legislation that I hope we can complete at
some stage with the reform of another place. At the moment, such a
clause is necessary while a Bill goes through another place. When a
Bill comes to this House, we take the clause out because we are the
House that considers financial and economic matters. That is entirely

                     </span>
                  </strong> I was indeed, and I was trying to avoid a
Greek-style deficit. I was simply referring to the provenance of part
of clause 32, which the hon. Member for Hemsworth will know perfectly
well, for the benefit of newer readers. The substantive point that he
was trying to raise, and would have raised had his amendment not been
starred today, was the cost savings. He suggested that for some reason
we had given different accounts of the savings that were anticipated. I
want to make it absolutely clear that that is not the case. The
Government made a very clear announcement on 16 March—my
birthday, indeed—this year that Departments are anticipating
cumulative administrative savings of at least £2.6 billion,
which will flow from public bodies over the spending review
period.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
crucial first to distinguish between administrative savings and
programme and capital spend savings, which are not the same thing; and
secondly to distinguish between those savings which are a direct result
of the measures in the Bill, and the other savings which are being
effected by a Government who are very keen to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 277<a class="bkMark" name="Column277">&#160;</a>
                  </div>reduce waste and make sure that we deal with the deficit overall. That
means that the figures quoted in different contexts will differ. The
figure of £2.6 billion, for instance, is across the programme,
including reforms that do not need this Bill to take place. When
programme and capital spend are taken into account, we estimate that
total spending through public bodies will be reduced by at least
£11 billion per year by 2014-15. If the savings for each year of
the spending review are taken into account, then a cumulative amount of
£30 billion will no longer be spent through public bodies. Add a
few £30 billions together, and we start to get to real money.
This is a worthwhile exercise, both in terms of the savings we will
make, but also in terms of the efficiency consequences of what we are
proposing.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
the hon. Gentleman would have proposed, had he been speaking to his
amendment, was the introduction of a statutory requirement for a
report. I think he would have proposed this on the basis of increasing
transparency over the issue of savings that will be realised. There are
two reasons why that is otiose.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000227">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
clause 11 stipulates that the explanatory document laid with the draft
order must explain why the order serves the purpose of
“improving…public functions”, having had regard,
among other things, to “efficiency”,
“effectiveness” and “economy”. Where a
reform will deliver savings, the requirement to have regard to
efficiency and economy would mean that the Minister would have to
include details of those savings in the justification for the
order.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000228">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
orders with financial implications will, as a matter of course, be
accompanied by impact assessments. In impact assessments, as the
Committee will know, detailed information on benefits and savings must
be carefully set out for Parliament and the public to scrutinise. That
is already set out in the published guidance on impact
assessments.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000229">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
do have sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I think it is
important that, when we airily say that savings will accrue, we set out
what we expect to see so that Parliament can hold the Government to
account for the decisions that they take. Had the hon. Gentleman been
in a position to table his amendment in a form in which it could have
been debated, and had we not already made provision which duplicates
the provisions in his amendment, then I might have had sympathy almost
to the point of accepting the amendment. However, I cannot give him
that moment of glory, because there are already two other ways in which
those precise details will be published each time we deal with one of
the consultations, orders or procedures that allow this Bill to take
effect. Therefore, his objective is served even if his means is not the
one I would recommend to the Committee. I hope that on that basis, and
without having to go into further detail about the enhanced affirmative
procedure, that the Committee will now allow clause 11 to stand part of
the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000230">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I just have a brief question for
the Minister. Since discussion on the Bill started we have had a change
of Government in Wales. Am I right in assuming that initial discussions
were with the One Wales Government—the coalition between Plaid
Cymru and Labour—and have there been subsequent discussions with
the new Labour Government? Was there any discussion about legislative
consent motions, the sort of reverse LCOs that we had been discussing
in Wales prior to the referendum? That is a straight question to the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000235">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an absolute
assurance about consultations with the new Government. I will find out
and make sure that he is written to. We have the equivalent of the
legislative consent agreement from the Welsh Government.
Clause 16 is about providing flexibility to enable a Welsh
devolved function relating to the environment exercised by one body to
be exercised by the other. The clause also enables the provision of
technical, professional or administrative services from one person to
another for the purpose of exercising environmental functions in Wales.
It provides Welsh Ministers and public bodies in Wales with flexibility
to ensure that bodies can work effectively together, potentially
realising gains in terms of efficiencies as well as
effectiveness.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000236">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
ensures that Welsh Ministers can establish how the function of making
arrangements using the powers under the laws can be discharged. The
interests of the UK Government in relation to cross-border bodies such
as the Environment Agency and the Forestry Commissioners are
safeguarded by a requirement that the Secretary of State’s
consent must be obtained prior to those bodies entering into
arrangements. All of  the clauses dealing with the Welsh
Government and the Welsh Assembly are subject to the decisions made by
Welsh Ministers in due course as to their applicability. This is an
important devolutionary area which the Government have extended within
the context of  the Bill. Welsh Ministers may take different
decisions from the UK Government on bodies that are broadly analogous,
and it is important that they should have that opportunity where it is
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000237">&#160;</a>

               <p>The
words “same or similar” concern me because I worry that
they may open the door to levels of complexity and variation that are
not strong enough to ensure the proper transfer of rights and the
protection of staff. There may then be a complicated and costly
rewriting of TUPE-type arrangements for different transfers, which
would increase confusion and possibly expense. I therefore wonder
whether the Government will consider amending the legislation before
Report, so that the Bill contains a provision that will avoid any
possible confusion and
complexity.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000248">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This is another amendment that we are not
debating, although we might have done so had life been slightly
different. The clause refers to the transfer of all kinds of issues
from one body to another should the Bill become an Act. That is right;
it is important to tackle issues concerning assets and so on, but it is
equally important to deal with staff in a proper way. We are dealing
not with one or two staff, but with tens of thousands of human beings
who are concerned about what will happen to them. We know of some cases
where administrative measures have been taken to reduce staff numbers
in quangos that have not, as yet, been abolished.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000249">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
refers to TUPE but it is not as clear as it might be. We have been
pressed by representatives of the work force who are loyal public
servants and want to provide the best service for the country. Through
no choice of their own they are now subject to uncertainty, and the
best we can do is to be as clear as possible in the Bill about TUPE and
the protections it offers.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000250">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I echo the
comments made by the hon. Member for Arfon but I also want to raise
another matter concerning TUPE and transfers. The pay of the most
senior staff and board members in the quangos is an interesting issue,
although I wonder whether there will be agreement across the Committee.
I do not make a partisan point because there is no doubt that under the
watch of the previous Government, it became an increasingly scandalous
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000251">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In August,
<em>The Daily Telegraph</em> reported that quango bosses had doubled
their pay and alleged that much of that happened under the watch of the
coalition Government. I do not know—let us say that all parties
share some culpability as I do not want to make this a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 280<a class="bkMark" name="Column280">&#160;</a>
                  </div>partisan issue. The Prime Minister was advised—I think he
accepted the advice—that we should aim for a ratio of 20:1
between the top and bottom levels of pay in public bodies. The debate
about TUPE allows us to raise the matter. It strikes me that, if we are
to offer guarantees to the ordinary staff who meet the public day in
and day out, we should protect them, their pay, salaries, conditions
and expectations for pensions and so on. I am not convinced that TUPE
should necessarily apply to the 332 individuals who earn more than
£150,000 a year. The reimbursement package for some amounts to
almost £1 million. I do not believe that, if a ratio of 20:1
applied, that the lowest paid worker would be on £50,000 or
whatever the multiple would be. I want to raise the issue because the
Bill says that TUPE will apply and I want to hear what the Government
have to say on that very difficult problem.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000252">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To their
credit, the Government have introduced the transparency website, and it
is possible to gain a large amount of information, which is not quite
as impenetrable as the civil servants designed it to be. If one spends
enough time, one can get the information out of it—I am sure
that was not the intention of the civil servants, because that is quite
surprising—but one does have to spend several hours on each
individual to try to find out what the pay packages amount
to.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000253">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not
think it fair or right to name names, but it is extraordinary that
seven men in the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority between them earn
packages worth £2.8 million a year. Although I do not wish to
name individuals, I do not suppose it would be difficult to find their
identities. The chief executive is paid a salary of £375,000,
but the extras amount to more than his salary—£379,000.
That is more than £750,000. Then there are their pension pots,
which are probably £2 million. The executive director of
business planning earns £195,000, with additional benefits of
£199,000. Again his additional benefits are more than his
salary. In the interests of transparency and the public knowing what is
being done in their name with taxpayers’ money, it might be
better to have another look at the transparency website and put these
details in one place, although if one is prepared to spend the time,
the truth does emerge.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000254">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will not
talk about the Olympic Delivery Authority, although the salaries of
some staff are extraordinary. The chair of Ofgem earns a package of
£415,000. We talked earlier about the Care Quality Commission,
which does a very valuable job. However, we must ask whether we would
want to protect a total remuneration package of just short of
£400,000 in any TUPE arrangements. It is not clear in the Bill
that those issues will be addressed in the transfer. Since the clause
deals with the transfer and refers to staff, let me say that we are
completely with the work force, who are loyal public servants doing a
valuable job, and we want to see them properly protected with secure
futures as far as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000255">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The people
who occupy the posts I have referred to are also distinguished
individuals, probably with brilliant minds and records of service going
way back, and I pay tribute to each one of them. However, as guardians
of the public purse and with an eye on the times in which we live, can
we justify some people—even at the third and fourth
tier—earning more than £300,000 a year on this
Government’s watch? That might have been the case, as far as I
know, under the previous Government’s watch—I am not
being partisan—but it cannot be right.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000256">&#160;</a>

one final amusing thing, although I hope you will not rule me out of
order, Mr Amess. It is fascinating that the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government appointed a
Conservative councillor to another quango, the Audit
Commission—a body that the Secretary of State has pledged to
abolish—on £14,000 a year. That decision was
surprising.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000257">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Although
we might not have a full debate now on the serious issue that I have
raised, we might come back to it on Report. How will we deal with the
transfer of undertakings for the great number of working people in the
bodies affected? More specifically, how will we deal with the levels of
remuneration if we are to protect everybody’s terms and
conditions? Will that not mean consolidating outrageous salaries that
are being paid from the public
purse?<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000258">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Clause 24 is important. It gives Ministers the
ability to make a scheme for the transfer of properties, rights and
liabilities in connection with reforms under the powers of the Bill,
and it contains important restrictions on those powers. It specifically
allows Ministers to make supplementary, incidental and transitional
provisions as part of the transfer scheme, including making provisions
that are the same or similar to TUPE regulations, or that are for the
shared ownership or use of
property.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000259">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will address my remarks directly to the TUPE issue, which was raised on
Second Reading by my fellow Hillingdon MP, the hon. Member for Hayes
and Harlington (John McDonnell). I invited him to a meeting, which took
place yesterday and was constructive, to discuss the issue with
representatives of the Public and Commercial Services Union. The hon.
Gentleman’s reasonable point was that a lot of reform and change
is going on and that there is, therefore, a great deal of anxiety,
uncertainty and insecurity among the important people who work for the
bodies. His reasonable and sensible point was whether we could do more
to clarify the rules of the road. We are going to think more about what
he
said.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
shall clarify our position in relation to clause 24. We are not using
the Bill to disable TUPE. TUPE will apply to Bill-related transfers.
The Bill does not and cannot interfere in any way with its application.
For public sector staff, the Cabinet Office statement of practice
provides, as a matter of policy, greater protection still. That is what
it was set up to do. It embodies an expectation that TUPE principles
are followed, as appropriate, in non-TUPE cases. That is important. The
clause fully reflects and is underpinned by
COSOP.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
wording used in clause 24 is not inconsistent with past practice, which
we discussed yesterday with the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington.
Practice has always varied, depending on the factual situation. The
reality of this Bill, as an enabling Bill—it is, therefore,
different from some of the precedents—is that it covers many
situations whose facts are currently unknown. That is important. The
view of this Government—and, I think, of any
Government—is that flexibility is critical at this stage, which
is why clause 24 cannot be prescriptive. I reaffirm the point that the
Bill does not and cannot interfere in any way with the application of
TUPE, and the clause fully reflects and is underpinned by
COSOP.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000262">&#160;</a>

there is cross-party agreement on the more polemic point surrounding
wage and remuneration levels in quango land. Given that we are at the
end stages of the negotiations, I gently say to the hon. Member for
Hemsworth that I am not sure that this Government came into power and
said, “One of things we must do is bump up all the wages in
quango land.” We are talking about a culture of excessive
generosity with taxpayers’ money that has crept up over time,
not least during the past 13 years of a Labour
Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000265">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">More
important is what we do about the matter now. The hon. Gentleman is
right: our constituents are disgusted by such a situation. There is an
important point relating to transparency because information is power
in that respect. If he tells me that the various websites and online
information resources designed to publish details of compensation
payments are too opaque and not user friendly, I will undertake to ask
why, because if the taxpayer is paying someone’s salary, they
have a right to find out quickly how much is being paid. That seems to
be a very important
principle.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
we are appalled by some of the redundancy payments that have had to be
made, we have introduced new more affordable terms of redundancy and
exit payments for civil servants and for those people in organisations
that mirror the civil service terms. Those have applied to the majority
of exits since the end of December 2010. In addition, there is a
requirement for Departments to publish details on compensation payments
as part of their resource accounts in order to support transparency.
That requirement covers all organisations covered by HM
Treasury’s financial reporting manual. As I said, if that
requirement is not producing information in the most user friendly way,
we will certainly look at the matter
again.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000267">&#160;</a>

1 to 5. Clause 26 permits the Treasury to make an
order that can vary the effect of tax legislation that may otherwise
apply to the transfer scheme. Such an order would be subject to the
negative procedure. The Treasury will consider the tax variations for
each scheme individually. Clause 26 limits the taxes that can be varied
to a list of relevant taxes. Stamp duty land tax was previously
excluded from the list because there is an existing stamp duty tax
relief for statutory reorganisations involving public bodies included
in section 66 of the Finance Act 2003.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000273">&#160;</a>

that relief and other powers under the 2003 Act do not cater for

transfer schemes will include land transactions that fall outside the
current stamp duty relief. The inclusion of stamp duty land tax will
ensure that tax liabilities do not become an unnecessary barrier when
Ministers make transfer schemes as part of reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000274">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment will result in a number of important benefits for Parliament
and for the Government. First, the reforms that the Government propose
to make to public bodies will deliver significant administrative
savings, which we have discussed this afternoon. It is therefore vital
that those reforms that rely on legislative changes can be delivered as
soon as possible. For some, the savings will depend on delivering
reforms before the start of the next financial year and, to make that a
realistic possibility, there must not be a delay in starting the
scrutiny of orders. For example, the abolition of the Commission for
Rural Communities will ultimately result in savings in the region of
£1.25 million in 2010-11 and a further £2.4 million over
the rest of the spending review period. Such figures would be put in
jeopardy if the Government were not able to complete the order-making
process by the end of the financial year.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000295">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 285<a class="bkMark" name="Column285">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
allowing the scrutiny of draft orders to start straight away will serve
Parliament well by ensuring that orders can be spread out over the
months following Royal Assent. Parliament’s ability to
scrutinise proposals properly could be compromised by a glut of draft
orders all needing to be brought forward after Royal Assent to ensure
that urgent savings are delivered on time. The Government absolutely
want to avoid that scenario and we have said repeatedly that we will
schedule orders so that Parliament will have ample opportunity to
scrutinise the detail of proposals. That is an important aspect of how
the Bill will work and the simple amendments would help the Government
to maximise the ability of Parliament to scrutinise proposals
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000296">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
it is important to know that Parliament will have already agreed to the
principle of reform by approving the listing of each and every body in
the schedules to the Bill. With that in mind, there can be no
justification for postponing the opportunity for Parliament to
scrutinise the detail of proposals set out in each draft order. It
would be a delay based purely on a technical drafting issue, but one
that would have real and detrimental consequences for the public by
delaying the Government’s ability to deliver much needed reforms
and to realise urgent
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000297">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Fourthly,
Parliament and the public will still be protected in the usual way by
other aspects of the commencement provisions in the clause. While
Ministers will have the ability to lay draft orders and start scrutiny
immediately, they will not have the power to make changes by using the
core powers in clauses 1 to 5 until two months have elapsed. In that
way, organisations and the public are still afforded the usual
two-month period to analyse and interpret the impact of the new
legislation, as it would be at least two months before any changes are
delivered.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000298">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Accepting
that the Public Bodies Bill is intended to be the mechanism for
reforming a range of public bodies, the laying of draft orders is an
important step in that process. It is logical and proportionate that
the power to lay draft orders is available immediately, should
Parliament pass the Bill. The amendment also clarifies that other,
technical provisions in clauses 28 to 32, such as the interpretation
provisions, will also come into force
immediately.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000299">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Committee can therefore rest assured that the amendment offers a
helpful clarification of when each of the provisions in the Bill comes
into force and it provides for the reasonable expectation that
Ministers may lay draft orders before Parliament as soon as the Bill is
passed. That does not change the proposals to reform public bodies or
the safeguards in the Bill. Delaying the start of parliamentary
scrutiny of orders, delaying the delivery of much needed reforms and
jeopardising the realisation of urgent savings cannot be justified, so
I ask the Committee to accept a sensible
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000300">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The amendment originated in the Lords.
Therefore, if the Government have their way, the clause will be
scrutinised back in the other place. No doubt, Members of the other
place will look at what the Minister has said and what I am now going
to say. I am not convinced about this issue, because we have had a
series of debates on a range of different types of public body, and we
have sought to probe why certain bodies 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 286<a class="bkMark" name="Column286">&#160;</a>
                  </div>were in each of the schedules, which were the meat of this Bill.
Habitually, the Minister’s case was that this was not the place
for the Government to explain how the situation would work, because
there would be a period of consultation. Having used that argument in
almost every single case, the Minister now seems to be saying that he
is well on the way to consulting even before the Bill has become law,
and that he is ready to lay orders before the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000301">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is a contradiction between the statement that the Minister has just
made and the arguments that we have heard over the past few weeks, and
I am troubled. If the Government already knew what they wanted to do
with these bodies, why did they not make the case better when the
Opposition were probing away? If the Government did not know at the
time, how can they now say that they are suddenly ready, or that they
will be ready when the Bill becomes an Act, to lay orders immediately
before the House? It would be wrong of me to suggest that either of the
Ministers in any way sought to mislead us, and I would not even think
that. The truth is, however, that it is hard to reconcile the
Ministers’ earlier arguments with the statement that the
Minister has just made.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000302">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is too
late in the day for us to probe that matter any further on this
occasion, and, in any case, I can see that the Government have a
majority in Committee. I want to reflect on the matter before Report
and Third Reading. No doubt, Members of the other place will look
carefully at the debate to see whether there has been any
contradiction, as I suspect there
has.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000303">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful to you, Mr Amess, for giving me the
chance to reassure the hon. Gentleman that clause 10 prevails, in the
sense that consultation under clause 10 must take place before any
draft order is laid under clause 11. The wording is clear on that, and
on the fact that 12 weeks must have elapsed between the start of
consultation on clause 10 and the laying of an order on Royal Assent
under clause 11. We are trying to enable a Department or a Minister, if
they are ready,  to get on with it. I tried to stress the point
that where delay is not justified, the argument is that we must get on
with it.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000304">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Of course we want to see savings, too, if they
are justified, and we do not want to delay the making of any savings
that are justified. However, the Minister cannot say on the one hand
that there will be three months’ consultation as required in the
Bill in another clause, and on the other hand want to remove the
two-month clause relating to the commencement. The two things are not
completely compatible. Can the Minister reconcile that for the
Committee?<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000305">&#160;</a>

towards situations where a consultation has effectively taken place
already, such as on the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The
Department in question will conceivably be ready to go, because they
have fulfilled the requirement for consultation. For most
of the bodies, however, clause 10 stands in terms of placing a
requirement on Ministers to consult before laying an order.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000306">&#160;</a>

would be inappropriate not to have a debate on something of a Welsh
nature before proceedings are wound up. In moving new clause 6 I am
returning, albeit briefly, to consumer rights and particularly the
future of Consumer Focus Wales. In our previous debates, there was
consensus that Consumer Focus has achieved a great deal in its short
life, which is certainly true of Consumer Focus
Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000345">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
new clause, which is unashamedly devolutionist in its intentions, would
allow the Welsh Assembly Government to set up their own consumer
advocacy body to replace Consumer Focus Wales, in a way similar to the
power already contained in the Bill for the Welsh Assembly Government
to set up a separate environmental body, and similar to the way
consumer advocacy is advanced in the other devolved
Administrations.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000346">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">From
financial inclusion to postal services and food safety, Consumer Focus
Wales has had a big impact and has been a source of high quality
research and persuasive advocacy. Discussions with Welsh Ministers and
a consultation have been ongoing, with a view to putting forward a new
model that draws from the grass-roots experience of citizens advice
bureaux. Although that presents some obstacles in terms of the level of
resources 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 291<a class="bkMark" name="Column291">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and research experience, my fundamental concern is that Wales will not
be properly represented. As a result of devolution and other factors
such as rurality, rural poverty and the Welsh language, the consumer
landscape in Wales is fundamentally different. A London-led model is
not suitable, and leadership and accountability should ultimately rest
in
Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000347">&#160;</a>

Focus Wales has undertaken. Private car parking, which is a major
concern of Consumer Focus Wales, was touched on in the Chamber last
night. Consumer Focus Wales has worked closely with trading standards
departments, including my own in Ceredigion, to try to eradicate some
of the shady practices in pursuit of private parking
offences.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000348">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Consumer
Focus Wales is launching an inquiry into park homes. I have spoken to
many constituents with concerns about park homes. Some of my more
intractable casework has emerged from the sometimes confusing law
relating to park homes. Residents of park homes are often older and
more vulnerable, and I know that Consumer Focus Wales will do a great
deal of good work for the benefit of my constituents. That illustrates
my point. With a totally different planning system in Wales, it is
clear that that work has to be done by a body with specific Welsh
experience, and that can take forward such work in a Welsh
context.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000349">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
know that the Government do not want to lose such work, but there is a
fear that the model proposed so far will not allow such comprehensive
work to take place. I am fortunate to have had a recent debate on
Consumer Focus Wales in Westminster Hall with the Minister responsible
for such matters. I do not wish in any way to insult my colleagues on
the Front Bench, but that debate was a good opportunity directly to
discuss matters arising from the Public Bodies Bill with a Minister
responsible for the policy. The Front-Bench team has done an admirable
job of representing the interests of other Departments, but it was good
to have that dialogue with the Minister with responsibility for
consumer affairs. I was encouraged by what he said, although the devil
is clearly in the
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000350">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
one thing that this debate is not about is the quality of work
undertaken by Consumer Focus Wales, and I am sure that all members of
the Committee will share that view. The Minister has stressed that
view. Indeed, Sharon Mills, who saw at first hand the work that
Consumer Focus Wales has done on food safety in response to the E. coli
outbreak that tragically killed her son, has submitted written evidence
to the Committee that expresses support for Consumer Focus Wales. It
does a fantastic job, and the question is how we can build on that and
take that work
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000351">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am sceptical as to whether the Citizens Advice model will work for
Wales. A separate body for Wales would be preferable. Citizens Advice
does excellent work, but there is no doubt that the Welsh arm would not
be able to be as vocal or as distinctly Welsh as Consumer Focus
Wales—let alone the whole issue that we have discussed
previously about the adequacy of resources.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000352">&#160;</a>

               <p>As
such, Consumer Focus Wales regularly undertakes work looking at the
services that consumers receive from all levels of government. There is
no certainty that this important and independent focus on Welsh public
services will continue. The failure to recognise the gap between what
the consultation describes as consumer policy and all the areas of work
that Consumer Focus Wales undertakes creates a worry that arrangements
may leave out altogether significant areas of work. The Minister with
responsibility for consumer affairs said during my Westminster Hall
debate
that<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000354">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Consumer
Focus Wales’s functions in representing Welsh consumers should
be retained in
Wales”,<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000436">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>and
that it was important that decisions affecting consumers in Wales
should be taken in Wales. That is a welcome commitment, but it needs to
be matched by what is put forward. I make a simple request that Welsh
Ministers and the Welsh Government should have the power—as they
do on environmental bodies—to establish a body unique to Wales.
This may sound a dry subject, but it is about devolution. There is a
willingness, and perhaps an expectation, that Welsh Ministers and the
Welsh Government will make decisions in this important
area.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000355">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
it were a case of keeping the matter open and looking at it after the
consultation, that would be fine, but if the power that I am seeking is
not included in the Bill, there will not be a legislative opportunity
for some time to give the Welsh Government this power. The Government
have rightly cautioned against pre-judging the consultation, but that
is what they will be doing by rejecting the new clause. If the Welsh
Government are not granted the power through the Bill, and even if the
Government decide that a separate Welsh consumer advocacy body is the
right vehicle, they will not have the power to set up that
body.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000356">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
urge the Government—I hope today, but if not then on
Report—to ensure that the Welsh Government have the power to set
up their own consumer advocacy body. The new clause will not mean that
they will do so, or that they will have to, but, in the spirit of
devolution, it will mean that they have the power to do so if they
believe that that is the best
option.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000357">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> You will not be surprised, Mr Amess, to hear
that I am fundamentally in favour of devolution. It is probably the
worst kept secret in the Committee or even in British politics. I
support the hon. Member for Ceredigion in calling for the devolution of
decision-making power. Whatever that decision might be, it is
fundamentally a matter for the Welsh
Assembly.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000358">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
point is that the issue is extremely timely. Some hon. Members will
have kept abreast of the developments in the other place this morning.
There have been calls for some time for a Calman-like commission for
Wales to examine the powers of the Welsh Assembly. The Secretary of
State announced today that we are to have such a commission, led by
Paul Silk. It will not be a Calman commission, but a
Silk—perhaps even a Silky—commission. Given that we are
to have this commission, the Secretary of State called for a moratorium
on further devolution for two years while the commission 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 293<a class="bkMark" name="Column293">&#160;</a>
                  </div>sits. I want to note my complete opposition to that. I agree with a
former Secretary of State and one-time Member for Caerphilly, Ron
Davies, who said famously that devolution is a process, not an event.
That cannot be altered while the commission does its detailed work,
which might take some time. There is a Welsh saying in response to
being asked, “Come here for a moment. Come and do something
here.” I can hear my mother saying it in Welsh: the English
translation would be, “I’ll be with you now.” That
means in a moment, as it were. That is not good enough for devolution.
Devolution is a process that will continue whatever the commission
does.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000359">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> It is indeed appropriate to end on a Welsh note. I
thank the hon. Member for Ceredigion for the amendment and the
constructive way in which he presented it. He will know that the
Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills has recently
consulted on proposals to rationalise the functions of consumer
protection bodies. By so doing, it is his aim to eliminate confusion
and duplication, strengthen local delivery and provide a stronger role
for front-line consumer services. Exactly how that is to be done is now
being considered in line with responses to the consultation. The
preferred option set out in the consultation was to close Consumer
Focus, which includes Consumer Focus Wales, because the Government
believe its functions would be better carried out by an expanded
Citizens Advice service.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000360">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government also asked for views on how they could work with other
consumer bodies. As the Minister for Consumer Affairs explained during
the Westminster Hall debate introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for
Ceredigion on 14 September, it is not the intention of the proposals to
reduce the level of support afforded to consumers across Wales or
anywhere else. In fact, there is room for improvement and we aim to
deliver that. The Government’s aim is to create greater clarity
for consumers and others about who is championing their
rights.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000361">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government want to increase the impact that publicly funded consumer
advocacy has domestically and internationally. We want to reduce
overlap and we want all that to be delivered by a known and trusted
organisation with high visibility and outreach. As we have argued
before, Citizens Advice already has an excellent track record of
advocacy on behalf of consumers at national and local level, and we
want to build on that track record and brand awareness. We do not wish
to lose the experience and expertise held at Consumer Focus. Instead we
want to bring together the expertise with the long-standing success of
Citizens Advice and its bureaux in helping consumers. That would create
a powerful consumer body that businesses would have to listen
to.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000362">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While
we want to make those changes, the Government agree that the functions
currently undertaken by Consumer Focus Wales in representing Welsh
consumers should be retained in Wales. Officials at the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills and Citizens Advice are in regular
discussion with those of the Welsh Government and remain confident that
Citizens Advice could be sufficiently developed to address any current
concerns over capacity and governance arrangements. Citizens Advice and
Citizens Advice Cymru are an excellent basis on which to grow our new
advocacy model. They 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 294<a class="bkMark" name="Column294">&#160;</a>
                  </div>are widely recognised and trusted by the public. While it is not
expected that the bureaux themselves will be used to deliver the
advocacy role, the information and experience gathered by them will
prove invaluable and ensure that the support being offered is what is
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000363">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
bureau in every county in Wales and services delivered from more than
247 advice points across the country. In 2010, there were 402,000
inquiries to citizens advice bureaux in Wales and they helped more than
123,000 clients. Every effort is being made to deliver a consumer
advocacy model in Wales that will be as good if not better than now,
and the amendment is not necessary to do that. Rather, in the
Government’s view, it will add layers of bureaucracy. The
amendment also goes against the spirit of the Bill, as it could add to
rather than reduce the number of public bodies and create duplication
of a service that can be effectively delivered by Citizens
Advice.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000364">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
it is important that each country has national representation on issues
of specific interest to them, industries that operate across Great
Britain should also continue to have a single national voice and not
have to negotiate three times whenever they wish to do
something.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000365">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I said at
the start of my remarks, this has been out to a consultation, which
closed on 27 September. It asked specific questions about whether the
model we are discussing might be appropriate in Wales and invited
responses. The relevant Ministers in the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills will respond in due course. If they are convinced
that a different model is appropriate as a result of responses, an
appropriate legislative vehicle will be sought. In the light of the
explanation and the assurances I have given, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000366">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for that
response. I concur completely about the need for transparency. I
acknowledge what he said about the significance of citizens advice
bureaux in our communities, and he is right to highlight the need to
avoid duplication. The message that I took from the Minister in my
Westminster Hall debate, and that I have heard this afternoon, is that
the consultation is proceeding and those responses will be analysed by
the Welsh Affairs Committee on which I serve. It will also undertake a
short investigation into these matters next week. So the jury is still
out. For that reason I will seek to withdraw the new clause with the
proviso that I may return to this on
Report.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000367">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
significant point that I want to make on the new clause is that these
decisions should be made in Cardiff. They should be made by the Welsh
National Assembly and the Government of Wales who are the best placed
to make these decisions. They are best placed to respond to the unique
needs for consumer advocacy in our country. That is why I am slightly
cautious and almost hostile when Ministers say that they will reflect
on the needs of Wales and on what is best for Wales. I am unashamedly a
devolutionist and I want that decision to rest with Ministers in
Cardiff. On the basis of what the Minister said, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000368">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> On a point of order, Mr Amess, it is curious, is
it not, that the clock is running about eight minutes ahead of itself?
The Committee, too, has run ahead of itself, very much due to the
excellent way in which it has been chaired by you and your colleague,
Mr Robertson. We have very much enjoyed the way that you have handled
things. There were times when we strayed beyond the limits and you
correctly brought us back into order. We very much appreciate how you
handled the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000421">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
two Ministers have dealt seriously with the issues we raised, and we
appreciate that. As I have remarked, they are both reasonable men
occasionally doing unreasonable
things.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000422">&#160;</a>

thank you for your chairmanship, good humoured and firm as it was. Can
you please pass on our thanks to Mr Robertson? I thank the Clerks for
some outstanding work. I thank my officials for their excellent work,
giving me words that I could use and advice that I could understand in
writing that I could read. I also thank the new, slimline Deputy Leader
of the House who has done some absolutely Trojan work alongside me,
even volunteering to speak on some of the more controversial bodies in
the Bill. Last but not least, I thank all on the Committee for the
extremely constructive and rigorous way in which we have dealt with a
far-reaching Bill with important consequences for a large number of
public bodies and the people that work in them. Some require serious
debate and analysis, and we feel that we have done that. Thank you
again.<a class="bkMark" name="111011100000424">&#160;</a>

splendid job of scrutinising the Bill thoroughly professionally. I also
