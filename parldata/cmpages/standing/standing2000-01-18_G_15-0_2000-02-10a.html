<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`8A-(1) Section 106 (false statements as to candidates) shall be amended as follows.

<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): I was saying that amendment No. 18 is exceedingly important. It was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) and the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), which shows some cross-party commitment to finding an answer to the internet problems that have arisen in recent years. I alluded to my own experience of the internet and to people using it in a way that could result in distortion or misrepresentation. My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East pointed to a specific and worrying legal problem.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): I point out to my hon. Friend that section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 is narrowly drawn. It relates to lies about the personal character or conduct of a candidate, with a view to damaging his chances of being returned to Parliament-lies about the sort of political positions that he might take or statements that might be wrongly attributed to him. It is specifically intended to prevent people's character being blackened by lies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for bringing me back to the amendment. I wished merely to allude to the wider problems caused by the electronic transmission of information and electronic publication, which we may have to deal with in other legislation.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> First, I apologise for having missed this morning's debate but, as I used to say in a former incarnation, I am familiar with the issue. It deserves our attention. When I was a Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, I devoted much attention to the question of how to grapple with and regulate the comparatively new phenomena of the internet. With that plea in mitigation, Mr. Maxton, I hope that you will forgive me for coming late to this discussion.
<P>
I have discussed the matter with the hon. Member for New Forest, East and my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, and I congratulate them on the way in which they have pursued the matter. I bow to my hon. Friend's expertise; he is one of the most knowledgeable Members on new technology.
<P>
I am not unsympathetic to amending section 106 of the Representation of the People 1983 along the lines suggested in the amendment. The subject is difficult, because we need to deal with a number of complex, technical issues. The Committee may agree about what we need to achieve, but the means of getting there is difficult to resolve. The amendment is not acceptable as it stands.
<P>
First, under section 106 of the 1983 Act, it is necessary to prove intent. The amendment would leave that requirement in place, even when the offence lay in the failure to remove an item that was first published some while previously, But it would be difficult to prove such a case and the amendment might therefore be without effect. On the other hand, removing the requirement would be a significant step and one needs to consider the public policy implications.
<P>
Secondly, we cannot clarify the meaning of ``publish'' in section 106 in isolation to other uses of that term both in the 1983 Act-for example, section 110-and in the Bill-clauses 94, 118 and 119. In particular, it may be right to clarify that a person who makes material available on a website publishes it for the period during which the availability of the material remains within his control. There must be some consistency in the way in which the issue of responsibility for website publications is dealt with across the board.
<P>
I have had discussions with the hon. Gentleman and have already asked my officials to consider what we could do to plug the loophole in such a way that it does not have an undesirable effect. I cannot promise to find a workable solution that meets all the public policy requirements without being too broad in focus, but I shall do my best. I am grateful for the discussions that we have had and on that basis I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): I apologise to you, Mr. Maxton, for the slightly inappropriate hand signals, but it is important to deal with the matter in some detail before the hon. Member for New Forest, East decides whether to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
My hon. Friend, the Minister, hits on the two key issues-the question of intent and the hugely difficult one of publishing. I accept that a careful line has to be drawn between deliberate intent to defame, either in or out of an election period, and the absolute right to freedom of speech that we must protect. All hon. Members will acknowledge that my hon. Friend made an important point that needs to be carefully studied in the context of an appropriate way of handling section 106 of the 1983 Act. We touched on that this morning.
<P>
On the question of publication, my view is still that in the Bill, as in all legislation, the Government need-to use the words of the hon. Member for New Forest, East of this morning-to create legislation fit for this century in the context of the very rapidly changing nature of publications. There are a number of issues that I would urge my hon. Friend to look at. The first relates to the internet as we know it today-and I stress ``today'' because tomorrow the internet will be a different vehicle, more widely available and with an infinite number of pages. I speculated this morning that there might be 10 billion pages currently available.
<P>
Second is the vexed question of the handling of e-mail, especially given the power to mass-broadcast e-mail. We saw when the Electronic Communications Bill was going through its Committee stage, the very effective way in which the Leader of the Opposition conducted, perfectly legitimately, his mass-broadcasting campaign. I am on dangerous ground, again praising a Conservative, but I praise him for his technical competence in so doing. If, however, it is used as a tool of malice, it could be a dangerous weapon that could undermine the integrity of any candidate very easily.
<P>
The third area is that surrounding the internet: the way in which domain names are registered. If I may use a personal example by way of illustration, there is nothing to stop me registering the domain name ``Julian Lewis''-
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): Other than commonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) says ``other than commonsense'' from a sedentary position. However, if I wanted maliciously to attack the hon. Gentleman, it would be very useful to register a domain name that is closely associated with his. Members of Parliament who subsequently become candidates have special problems associated with that. There are grounds for saying that Parliament should revisit this problem urgently. If it is not possible to reach an appropriate solution before we consider the Bill on Report, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be in a strong position then to give appropriate assurances, not just to this Committee but to the whole House, that active consideration will continue until we find a way through this morass. There will have to be a clause that encompasses the technologies of tomorrow as well as those so far identified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I hope that when summing up the hon. Member for New Forest, East will, first, disregard my unfair intervention. Secondly, I accept that many of us feel that this issue needs to be confronted and dealt with. I hope that he will press the Minister, as I would, to make sure that should she feel unable to come forward with a solution now, she will give some undertaking that something will be done, since this is going to be the most rapidly expanding area on election communications and campaign communications over the next 10 years. If this Bill misses the opportunity, there will be a major loophole.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> In view of that generous support for the amendment from the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, I could forgive him almost anything. If the Minister had been present this morning, she would have heard me talk about the memorandum, with which I know she is familiar. I also paid her a tribute for her kindness in meeting me not only in her capacity as a Home Office Minister, but to discuss related matters when she was a Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not want to sound mawkish, but I was extremely touched by the sympathy and support that Members from all parties have shown me for the ordeal that I underwent. I am sure that many of them realise that it might be only the tip of the iceberg. As I am sure the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston recognised long before I became acquainted with the subject, the internet is in about year three of its evolution, yet we may expect that it will advance to about year 50 in the twinkling of an eye, which is a mere decade of earthly time. The technological ability that the internet confers on any individual to broadcast to the world is a great power.
<P>
I am in no way attached to the specific words of the amendment. I did not draft it myself; I am grateful to the Clerk of Legislation, who drafted it as a first and-I think-effective stab at the problem. In a previous existence, I was involved in pressure group work and sometimes I helped to draft amendments to legislation. I have never known of the acceptance of an amendment drafted by the person who waged the campaign for it. One must try to convince the Government of the day that an amendment needs to be made, and then rely on the expertise of officials working with Ministers to draft it.
<P>
My campaign has gone on for several months and I have received personal or public support from three Home Office Ministers. They understand the problem and support me, so why should they not amend the Bill? The answer is that there may be technical difficulties, but we do not want to let what I shall gently call the Sir Humphrey syndrome force the problem into the sand.
<P>
It is clear already that people who upload material on to the internet are publishing it, and my case did not fail on the grounds that they were not. We are dealing with the narrow issue of whether it amounts to publication during an election campaign if people deliberately keep material on the internet and, as the Minister rightly said, decide to leave it there, knowing that it is under their control to remove it.
<P>
We are talking about something that goes to the heart of the democratic process. Section 106 of the 1983 Act is designed to place criminal sanctions against an act for which, if it were done to individuals when they were prospective candidates or involved in an earlier stage of political life, there would be no criminal remedy. The exception to that would be the all too infrequently used remedy of criminal libel, and it is debatable whether that is even still available to people for their protection.
<P>
Section 106, when it deals with other methods of publication, can place criminal sanctions in the peculiar situation of danger to the integrity of the election process. Therefore, I see no reason in principle why it cannot make a similar rigorous exception to our more normal, liberal attitude to issues of free speech and criminal law in the case of the internet.
<P>
In the discussions that led up to my tabling the amendment, officials kindly gave me the judgment on a case that established that, had the judges done their job properly in my case, the appeal would have failed and the conviction of the person who had abused my reputation would have stood. The problem was that the case was out there at the time of the appeal and it was not adequate to do the trick. The barrister who brought the case for the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed to me subsequently that, in his opinion, even if that particular case had been cited, it would have made any difference to the result.
<P>
Let us suppose that that advice was correct and that the case law established by that judgment had done the trick and determined that it was still publication to leave the material on the internet during the election campaign, having put it there prior to the start of the campaign. If that were the case, whatever the difficult, technical, knock-on problems that would flow from amending the Bill, they will still result from that specific case law. I sometimes get the feeling that there is objection to that, because minds have been made up and people do not want the trouble of altering the law and looking round for alternative rationalisations. I know that that is not the view of the Minister and I hope that it is not the view of the Government's professional advisers.
<P>
I want to refer now to intent. The objection that is now being made that it would be difficult to show that leaving lies on the internet during the election campaign was done with the intent of affecting the candidate's vote. That would not be much more difficult than it was for me to show that putting the lies on the internet in the first place was done with the intent of damaging my vote. The Minister and I are at one about how difficult it is under the current law to get a conviction under section 106 of the 1983 Act, because it requires that the person who is to be convicted must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``before or during an election''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
told lies about the candidate.
<P>
To fulfil that requirement, I attended a public meeting given by the author of the scurrilous lies about my private life and deeply personal matters. The lies also affected my then girlfriend, who was accused of being a woman from an escort agency and she attended the meeting with me. I asked the person who held the meeting what he had said about Julian Lewis. He gave me answers and it was only then that I revealed that I was the very person whom he been defaming throughout the world. I identified my girlfriend and asked him to name her and the escort agency for which he had said she worked. He could do none of those things and it was only then that I said, ``The reason you are doing this is to damage my vote at the election, isn't it?'' The man was arrogant and stupid enough to say, ``Definitely.'' I could prove intent only because I had had enough foresight to have someone in the front row tape recording what was taking place. The argument about the difficulty of proving intent is not in relation to my amendment, but in relation to the efficacy of section 106 of the 1983 Act as a protection for candidates against lies being told about them generally.
<P>
If people want to make an issue out of the question of intent, they must consider removing paragraph (6) from section 106, whether or not such material is put on the internet during the election campaign. As the law stands, it is difficult to prove intent. If the difficulty of proving it is an objection to my amendment, it is also an objection to the existing law. I am trying to bring the Bill into line with the intention and reality of existing law as it pertains to those people smart enough to put lies on the internet before an election campaign formally begins and to leave them there, rather than as it pertains to those who merely put lies on the internet during an election campaign.
<P>
I have listened carefully to the Minister's assurances. I am almost entirely satisfied, but not so satisfied that if she cannot come forward with the appropriately sophisticated amendments-if her officials are correct, and I have no reason to doubt their view that amendments are clearly required-I will, not introduce the amendment at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 122, in page 80, line 17, after `Act', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and in the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now come to part IX of the Bill. We touched on it earlier in our deliberations on donations to political parties. Clause 128 is about political donations by companies. We have said throughout our proceedings that we concur with the recommendations of the Neill report almost in their entirety. I know that the Government have acted in the spirit of that report in the Bill. I remind the Committee of recommendation 34, which is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Legislative provision should be made to require any company''-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is an important emphasis-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``intending to make a donation (whether in cash or kind . . .) to a political party or organisation to have the prior authority of its shareholders. This authority could be in the form of a broad enabling power''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I argued earlier for consistency in legislation. The Minister may know that this morning her colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary agreed to reconsider what I said about de minimis limits. However, a more important element of inconsistency is highlighted by the amendment. Clause 128 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The provisions set out in Schedule 18 shall be inserted in the Companies Act 1985''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I refer the Committee to our discussions on clause 48, which deals with restrictions on donations to registered parties. Clause 48(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``For the purposes of this Part the following are permissible donors . . . <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) a company-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) registered under the Companies Act 1985''-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
consistency so far-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 appears to be missing from part IX. It is certainly missing from clauses 128 and 129 and from schedule 18.
<P>
I remind the Minister of the White Paper published by the Home Office. Paragraph 5.l9 is about donations by companies to political parties. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Bill as introduced will amend the Companies Act 1985 to give effect to these conclusions''-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
okay so far. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Parallel amendments will be made to the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 so that the requirements will apply to all companies incorporated in the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not a lawyer and have not studied in detail the Companies Act 1985-not mentioned by Neill who refers all the way through to the Companies Act 1967. I will not go into that because I do not know the nuance differences between those two Acts.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our concern is that we seem to have omitted the provisions for companies in Northern Ireland. The White Paper refers to the United Kingdom or the UK and it seems to me that, given clause 48(2)(b) passed earlier, we are dealing here with donations from a company.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(i) registered under the Companies Act 1985 or the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and we seem to have found a glaring omission, unless-and I hope my suspicions are incorrect-this is an omission for political purposes. I raise that question because we have had other discussions on clauses relating to the control of political parties in Northern Ireland and for donations to them.
<P>
I seek reassurance from the Minister that we are not in some way trying to create yet another loophole for impermissible donations-donations from companies that are registered under the Northern Ireland companies registration orders which would not be permitted in Great Britain. I have argued throughout this Bill, and we shall no doubt return to it on Report, that there should not be any special provisions for Northern Ireland or for Northern Ireland political parties. When talking about third-party expenditure, we highlighted the fact that there are no special provisions for Northern Ireland under third-party donations: if third parties are making expenditure in election campaigns and those third parties are located in Northern Ireland, there is not the protection of anonymity or protection against taking impermissible donations which Northern Ireland political parties enjoy. Therefore, I find it illogical that we should now be allowing this Bill to pass through with a lack of provision for Northern Ireland companies and permissible donations from them, particularly as they have already been mentioned as requiring to be mentioned by the political parties in clause 48.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I hope that I will be able to provide some reassurances to the hon. Gentleman and I understand why he has raised this matter. It is right to say that the Neill committee's recommendations were made in respect of all parts of the United Kingdom. We accept that. However, we ought to point out with regard to this part of the Bill the need to recognise that Northern Ireland has its own companies' legislation. That position was recognised under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, under which company law remained devolved to Northern Ireland. It is important to remember that that was a devolved matter and has been so since 1922. Given that background, the Government felt that issues relating to political donations and expenditure by companies should be looked at separately in respect of Northern Ireland and-as is usual-the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 amended accordingly.
<P>
Given that it is a devolved matter, the Government felt that in drafting the Bill this was the correct way to proceed. I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) for raising the matter and giving me the opportunity to put it before the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the Minister for her explanation. I hesitate to suggest that that might satisfy me, because we are drawing up a set of rules for the conduct of political activity in the United Kingdom. The Bill makes provisions and exceptions that relate to Northern Ireland. We have referred specifically to donations from companies registered there and, as I said earlier, the Government said that parallel amendments will be made to the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986.
<P>
A Northern Ireland Bill has already passed through the House of Commons-and probably by now through another place-that would effectively suspend devolution. Those legislative powers would therefore revert back to this place, yet we are still ignoring the provisions in the Bill as they relate to Northern Ireland. To avoid a protracted debate, I shall withdraw the amendment, but, particularly given the changing nature of devolution as it relates to Northern Ireland, I suggest that the Minister or other members of the Committee might address the matter again when the Bill is considered on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 128 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>CONTROL OF POLITICAL DONATIONS BY COMPANIES:</center></H4>
NEW PART XA OF COMPANIES ACT 1985
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Eighteenth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Members of the Committee may be aware that we are dealing with significant changes to the way in which companies operate, particularly in relation to political donations. I am therefore surprised at the lack of representation from the corporate sector on the effect that the provisions will have on companies.
<P>
As I said earlier, we support the recommendations of the Neill Committee and, therefore, the spirit of what is proposed in the Bill. However, a matter has been raised with me by the Confederation of British Industry that I should like to bring to the attention of the Committee and on which I seek some guidance from the Minister. The schedule amends the Companies Act. Proposed new section 347A(6)(b) defines what constitutes an ``EU political organisation''. The term ``EU political organisation'' means a registered party. That is fairly straightforward if the organisation involved is a party that is registered in the United Kingdom, but is not so straightforward if another part of the EU is involved. Proposed new section 347A(6)(b) refers to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any other organisation which carries on, or proposes to carry on, activities of any political nature in the United Kingdom or any other member State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That catch-all provision could include all sorts of organisations. What is meant by the phrase ``any political nature''? Might the provision include a think tank? Does the Institute for Public Policy Research, or the Centre for Policy Studies, constitute an organisation carrying on an activity of ``any political nature''? Such organisations want to influence the political debate. Some of our learned institutions have centres for research from which we, as politicians, receive documentation and which want to influence legislation. They may receive corporate donations that the companies involved regard as part of their academic sponsorship. Might such donations be considered to be of a political nature? That is a genuine anxiety of corporate treasurers, who have suggested that it is a rather broad-brush provision.
<P>
The definition of ``EU political organisation'' is clear for organisations that operate in the United Kingdom, but not for those that operate in the rest of the EU. The phrase ``any other organisation'' is so broad brush that it could encompass a whole host of organisations that might not regard themselves as political and would certainly not regard themselves as third parties, permitted participants or members' associations. Such organisations are essentially academic or quasi-academic, but none the less they have an interest in political science. Does that constitute activity of ``any political nature''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Although I do not have a great deal of sympathy with the idea of granting wholesale exemptions to companies for the money that they can disburse without the approval of shareholders, the hon. Member for North Dorset touched on several issues that need consideration, especially the charitable or quasi-charitable giving of companies. Charities cannot, of course, indulge in political activity under UK law, at least in this country. We must consider whether the wording of the provision might catch some of them because they do educational and other work in overseas countries. Some organisations, such as War on Want, were deliberately established as non-charitable organisations to enable them to carry out more politicised work in this country to change public opinion.
<P>
It seems that companies will be able to donate to charities, which by definition cannot participate in political activity, but they might be strongly inhibited from contributing to other non-profit-making organisations that do not work for party political advantage even though they advocate a view that might be regarded as political. I do not support the hon. Member for North Dorset in his attempt to expand the scope for companies to gain exemption, but I ask the Minister to comment and reflect on one of the, perhaps unintended, side effects of this part of the legislation, which might be to make companies less willing to engage in their non-profit-making civic duty to support society.

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> All members of the Committee have received the letter from the CBI to which the hon. Member for North Dorset referred. While considering its content, it struck me that the CBI might have hit on a point about the wide use of the phrase ``any other organisation'' in the paragraph. To take up the point made by the hon. Member for-Hazel Grove, would that preclude or restrict charities such as Save the Children that are engaged in political activity with a small ``p''? I shall be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister will clarify the intention so that we consider it in the context of those observations and the CBI representation that she has received.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Dorset or raising the matter, and for the contributions from my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. We will need to take the issue away and reflect on it. We couched the provisions in those terms because they follow the recommendations of the Neill committee, but I understand the representations that have been made about the broad nature of the drafting.

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The amendments are on a slightly different point from the one that I made earlier. I have sought to return to the phraseology in the White Paper, a section of which is about companies. It mentions the commercial climate in the United Kingdom, donations to UK and European Union companies and political activities in the United Kingdom. In clause 129, the United Kingdom does not exist. Its references are to Great Britain, the European Union and something called non-EU, which I presume means the rest of the world.
<P>
I heard what the Minister said about leaving aside amendments to the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 because that relates to what might today, but not tomorrow, be devolved activities. I acknowledge that argument but am concerned that we are dealing with companies incorporated in Great Britain, when the basis of the legislation is that of donations to UK political parties that are, for the most part, from permissible donors, most of whom are on an electoral register in the United Kingdom, and from incorporated and unincorporated bodies. As we have discovered, unincorporated bodies might not be based in the UK. There is a flaw in the legislation in regard to donations or activities by third parties, but the most glaring flaw is that, while we have talked about political donations from companies in the UK seeking shareholder approval, in the clause we slip back to omitting Northern Ireland and talking about Great Britain.
<P>
I shall put aside the Minister's practical arguments about the separate legislation in Northern Ireland. I accept that that is her position. However, we are dealing with disclosure of political donations and expenditure in a directors' report. It is entirely legitimate that, whatever supplementary or parallel legislation is enacted in Northern Ireland to the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order, a company, be it incorporated in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, making a donation to a political party in the UK should have to comply with the provisions in the clause. We have already decided that the only companies allowed to make such donations are ones that have a registered office in the UK, even though they might be incorporated in the European Union,
<P>
It is a simple principle, based on the fact that we are dealing with the activities of United Kingdom political parties. We should specify-and it is within the power of Parliament to do so-that political parties that send members to Parliament should be covered by legislation passed here. That legislation covers companies incorporated in the United Kingdom, not just Great Britain.
<P>
My point is, I hope, simple: I am not in favour of exemptions for Northern Ireland in this regard, despite the fact that I have argued for exemptions for Northern Irish political parties. Whatever the practical provisions, I am not prepared to accept a clause that provides for yet another exemption for companies incorporated in Northern Ireland, despite that fact that other provisions in the Bill give exemptions for parties registered in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's arguments. I hope that he will forgive me if I frame my response to him in a way that is similar to my earlier response. I said that since 1922 Northern Ireland had a company law regime that is separate from that of Great Britain. That has, of course, had consequences for legislation over the years. The Companies Act 1985 extends only to England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland is regulated in a different way and it has the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Am I not right in thinking that the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 was passed in this House?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Of course it was. The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. We in this House recognise that there are different institutions and different histories because of the nature of the United Kingdom. That has resulted, from time to time, in different regimes. Company law legislation has evolved that has brought parity with the rest of the UK, but Northern Ireland is governed by separate legislation. This is not unique.
<P>
This part of the Bill relates to matters of corporate governance and its scope is wider than the Neill committee's recommendations. That is why it is appropriate that it should be dealt with through companies' legislation, which is separate in Northern Ireland. I understand genuinely the points that the hon. Gentleman raises. These discussions, however, are not unique. I have served on a number of Bills-both in opposition and as a member of the Government attempting to put through legislation-when we have looked at the different situations that have existed because of different legislation in other parts of the United Kingdom. I am not sure if I can satisfy entirely the hon. Gentleman on this point, but I do hope that the explanation will enable him to understand why the Government arrived at this view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I certainly accept the logic of the Minister's response and her explanation why the Government reached this conclusion and the wording in the Bill. I remind the Committee of the arguments made from this side this morning with regard to local government elections in Scotland being covered by different legislation and how it is conceivable that somebody could have committed an illegal or corrupt practice in the Scottish local government election yet stand for Parliament in England. We need legislation that ensures that political activity by political parties, third parties, individuals, companies and other organisations in this country is clean and based on the principles of financial propriety and fairness. It concerns me that all these little differences are built in.
<P>
We may return to the Scottish issue, and the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that we will come back to the whole provision for Northern Ireland on Report. I sense that there is an unwillingness to re-address this on Report. Other Members of the Committee, and the Minister, may wish to look at this again between now and Report to see if we can find a better way. In order to give us time for reflection, I beg to ask leave to withdraw this and the subsequent amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 129 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.-[Mr. Sutcliffe.]

Adjourned accordingly at half-past Three o'clock till Tuesday 15 February at half-past Ten o'clock.
