<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Gisela Stuart):</B> I shall take us back to where we were before we broke for lunch. The discussion focused around the future of the national health service and why we felt it appropriate to have one system, the Commission for Health Improvement, to manage the NHS and another system, the National Care Standards Commission, to regulate the private sector. The two bodies have a common interest in the quality of health care, but there are substantial and significant differences between them.



<P>
I would like to take the opportunity to apologise that new clause 23 was tabled so late, but hopefully it will clarify the issue.



<P>
It may be helpful to remind ourselves of the purpose of the Commission for Health Improvement and thereby highlight why it would be inappropriate for one system under the National Care Standards Commission to regulate both sectors. The National Care Standards Commission is being established to regulate and to provide safeguards and national minimum standards for patients in the independent health care sector. It is not for the Government to advise the independent sector. Part of the role of the Commission for Health Improvement is to advise the NHS on clinical governance, to review local NHS clinical governance arrangements for a rolling three to four-year programme, to carry out investigations into persistent service problems at the initiative of the Secretary of State and to review NHS implementation of such things as National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance. The Commission for Health Improvement began its operations in April 2000 and is currently carrying out two special investigations and compiling four clinical governance reviews. The remaining 21 reviews will be completed by March 2001. The National Care Standards Commission's role is to set standards, to regulate, to inspect and--if necessary--to apply sanctions in the independent sector.



<P>
We have a system with two specially designed measures to ensure that high quality care is provided in the NHS and to extend that by different methods to the private sector. For that reason, the amendments to extend the National Care Standards Commission's remit to NHS hospitals and to independent clinics and medical agencies that provide NHS services will be an unnecessary second level of scrutiny. Therefore, we ask the Committee to vote against the amendments.



<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I am grateful to the Minister for her remarks. She may be confused as to my intentions. I am not suggesting that the National Care Standards Commission can act in relation to the NHS as an alternative to the Commission for Health Improvement. I thought that I made that clear, but maybe I did not.



<P>
The role of the Commission for Health Improvement should be to provide support and encouragement, to spread good practice and generally to help NHS institutions to improve. I see it as an internal management consultancy unit in the NHS, which will help the NHS develop its structure. The Minister has outlined the case for a regulatory regime in the private sector and has made what I will describe as the clause 7 argument against any extension of the NHS management support unit to the private sector. I am sure that she will make that argument again in relation to clause 7. The purpose of the Commission for Health Improvement is to help the NHS to improve, not to help the private sector to improve. The private sector recognises that it must take responsibility for its own improvement and for striving to reach the standards that have been set for it.



<P>
The Minister has not addressed the argument that I and other hon Members have put forward during this morning's debate. In addition to an internal management support unit, in the form of the Commission for Health Improvement, seeking to drive up standards, to reorganise and to spread best practice, there is an argument for having a separate regulatory body, which should not be involved in helping management to achieve targets. There are two quite separate functions: setting and monitoring the achievement of targets--that is the watcher's role--and supporting organisations and institutions in trying to improve themselves and to reach those targets. I put it to the Committee that a body charged with improving the structure, management and efficiency of the NHS will be a very worthy body, but it will be incapable of being an impartial and independent regulator of that which it seeks to improve. My argument, which the Minister has not addressed, is that there is a case for the independent, regulatory role that she described in relation to the independent sector being extended across all sectors. Giving that role to the National Care Standards Commission will have the additional advantage of extending it across the acute and care home sector.



<P>
I was hoping to make it clear to the Minister before lunch, when I sought to intervene, that we are trying to probe whether the Government accept the principle that the way forward for the future must be towards a regulated system, and that a managed system alone cannot deliver the quality that we are seeking, both in the NHS and in the independent sector. I would no more suggest beefing up the management of the independent sector as a substitute for a proper regulatory regime of the independent sector than I would suggest that for the NHS. Whether it is provided by the National Care Standards Commission or by another body, the idea of introducing a unified, light-touch regulatory regime that sets and monitors the framework in both acute and non-acute and private and public sectors is very attractive. That will ensure that the seamless transfer of patients between public and private sectors, and between acute and non-acute units within those sectors, can occur with complete safety and reassurance for patients. That has nothing to do with the separate argument about the merits of using the Commission for Health Improvement to ginger up individual NHS units so that they meet their targets. The argument for a single and unified system of regulation stands.



<P>
I was not expecting the Minister to accept my amendments, but I had hoped to hear that the Government, in their evolving thinking about the health service and in line with some of the announcements that have been made in the past few months, were beginning to see the way forward other than in terms of a solely managed service. I had hoped that the Government would be willing to envisage a future in which the Secretary of State had a more hands-off role, and in which he facilitated the establishment of a regulatory mechanism over the whole health care delivery system and took a lesser role in the actual management of the NHS. In that way, individual units in the service, assisted by the Commission for Health Improvement, would be able to respond to the challenges set for them, and patients using any part of the overall health care delivery system would be safe in the knowledge that there was a uniform, functional regulatory system overseen by the Secretary of State in his primary role of ensuring the safety of all patients in this country, in whichever sector they are treated. In that way, all patients could be confident that their treatment was under a properly regulated regime. That seems to be an attractive model for the future. I am not minded to withdraw the amendment unless I receive some indication from the Minister that she at least agrees with the direction of my thinking. I accept that the amendments might not be perfectly drafted and that there might be better ways of achieving my objective, but I should like to hear that the Government are sympathetic to the general approach outlined in the amendments.



<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight) rose--



<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): I shall leave the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) to make his own point.



<P>
I share the bewildermnent of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) and endorse everything that he said. After a very positive start this morning, I was frankly amazed by the Minister's speech. I was looking for answers to the narrow point of how one can make a regulatory system function across what is an increasingly fluid divide between the public and private sectors if that system operates in only one sector. Just before lunch, the Minister said something that I did not properly hear about how my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and I were taking opposite positions, but my point is exactly the same as that of my hon. Friend. Quite apart from the issue of internal NHS management, whatever framework we adopt should be unified. In her final remarks, will the Minister specifically address the question of how a regulatory framework will be effective in the sorts of cases that I outlined this morning if it can look at only half the picture? If bent or apparently bent consultants, who span the public and private sectors, are under investigation, how can the situation be dealt with effectively if there is one framework for one sector and another framework for the other?

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I share the disappointment with the ministerial reply. I had hoped to hear a better justification for treating the private sector differently from the NHS. As a clinician, I cannot see any difference between the medical intervention that is carried out in the private sector and that which is carried out in the NHS, as long as they are both of good quality. Clinical governance and outcomes are just as important in the private sector as they are in the NHS. Indeed, one hopes that much of the work done by the Commission for Health Improvement will benefit both sectors. That is why I am confused about the need for a dual-track approach.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Did the hon. Gentleman hear the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) tell the Minister, the hon Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) during Health questions in the House that she would not accept a move from an NHS hospital to a private sector unit unless she was sure that it was of the same standard as the NHS hospital? The hon. Member for Barrow and Furness replied, "Neither would we." Does not that imply the need for a unified regulatory structure for both sectors?



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That is a valid point. I did hear that, and one could ask the same question from a different political perspective. It depends on which side one favours. I favour neither.



<P>
The private sector can have its own standards for wine lists or whether lace doilies should be put under tea cups and colour television provided. Those are distinctly private sector matters, although I should quite like them in the NHS if we could afford them. However, clinical management of patients requires a common standard and I do not understand why the ministerial team has dug itself in on questions such as the Commission for Health Improvement, arguing that it is a specific NHS issue.



<P>
Many NHS patients are treated in the private sector. Will they, coming under the remit of CHI, be treated differently from a patient in the private sector who funds himself or is funded by an insurance company? That would create a bureaucratic nightmare for the NHS, which will have to track its patients through the system, and for the private sector. The latter could have to deal with three regulatory set-ups--one relating to insurance companies, which may operate their own system, one relating to clinical governance and complaints in the private sector and one for NHS-funded patients. That cannot make for efficiency or good clinical care.



<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>



<P>
I am sorry that the Minister has not given us more comfort in her speech. I await her further contribution, but if the ministerial team does not move any further on the issue, I shall have no option but to support the amendments, even though they will not deal with our concerns. Perhaps we can return to the matter on Report.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> May I take us back to the amendment, which was a clear attempt to bring NHS hospitals within the regulatory scope of the National Care Standards Commission? That is inappropriate. Two years ago, would the Government have thought it necessary to introduce a Bill to regulate national health service hospitals? We felt that we needed a continued drive for quality, continued benchmarking and a system that worked with professional regulations--hence the establishment of CHI. However, that left an anomaly, inherited from the previous Government, of hospitals in the independent sector that were classified as nursing homes and were not properly regulated. Bringing those hospitals, which until then had been outside the loop, into a regulatory structure made sense, taking into account all the pieces of the jigsaw.



<P>
It still seems appropriate to us to make a distinction between a managed service, from which we are not moving away, and the private sector, which, despite its different names and structures, still needs to be regulated. There is an interface between social and health care in many parts of the private sector. Giving the National Care Standards Commission the overall remit, with a special section for the hospital, was the best way forward. The amendment, which would bring all NHS hospitals into the remit, is not appropriate. It would not add to what is already being done in the NHS under CHI. Without the clause, acute hospitals in the independent sector would not be regulated.



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The Minister said that the independent sector must be brought within the loop. I could not agree more. I have pressed for that for three years. However, that is not being done. A separate loop is being created.I am not sure whether it circles around the NHS, is in the NHS or is in an outer galaxy that does not interact with the NHS.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> One interesting aspect is that the vast majority of the private sector deals with NHS patients and, for those patients, it will be subject to CHI. The purpose of new clause 23, which establishes the way in which the NCSC will work with CHI, is to ensure that they do not operate as two separate streams, but work together in the best interests of patients. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight thinks that that is illogical. Given the size of the NHS and its structure, we strongly believe that CHI is the best way to drive up NHS standards for clinical governance and its complaints procedures. I beg to differ with the hon. Gentleman: there is a difference between a regulatory function and a management function.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am afraid that my mind is more firmly made up. I concede that new clause 23 attempts to avoid duplication at a practical working level, and I imagine that one or the other body will lead in any specific case, but the Under-Secretary told us that the managed service does not require independent or overarching regulation. However, there is overwhelming evidence of failure in the NHS, which is not surprising in such a vast organisation. Failure should be tackled, first, by putting in place a proper regulatory system to ensure that minimum standards are met through registration, inspections and control, and, secondly, by providing appropriate support mechanisms to bring management up to standard.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> In that light, what does the hon. Gentleman think of CHI's special investigations into failing hospital trusts? There are systems to deal with failure in the NHS.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Of course there are; that is an example of CHI performing part of its role. But why is the Under-Secretary afraid of imposing on herself the same regulation that she is imposing on the private sector? Why would NHS hospitals, with the support of CHI, be afraid of being inspected once a year to reassure patients that they are complying with the basics? Her refusal to accept that point of principle leads me to suspect that I was wrong when I said that all NHS hospitals would pass with flying colours the regulatory requirements that are to be imposed on the private sector.



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Is there not a parallel between the time when local authority-run residential homes were not inspected and the lack of inspection of private sector homes? Have we not learned from reports of the past few years, starting with Utting, that that system did not work? I am glad that the Government are addressing the issue by establishing a common structure for public and private sector residential homes. There is no logic in maintaining two loops for health care.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, which returns us to the starting point of the debate. The Government are caught by their own logic. The Under-Secretary's comments reflect a collective--this is not personal--arrogance that a managed system does not require inspection. The attitude seems to be "We are managing it, so why should it need to be inspected. We are infallible." That is surely not what the Under-Secretary means. I cannot envisage any other field of human endeavour in which those in charge--in this case they manage a service that literally has the power of life and death over those who use it--would argue that because they manage it, there is no reason for anyone to inspect it. British Airways does not assert that because it properly manages its business there is no need for the Civil Aviation Authority to inspect what it does. Train operators do not assert that because they are implementing better management systems, they do not need the regulatory regimes that the Government are putting in place to oversee their operations. That is an indefensible line to take. I wish the hon. Lady had acknowledged that proper regulation as well as proper management requires the separation of those two functions.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I would be interested to know how the hon. Gentleman would describe the reviews of hospitals conducted over a 24-week period, published reports and action plans and reviews that cover clinical audits, risk management and work force issues, including appraisal, patient experience, information, education, research and effectiveness. That is the rolling process--in a different time system given the size of the NHS--that the Commission for Health Improvement is implementing. We have put in place a mechanism for a continuous review and improvement of standards, assessment, benchmarking and quality assessment. The previous Government did not begin to address those issues. They thought that the market and competition would produce a better service and that it would happen naturally, but it did not. Instead, the result was huge differences in the performance of the trusts. We are addressing the issues through the Commission for Health Improvement.



<P>
It is disingenuous to interpret what I have said about the role of the managed system and the Commission for Health Improvement for the NHS and the necessity to regulate effectively the independent sector as an expression of arrogance or self satisfaction--far from it. The Government have acted to drive up quality across the NHS. As regards the two different structures, it is a question of horses for courses and what is appropriate for the two different sectors. They will work together to avoid duplication. I would like to know the value of what the hon. Gentleman proposes.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> May I gently remind the Committee that interventions are interventions and not speeches.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for her intervention. However, the hon. Lady's remarks are disingenuous because she misrepresents the Commission for Health Improvement's role. The Commission will conduct reviews and produce reports, but it does not have the power to impose sanctions. Unfortunately, I cannot locate the paper from which I was going to quote, however, it has been made clear that the result of a Commission for Health Improvement review or investigation will be a report to the appropriate authorities--be they Ministers or hospital authorities. In other words, the Commission will report back to the manager about whom we are talking.



<P>
The Commission for Health Improvement--and I am ready to be corrected--will not have the power to shut down or threaten to shut down a hospital or unit that fails to meet minimum standards. That is the critical distinction between a regulated system and the role of an Organisation such as the Commission for Health Improvement within a managed system. I am not denigrating or disparaging the role of the Commission for Health Improvement. It will provide important support within the NHS, but it is not an independent regulatory regime, which, in the last instance, if necessary, can shut down an operation, as the National Care Standards Commission will, where necessary, in the private sector. Until the Government address the distinction between the managerial and the regulatory roles, little improvement will be made in the overall performance of the NHS, given its size and complexity.



<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Before she winds up, will the Under-Secretary state how cases such as Dr. Ledwood's will be dealt with by a fragmented regulatory system? Will she do so during debate on new clause 23?



<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> This is an issue of professional regulation. Consultants who are no longer allowed to operate in the NHS system have sometimes been allowed by a loophole to operate in the private sector. That loophole is being closed. The information system that enables communication between the private sector and the NHS on unsatisfactory clinicians is being strengthened. More to the point, individual hospital managers in the private sector will be made responsible as executives and will no longer work with systems based on giving rights of audience. Together with our actions on professional regulation, this strengthening of the system is an important change. The case to which the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) referred involved the failure of professional regulation rather than a loophole between the private and independent sectors.



<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for giving way once again. There are other examples. Let us consider somebody who is operating within the NHS and the private sector, which happened in the Ledwood case. Such a person could send NHS patients off to private doctors for after treatment in a series of different places in order to cover up his mistakes. Surely a single regulatory body is more likely to pick up the trail of such a person than separate bodies that do not deal with private organisations and the NHS together.



<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that the Under-Secretary had given way, but I was under the impression that she had concluded her remarks. Does she want to respond?



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I shall do so simply to try to reassure the hon. Gentleman that clinical governance will have a significant place in identifying practices such as those that he described, as it will provide a performance benchmark. Clinical governance and professional regulation is the true way forward.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry to try your patience, Mr. Gale, by intervening again. We are about to press amendment No. 83 to a Division, but the Under-Secretary did not address the less dramatic and controversial--but none the less important--issues raised by amendments Nos. 90 to 93. Some clarification was sought on those amendments in relation to the limitations on the definitions of independent clinics and independent medical agencies. Will the Under-Secretary deal with those points?



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> In accordance with the arguments that we have advanced, we do not feel that the amendments would add anything to the regulation set out in the Bill. We believe that they are unnecessary and inappropriate.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Under-Secretary clarify a specific point? Can an independent call-out service take itself out of the Bill's scope simply by taking on out-of-hours service for one general practitioner" If that is not the case, will the Under-Secretary explain why? If it is the case, how would a private service provider who works for one NHS general practitioner be regulated or controlled in other work?



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> As I understand it, the service provider would be brought into the remit of NHS controls.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That statement is reassuring, if it is correct and if it relates to the whole activity of the agency in question, in both the NHS and the private sector. That is not my understanding, but I accept the Under Secretary's assurance. Perhaps we could pursue the issue in more detail outside the Committee.

</FONT><B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 2, line 25, at end insert



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'operated with the intention of providing overnight accommodation for patients'.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to draw out the distinction between a hospital and a clinic and to obtain a more precise definition of the difference between them. I started with the simplistic idea--which is possibly not the best distinction--that patients stay overnight in hospitals but not in clinics. Amendment No. 89 defines a clinic as an establishment that provides the services listed in clause 2. I recognise that the amendment is a crude way to extract information, but it probes the essential distinction between a hospital and a clinic. What will be the differences in the regulatory regimes that will be imposed on those establishments? On what side of the line will they fall? In clarifying what will be a hospital and what will be clinic, it would help the Committee if the Under-Secretary refers to familiar, existing establishments.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> It would be useful to address the issues directly. Clause 2 relates to a diverse range of hospitals and other establishments that provide the services listed in subsection (7) and which will be covered by the definition of an independent hospital. The services include cosmetic surgery, medical treatment under anaesthesia or sedation, dental treatment under general anaesthetic, obstetric services and termination of pregnancy. The intention is to regulate those establishments as independent hospitals. The National Care Standards Commission will do that by referring to specific regulations and standards that will be developed to reflect the special nature of individual health care services. The services are the determining factor, not whether a patient stays overnight.



<P>
The amendment would tamper with the balance. It would take day hospitals and other establishments that do not provide overnight accommodation out of the definition of independent hospitals. Establishments that do not include services provided by medical practitioners would not be subject to any form of regulation. That is not acceptable. It is our intention to improve the safety of care that is provided to the public.



<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has slightly confused me. I took his amendment at face value. It would contribute nothing to the Bill. However, I shall be happy to take up any specific points that he might like to make.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, but I must throw the ball back into her court. There is no apparent reason to distinguish between a hospital and a clinic unless each regulatory regime is to be fundamentally different. I was hoping that she would enlighten us on that.



<P>
I suspect that we shall return to this issue when we consider the scope of services provided by hospitals and clinics. I am interested in the differences between the regulatory regimes for clinics and hospitals. If the Under-Secretary cannot clarify that, it might be best for me to withdraw the amendment so that we can address what makes a hospital and what makes a clinic when we debate subsequent amendments.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> It may be useful to explain that hospitals will be establishments that operate in the general acute sector or provide services such as abortions. The services that we are trying to regulate in independent clinics will include doctors who work from private rooms or private walk-in medical centres, like the one in Euston station.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Would not the Bill make the practice of a dental surgeon who delivers services under general anaesthesia a hospital? In that context, when do the Government expect to remove general anaesthesia from the list of services that can be reimbursed under the general dental services regime?



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I would certainly prefer to write to the hon. Gentleman on that.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It is clear that there is no fundamental difference. We are simply trying to explore the boundaries and functionality of the Bill. As we shall discuss this issue later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.



<P>
Amendinent, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 2, line 27. after 'illness' insert 'or palliative care'.



<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 42.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> The amendment clarifies the distinction between establishments whose whole or main purpose is to provide palliative care, which are generally described as hospices, and care homes that provide an element of care for terminally ill residents as part of their overall services. Clause 2 as drafted brings within the definition of independent hospital all establishments that provide any of the listed services in clause 2(7), which include palliative care. That would bring care homes that provide care to terminally ill residents within the definition of independent hospital. That is not our intention.



<P>
The amendment will ensure that only those establishments whose whole or main purpose is to provide palliative care will be required to register as independent hospitals. We shall take account of the specialist nature of palliative care when we develop the regulations and national minimum standards for such establishments. Care homes that provide care for terminally ill residents will have the nature of that care recognised and receive a certificate of registration. They will be expected to comply with the standards that we set.



<P>
The amendment is not contentious. It will ensure that establishments that specialise in providing palliative care will be regarded and registered as such. They will be distinct from care homes that provide care for terminally ill residents as part of their overall services.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I think that the Minister has told us that the definition of a hospital will include a sub-set for a hospice. As it would not be appropriate to regulate a hospital that primarily provides palliative care as a care home, it appears that it is necessary for the overall definition of hospital to include an almost separate definition to cover hospices. I have not had a chance to check that logic, but I hope that the Bill's structure will be robust enough to allow for that distinction so that hospices are not burdened with a regime that is more appropriate for an acute independent hospital. I will take the Under-Secretary at face value on that. I am sure the hon. Lady would be the last person to want to place excessive burdens on hospices.



<P>
Is the Under-Secretary at all concerned that we are introducing a definition of hospital for the independent sector that is different from the definition of hospital in the National Health Service Act 1977, which does not include palliative care? Does the Under-Secretary think there will be any ramifications as a result of that? That is my only other question in relation to the amendments.



<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I am not convinced that we are introducing a new definition. We are recognising the fact that some establishments--the hospices--provide an element of medical care and therefore should be registered as hospitals. In the consultation process with the sector, we recognised the diversity of the services provided. The commission will be responsive to the different natures of the hospitals that will be subject to inspection. The definition reflects that. We did not want unnecessarily to burden those establishments that provide only care with hospital regulation.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am not sure that I followed the last remark. The Under-Secretary said she did not want unnecessarily to burden those establishments that only provide care with hospital regulation, but she has changed their status from care homes to hospitals. She also said that she was not convinced that the Bill changes the definition from that in the NHS Act. That Act states,



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"hospital" means--



<P>
(a) any institution for the reception and treatment of persons suffering from illness,



<P>
(b) any maternity home, and



<P>
(c) any institution for the reception and treatment of persons during convalescences of persons requiring medical rehabilitation.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
We are introducing a new definition. Perhaps the new definition is the correct one. The purpose of my question is to find out whether the Under-Secretary and her advisors have considered whether the definition in the NHS Act should be amended in the appropriate schedules to the Bill. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will consider that point.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I am extremely happy to take up the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, because it is in nobody's interests to have to a Bill that is inconsistent with itself.



<P>
Amendment agreed to.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 2, line 31, leave out 'liable to be'.



<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 108, in page 4, line 26, leave out from first 'hospital' to 'an' in line 28.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The amendment probes the grammatical construction of the Bill as much as anything else to discover whether a more substantive issue underlies it. The amendment would remove the words "liable to be" from line 31 on page 2. At present the clause reads,



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other establishment in which treatment or nursing (or both) are provided for persons liable to be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
I do not understand the term "liable to be detained". Without wishing to make light of the issue, I suspect that we are all liable to be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 in the sense that none of us is exempt from its provisions. Perhaps the Bill means any establishment in which treatment or nursing are provided for persons detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. That would be something quite different. Or does it mean treatment or nursing--or both--provided for persons not currently detained under the Mental Health Act, but of a type that makes them likely to be detained under it? The last interpretation would present enormous difficulties of definition. Who will decide which people are potentially liable to be detained under the Act? Other interpretations are possible. Will the Under-Secretary explain what precisely the words "liable to be" add to the clause?



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Will the establishments include police stations, which might act as a place of safety to which people with disturbed behaviour can be taken simply to be assessed and treated by police surgeons? Such people might be liable to detention under the Mental Health Act. The same argument might apply to the prison services and to remand prisons. If that is the case, I welcome it, as I do not think that those are the best places to submit to detention people who have mental health problems, as opposed to those who have engaged in criminal behaviour.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I am happy to explain why I cannot accept the amendment. Subsections (3)(b) and (6) of the clause make a useful distinction between types of establishment. Establishments covered by subsection (3)(b) will be permitted to admit patients for detention and treatment under the Mental Health Act 1983. They are the detaining authority in such cases. During the course of this treatment, patients under detention may be granted legal absence under section 17 of the Mental Health Act, but they remain liable for detention. They may reside in other locations, including their own homes or establishments, that do not need to be specially registered. The amendment would obscure that useful distinction.



<P>
I ask the Committee also to reject amendment No. 108. It is important for hospitals that admit patients for detention under the 1983 Act to be separately registered, because they must comply not only with the Bill, but with the 1983 Act if they are to admit such patients. It is an offence for a hospital that is not registered to provide treatment to persons liable for detention under the 1983 Act to take such patients. The phrase "liable to be detained" determines the legal status for someone for  whom an application for admission under the 1983 Act has been made and accepted. Such a person may be detained or may remain liable for detention. Without that separate provision, any registered hospital could take such patients. A hospital that takes both sorts should be registered for both. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge on why the amendments are unnecessary.



<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight spoke about police stations. They are places of safety, but they are not establishments where nursing care or treatment are provided, so they are not covered by the provision.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for clearing up that matter. There is obviously a sound technical reason why the Bill must remain as it has been drafted and amendment No. 108 should be rejected.



<P>
I am not entirely sure, however, about her argument on amendment No. 86. I think that she said that the term "liable to be detained" had a specific meaning, which ensured that the clause dealt with the accommodation of someone who was liable to be detained but was not actually detained. She referred to subsection (6), which relates to a person who is absent in pursuance of section 17 of the Mental Health Act and who might be resident at his home, the hospital or another place. I shall ask a further question about that later. If I understood her correctly, the Under-Secretary suggested that the inclusion of the words "liable to be detained" in subsection (3)(b) was necessary to facilitate that procedure. However, it seems to me that subsection (3)(b) provides any institution housing a person liable to be detained under the Mental Health Act--that person could be the one whom the Minister has used as an example, and be absent in pursuance of leave granted under section 17 of the Act--would, by definition, be a hospital. That does not seem appropriate. The definition contained in the clause is clear. It states:



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A hospital which is not a health service hospital is an independent hospital.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
It goes on to state that the word "hospital" means, inter alia,



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other establishment in which treatment or nursing (or both) are provided for persons liable to be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
Would that include a hostel or halfway house? Would it automatically be defined as a hospital?

<B>Ms Stuart:</B> Neither my officials nor I agree with the hon. Gentleman's reading of the interaction between the two provisions.



<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> persons under section liable to be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983?<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
 As a non-lawyer I interpreted the paragraph in the same way as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. The provision may cause concern.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> The best way forward would be for the lawyers to re-examine the provision carefully to ensure that those concerns are not justified.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.



<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 2, line 33, leave out 'of a prescribed kind'.



<P>
The amendment is simple and deals with what will be a recurrent theme in the Bill. It would remove the words "of a prescribed kind" from subsection (4), which would then state:



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Independent clinic" means an establishment . . . in which services are provided by medical practitioners.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
If we are to be able to scrutinise the Bill we must nail bits of wood over some of the holes left in the structure. The terms "of a prescribed kind" and references elsewhere to prescribed techniques or technologies make the words on the paper meaningless. It is difficult to interpret how the Government envisage using the wide discretion that they would be given. What types of establishment does the Government propose to 'be and why is it not possible for the Bill to prescribe them? The term "independent clinic" would then be defined properly, rather than simply as whatever the Secretary of State says it shall be, if I may paraphrase the subsection. I do not find that helpful or conducive to proper scrutiny.



<P>
Assuming that the Minister will resist the amendment, would a prescription in this context be made by regulations, and therefore be subject to parliamentary scrutiny? May we have assurances from the Government that we shall have a proper opportunity for separate scrutiny of regulations under the Bill? We want to avoid the presentation to the House of a vast omnibus statutory instrument, including regulations under dozens of clauses, with a maximum of one and half hour's debate in Delegated Legislation Standing Committee. That would be a travesty of scrutiny. What we are doing here today is only half or a quarter of our job, because until we know what type of establishments will be prescribed we cannot say anything very intelligent or useful about the Govemment's proposed definition of an independent clinic.



<P>
What are the Government's intentions? I do not believe that the Bill has reached its present stage without Ministers having a clear map in their minds of the finished structure, including the secondary legislation that will follow. It is painful that we must labour half in the dark and deal with Ministers who have half of the equation in their desk drawers, but are not prepared to  reveal it to the Committee. That demeans Parliament and reduces our ability to fulfil our role as Members of Parliament.



<P>
5.30 pm



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I cannot support the amendment. However. I do support the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge on the question of regulations and the process by which they will be laid. It would be a matter of concern if the Bill became too prescriptive and fixed in time. Some items under subsection (7) may be out of date by the time that the legislation is passed. No definition is made of cosmetic surgery. Is it only surgery under a general anaesthetic? Does it include surgery using adhesives? All kinds of clever procedures are now carried out, some of which may be extremely invasive while others are relatively minor. The same applies to dentistry. As local anaesthetic techniques improve, the measure of what constitutes major dental surgery is not the form of anaesthesia, but the procedure itself. The Government are right to take the power to alter the prescriptive list by regulation. However, I endorse what has already been said; it is important that the regulations be scrutinised.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> The amendment seeks to remove the power in clause 2 for regulations to be made to prescribe the type of establishments to be included in the definition of "independent clinic". Therefore, the amendment would restrict the ability of the National Care Standards Commission to move with the times and to respond effectively to changes in the provision of independent health care. I will give just one example of a type of establishment that has emerged recently; the private walk-in medical centres. The Government need the power in order to move with the times.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Accepting the amendment does not mean that the definition will not cover private walk-in medical centres, as the definition would imply an establishment in which services are provided by medical practitioners.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I was simply using that as an example of the ways in which medical delivery has changed. I would not pretend that I can predict the future. There may be developments that we cannot foresee. It is important that the Bill is flexible and that we do not end up in the same situation as under the 1984 Act, where something is enshrined in primary legislation, which means that we are unable to respond to changing services and needs.



<P>
The National Care Standards Commission is not a short-term project. It is being introduced to take the regulation of care homes and independent health care into the 21st century. The commission needs to be able to reflect changes in the provision of health care in the future. We must ensure that any future development, which we cannot envisage now, can be brought within the commission's regulatory remit as and when appropriate. I acknowledge that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight made a powerful point on the issue.



<P>
Clause 2(4) provides the flexibility necessary to deal with changes. In answer to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the power to prescribe by regulations, the type of establishment that comes within the definition of an "independent clinic" is needed. We are ensuring that adjustments can be made to the commission's regulatory scope. The amendment would remove that power and flexibility and make the commission a less effective body.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The purpose of the amendment was to probe the Under-Secretary over the Government's intentions on the power. Can the hon. Lady give the Committee an assurance on the proper scrutiny of the regulations when they are introduced? Can she give us an undertaking that the regulations for clause 2 will not be merged with other regulations, thereby preventing any proper scrutiny?



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> The hon. Gentleman is more familiar than I am with parliamentary procedures and one Minister cannot give a commitment about what another Minister will do. We have consulted carefully with stakeholders and providers, and regulations will be introduced. For the reasons that I have outlined, the amendment would be too restrictive and would not help the work of the commission, so I ask the Committee to reject it.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept that there is a need for flexibility in legislation so that it does not become outdated too quickly. I was not expecting the Minister to accept the amendment, but I am disappointed that she has been unable to make some gesture in the direction of Parliament. She has talked about the importance of consulting stakeholders and users, but I would have been more pleased had she made some nod in the direction of the importance of the proper parliamentary scrutiny of regulations. I acknowledge the imperfection of the amendment and the need for some flexibility in the Bill, but I hope that in framing regulations under the Bill once it has become an Act, all Ministers will consider Opposition Members' desire for a reasonable opportunity to scrutinise and debate the regulations. Because such a large volume of regulations may potentially flow from the Bill, it would be nothing short of a scandal if all the regulations were lumped into one statutory instrument. If the Government were able, perhaps at the next sitting, to give some indication that they acknowledge that point and will not rush through a vast wad of regulations in one hit, that would greatly relieve some of the Opposition's concerns and allow us to be a little more relaxed about some of the issues that will be dealt with by regulation. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.



<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 88, in page 2, line 34, at end insert



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'or by practitioners of therapies held out to be alternative or complementary to conventional medicine'.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
The amendment moves us on to a completely different area. It would add to the Bill establishments where alternative or complementary therapists practise. There are different views about alternative and complementary therapy. One body of opinion believes that it makes a valuable and important contribution to the overall health care and well-being of the nation. Another body of opinion believes that it is a perfectly harmless but not very useful activity that people can spend their money on if they like. A third body of opinion believes that it is dangerous quackery and should be suppressed. It is not my purpose to argue in favour of any one of those positions but, from consultation outside, it seems to me that the Bill was widely expected to place some controls on the practice of alternative and complementary therapy, not least because, in the very nature of their mode of delivery, they mimic medical practices to some extent. In some cases, vulnerable members of the public can be and are misled by the offerings of people who are not medically qualified but who offer "treatment".



<P>
There are two issues. First, I am concerned about the possibility of misleading diagnoses being provided by people who are not properly qualified and the wrong treatment being administered by people who are either completely unqualified or under-qualified. There are obvious dangers in allowing people to believe that their problems are being dealt with when they are not. Secondly, I am concerned about the medium of delivery of the service. I became concerned about that because of a constituency case, which was brought to my attention by a lady constituent who had suffered at the hands of a reflexologist what she claimed to be serious and worrying abuse. It occurred to me when I dealt with the case that such services often involve intimate contact with patients and are delivered on a one-to-one basis in an enclosed and private environment and therefore involve obvious scope for abuse by unregulated practitioners.



<P>
That is precisely the sort of issue that the principles of the Bill are intended to address. Have Ministers given any thought to how better protection--it will never be perfect--can be provided to people who turn to alternative or complementary therapists? Have they thought about how the bad practitioners might be weeded out and, by implication, how protection can be given to the overwhelming majority of good practitioners, who are diligent and correct in their work?



<P>
I try not to get into the habit of reading out briefings from external bodies. However, I should like to draw to the Committee's attention points made about the issue by the BMA. It states that



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is unfortunate that the Bill regulates premises only when a medical practitioner is involved.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
It notes that medical practitioners are already "heavily regulated", while non-medical practitioners, such as people who practise acupuncture and complementary therapies, as well as those who practise body-piercing--which might not be regarded as a therapy, but which is an invasive procedure with significant potential for delivering harm to the patient--are unregulated. It refers to tattooing, laser treatment and the delivery of herbal remedies, a practice that does not so obviously suggest itself. There is a need to ensure that such treatments, which are invasive and can involve intimate contact, are delivered in properly regulated environments and that proper standards of hygiene and care and proper patient records and traceability are maintained. The people who turn to such services, which are similar in some respects to medical care, should expect the Government to seek to create a regulatory framework that embraces people who offer them. The essential point is that the nature of the service provided and not the type of person who is providing it should determine the extent of regulation and inspection.



<P>
I would be surprised if the Under-Secretary did not agree with the principle that I am outlining or accept that there is some dubious practice that could do with regulating. I looked in vain at the Bill for any scope that allows the Government to bring within its remit the treatments about which I am speaking. One or two outside bodies have suggested that clause 39 could be used, but it would not be effective in dealing with the provision of services that are not of a type that is routinely provided by NHS bodies. That includes tattooing and body piercing, which, I hope, are not routinely provided by the NHS. [Interruption.] If they are, I have at a stroke identified for the Under-Secretary a way of freeing up resources that can be put to better use elsewhere in the service. Clause 39 will not do the trick. I hope to hear that Ministers are considering the matter--at least in principle--and are aware of the concern that has been expressed outside the House.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am very sympathetic to the amendment, but it does not go far enough. The problem is not just with alternative treatments. Many mainstream interventions that are allied to medicine--such as psychotherapy, psychology and physiotherapy--put patients at risk. Many vulnerable people trust practitioners who make therapeutic claims. However, instead of inspecting practitioners, it might be more helpful to examine the claims of establishments that offer such services. Any establishment that offers a therapeutic answer to a vulnerable person's miserable life should be able to substantiate that claim. Such claims are not the sole prerogative of the medical profession, which often fails in that role. The failure of traditional medicine to provide the cures that people seek creates a dependence that requires protection. That is why we need the amendment.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I fully agree with the sentiment expressed by the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Isle of Wight. Some therapies that were regarded as outlandish a few years ago are now accepted. For example, 25 to 30 years ago, acupuncture was thought to be on the fringe. It is now much more mainstream.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Just for the record, that would depend what part of the world the Under-Secretary was in. I assure her that 2,000 years ago, China did not regard acupuncture as being on the fringe.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> When I first had acupuncture, it was regarded not as outlandish, but as the appropriate treatment for an injured elbow. That was in Beijing in the early 1980s. But we are discussing regulating the NHS.



<P>
The independent health care services that are to be regulated by the National Care Standards Commission were determined after taking account of a last year's wide-ranging consultation exercise. As a result, the independent health care services in the Bill are those that merit statutory regulation. Given that starting point, the approach is proper and balanced. It takes account of the risk presented by particular services. We believe it to be proportional.



<P>
Complementary and alternative medicine is by its nature not clearly defined. I would have been surprised if anyone had known what reflexology was 10 year ago. I am not entirely sure whether it has a recognised definition now. It would not be practical or justifiable to introduce statutory regulation of such services at this time. However, rapid changes are occurring in health care provision and flexibility is needed to bring other health care services within the regulatory ambit of the commission as and when necessary. Services that were considered outlandish several years ago are now almost considered to be part of conventional health care. Clauses 2(8) and 39 contain the scope to do that.



<P>
Clause 39 does not refer to routine services. It covers services that might be provided by the NHS, and many of the more accepted treatments will fall within its scope. We regard it as a more appropriate, pragmatic and effective approach than that suggested by the amendment. We want to keep open the possibility of introducing regulation for other services, when the time is right. The Bill will allow us to do that.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am slightly reassured by what the Minister says. At least she recognises the problem. However, she said that procedures that are offered within the national health service could be regulated using the powers in clause 39. By definition, however, it will be those services that are not provided within the national health service that will give most cause for concern. They will be furthest away from recognised and acceptable treatment delivery mechanisms. The Minister should tell us whether, bearing that point in mind, she might be minded to consider sympathetically an amendment to clause 39 that might allow the scope of the Bill to be expanded at a later stage to cover the type of services about which I have spoken today-- [Interruption.]



<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate that hon. Members will need to converse with each other on  occasion, but I should be grateful if they would hold private conversations in the Corridor.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is satisfied that the provisions of clause 39 and clause 2(8)(c), which allow for modification of the definition of services, provide the flexibility that he seeks. Clause 2(8)(c) states that regulations may



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>modify the definition in subsection (7).<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
We hope that that will allow us to move forward.



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am trying to listen carefully. I thought that subsection (8)(c) referred to the situation that was described earlier. It is services provided by medical practitioners that can be varied, and I would like some reassurance that subsection (8)(c) is not restricted to the services of medical practitioners.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> Unless I am advised otherwise by lawyers who are more experienced in such matters than I, I would say that it is not restricted in that way. However, we shall consider the point, and I shall be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman.



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am grateful for that, because it would be an extraordinary catch-all clause, under which the Bill could be entirely rewritten. I am not completely happy with the reassurance given.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> The point is that we can regulate establishments that provide listed services. We can modify the list of services so that we can regulate providers of alternative therapy.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am not entirely sure that subsection (8)(c) is the appropriate route. My understanding is that it will modify the definitions in the list in subsection (7). All the services in that list are, by definition, provided in hospitals. It would not be appropriate to treat some of the services that we have discussed--tattoo parlours, for example--as hospital services.



<P>
However, the Minister has expressed an understanding and awareness of the issue, and I was reassured that the Government are considering the matter. It is more important that we bring unregulated fringe services under some form of control than that we concentrate on tightening up the nuts and bolts of the regime for already regulated areas, which is what the Bill does. However, as I accept that the Minister has expressed good intentions and as we may have the pleasure of debating this issue again in the future, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.



<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 2, line 34, at end insert

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this--



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond rose--</B><P>



<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's haste, but I must first tell the Committee that with this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 94, in page 3, line 5, at end insert--



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'() physiotherapy or rehabilitation treatment following surgery or trauma;'.<P>

<P>
No. 96, in page 3, line 12, leave out from 'using' to end and insert



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'techniques or technology prescribed in regulations.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I was trying to speed matters up a little, Mr. Gale, but I would not want to jump the gun.



<P>
Amendment No. 89 was linked to amendment No. 85, which has been withdrawn. Once the connection between a hospital and a clinic had been established, amendment No. 89 went on to define listed services that could be supplied in a clinic. As we have had that debate, I shall not go into amendment No. 89 in further detail. However, I want to say a little about amendments Nos. 94 to 96, with which it has been grouped.



<P>
I accept that the Bill gives the Government scope to bring in additional listed services at will, but it should be a principle that, where a service clearly needs to be included, we do not shelter behind the catch-all, regulation-making powers but include it in the Bill. I am interested to explore with the Minister where the intermediate care centres--the step-down hospitals for rehabilitation, particularly of frail, elderly people--will fit into the Bill. Does the Minister see them as hospitals or as nursing homes? I understand that some centres are already being set up in nursing homes for continuing post-operative care, but it may be more appropriate to regard them as hospitals, as presumably doctor supervision will be continued after the patient is moved from the NHS hospital to the private--I presume that it will be private--intermediate rehabilitation centre. To include in the list in subsection (7)



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>physiotherapy or rehabilitation treatment following surgery or trauma<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
makes it indisputably clear that those step-down intermediate facilities will be regarded as hospitals. As the Bill is drafted, physiotherapy or rehabilitation provided by anyone other than a doctor on a non-residential basis would fall outside its scope.  Is that a correct interpretation and is it the Minister's intention?



<P>
Should not professions allied to medicine operating independently outside a hospital environment be covered by the Bill? The services provided by a physiotherapist are similar to those provided by doctors and nurses and should be covered. If they are provided in a hospital, I think that they will be covered, but if they are not, they will not be. It is an anomaly that the same service, perhaps provided by the same person, can be covered in one place and not in another. The service provided by a physiotherapist who worked in a private hospital would be covered when it was provided in that private hospital, but if that same physiotherapist ran an evening sports injuries clinic in a room above a shop in the high street, which is perfectly legitimate, that would not be covered, as I understand it. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify whether that is the case and, if so, whether something needs to be done about it and whether the something is amendment No. 94.



<P>
Amendment No. 95 again extends the list, by including



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any invasive technique or procedure.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
That would include the now-famous body piercing example. But if there is a definition of what should be included in the hospital category, it is anything invasive to the human body. I accept that the drafting may not be right, but I ask the Minister to look sympathetically at those two extensions to the list.



<P>

<P>
Amendment No. 96 has a different purpose. Clause 2(7)(g) states that the list will include



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>treatment using prescribed techniques or prescribed technology.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
That makes a mockery of the concept of having a list in the first place. It is not clear, at least on my initial reading of the Bill, how those techniques or technology would be prescribed. The amendment would allow them to be prescribed only in regulations, which would provide an opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny. If the Under-Secretary says that, as the Bill is drafted, such techniques or technology can be introduced only in regulations, I should be happy to withdraw the amendment. Ministers should have sufficient flexibility to respond to a changing environment, but we do not want to make the Bill meaningless by giving too much power to Ministers to exercise at their discretion.

<P>

<B>Ms Stuart:</B> It may help Committee members if I begin by referring to clause 100, which appears on page 62 of the Bill. It states:



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"prescribed" means prescribed by regulations.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
Opposition Members discussed whether rehabilitation would be a nursing or a hospital function. Rehabilitation should be an important part of all services in the acute and long-term sectors, including care homes. If it were used as a point of definition, it would have to fall on one side or the other, which is exactly what we want to avoid. It should form part of all good social care wherever that is provided. Examining where intermediate care will fall, in terms of step down, shows that such services can be provided in hospitals and nursing homes.



<P>
The group of amendments would widen the clause's definition of independent hospitals. The Bill already contains sufficient flexibility to bring further health care services within the regulatory scope of the National Care Standards Commission, if appropriate. I hate to say it, but I am not convinced that the amendments would improve on those provisions.



<P>
Amendment No. 95 shows how the thinking that lies behind the amendments may be flawed. It would bring within the clause's definition of an independent hospital establishments in which any invasive technique or procedure is carried out. That amendment is inappropriate, because some invasive techniques or procedures--injections, for example--may not need to be undertaken in a hospital environment. It may be wholly impractical to do so because of the numbers involved.



<P>
Clause 2 distinguishes independent hospitals from independent clinics. It includes in the definition of an independent hospital any non-NHS establishment at which the services listed in clause 2(7) are provided, including cosmetic surgery and the termination of pregnancy. In contrast, clause 2(4) provides that independent clinics are establishments that are not hospitals in which services are provided by medical practitioners. The services that we envisage being regulated under that definition will be, typically, a private walk-in medical centre or consulting rooms where doctors treat private patients.



<P>
Amendment No. 89 would, confusingly, bring establishments that provide any of the services listed in clause 2(7) within the definition of both independent hospitals and independent clinics. That confusion would not help the regulation of establishments in which those services are provided.



<P>
Amendments Nos. 94 or 96 are unnecessary. The general definition of independent hospitals in clause 2(3) is drafted flexibly to allow other procedures such as physiotherapy or rehabilitation to be covered. Many procedures are carried out by hospitals, and it would be inappropriate to include them all in the definition. Amendment No. 96 would simply reword clause 2(7)(g) without changing its meaning.



<P>
I hope that I have assured members of the Committee that the amendments do not in any way enhance the definitions of independent hospitals, and I ask the Committee to reject them.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her clarification on amendment No. 96, which I should have spotted myself is redundant.



<P>
I take her point that some invasive procedures would be inappropriate in a hospital setting. By way of self-defence, I said at the outset that I saw this group of amendments as being linked with amendment No. 85. Amendments Nos. 85 and 89 would treat hospitals and clinics as the overnight accommodating and non-overnight accommodating arms of a group of establishments that would carry out a series of listed procedures. I was not suggesting, by seeking to include invasive procedures on the list, that all injections should be carried out in hospitals--although the way in which the amendments are grouped implies that I was--but that a place where injections were carried out would be a clinic, which would not provide overnight accommodation for such patients.



<P>
The Under-Secretary has dealt with the substantive part of the matters that I raised. I see just one gap in her argument, which relates to amendment No. 94. She said that she wants it to be possible to provide physiotherapy and rehabilitation services either in a care home or a hospital. I understand the logic of that. However, unfortunately, declining to include such services in the list in subsection (7) means that those that are not provided in either a hospital or a care home setting will not be regulated at all. The structure of the Bill creates a dilemma. If we either define a hospital as a place where, among other things, physiotherapy is delivered, or allow physiotherapy to be delivered in hospitals or care homes, we will fall through the middle, with the result that independent physiotherapists will not be regulated in any way.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> We shall probably address that when we discuss the next amendment.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.



<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 42, after 'medical', insert 'and nursing'.



<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 42, after 'medical' insert



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'and professions allied to medicine'.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> These are probing amendments. The fact that the Bill refers only to medical agencies and organisations makes me a little paranoid, because health care is about a much wider kind of teamwork. I cannot understand why subsection (5) mentions only independent medical agencies. If the medical side is to be regulated, the same should apply to nursing agencies and agencies that supply professions that are allied to medicine, because they can have just as much impact--for good or, occasionally, for bad--on patients that seek their services. It seems illogical that the Bill should include the doctors but not the rest of the team.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> The effect of amendment No. 1 has largely been addressed by measures already in the Bill. The amendment would require organisations or agencies that provide nurses to be regulated by the commission, but clause 4(5) contains a provision that enables the commission to regulate nurse agencies. The amendment adds nothing to that.



<P>
The amendment would also bring individual nurses within the commission's regulatory remit. I am not sure whether that was the hon. Gentlemen's intention, but we do not see that as necessary. Having consulted widely on the scope of independent healthcare to be regulated, we do not believe that the regulation of individual nurses is a pressing issue that calls for recognition in the Bill.



<P>
The quality of care provided by nurses will be addressed in the new regulatory system that we propose through the regulation of nurse agencies, care homes and independent hospitals and clinics, including the out-reach services that they provide. In addition, we have ensured that the Bill contains flexibility, through clauses 2(8) and 39, for the commission's regulatory remit to be extended in future if necessary. In our view that is the most appropriate way to ensure that the right health-care services are brought within the commission's jurisdiction at the right time and in the right way.



<P>
Amendment No. 2 is in a similar vein. It would extend the commission's remit to the professions allied to medicine--physiotherapy, chiropody and speech and occupational therapy. Our view, taking into account the responses to the consultation exercise, is that the inclusion of those services in the Bill is not a pressing issue. That is not to detract from the merit of the amendment, but simply relates to the context.



<P>
The amendments add little to the Bill and would reduce the flexibility that we have introduced in clauses 2(8) and 39 to bring other health-care services into the commission's regulatory remit if and when the time is right and in the most appropriate and effective way. For that reason, I ask the Committee not to accept the amendments.



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I hear what the Under-Secretary says, but it would have been more helpful if the Bill had described the agencies as "independent, clinical agencies" and "clinical practitioners" or had listed the full set of professions currently offering these services. Again, we are being pointed to opportunities to introduce secondary legislation, should it be required, through regulation. I find it disappointing that we are not being given the opportunity to put things right to start with.



<P>
I accept that my amendments may be a little crude, but they would create more flexibility than the existing provisions have. I should have welcomed a move towards widening the provision and a recognition that therapeutic care is wider than medical care and that the accompanying risks are wider than purely medical risks.



<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> There are provisions for the scope to be extended, which we believe is a satisfactory way forward.



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I hope that we shall hear more about that in the fullness of time. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.



<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<P>
Amendment made: No. 42, in page 3, leave out line 11.--[Ms Stuart.]



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page 3, line 13, leave out subsection (8).



<P>
I am afraid that my argument is a familiar refrain. We saw in the last but one debate how useful it can be to have a capsule regulation-making power, properly used in safe hands, but I and other Opposition Members are uncomfortable with subsections that make of the Bill an empty box. I do not expect the Under-Secretary to accept an amendment that would remove subsection (8); she has made it clear that she is not likely to be persuaded to do so. However, I plead with her, although she has said that she cannot give such an assurance now, to consult her colleagues before our next sitting, so that we can be reassured about the level of scrutiny of regulations. In the light of subsection (8), the Bill might as well state that a hospital, clinic or agency is anything that the Under-Secretary wants it to be.



<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>



<P>
Although I am sure that the Under-Secretary will use responsibly the powers that the Bill will grant, the provision effectively makes a mockery of what we are trying to achieve today. If the Government are to reserve for themselves such extraordinarily broad powers, I  cannot see the point of debating such matters in Committee and the other place. I shall be interested to hear the Under-Secretary's response.

<P>

<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I shall be very brief. We are the party that recognises that rights come with responsibilities, and the purpose of clause 2(8) is not to wield power, but to be able to respond to changing circumstances. I hope that the consultation process has shown that we intend to move matters forward. It is in no one's interests to introduce regulations that do not improve patient care, so the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to hear me ask Committee members to learn from the lessons of the Registered Homes Act 1984. It is widely recognised that, although the Act itself was not flawed, times changed and the regulatory powers did not exist to reflect that fact. Therefore, we regard clause 2(8) as a useful tool.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sure that it is very useful for the Government to have virtually unlimited power at their disposal. I remind the Under-Secretary that such provisions are to some extent double-edged swords. Although she and her colleagues may know what they intend to do with those broad powers, they have chosen not to share that information with us thus far. Moreover, a future Administration could use those powers fundamentally to change the nature of the primary legislation, and all hon. Members will agree that that would not be in the spirit of the parliamentary system. Nevertheless, the Under-Secretary has made her position clear, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.



<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

Question accordingly agreed to.

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 98, in page 3, line 21, leave out from 'following' to end of line 22 and insert 'persons--'.



<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 110, in Clause 4, page 4, line 34, leave out 'nurses'' and insert 'nurses'.



<P>
No. 123, in Clause 7, page 5, line 22, leave out 'States's' and insert 'State's'.



<P>
No. 137, in Clause 10, page 7, line 20, leave out 'of' and insert 'for'.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I hope that this group of amendments, if it can be described as such, will not warrant debate. To show Ministers that I have read the Bill, and as an advertisement--I hope--for the state education system's ability to teach grammar, I have tabled amendments Nos. 110, 123 and 137 to correct some minor drafting anomalies. They should not prove particularly controversial.



<P>
Amendment No. 98, however, is slightly more substantive. I have never, before seen the terminology and style that is used at the beginning of subsection (2).  "Subsection (1) concludes with the phrase "the following persons." It is followed by subsection (2), which begins: "They are--". That seems to be out of line with every parliamentary usage of which I am aware. We should remove the phrase, "They are--" from the clause. Subsection (2) should begin with the substance of its provisions, which start on line 23 in paragraph (a).



<P>
I live in hope that the Minister will accept at least some of the amendments. If he cannot accept any of them, I should be interested to hear him defend the Bill's grammar.



<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> I find myself once again in the rather nice situation of being Mr. Nice Guy. I am going to recommend that Committee members should agree to two amendments--we could call them the apostrophe amendments--from the group that we are considering, namely, amendments Nos. 110 and 123.



<P>
It is for Government Front Benchers occasionally to tease the Opposition for their failure to read a Bill properly. Sadly, on this occasion, I cannot do so--the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has obviously read it very carefully. He spotted errors that the many people who have been involved in the Bill's preparation for a long time failed to notice.



<P>
The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends spotted two grammatical errors in the clause. Our intention is to make the Bill as grammatically perfect as possible. I hope that Committee members agree to amendments Nos. 110 and 123.



<P>
I have carefully considered amendments Nos. 98 and 137. I cannot recommend Committee members to agree to Amendment No. 137. Clause 10(6)(b) uses the phrase



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the conviction ... was of an offence.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
The amendment would replace the word "of" with the word "for". I am advised that although the construction, "conviction for an offence" is used colloquially, the phrase, conviction of an offence" is the more accurate legal construction. In the interests of accuracy, it would be unwise to add the colloquial phrase to the Bill.



<P>
Amendment No. 98 involves a change of style rather than of syntax or grammar. There is nothing grammatically incorrect with the construction of that part of the Bill. I accept that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge does not like the way in which the Bill reads, and he may be unfamiliar with the use of the phrase "they are" at the start of a subsection. However, that is not a matter of substance, and it does not lead me to recommend that the amendment should be agreed to. The Bill is perfectly clear and there is no ambiguity about who or what is being referred to. I therefore think that the Bill's current drafting is perfectly acceptable.



<P>
I recommend Committee members to agree to amendments Nos. 110 and 123, but, for the reasons that I gave, we cannot agree to amendments Nos. 98 and 137.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for accepting amendments Nos. 110 and 123. I learned something from our discussion about amendment No. 137. I always thought that a person received a conviction for an offence, but I shall try to change my habit, although it sounds rather strange to refer to the conviction of X of speeding. I stand corrected.



<P>
On amendment No. 98, I persist in believing that it would be more elegant to delete the phrase, "They are--". That would also shorten the Bill, albeit by only one line. Anything that reduces the volume of legislation is always to be recommended. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.



<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 99, in page 3, line 25, at end insert--



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(d) persons who are mentally impaired.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
The amendment seeks to add to the definitions in clause 3, using terminology to be found in clause 100(2)(b), a definition that would make it clear that the care home definition would embrace establishments caring for people with learning disabilities. I take it that that is the intention of the Bill. It is not obvious from my reading of clause 100(2)(a) and (b) that persons who are "disabled or infirm"--the definition given in clause 3(2)(b)--would include people suffering from a mental impairment. If "disabled" were to be interpreted as including mental impairment, it would not seem logical to have a separate definition in clause 100(2)(b) for "mentally impaired". It is the purpose of the amendment to ensure that the care home definition embraces homes for people suffering from learning disabilities.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling this amendment because it allows me to make it perfectly clear that we intend care homes that provide personal and nursing care for people with a mental impairment to fall within the definition of a care home in clause 3. It would be ludicrous if that were not the case, and it is clearly our intention that it should be so.



<P>
The hon. Gentleman may be looking at the wrong part of clause 100 in his search for a definition of what is covered by clause 3. Clause 100(l) defines "illness" as including "mental disorder". That subsection goes on to define "mental disorder" as including any "arrested or incomplete development". It is, therefore, clear that services for people who are mentally impaired would be covered by the definition in clause 3.



<P>
There is one other problem, which is the second reason why I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to make things clear in my response to the amendment. Clause 3(2)(a) contains a reference to a person who is ill. Clause 100(1) refers to the term "illness". I am prepared to accept that there may be a drafting error that needs correcting. We must ensure the word "ill", is interpreted as meaning "illness" as well. That is not clear in the Bill, and it might need to be clarified.



<P>
In relation to the hon. Gentleman's substantive point, I can confirm that a care home that provides nursing and personal care to people who are mentally impaired already falls within the scope of clause 3. The amendment is, therefore, technically unnecessary, but it has been useful in highlighting a slight drafting error in the Bill, in that the terms "ill" and "illness" are not currently aligned with each other. We shall ensure that they will be.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation and I accept that in legislation, or in a contract, the fact that something is defined in a certain way ultimately settles the issue. However, I find it slightly strange--as will many people outside the House--that we have to go through a chain of definition that says that an "illness" includes a "mental disorder", and "mental disorder" includes



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> arrested or incomplete development of mind.<P>
</UL></FONT>



<P>
That seems to be far beyond the everyday definition of "illness". Although I accept that the logic of the definitional structure works and renders the amendment redundant, I hope that we shall not define "illness" as including learning disabilities all the time in health legislation. As I understand it, they are not an illness, or anything remotely resembling an illness, and need to be treated as a different kind of problem. However, I recognise that the Minister has dealt technically with the point and I beg to ask leave to withdrawn the amendment.



<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 101, in page 3, leave out line 30.



<P>
The point of the amendment is to raise our concern that, having created the level playing field that we all want, we do not find that individual establishments are removed from the category of care home, thus undoing the uniformity achieved by the Bill. The Government should confirm that the purpose of the regulation-making power is not to allow them to except a specific establishment. That would raise questions about whether public legislation really is public legislation.



<P>
We need an assurance from the Minister that the clause will not be used to exclude a specific establishment--in other words, positive discrimination in favour of a particular establishment, by removing it from the regulatory regime--or to undo what the Government have done to create a level playing field for local authority and independent care homes. It would be possible for the Government to argue albeit rather disingenuously--that they should use exception by regulation for local authority homes. I am sure that the Government do not have that in mind, but I would like to hear the Minister say that.



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I find the amendment curious. Normally, we would recognise the need for flexibility to allow for changing circumstances. Care homes will remain care homes. On what sort of occasion would the Minister need to use the power to alter by regulation? There is a care home in my constituency that was established by an Act of Parliament, and I would not want that establishment to be excluded. Apparently, it can be closed only by an Act of Parliament. Is that the sort of situation that the Minister is considering, or will there be a category of homes that may have to go?



<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I understand the purpose behind the amendment and the comments of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. I shall take the opportunity to clarify matters.



<P>
It is our intention to use the powers to regulate categories of care home, not to pick on individual owners. We will not, of course, use the power to make regulations to drive a coach and horses through the fundamental principle and ethos of the Bill; the creation of a level playing field for different providers and the ending of the various exceptions and loopholes for different categories of care home. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight gave us an example of a home that is exempted from current regulatory arrangements. The clause is designed to get us away from that complete mess.



<P>
Some places are covered by regulatory arrangements, but have been categorised wrongly. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, some hospitals have been categorised as nursing homes. We want to get away from such nonsense and from all sorts of exemptions--children's homes, small children's homes, care homes established by Act of Parliament, care homes established by royal charter--to a level playing field for which we have argued consistently and which the Opposition now support. Therefore we shall not use the regulatory power in those ways. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked me for assurances about our intentions, and I hope that he will be reassured on that count.



<P>
To some extent the argument on the amendment, although brief, has been familiar, because the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends tabled similar amendments to earlier clauses, seeking to delete any power to make regulations that would exempt certain categories of homes from the definition. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has dealt with the main argument for a regulation-making power.



<P>
To recap, the simple argument is that, first, we want our definitions to be comprehensive and, secondly, we want an end to the current mish-mash of regulations and loopholes, and the Bill achieves that. However, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has made clear, we must make sure that we do not repeat the mistakes of earlier legislation in constructing the definitions.



<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight invited me to give an illustration of when we might want to take a category of care homes out of the definition. I could answer that in two ways. I could try to concoct an illustration now, such as new-age therapeutic interventions and clinics that provide colonic irrigation--I do not particularly want to dwell on that aspect of such services--or I could refer to other service provision that may emerge, which provides a new approach or treatment but which we may not want to include in the definition of a care home for other reasons. We may think it more appropriate to regulate the latter differently.



<P>
We are trying to make the definitions comprehensible and effective, but flexible. The way to do so is not to commit ourselves now to a series of definitions that cannot predict the way in which services, and care services in particular, will develop over the next five years or even the next 18 months.



<P>
I know that the hon. Members for Isle of Wight and for Runnymede and Weybridge object to the provision, but the intention is not to subvert the normal parliamentary process by making the Bill what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge called an empty box, thereby driving a contradictory set of policies through the centre of the legislation at an unknown time in future, short-circuiting the parliamentary process. We are simply trying to ensure the flexibility to enable us to look ahead to the way in which services will develop and to make a judgment in future about whether the definitions are comprehensive enough or we need to use the regulation-making power to exempt them so that they can be more properly dealt under another provision or in future legislation. That is a sensible way to make law. I do not accept the argument of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that that is either an abuse of the parliamentary process or is putting two fingers up to the House and to hon. Members. Of course it does not do that.



<P>
I add this observation, for what it is worth. If the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge were in my place, we might have a different Bill, but it would contain the same provision that he is objecting to. He must be honest with himself and with the Committee about that. I accept that it is a familiar form of legislation and that it has downsides, some of which he has identified. However, it is a sound way to provide flexibility in a definitional part of the Bill; nor can it be argued that the definition of a care home is not clear. The clause contains both a clear set of definitions and the flexibility to ensure that it can be adapted to meet future developments. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment to a vote. There are good and solid arguments why we should leave the clause as it is.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those comments. I hope that, in the spirit of what he has said, he will acknowledge that, because of the widespread use of regulation-making powers, not only in this Bill but in much of the legislation that the Government have introduced, if Opposition Members are to do their job, they must probe the way in which the Government intend to use those powers. In practical terms, We can do that only by tabling amendments to remove the regulation-making powers, so that, in Committee, Ministers can assure hon. Members about their intentions and, in some cases, give a specific assurance that they have no intention of doing x, y or z and that that is not why they have provided for such powers.



<P>
In a climate in which much legislation depends, perhaps with good reason, on regulation-making powers, that job of the Opposition is one of the most important functions of the Standing Committee process. It enables Ministers to make clear and, to some extent, binding commitments that reassure members of the Committee and the wider audience. If we appear to be tabling many amendments that seek to remove altogether the Government's scope for manoeuvre, it is not with any real intention of doing so. We are trying to probe the Government's intentions and give the Minister the opportunity to make some commitments.



<P>
When a Bill contains powers to use regulations substantially to change a clause, there must be a temptation to laziness on the part of those who are charged with preparing it. They may think, "It does not really matter whether the list in clause 2(7) is exhaustive, because we need only get the Minister to sign a statutory instrument if we find out later that we have missed one or two things out." I am sure that the Minister is alert to that inevitable human reaction to having the power easily to correct defects after the event, and hope that he and his Department will be vigilant in ensuring that that mentality does not creep in.



<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his reassurance on the two substantive points that I raised, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.



<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I would like to make just two related points, which have been raised by several organisations, including the NHS confederation and bodies that are involved in the provision of sheltered housing.



<P>
Concerns have been expressed about the way in which the social security system interacts with the Bill's definitions in respect of the registration of care homes. There is a danger that the definition of a care home could embrace situations that it is not intended to embrace, so that people who are in receipt of housing benefit might find themselves no longer eligible for it. That applies particularly to sheltered housing provision.



<P>
It was clear from debates in the other place that the Government want to exclude ordinary sheltered housing from the definition of care homes, but want to include sheltered housing that provides additional services. Broadly speaking, that is right. The problem is that the architecture of the Bill is based on the concept of an establishment. I hope to see the construction of more sheltered housing developments that allow people to purchase from a menu of care, or have such purchases made on their behalf. That allows people to live wholly independently in a property that they own or are renting, and, as their state of physical or mental health deteriorates, enables them gradually to buy in services that are provided for them on site.



<P>
We must ensure that people in such circumstances who are living in unserviced accommodation are not inadvertently caught as residing in a registered care home because the establishment, for the purposes of the definition in the Bill, is taken to be the whole development. That will include some units where people are receiving accommodation and personal care and others where they receive accommodation only. I do not claim to be an expert on housing benefit, but that might render people ineligible for it. Will the Minister tell us, first, what work has been done to ensure that nothing in the Bill retards the development of such flexible sheltered housing schemes with a menu of options of care, and, secondly, what discussions have taken place with the Department of Social Security to ensure that the clause will have no unintended effects on housing benefit?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Before I respond to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, may I re-emphasise the points that I made in the short debate on the previous amendments? The clause provides a simple, clear and effective definition of a care home. Combined with clause 10 and the obligation to register, it will put in place a framework that will close the loopholes to which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred.



<P>
In a quiet and modest way, the clause is an important part of the Bill, and I am pleased to note that, given what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has just said, the Opposition do not object to what we are trying to achieve in this regard. He mentioned sheltered accommodation and supported housing. I know that he prepares for these debates assiduously, and he will be aware that we have made it repeatedly clear that we do not intend to regulate new types of accommodation that have not been regulated before. We want all care homes to fall within the definition of regulated and registrable services, but we do not intend to extend the requirement to register as a care home.



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand rose--</B><P>



<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I know that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight wants to intervene, and I shall give way in a moment.



<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge cited an example of sheltered and supported housing where care is provided in a person's own home as part of a network of support mechanisms that are offered by housing associations or other social housing providers. In that instance, it is clear that we are not talking about a registered care home. As a matter of common sense, where care is provided in a person's home, whatever the tenancy arrangement, the definition of a care home should not apply, so the clause will exclude such provision from the definition of a care home.



<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am following the Minister carefully. He appears to accept the current anomaly, whereby one's eligibility for housing benefit defines one's clinical condition, rather than clinical need. He must recognise that, under the various schemes that have been created, work that should be done in care homes is being carried out in ultra supportive housing schemes to circumvent benefit regulations. I urge the Minister to discuss the problem with his counterpart at the Department of Social Security, and to find a way round it. We have an opportunity to put this right, and I shall be disappointed if the Bill does not extend the controls that we desperately need for certain supported schemes.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The modest definition in the clause will address some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns in a number of ways that we have not touched on today. For example, we have yet to discuss removing the concept of boarding from the definition of a care home. At first glance, that might appear a modest redefinition, but it is important. That concept was used by some unscrupulous people to get round the care home definition by charging residents for board, in addition to other services.



<P>
As I said, we have in part addressed some of the concerns that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight raised. With regard to the requirement to register with the National Care Standards Commission, we want the new definition to be sufficiently flexible, simple and clear to ensure that those who are providing nursing and personal care are caught, and we have constructed the clause accordingly.



<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight also asked me to confirm that I have discussed the implications for housing benefit and benefit entitlement with my colleagues in the Department of Social Security. I can confirm that I have, and we are sure that there is nothing in the Bill that will give rise to unintended consequences in respect of benefit entitlement. A great deal of effort has been put into ensuring that the definition in the clause is robust, and will provide the mechanism and opportunity to deal with anyone who tries to get round the new registration requirements by some sleight of hand or device. The definition will enable us to have a strong belief that we will be able to catch them if they try to do that.



<P>
I said to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that we did not intend to regulate new types of accommodation; I hope that he is reassured about that. Therefore, nothing in the clause should lead him to conclude that the Bill will inhibit the development of new, more flexible patterns of care through different models of housing provision. We want people to receive the best and most appropriate care, and innovation and experimentation are part of that. We do not want the Bill to inhibit any new type of service provision that may emerge. We want it to provide public reassurance and confidence that, whatever the provision, it will meet a certain standard of competence and quality; that is what the Bill will do.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister once again for a clear expression of intent. To judge from what he has said, much will hinge on the definition. He has talked about living in one's own home being clearly excluded from the definition of a care home, but it is perhaps not so clear-cut a definition as it might at first sight appear. I can think of developments in my constituency where elderly people have self-contained flatlets in a facility with substantial communal elements.



<P>
The problem revolves around the fact that the applicability of the legislation is based on the concept of "an establishment", which I suspect may cause definitional problems. However, the Minister has made it clear that he does not intend the definition to embrace a sheltered or supported housing development and thus to interfere with possible eligibility for housing benefit.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> To clarify one point, the hon. Gentleman is right about our intentions, but the personal care element of the service that is being provided may be caught by other regulatory aspects of the Bill; it may also be covered by the clauses dealing with the provision of domiciliary care. Therefore, there is no suggestion that there will be no regulatory cover. It is simply that, in the hon. Gentleman's example, if someone is provided with care in their own home, that home will not meet the definition of a care home under the clause.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is exactly right: the domiciliary care provided would be regulated differently. I accept the Minister's assurance. Could he perhaps, before Report, look at the definition of some of the terms that he has used? When he reads what he has said about people living in their own home and the interface between that and the definition of an establishment in the clause, he may understand my concern that some definitional problems may arise that have not been envisaged. I 



should be grateful if he would look at that before Report, so that he can reassure the bodies outside the House that have identified this as a potential problem--substantial bodies with a keen and detailed interest in and knowledge of this sector--as I suspect that there is a grain of concern that still needs to be addressed. However, I am grateful to the Minister for making his intentions clear, so I shall not oppose the clause standing part of the Bill.

Question put and agreed to.
