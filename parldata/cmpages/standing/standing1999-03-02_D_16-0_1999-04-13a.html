<H4><center>Claim or full entitlement to certain benefits conditional on work-focused interview</center></H4>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome the Committee back and hope that everyone had a good Easter break.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I hope to assist the Committee by raising this issue. No Chairman will ever give up in advance the flexibility to decide whether to allow a clause stand part debate. However, many issues that relate to this clause cannot appropriately be probed by amendments because, once an amendment is tabled, it signals a substantive view.
<P>
The explanatory memorandum deals with the pilots for the interviews. The Government's documents on the subject reveal considerable contradictions, especially with regard to the mentally and physically ill and widows. I do not want to exclude any possibility of what we may discuss, but we should probe the reference to widows in new section 2A(2)(d). We should also deal with the issue of the terminally ill and whether work-focused interviews should be available to those in work.
<P>
I do not want to raise those matters in an amendment. Many issues can be properly explored only in a clause stand part debate. I hope that if my colleagues and I impose a self-denying ordinance and do not raise those issues when we speak to individual amendments that it will be possible to have a clause stand part debate. Even if you do not wish to comment on that, Mr. Malins, I hope that my request has been registered.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am inclined to think that we should have a clause stand part debate, subject to developments during our discussion on the amendments, to which I shall listen with great care. I shall announce my ruling in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I beg to move amendment No. 91, in page 44, line 27, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(iii) that person is neither severely disabled, nor is a carer of a disabled or elderly person, or of a child under the age of 5'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
May I also welcome you back, Mr. Malins? I hope that your Easter break was as good as mine.
<P>
The amendment would exempt categories of people who may be claiming benefits from the compulsory interview which the Government are determined to put them through. The reasons for exemption are different in each case, but there are good reasons for believing that the severely disabled, their carers and people who care for the elderly or very young children should be exempted from the clear threat of benefit removal by the Government if they do not attend the compulsory interview.
<P>
We have always said that it is important to give people every opportunity to discuss employment possibilities, if that is the route they choose to take. That would remain the case for people who are covered by the categories in the amendment. They should receive advice on job opportunities and, as we mentioned in our discussion on amendment No. 92 at the end of the last sitting, on benefit entitlement, child care and other relevant matters, but they should not be compelled to attend an interview with sanctions attached if they choose not to or are incapable of doing so.
<P>
A parliamentary answer on 18 March stated that the prime purpose of the personal adviser is to help clients explore ways in which they can overcome barriers to participation in the labour market. That is fine, in that it is consistent with the Government's espousal of work for those who can work, but they also claim to want to provide security for those who cannot work. It is important that people for whom work is an inappropriate option should be provided with security. Threatening them with the loss of benefits is the very opposite of providing them with security. For that reason, we feel that such people should be exempted.
<P>
Requiring someone who is severely disabled to attend what the Government insist will be a work-focused interview, implies a measure of doubt about that person's disability. The implication is that such a person may be lying and failing to take up work where work is a possibility. That is not the right way in which to treat such people. It is essential that the interview be seen not as a threat to allowance or benefit, but as a positive opportunity to discuss employment, benefit entitlement, issues such as child care and the entire range of help that the Government can provide. Sadly, during our deliberations on the Tuesday before Easter, the Government did not agree.
<P>
According to the Government, helping clients to explore work opportunities remains the prime purpose of the interview. Rather than spending money on helping people to overcome barriers to participation in the labour market, it would surely be better for the Government to remove those barriers. Currently, the disabled have to overcome various barriers: discrimination, prejudice and, importantly, inaccessibility. The latter can mean not only physical inaccessibility to the workplace but inaccessibility to the work itself. For example, people with a visual disability may need a computer screen that is larger than the standard size, written materials in Braille format or a large typeface.
<P>
On the Tuesday before Easter, I spoke to a lobby of disabled people about the difficulties that they face and how best to help those who wish to return to work to do so. I told them that the greatest difficulty that most disabled people face is not a lack of awareness or the opportunity to attend job interviews, but inaccessibility to the workplace or the work itself. My comments met with a roar of approval. Of course, schemes exist to help employers to remove some of those barriers, but they are insufficient and the Government must face up to the problem. At present, there remains a great shortage of suitable jobs for disabled people.
<P>
The Government are tackling the issue from a one-sided angle. They expect disabled people to be able to go out and find work even though there may be no work that is accessible to them. The Governement are failing to provide disabled people with an adequate working environment. Importantly, they have also failed to extend the compass of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to include more small businesses. Firms employing as few as two people should be brought within the scope of the Act. It is a pity that the Government restrict the scope of the Act to those firms employing 15 or more people.
<P>
The Government have said that there are about 1 million people who want to find work. However, so far, the new deal has succeeded in finding work for only about 50 disabled people, and the disabled persons tax credit is not expected to help more than about 6,000. There are therefore huge numbers of people not being properly helped by the Government's current schemes. If the Government's flagship policies are making such a tiny impression on the problem, it is inappropriate to attach a benefit sanction to the compulsory interview, as the Bill sets out to do.
<P>
For those incapacitated while in work, or while trying to find work, the traumas are especially telling. It is wrong that people who suddenly find themselves incapacitated should be forced to go through an interview at such a difficult time. They may be facing the trauma of the impossibility of finding work, when they have been used to working all their lives. They may suddenly find themselves in a position where they may never work again, and yet they are forced to undergo such an interview, with the threat that they may have nothing to live on if they do not attend. In such circumstances, where someone's mental state may be such that they have difficulty in getting themselves together at all, it is inappropriate that they should be faced with such a threat to their future livelihood. That would only exacerbate the difficulties that people face at such a time. For those reasons, we feel that disabled people should not be forced to attend an interview.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): Will the hon. Gentleman explain how he defines severely disabled, and elderly? Presumably, the term ``elderly'' refers to pensioners, but how does he devine severely disabled?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> One definition of a severely disabled person might be someone who applies for the severe disablement allowance, which is one of the benefits listed in the clause. If the Government wish to accept the amendment, but wish to provide a more exact definition of severe disablement, or if the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) would like to provide an adequate definition, I am sure that we would consider a further amendment to accommodate that definition, if necessary. At present, however, I am happy to leave the amendment as it stands.
<P>
The amendment also seeks to exempt carers from the compulsory interview.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): On a point of clarification, the amendment covers the carers of disabled or elderly persons. Does the hon. Gentleman mean full-time carers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> We must consider the extent of care. I shall come to that in a moment, and I hope that I shall be able to answer the hon. Gentleman's question then.
<P>
There are people who care for the elderly, for disabled people of working age, and for young children. It is unfortunate that people who spend a large part of their time in unpaid caring work should be faced with such a threat, not least because it implies that their caring work is not worthwhile, and that they are not playing a full part in society, or doing their duty by society while they are playing a caring role. That implication is wrong. We do not look after our carers well enough in this country, nor do we have a high enough regard for unpaid caring work. The provisoin takes us in the wrong direction, by appearing to pay even less attention to the importance of caring work in our community. The Government are trying to associate carers with the something-for-nothing culture. I do not believe that people who care for the elderly, the disabled or the very young are in any way part of that culture. The Government's thesis is that the Bill is a way of removing that culture. However, by forcing carers to attend interviews, the Government are sending them the message that they are not doing a worthwhile job, and that if they are not prepared to accept work, they are trying to get something for nothing.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna </B>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth): Does the hon. Gentleman realise that the comments that he and others have made reinforce that attitude, which is completely wrong?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am not sure how describing that attitude as being completely wrong serves to reinforce it. My argument is that the Government, who will force people to come to interviews, are effectively saying, ``Unless you have a paid job, you're not fulfilling your part in society.'' If the hon. Lady does not want to send that message, she should support the amendment, which makes it clear that carers do a valuable job.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Government's national carers' strategy recognises, for the first time, that carers play a vital role? It offers support to carers in many different ways, and it makes available substantial resources to help them to do their vital work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am happy to recognise the fact that some of the Government's efforts appear to be going in the right direction. However, the clause will counteract that good work&#151;it will reverse what the Government claim to be doing in other areas. If Labour Members want to prevent the destruction of the Government's good work, they should support the amendment. Otherwise, carers will be told that their unpaid work is not worthwhile and that they should be in paid work instead. Carers strongly object to that approach, which they believe diminishes and demeans the value of their work. If Labour Members do not want to demean carers' work, they should support the amendment. That would show that they support not the Bill's proposals, which go against what the Government profess to believe, but the good work that the Government have done to support carers.
<P>
In relation to those who care for the elderly, the disabled or young children, there are three aspects to caring work. It is unfortunate that the clause refers to the invalid care allowance. The Carers National Association quoted Department of Social Security research that showed that 77 per cent. of invalid care allowance claimants provide care for 50 hours or more a week. The Government believe that those people should attend an interview and take paid work in addition to the 50 hours unpaid work that they already do. They are saying to carers, ``The 50 hours of work that you do caring for someone does not count&#151;it is not proper work.'' The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) asked whether the amendment referred to full-time carers. We should remember that many carers do more than full-time work.
<P>
The Bill also applies to lone parents, who will be forced to attend an interview despite the fact that the Government&#151;as far as I know&#151;have not made it fully clear whether that will be in addition to the new deal interview or whether the two will be combined.
<P>
The Government's two objectives are in conflict in relation to child care. They have claimed on various occasions that they are doing a huge amount to combat child poverty and it is true that they have increased child benefit much more quickly than the previous Government. That is welcome and the right way forward. The Government have not done enough for the youngest children, but by increasing child benefit they are moving in the right direction. The policy in the Bill, however, is directly counter to that. To those looking after under-fives&#151;the pre-school children&#151;the Government are saying, ``What you are doing is not worthwhile. You must come in for a compulsory interview''. That is contrary to the Government's original claim, in relation to the new deal, that compulsion was not the issue. Lone parents looking after very young children will be compelled to attend interviews. The Government are trying to raise children out of poverty, while at the same time threatening lone parents with a reduction in benefits if they do not attend an interview. That will only result in an increase in child poverty.
<P>
Two different arms of the Government are&#151;again&#151;fighting each other and doing incompatible things. The Bill's provisions would appear to destroy some of the good work that has already been done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that for many lone parents who might not have considered work, the interview could provide enormous benefit? It might provide an opportunity to find work, which is the best way to counter poverty. Living on income support does not do children any favours. Giving parents the opportunity to have an interview, which may lead to work, is the best way to assist children to escape poverty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that people should be offered the opportunity to have an interview and to discuss work possibilities. Not one word that I have said this morning has implied otherwise. I have always said that such an opportunity is beneficial. However, I have also said that such people should not be compelled to have an interview and that their benefits should not be removed if they choose not to do so. Some parents of very young children believe that it is right and proper to be at home to look after those children in the pre-school years. Liberal Democrats believe that they should be allowed every opportunity to make that choice. The difference between the hon. Gentleman and I is that while I would give such people that choice, he says that they ought to go to work and to have an interview and, furthermore, that they can avoid the interview only if they are willing to lose their benefits and therefore throw their children into greater poverty. If the Government want to avoid appearing totally inconsistent in their aims as regards carers, they must remove the provisions in the Bill that create such a conflict.
<P>
The single gateway should have been introduced with many more safeguards. If the safeguards that we suggested in various amendments had been included in the Bill, we would have been much happier&#151;as would the claimants&#151;about the possibility of people being forced to attend an interview. The real problem with the Bill is the threat of benefit disentitlement and of throwing already poor people into greater poverty. The misplaced emphasis on work and work alone, which we debated in our previous sitting, shows the failure of the Government's policy in the Bill. They should guarantee the right to an interview, information and benefit. Claimants should be guaranteed those opportunities if they need them, but we should not force them into poverty by removing their benefit if they choose not to attend an interview.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I extend my good wishes to all Committee members and I hope that they had a pleasant Easter. For some of us it was an exciting one.
<P>
I had a firm conviction at 10.30 this morning that I would vote with the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) but, having heard him speak, I am no longer certain of that. The Government deserve criticism for much of what they are doing in the Bill for disabled people&#151;my hon. Friends and I have tabled amendments to deal with that&#151;but I am not sure that the amount of vitriol, even though it was stated politely, was entirely deserved by the Government. On the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, I do not believe for one moment that the Government intend severely disabled people to attend interviews&#151;I anticipate that the Minister will tell us that regulations will ensure that they do not have to do so&#151;nor that full-time carers of disabled or elderly people or people with children under the age of 5 will be forced to attend interviews.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury kindly told me at length the amount of time put in by carers of disabled and elderly people. His example was an accurate reflection of their enormous dedication and the long hours that they work. We all have relatives or friends who have gone through the experience, but the hon. Gentleman did not refer to part-time carers of disabled or elderly people. There is no reason why people who are providing part-time care should not go through the gateway. There are many advantages in allowing part-time carers to attend interviews.
<P>
If the interviews are to be part of moving through the single gateway, it is important that they have a purpose and a number of people will be eligible. The Government's consultation paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is no unconditional right to benefit. People have a right to expect help into work and security if they cannot. In turn they have a responsibility to take up that help.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment covers security for people who cannot work. It would be unreasonable to expect those caring for children under the age of five and severely disabled people to attend interviews. We have all had the benefit of the briefing from the Disability Benefits Consortium. It states that it is unfair, first, on principle to force those working full-time as carers to take time off to attend interviews to discuss work; secondly, to jeopardise the sole income of severely disabled people and of vulnerable dependants: Thirdly, it states that those groups have experienced practical difficulties associated with attending work-focused interviews, which the hon. Member for Newbury pointed out with great persuasion.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I raise one issue about children under the age of five. Those who attended Second Reading will recall that the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks) made an interesting speech about single parents. He pointed out that there would be no compulsion until the youngest child was 16 years old. He thought that current arrangements were wholly unrealistic and pointed out that various other ages were commonly used in continental Europe. He hoped that the Committee would debate what would be an appropriate age before the person with the care of such a child&#151;the mother or father&#151;was required to go for an interview. Will the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities, the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) give us some idea of the Government's thinking on the matter? Is he entirely satisfied with existing arrangements, or does he have some sympathy with the view of the hon. Member for Croydon, North?
<P>
In conclusion, if the Minister assures us that persons who are severely disabled, full-time carers of disabled or elderly persons, or who have children under five years of age will not be expected to attend an interview, I shall be persuaded to vote against the amendment. However, if we receive anything less than that, and despite the Liberal Democrat amendment being less than perfect, I shall urge my hon. Friends to support it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I shall be brief. I return to a subject that I was speaking about before the House rose for the Easter recess. I give notice that I shall raise the question of mental health in subsequent debates. The amendment addresses the broad principle, rather than the details raised in other amendments, such as training for staff, travel and so on.
<P>
Many of those who suffer mental illness could be advised to return to work for all sorts of reasons&#151;for their self-esteem, to help recovery and to deal with the stigma of mental illness in the workplace&#151;but others will be incapable of being interviewed and certainly incapable of taking up a job thereafter. The amendment allows me to raise that aspect of mental illness.
<P>
I want an assurance from the Minister about the promised regulations. Many who are mentally ill look physically fit. For them, the illness will be exacerbated by stress; they will worry that benefits might be lost, that they will have to meet new people or that they may have to travel. The mere receipt of official notification that they will be involved in that process could greatly set people back.
<P>
It is important for the Minister to assure us that people who are mentally ill will not be put under pressure such as the wording of the Bill implies. The wording is prescriptive. It instructs rather than requests and may cause a great deal of grief, difficulty and anxiety to people suffering from mental illness.
<P>
To ensure that people who are mentally ill do not suffer from such pressure, we must create a barrier between the mentally ill person and officialdom, perhaps in the form of his or her general practitioner, community psychiatric nurse or carer. That would ensure that, should the person be caught up in this prescriptive system, someone can advise the Employment Service that that person should not be involved. That advice should be accepted, so that the person who is desperately struggling with his or her illness, in many cases in order to get better, is not placed under that extra element of pressure, which could lead to a relapse and exacerbate his or her problem. If the Minister could give us some assurances along those lines, I should be less worried about the principle of people who are mentally ill being required to attend work-focused interviews, regardless of whether such interviews take place in homes, care centres or other locations.
<P>
I am sure that, in the most well-intentioned manner, the Government want to make it as easy as possible for people to return to work. However, the text of the Bill is such that many people who are mentally ill would find it difficult and threatening to comply. Will genuine systems be developed to help people who are mentally ill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> You, will be pleased to hear Mr. Malins, that I shall give a crisp speech by way of a question. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar made the obvious point that the Government do not intend to require severely disabled people to take part in such interviews. Why, therefore, is severe disablement allowance included among the benefits to which the clause applies? The inclusion of the allowance implies that people in receipt of it, who presumably are severely disabled, will be required to attend interviews. I am sure that that is not the Government's intention, but I should like the Minister to clarify the matter.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities (Mr. Andrew Smith):</B> The hon. Member for Newbury gave a breathtaking misrepresentation of the intentions of the single work-focused gateway. He appeared even to misunderstand the amendment, which is designed to ensure that claimants who are severely disabled, are carers or have charge of children under the age of five would not be subject to further interviews once benefit had been paid. Much of his speech seemed to be about entirely exempting such people from interview. However, I shall leave that to one side and discuss the principles that he raised.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke as though the single work-focused gateway related to work alone. He used that phrase on several occasions and kept talking about threats. It is a work-focused interview, as we discussed in our previous sitting. It is designed to provide help and advice, expecially for disabled people with specific needs, and to open access to training. I see it as a gateway&#151;a point of contact with the wider network of community support for those people. I think that he and his party ought to welcome that, not attack it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> In a sense I am delighted to hear the Minister say that, but it is exactly what an amendment that we tabled at the Committee's previous sitting&#151;an amendment that the Government threw out&#151;was about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> We are debating this amendment, not the last one, as I am sure you would be the first to remind us, Mr. Malins. Help will be available at the same time. We want to focus on work and whether it is appropriate. I underline an informed point made in that previous debate. With the exception of those for whom jobseeker's allowance is the appropriate benefit, no one will be required to take action beyond participating in the interview itself. Every claimant will have a free choice as to the steps that he or she takes towards independence, but the requirement to take part in an interview will ensure that it is an informed choice.
<P>
Most people will be interviewed at the outset of their claim and I acknowledge some points made by Opposition Members about that. For some people, that would of course be an inappropriate time to conduct an interview about work. We can all imagine circumstances, for example when a lone parent has recently had a baby, that would not be an appropriate time to talk about work. In those circumstances, the personal adviser will be able to defer the interview.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) asked a question about the mentally ill, the answer to which is in the Bill. There is a commitment to bring in regulations on page 46 under subsection (6)(b) of proposed new section 2A, where it is stated that interviews would not apply
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the designated authority determines that an interview&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) would not be of assistance to that person, or
<P>
(ii) would not be appropriate in the circumstances''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Therefore, I am able to assure her that when someone's mental illness is such that it would not be appropriate for him or her to have the interview, it can be deferred or possibly waived altogether. I resist a blanket provision that such people should not have interviews, as that rests on the misinterpretation contained in the speech of the hon. Member for Newbury as to what they will be about. They will be about work where appropriate and how people can enhance their employability, but they will also be about health. The sensitivity and professional skill with which the interviews are conducted is crucial. In later debates, we shall talk about the all-important question of the training of personal advisers on conducting the interviews.
<P>
Let us remember that what are being launched in June and November are pilots, and that the point of them is to get the process right and to ensure that the help is sensitive to the needs of those taking part in the interviews.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> One question arises from the Minister's assurances, which concerns the interviewer. I do not want to stray into a subject that will be covered by future amendments, but will the interviewers have the authority to tell the health services and social services the sort of help that should be given to people whom they interview who cannot work? Would they then instruct social and health services to provide extra facilities, or send people in appropriate directions saying, ``This is what you need and this isn't''? Who would then control the budget and decisions over the spending involved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> We are already being pretty ambitious in the scope of the single gateway and personal advisers have an important and professionally responsible job to do, as we have said. It would stretch the claims of what the single gateway could do if the Government supposed that it could take over the functions of a GP, as a gateway to the health system, or the functions of a social worker in relation to other help. Clearly, personal advisers will be able to interview people who, on grounds of mental illness or disability, have acute needs. Of course, they will be able to refer them to appropriate professional help. However, it would be a mistake to assume that personal advisers could in any sense substitute their judgment in matters in which they are clearly not professionally qualified.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am riveted. If the person in front of the adviser is not already receiving the help that he or she needs from either the health service or social services, there is nothing left for the interviewer to do other than to recommend that the person should work or enter the social security system. If I understand the Minister correctly, that is all that the interviewer can do, yet the general drift of the Government's suggestion is that the single work-focused interview is not just about work; it is, as the hon. Member for Newbury said, a much wider interview. That implies that interviewers have the right to feed into the health service or social services those who are not receiving adequate treatment. The Government are confused about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> There is no confusion at all on our part. I thought that the hon. Lady was referring to people with acute needs, especially those with mental illness. If it is apparent to the interviewers in the single work-focused gateway that people are not receiving the wider professional help and support that they need, clearly it would be appropriate to refer them to the relevant agency, whether through a GP, social worker or whoever.
<P>
Let us remember that such matters are not black and white&#151;they are matters of degree, about which sensible judgments must be made. For example, an immediate prospect of work is not realistic for some people, but with suitable support, training and appropriate courses, they might be able to work in the future. The whole point of the single gateway is to ensure that an assessment is made in the light of a person's experience, qualifications, inclinations and interests to help him or her achieve greater independence.
<P>
As I explained earlier, the clause also deals with the fact that claimants will be asked to attend subsequent work-focused interviews, triggered by certain changes in circumstances. Those interviews will take place following specified events that are likely to have a bearing on someone's propensity to take steps towards the labour market or after a set number of years of continuous benefit receipt have elapsed. That is the common-sense way to deal with repeat interviews.
<P>
I take issue with the hon. Member for Newbury, who kept using the word ``threat''. This is not a question of threatening or harassing vulnerable people; it is one of helping them and ensuring that they do not slip into a life of dependency when that can be avoided. The requirements are reasonable, and as I have explained, they will be exercised with flexibility and sensitivity.
<P>
I have already referred to the fact that lone parents with young children might need to have their interviews deferred immediately following a birth, or they might need time to arrange appropriate child care. Of course, we understand that severely disabled people might have mobility problems or other difficulties. I resist the assumption that it is inappropriate for those who face considerable barriers to attend an interview intended to explore how those barriers can be overcome.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Bill states that people must attend an interview, except in very special circumstances when they can be deferred, and that if they do not attend they are liable to lose benefit. If that is not a threat, for God's sake what is?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> It is not a threat because it is entirely reasonable to expect people to attend an interview about their circumstances at the point of entry to the benefit system and at certain times thereafter. The public find it absolutely staggering that people who access the benefits system at present receive benefit, sometimes for a considerable number of years, without ever having had an interview about their circumstances. That is absolutely incredible. Most of the public imagine that interviews already take place and would be very surprised to discover that they do not.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury seems to be wilfully looking away from the help that the interviews will make available. The ultimate test and the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, through the experience of the people involved and their feelings about the interviews, which will be up and running in June and November. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we had similar debates with him and his hon. Friends about the interviews on the new deal for young people and the mandatory nature of that programme. The new deal was a controversial issue, but when it was under way, young people said that the interviews were helpful and many of them volunteered for early interviews because they saw it as a programme that was on their side. When that happened, the whole area of contention disappeared. The real test is the help that will be available in the interviews.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I entirely agree that if the interviews prove to be so helpful that people believe that they are good for them and spread the news, encouraging others to volunteer to be interviewed before they have to do so, it will be wonderful. In that case, why is there the threat that if the people do not agree to be interviewed, their benefit will be removed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> There is a balance between rights and responsibilities. I believe that it is perfectly reasonable to expect people to turn up for interview, except in extreme circumstances when it would not be feasible for them to do so. I am sure that that is also the public's judgment on the issue.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury wants to cut out categories of people from the provision, but, the heart of our policy is to treat people as individuals, not simply as categories. One of the failings of the system is that people are treated very differently, depending on the nature of the benefit to which they have access. There is a labelling process, a categorisation process or, in some cases, a stigmatisation process. The aim of the single work-focused gateway, along with the wider reforms of the welfare state that we are introducing, is to get away from those processes, and to treat people as individuals.
<P>
The Government have done a great deal to extend extra help to carers. For example, &#163;140 million has been made available for grants to help carers to take a break. That is on top of the &#163;750 million that has already been spent on prevention and rehabilitation. The single gateway will benefit carers in a number of ways. Some may want to take on employment that they can fit round their caring responsibilities, and their personal adviser will be able to help them to do that. When caring responsibilities cease, many carers have to look for work, so it would be helpful for them to have had an interview to plan for that eventuality. Personal advisers and the single work-focused gateway can help people to keep in touch with the labour market through advice and training, and will provide people with continuous advice as they move back into work. In that way, the single gateway will help, rather than undermine the role of carers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight (Arundel and South Downs):</B> Will the Minister clarify how the proposal will work in practice? How frequently will people be required to turn up for interview? If someone turns up for one interview, and it is unsatisfactory, will he be obliged to attend others, until everything has been sorted out? It is easy to say that people must turn up for an interview, but, in reality, there may be several. How often will people on certain benefits be required to attend? Will it be every two, three, or how many years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The short answer is that it depends on the circumstances and on the individual. In the case of deferred interviews, the appropriate time to call in an individual would depend on his or her circumstances but in general it would be a period of three months or more. In the case of triggered interviews&#151;the point raised by the hon. Member for Beckenham&#151;lone parents may be called in for interview when their youngest child reaches the age of five or 11, for example, disabled people would be called in when the results of a personal capability assessment were known, carers when their caring duties commenced or ceased and others when they started or completed a training course. Those are sensitive, common-sense trigger points for an interview.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Perhaps the Minister was about to come to the point that I raised on behalf of the hon. Member for Croydon, North. The Government have made it clear that there will be no compulsion for single parents to attend an interview. The hon. Member for Croydon, North said that 16 was inappropriate in regard to the age of the youngest child. Do the Government have a view on what the appropriate age should be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. There is a requirement for lone parents to attend for interview and I have just set out the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to ask people in for a repeat interview. Except for those for whom the jobseeker's allowance is appropriate, the Bill does not require individuals to take any action over and above taking part in the interview.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> What about the second point of my question, that raised by the hon. Member for Croydon, North on the appropriate age of the youngest child?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> That point is outside the scope of the Bill, as I said. Tempted as I am to be drawn by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar into that territory, it is not part of the Bill's purpose and I would be out of order if I did so. We have not heard any convincing arguments for the amendment. The important point is that the single work-focused gateway offers people quality of opportunity to explore opportunities for work, so that they can move to greater independence, for help with benefits and for advice on child care.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury and his hon. Friends have not thoroughly thought through what is meant by the principle of mainstreaming and equality of opportunity. We should follow the fundamental principle that disabled people and other vulnerable people should, as far as possible, have the same opportunities and rights, but also the same responsibilities as everyone else in society. The amendment flies in the face of that and for that reason alone should be rejected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar has spoken extremely well on the amendment. As will have become apparent, we have agreed that I should cover the disability issues in the Bill and that he should cover the labour market and other benefit issues. Therefore, we both wish to speak on the clause, because it raises both aspects.
<P>
My hon. Friend has said that we approach the Liberal Democrat amendment with an open mind&#151;we like to think that we approach everything with an open mind and I believe that we do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> It is nice to hear that the hon. Gentleman has such an open mind. As far as a I remember, Conservative Members had such an open mind on the previous amendment that they could not make up their minds at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We had good reason for abstaining on that amendment. We might have good reason for abstaining on this one. I will explain to the hon. Member for Newbury why. Although his heart is in the right place and we sympathise with his concern for the three categories of claimant whom he is trying to protect&#151;the severely disabled, carers and carers of children under five&#151;we are not sure whether he has thought through the exact consequences of the amendment. What the Minister said carried great force. We want a regime that does not unduly discriminate or exclude the disabled, carers or mothers from facilities that might enable them to keep in touch with the labour market.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
What lies at the heart of the clause is whether work-focused interviews are a genuine product or a new Labour gimmick. In the case of disabled people, will they be a device for personal capability assessment and, as a result, arouse great suspicion on the part of claimants that the purpose of an interview is to trick them into giving an excuse for the benefit to be withdrawn? Will they be of real advantage to claimants who receive the benefit of what is genuine advice? I hope that we shall discuss that matter in the clause stand part debate where it properly belongs and which goes to the heart of what is meant by work-focused interviews.
<P>
 paul
<P>
Have the Government thought through properly the need to take account of the particular difficulties of the disabled, carers and those with small children? The next set of amendments cover the protections that are required for disabled people who attend interviews. If the advice that people receive is useful and if, as the Minister said&#151;I trust that he was sincere in saying it&#151;even those who are very badly disabled may benefit from having a chat with someone who is experienced in the field and can say whether there are certain things that they can do, although they may have given up long ago any chance of playing a useful role in life, that would be a wonderfully positive contribution to the life of those individuals. The last thing that one would want to do would be to prevent that from taking place.
<P>
Carers do not remain carers throughout their lives, and those of us who have small children know that they have a way of growing up. It may make good sense, therefore, to have interviews before the time when one can go back to part-time or full-time employment. It would be useful to consider job opportunities, training or reskilling programmes that might be relevant to one's future. All such things could work out well if the Government are sincere in making a success of work-focused interviews and want them to be regarded as being of real benefit to people who are out of work rather than a cruel hoax perpetrated on often vulnerable people for PR reasons or a Treasury trick designed to deprive of benefit those who legally and morally are entitled to it.
<P>
Those are the two questions on our minds, against which we shall evaluate future amendments and the Government's proposals. Given our discussions so far, we feel that the hon. Member for Newbury has not made his case; the three categories of individuals about whom he is rightly concerned are protected sufficiently in later amendments. In the circumstances, he will not be receiving our support for his amendment today. However, if he keeps trying, he will certainly have our support when he deserves it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister did not refer to the question that I asked him, so it will do no harm if I repeat it. I took up the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham that there should be no question of requiring people with severe disabilities to attend interviews. Why, therefore, have the Government included that in the Bill? The Minister will say&#151;in an attempt to be positive, I shall agree with him&#151;that people who are severely disabled should not be placed in a ghetto that allows them not to attend an occasional interview to talk about their lives. I have no argument with that, but the Disability Benefits Consortium made the sensible point in its briefing that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for claimants with severe disabilities the nature and severity of their condition will rule out paid employment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure we would agree on that. It goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``These are not by definition people who are unemployed and available for work, but people who are incapable of work, and have been so for at least six months. Interviews for these claimants should focus on the welfare of the individual and should encourage take-up of any additional benefits.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a fair statement. Does the Minister agree with it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> The important thing about the gateway and the reform of the welfare state is that we write no one off. It is remarkable to see what jobs people with severe disabilities are undertaking. We should not put a ceiling on people's aspirations, but the hon. Gentleman made a fair point. The balance of advice that is given is a sensitive interview, where an interview is appropriate, will need to focus more on help and training and the exploration of possibilities than on immediate work for people who face serious barriers. However, I do not want to start from the assumption that we write anyone off, because we do not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> On a narrow point, the picture of Stephen Hawking comes to mind when I think of what a person with a severe disability can achieve. It is right for the Minister to say that we should try to get as much from people as we can. That is civilised; it ensures that everyone contributes to society and understands their worth. But there needs to be a degree of realism. The Minister was shocked by the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham. Of course it will not be possible for interviewers to make assessments. They cannot second-guess clinicians, but will refer the matter on. However, we are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. The Minister must understand that we are all trying to make the proposal work.
<P>
I envisage the system working in partnership with clinicians and mental health officers to prepare someone for a work-focused interview. However, we might push into an interview people who are not ready for work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> May I develop my point first? We might duplicate what is available in the community. Plenty of organisations can offer help on benefit claims and therapeutic work to get people back into society. My concern is that we will end up with a shuttlecock between the two. If people are to go through the gateway, there should be a reasonable anticipation that they will move through it smoothly and go into protracted work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that many people in our community have no relationship whatever with the welfare services? As the hon. Member for Beckenham said, many vulnerable people have a mental illness. The work-focused interview may refer them to people who could provide them with much-needed support. Many vulnerable people who lead isolated existences will attend the work-focused interview, and a trained worker will identify a need and refer the case on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is a good point, but I have two responses to it. First, the analogy with mental illness is not a good one because, by and large, few people suffering from mental illness are completely alone. With regard to community care, considerable strides have been taken over the past few years by the previous Government&#151;to give credits where it is due&#151;by the present Government. It is right to praise Governments when they have succeeded.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Many of the mentally ill to whom the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) referred also suffer from drug and alcohol abuse. There has been a big rise in the number of workers dealing with those who live on the streets and who suffer from drug and alcohol abuse. Even people who live on the streets have connections with the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I bow to my hon. Friend's superior knowledge of that part of community care.
<P>
I have a second response to the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford. It is a mistake to regard the single gateway as a cure to all of the nation's ills. [Hon. Members: ``We do not.''] I am pleased to hear that. Will the Government's proposals extend care to all cases? Will the interview put everyone back on their feet? People should not go to an interview unless they are ready to do so. We need to be realistic in our approach to severely disabled people who have no real prospect of work. Such people were mentioned in the excellent brief by the Disability Benefits Consortium.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford said that everyone should realise their full potential. That is a valid view, but I do not believe that pushing such people through a work-focused interview is necessarily the right way to realise their full potential. There would be more merit in that approach if people worked in partnership in preparation for the interview.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made valid points about part-time care workers and the need for periodic checks on people in full-time care. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) has tabled amendments about where the interview should take place. in that context, perhaps we could meet somewhere in the middle.
<P>
The Minister should accept that the amendments would make the single gateway work; we are not seeking to put obstacles in the Government's way. The hon. Member for Croydon, North sidestepped the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> He was not chosen to sit on the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> No.
<P>
There is a wonderful musical starring Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton called ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas''. Perhaps I should apologies for using such a word. The governor sings a little song when asked a different question:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Oh, I like to do a little sidestep''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was content until the hon. Gentleman talked about singing a little song, when I began to worry that he might start singing it. He should return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> In conclusion, should fame not be kind to the Minister, he could have a brilliant future before him singing part of that musical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> I welcome the generally constructive spirit in which the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar spoke. The Government envisage a radical reform of the welfare system, and the Bill is part of that process. It would be an advantage if we could proceed on a bipartisan or multipartisan basis. I listen with interest to what Opposition Members say. I think that the hon. Gentleman's argument&#151;equating readiness for interview with readiness for work&#151;was illogical. He suggested that it would be inappropriate for someone to have an interview if they were not ready for work. That would create a vicious circle: someone might not be ready for work, but training and advice could help them to get ready for work, yet the hon. Gentleman proposes that they should not be offered the interview until they are ready. In that case they will never receive the help that could open up the way towards greater independence and employment. I put it to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar and his colleagues that it makes sense for people to have the interview, even if they are not capable of work at the time, so that they can consider the best ways of realising their potential.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I agree with that argument in general. However, will the Minister bear in mind that the amendment relates to only three categories: severely disabled people, full-time carers and those with children under five? We are discussing only those three categories.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> Yes, indeed. None of those people should be excluded from the possibility of working in the future, nor should they be denied the interviews that can help them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The most critical point came out in the last thing that the Minister said: that, under the amendment, these people would not be allowed to have their interview. That is not the purpose of the amendment. I have never suggested that people should not be allowed to come to such an interview, to receive all the information that they need. People in the categories included in the amendment would still be free to come to such an interview at an appropriate time, if they chose to do so. Nothing that the Minister has said about this being a way of stopping people from coming to an interview is relevant to the amendment. We are not attempting to stop people from attending interviews, if they choose to do so, and feel that it would be of benefit to them. That would be the right way to do it.
<P>
If it can be proved to people that the interviews will benefit and help them, it will rapidly become clear&#151;as the Minister said earlier when talking about the new deal&#151;that people will come to the interviews voluntarily, without the threat of removal of benefit. The Bill contains such a threat. Anyone suggesting that benefit claimants who are told that they will forfeit their benefit if they do not attend their interview are not being threatened is playing with words. Claimants would regard that as a threat. They need the benefits; they are told that, if they do not come to the interview, they will not get the benefits. That is a threat to them&#151;there is no other appropriate word for it.
<P>
We accept that people should be offered interviews, even those in the categories mentioned in the amendment. It is interesting that the Minister spoke at length about the fact that the interviews are not only work focused. Before Easter, we had a long argument about whether the wording of the Bill should emphasise that the interviews were work focused. The Government insisted that it should be called a work-focused interview, whatever other aspects to it there might be. They said that it should be described only as a work-focused interview, despite all our arguments that the description should be more broadly based. Today, however, the whole tenor of the Government's argument is that the interviews are not merely work focused, and that the point of them&#151;especially for people in the categories mentioned in the amendment&#151;is that they would be much more wide-ranging, and would take in many more aspects that would be helpful to the people concerned.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman has referred repeatedly to threats. Does he regard it as a threat that would-be claimants have to fill in a form and supply certain information before they can receive benefit? If he does not, why should he regard turning up for a helpful interview as a threat?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The threat is that of the removal of benefits if a person does not turn up for the interview. Obviously, if people wish to obtain a benefit, they must fill in a form to say why they need it. That is not the point&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There are too many noisy sedentary interventions. The meeting must come to order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> As the Minister has repeatedly told us, the point of the interviews is not for claimants to explain why they need the benefit. There will be no questioning as to why they need the benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that many people make mistakes when filling in forms and that their benefits are consequently delayed? One of the purposes of the interview could be to help such people to receive more benefit. That is hardly a threat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> If so, there would be no need to threaten those who fail to attend interviews with the removal of benefit. If such people felt that an interview was the quickest way to sort out those problems, they would doubtless agree to attend and one would not need to make threats.
<P>
Where the Government believe that the only way to detect fraudulent cases is to oblige those concerned to attend interview, some sort of threat may be necessary. Where there is fraud afoot and an interview is merely offered, people might decide that the best way to get away with fraud is to decline to attend. I fully accept that, where one is genuinely trying to avoid fraud, one may need to threaten those who are unwilling to attend interview with a reduction or removal of benefit.
<P>
However, we are not considering cases involving fraud. As the Minister said, under the provision, those who decline to take up paid work will continue to receive the benefits. The provision does not deal with fraudulent cases&#151;if it did, there would be some logic to the Bill's implied threat. The Minister made it clear that that is not what the Government are about. Therefore, a good case for the amendment remains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that interviews would increase or decrease cases of fraud?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I do not know. I am saying that the provision has nothing to do with fraud. Given that the Minister made it clear in his earlier comments that it has nothing to do with fraud, I do not see the point of his question. More importantly, he also made it clear that none of the people in the relevant categories will be required to take up paid work.
<P>
I have taken on board points that were made about the amendment's precise wording. Questions were asked about the definition of ``severely disabled'' and about the number of hours of care a carer of a person in a relevant category must provide per week to fall within the scope of the amendment. Those points are valid and I should like the opportunity to re-examine them. For that reason alone, and with a view to tabling similar amendments later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 44, line 28, after `interview', insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins, for allowing me to move the amendment, which would ensure that interviews are held in an appropriate place. The places at which benefit-related interviews are held are by no means always appropriate from the claimant's point of view. We want the phrase, ``appropriate place'' to be inserted in the Bill and given as wide an interpretation as possible. There are a number of reasons why people trying to claim benefits may find it difficult to get to the offices to which they are invited. A guarantee of a home visit rather than an interview in a benefits office, particularly where physical access to the office is difficult for those with disabilities, would be sensible in certain clear cases. By physical access, I refer not only to the office but to the interview itself. All aspects of accessibility must apply&#151;lack of wheelchair access is the most obvious example, but accessibility of information and communications must also be considered. Some people may find it difficult to communicate with the interviewer when they come to the interview and excessive remoteness from the benefits office may also cause a problem.
<P>
During the Easter recess, I took the opportunity to go to Scotland and to visit the benefits office in Inverness, which must deal with some of the remotest claimants in the UK. Staff at the office told me that some of their claimants came from islands&#151;from which access could be difficult&#151;and some from parts of the country where few, if any, roads exist and there is no other easy form of transport. Some of those people would find it difficult to get to the benefits office.
<P>
<B>Mrs. McKenna:</B> The hon. Gentleman paints a picture of Scotland that I do not recognise. I know Inverness and the islands well and transport&#151;though not ideal&#151;is pretty good. Would he not agree that the Bill includes provision for the benefits service to travel to such areas and that it would not require anyone to travel to Inverness? Various arrangements exist to cater for transport problems and they will continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am delighted to hear that. I hope that the Minister will give a similar assurance. If so, the amendment should pose no problem, and I hope that the Government will accept it.
<P>
An interesting case was brought to my attention by the social policy bulletin of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux in January this year. It concerned a client who failed an all-work test and who registered for jobseeker's allowance pending an appeal. She was wheelchair bound and had been in receipt of disability living allowance, mobility allowance and middle rate care. She was able to gain access to the jobcentre only with the assistance of two helpful workmen. The jobcentre staff were apparently unable to assist.
<P>
In such instances, it should be possible for benefits offices to work more humanely. Where there is a lack of proper accessibility to the place of interview, the claimant should be interviewed in his or her own home. Recent parliamentary answers to my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)&#151;I am delighted to note his presence in the Committee this morning&#151;included the admission that only a third of all jobcentres have a disabled toilet. I always regard disabled toilet as an odd phrase; I suppose that it means toilet for people with disabilities. As many people with disabilities need to go to a benefits office or jobcentre, it is extraordinary that only a third of such places are equipped with a toilet for people with disabilities. That is an example of the Government introducing barriers to employment and benefits rather than removing them, as they assure us they are trying to do. I hope that they will tackle that problem in the future.
<P>
It is also important that there should be facilities for young mothers. Lone parents&#151;they may have become lone parents only recently&#151;may come to claim benefits and attend interviews when they have young children with them. It is important that proper facilities are provided at benefits offices, if claimants with young babies are expected to attend interviews.
<P>
It is also important to consider the long distances that may be involved. I am delighted to hear that the constituents of the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) have no problem with access, but I was told by the benefits office involved that it is concerned about that issue.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the more that local benefits offices merge or close down, which happens a lot nowadays, the more difficult access to them becomes, especially in rural areas. It is important to have the flexibility of a home visit; at the very least, people should be given travel money to enable them to attend interviews. It should be paid in advance, because many people who claim benefits do not have ready cash and will be unable to afford what may be long and expensive journeys. If interviews are compulsory, such matters must be properly thought through.
<P>
Private companies may be involved in the single gateway. If so, it is especially important that the guarantees of accessibility and home visits, if necessary, are included in tendering documents sent out to private contractors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> For once, I thoroughly agree with the hon. Member for Newbury. I apologise if I confused his constituency with that of his hon. Friend. I ought to remember Newbury, as I spent many happy hours at its racecourse in the more frivolous days of my youth, but I do not think that I am the worse for wear for that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury made a number of points that are common to us both. My main purpose in tabling the amendments is to obtain some assurances from the Government. We do not like the way in which the Bill has been formulated, with enormous powers to make regulations, but no indication of how the powers will be used. We want some assurances in Hansard at least&#151;if not in the Bill&#151;to which the civil servants who draft the regulations will have to refer. We should have many opportunities to remind the Government of their assurances if they are not fulfilled. If we are not given specific assurances, I shall press the amendments to a Division, whenever appropriate in our proceedings.
<P>
I want to keep an element of flexibility. As you know, Mr. Malins, I am of a naturally sanguine disposition and always hope that the Government will give us the assurances that we wish for and that their better instincts will prevail over either their less good ones, or the instructions of the Treasury of Mr. Alistair Campbell.
<P>
The effect of the three amendments would be that the regulations would provide for interviews to be held at home. Amendment No. 252 would ensure that interviews can be held at home if the claimant is ill or has to travel more than 20 miles. Amendment No. 81 covers disabled people and amendment No. 82 refers to reimbursement of the interviewee's reasonable expenses when significant distances have to be travelled. Many people involved may be on means-tested benefits or very low incomes. If the Government hold out those interviews as being of benefit to claimants, rather than a negative burden on them, it is important that serious costs are not involved. The interviews will involve people giving up their time, so we want to ensure that they think that they are a useful way to spend their time. They must think it useful to expend whatever effort is required to attend the interview, so long as that effort is reasonable and no unreasonable financial burden is involved.
<P>
This group of amendments neatly falls immediately after the debate on amendment No. 91, because, as I said then, whether or not the system will work, whether claimants will think that it is of benefit to them and whether it will help them return to work or, if they cannot work full time, perhaps in the case of disabled people, to find a niche of activity that they might not have discovered or have had access to&#151;we all hope that that happens&#151;depends on the Government's good faith and the thoroughness of their planning. We do not want the interviews to become a great burden on those who are summoned for interview.
<P>
I should like the Government to assure us that all the offices where such interviews will take place will be fully equipped for disabled people, which means more than just wheelchair access. The hon. Member for Newbury mentioned the provision of lavatories. It is a bad show that only a third of benefits offices are equipped for disabled people. If an office is not so equipped, we want an assurance that the interview will take place at home.
<P>
We also want an assurance that the interview will take place at home if the interviewee would have to travel more than a certain distance&#151;we have chosen 20 miles in amendment No. 252, but we might settle for another figure. We want to make absolutely clear the maximum distance that anyone should reasonably be expected to travel, connected to which is the matter of cost.
<P>
If the Government are prepared to reimburse taxi fares, it would be reasonable to ask a disabled person to travel 20 miles by cab. However, I do not know whether it is appropriate for the taxpayer to pick up the bill. The cost of travel must be weighed against the cost of sending officials to claimants' homes. As we state in other amendments, those officials must be properly trained and either full-time employees of the Benefits Agency or sub-contracted to it.
<P>
I hope that the Government have thought about such matters. I hope that they will give us an answer and that the Minister will tell us exactly what his thinking is and whether he has considered such costs and trade-offs. He might have forgotten&#151;he might have been talking to his neighbour&#151;that I mentioned the trade-off between the cost of using cabs that are equipped for disabled people and the cost of home visits.
<P>
It is unacceptable for the Government to do nothing at all and simply say, ``Come to the interview. It does not matter how difficult it is or that you cannot get through the door when you get there because there is no disabled ramp. If you don't get there, we will take your benefit away.'' The Government would not dare to say that explicitly, but if they fail to deal with the points that I have made, they will be implicitly confessing that that is their approach.
<P>
I do not accept the view that the details should be left to the Benefits Agency and that we should not worry our little heads in Parliament about such matters. That is not acceptable. We must have assurances that the system will work properly. The hon. Member for Newbury made a good point&#151;I would have made it but he was called first on this occasion. Perhaps it is the intention&#151;to which we have no objection in principle; indeed, it may be a good idea&#151;that in many cases the responsibility for carrying out the interviews will be sub-contracted to the private sector. People in the private sector with the training and background experience to deliver and conduct such interviews may do so much more professionally than the usual Benefit Agency staff, in which case we would welcome that approach. However, if the Minister is about to spend taxpayers' money on such contracts with the private sector&#151;which must include precise specifications that he has already worked out&#151;he can tell Parliament now that those specifications are. We want clear, concrete assurances. If we receive them, I shall not press our amendment to a vote; if we do not, I hope that I can catch your eye, Mr. Malins, at the appropriate moment in order to do so.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I should like to ask the Minister about the policy on home visits. Three key categories seem to be involved&#151;mothers of young children, who often experience practical difficulties in finding people to mind their children; the disabled, to whom my hon. Friend the Minister for Grantham and Stamford has just referred; and the mentally ill, who are progressing toward recovery but for whom travelling is often a problem.
<P>
If personal advisers are to be what we hope, in a significant proportion of cases, home visits will be more successful and effective than requiring people to turn up at a Government office, with all the discouragement and problems that that entails. If the Government are to take the matter seriously, it will, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford pointed out, form an important part of drafting specifications. It is also important to establish whether home visits should be treated as the exception in cases that are genuinely difficult, or whether the Government are willing to consider as a matter of principle what might amount to up to a quarter or a third of cases being dealt with by home visits. If we want to make the scheme work, home visits will be an important ingredient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> I have considerable sympathy with the spirit of the amendment, and hope that I can assure hon. Members so that they do not press the matter to a vote. It is in the essence of the single gateway that it works successfully, is accessible and, as amendment No. 93 states, that interviews be held ``in an appropriate place''. I want the surroundings to be not only appropriate but of good quality, to get away from the old image of the dole office and the Benefits Agency&#151;civilised surroundings, commensurate with what we are trying to do in helping people realise their potential. I want the environment in which the interviews are conducted to be as welcoming, secure and pleasant as possible for everyone involved. I want claimants to notice the difference when they enter the single gateway provision. We want them to be immediately aware that it is a better and more customer-focused service than anything that they have received in the past.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) mentioned three categories in relation to the provision for home visits. The first was people with care and responsibility for small children, the second was people with severe disability, and the third was people who suffer from mental illness. We have said that we will make provision for home visits when necessary. I shall not say that each of those categories should automatically receive home visits, because that might not be appropriate. However, I assure the Committee that sensitivity will be exercised in making provision for home visits when appropriate, and we have in mind precisely such categories of people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Oaten </B>(Winchester): Disabled people will want to know how decisions on home visits will be made. If a disabled person felt it inappropriate to attend a meeting at the job centre, will a right of appeal be built in to demand a home visit? If so, who would adjudicate in such cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The decision will have to be taken during the initial registration and orientation stage of the single work-focused gateway procedure, when the initial information is provided and arrangements are made for an interview. It makes sense for the officers undertaking the work to have a fair degree of discretion to apply common sense and sensitivity. As I said in the previous sitting, one of the reasons for the pilot schemes is to enable people to see the circumstances under which home visits are provided.
<P>
We will discuss appeals under a later group of amendments, but I can say now that there will be a right of appeal against the refusal of benefit for whatever reason. People might construct an argument against the legitimacy of benefit being refused on the grounds that it was inappropriate to expect them to go into an office rather than have a home visit. However, I would be cautious before entertaining appeal rights at each stage of the process; that would bog the whole thing down in terrible bureaucracy and would not work in claimants' interests.
<P>
<H5>12.15</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Minister assured us that the issues would be handled with sensitivity and common sense. I have complete confidence in the sensitivity and common sense of the Minister, but he will not be the one taking the decisions; in many cases, it will not even by his officials. He will surely not have it written into the contracts of outside, private-sector groups that they should determine the matter on the basis of sensitivity and common sense. More detailed, specific, concrete criteria will be necessary for determining, for example, when interviews should take place at home or in what circumstances and on what terms costs could be reimbursed. I hope that the Minister will give a clear answer to my questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> It is not necessarily simply the private sector who will be involved; it may be the voluntary sector in partnership with the private sector. Members of the Committee will know that four of the 12 pilot schemes involve such partnerships. We will follow the principle that private-voluntary provision should be made on the same basis as that available in the public sector.
<P>
I cannot give details of the contractual requirements; many of the matters are still being decided. I hope that the hon. Member will be reassured by the principle that I have just given and by the fact that in assessing performance of private or public sector provision, people will be able to see the number of home visits being made and the circumstances under which they have been made available. That is a sensitive and commonsense way of proceeding. We expect private-voluntary sector providers to make arrangements for home visits where appropriate and for the considerations taken into account in deciding what is appropriate to be the same as those in solely public sector provision.
<P>
There will be other opportunities to debate the private-voluntary sector partnerships. That sector will have the front end of the process and the oversight of the management, but it will be in close partnership with the Employment Service, the Benefits Agency, the local authorities and all those involved in the single gateway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Does the Minister accept that the single gateway will be affected by&#151;to continue the analogy&#151;its weakest hinge? The further we get from the Minister, the further decisions go down the administrative strata, the greater the need for guidelines and guidance. I accept his point that the scheme is at the pilot stage and that we will learn from it, but even a pilot needs guidelines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> I am flattered by the hon. Gentleman's assumption that I am the strongest link in the process. I emphasis that we have a large number of dedicated, professional staff working on the issue who are no strangers to those sorts of decisions. They currently decide what is reasonable or not reasonable in regard to calling people to interviews or to the circumstances in which extra help can be given for transport.
<P>
As I said, provision for home visits where necessary make sense. I resist amendment No. 252, which specifies two sets of circumstances. Serious illness and distance of travel may be relevant considerations, but they are by no means the only ones, as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs pointed out.
<P>
I am committed to the idea of access for disabled people in the single work-focused gateway and other respects. My Department is to the fore in promoting rights for disabled people more widely, and does so with great energy. That is why we have specified, as one of the criteria for selecting the sites in the pilot areas, that disabled access will be available or can be provided in each location before the pilots begin. Again, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, in terms of what people will experience on the ground. As well as the physical access, we will ensure that hearing loops and other facilities designed to help disabled people are provided. We are also exploring how best to provide for the needs of people who face additional difficulties in attending an office, whatever they may be, in terms of the provision for home visits that I have explained.
<P>
The single gateway will help disabled people in other ways, as was said in the previous debate. Let us remember that we are bringing together the functions of different agencies, notably the Benefits Agency, the Employment Service and local authorities, in relation to housing benefit and council tax benefit. That alone should make life easier for disabled people and other claimants. Instead of them being shunted from pillar to post and having to make several visits, as they have to all too often at the moment, in future they will only need to go to one place to have all their benefit needs met. That ought to be counted as a big step forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> Am I right in thinking that the Minister said that he was going to guarantee that those jobcentres involved in the pilot would have full disabled access? Will that include induction loops and disabled toilets? Will he clarify whether the same guarantee would apply to every jobcentre if the project were to go nationwide?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> It is not simply jobcentres that we are talking about, but single work-focused gateway sites. Many of them will be jobcentres, but some will be Benefits Agency and local authority offices, and some will be new premises acquired for the purpose. I give that assurance in regard to the pilots. Any questions for national roll-out will be addressed when we take a decision whether and how to expand the single gateway. I would be surprised if anyone were to advocate a lower standard of provision in a national roll-out than had been shown to work successfully in the pilot.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The Minister may have answered the question that I am going to put to him&#151;I hope he will tell me if that is so. My impression is that he expects housing benefit staff as well as social security staff to be available wherever the interviews will be conducted, and that social services staff will be available to deal with any social services issues that may arise when dealing with disabled people. I understand that it is easy to put social security staff together with the employment services, but will the local authorities and the voluntary services physically be at the same sites as the interviews?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The physical conjunction of provisions must involve the personnel covering the key areas, both in conducting the interviews and in making accurate assessments of benefit claims. Employment Service staff, relevant Benefits Agency staff and local authority staff will deal with housing and council tax benefits. I am not suggesting that we can integrate the whole of council and other local authority provisions.
<P>
I would not suggest that voluntary sector and other advisory groups are physically located at the single gateway sites. Consistent with the previous debate, I suggest that there must be good links with the wider network of support, so that appropriate referrals and advice to point people in the right direction can be made.
<P>
On the reimbursement of travel costs, we are working hard at local level to identify premises for single gateway pilots to maximise accessibility. One of the main criteria used in selecting sites was that, wherever possible, people should not have to travel for more than 45 minutes each way or spend more than &#163;3 on a return public transport fare to get to and from their interview. Indeed, in the pilots where sites have been selected, the centre of population has an existing service from the jobcentre or the Benefits Agency office. Some areas and centres of population that did not previously have a site will have one, which will improve the provision.
<P>
The expectation that claimants in general will meet their own costs is consistent with the requirements for those following the JSA regime that is in operation. In terms of the flow into the single gateway, about 75 per cent. of those who will be taking part will be JSA eligible and that is a reasonable requirement.
<P>
Problems of access and remote rural areas and island communities have been mentioned. We are examining the possibility of outreach facilities, not dissimilar to those that exist at present, although we want to improve them whenever possible. There may be exceptional circumstances when it may be appropriate to reimburse some of the expense and we have the flexibility to allow that. The proposition of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford was one that we have been explicitly considering&#151;for example, when a claimant might incur excessive costs in going to the interview and whether it would make sense to take the interview to that person or when the difficulty and cost of a taxi journey into a gateway centre might be less than that involved in taking the interview to the client. Usually, people would be expected to go to the centre and meet their own costs.
<P>
I hope that the Committee accepts that we are setting out our proposals sensibly and sensitively. They will ensure that people are interviewed in civilised, welcoming, secure surroundings that cater for particular needs. In the light of my assurances, I hope that members of the Committee will not press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I should like speak on behalf of those who suffer from motor neurone disease&#151;people to whom a home visit would be appropriate. As the Motor Neurone Disease Association states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The majority of working people affected by MND stay in work for as long as they can after diagnosis. Return to work is not a possibility once they have left. Rather, the point at which someone with MND is no longer able to work, or is forced to leave work, is an unhappy indicator of the disease's rapid and relentless progression.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> People with MND therefore do not require incentives to work or interviews to help them find suitable work and should be exempt from any such requirement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I know that the Minister will not make any such exemption, but can he make it clear that where people have been working all their lives but are now confined to wheelchairs with a relentless disease, the official will visit them at home?
<P>
The brief issued to members of the Committee by the National Association for Mental Health cites an example of someone who has suffered from schizophrenia for many years. The man is middle aged, has no family to look after him and no friends who will take care of him because of the nature of his disease. Social services have contact with him, but often he does not open the door. He does not answer letters that people write to him because he does not open them. As a result, his electricity may have been cut off. A letter may be sent to him inviting him to the interview but he would not, of course, open it. His benefit would be reduced, but he would not complain&#151;he would simply buy less food. In that case, there must be contact with social services. If there is such a history, will home visits take place and will the case be handled sensitively?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The first example, which was about motor neurone disease, is the sort of case in which I would expect a home visit to be appropriate. I shall not give a blanket assurance and say that all visits will take place at home because they may not be suitable or appropriate in all cases. However, the example is the sort of case that we have in mind. If the disease has reached a certain degree of severity, it may not be appropriate to have the interview at all. We had such severe disability in mind in those parts of the Bill to which I referred the hon. Member for Beckenham.
<P>
In relation to the severely mentally ill person who does not open letters and who is in receipt of benefit, most access to the benefits system currently tends to come from social workers. It is important to maintain that liaison in relation to the single gateway.
<P>
We should consider the case of someone who is in receipt of benefit and who may have had an interview deferred because it was not appropriate for him to attend at the initial point of claim. As the hon. Gentleman suggested, he may not open the appropriate letter or otherwise respond. In that case, we would not terminate the benefit until a home visit had been made. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we shall bend over backwards in the cases that he described to ensure that they are dealt with sensitively and in a manner that minimises the risk of anyone having benefit withdrawn unfairly or unreasonably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The whole Committee should be grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough for raising the two cases on behalf of the Motor Neurone Disease Association and MIND. In such debates, it is important to focus on specific cases. I am gland that my hon. Friend discussed motor neurone disease&#151;a representative from the relevant organisation is coming to see me this afternoon. She could not come earlier because of Easter. I hope that our discussions this afternoon will inform my contributions to later debates. I am glad that my hon. Friend is already briefed on the subject.
<P>
I am also grateful to the Minister. He gave a constructive, confident and&#151;to use his words&#151;sensitive and commonsensical response. He has obviously thought through some of these matters and knows what his policies are.
<P>
The Conservative party is more than ready to proceed by consensus when the relevant principles are genuinely shared and when the detail has been properly thought through. If work-focused interviews turn out to be what the Labour party say they will be, we are, in principle, in favour of them. The could be a valuable addition to the services that the state provides for people who are unemployed or are otherwise excluded from the world of work for reasons that excite everyone's sympathetic concern on humane grounds.
<P>
The Minister gave the Committee some specific assurances. I received the assurances that I wanted in terms of the maximum travel cost to be incurred&#151;I have taken note of the sum of &#163;3. I also note the maximum distance to be covered, which the Minister prefers to express in terms of time&#151;45 minutes. I am happy to take that on board. We have received clear assurances that the offices where the interviews will take place under the pilots will be equipped to accommodate disabled people. We are satisfied with that. We also heard the Minister say that, in principle, he would be surprised if, when the scheme is rolled out to cover the whole country, the standards would be any lower than those set for the pilots. Again, we are happy to take him on trust.
<P>
This has been a constructive and helpful debate. It goes without saying that, as an Opposition, we remain sceptical, and we shall not go to sleep on this. If these assurances are not fulfilled, either at the pilot stage or subsequently, we shall remind the Government of the undertakings that they have given today. However, on the basis of this debate, it would be reasonable for us not to press our amendments to a vote. We trust the Minister to carry out those undertakings in good faith, and I am sure that he will tell his officials that he has made those assurances, to make sure that the message goes down the line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I wish to take up the issue that the Minister raised about the possibility of having local authority people coming into the single gateway sites. I was delighted to hear that this was his intention, at least in the initial pilot schemes. I hope that he can also assure us that the local authorities have been warned about that. I had not realised that that was going to happen, and nothing seems to have been mentioned in any of the Local Government Association's bulletins to suggest that it knew that it would have to do that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> The LGA is certainly involved in discussions. In each of the pilot areas, the local authorities concerned are not only being consulted, but involved in the local implementation groups and represented on the national implementation project. There are several issues to discuss, not least reimbursement of the local authority costs involved. Local authorities' contribution has been constructive and positive, not least because of the number of local authorities that have led the way in making one-stop shop provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am delighted with the Minister's reassurance. I hope that he will also reassure us that local authorities will be fully reimbursed for any extra costs involved. We all know the problems that local authorities have had in terms of extra duties being imposed on them over the last few years without the resources to fund those duties. I hope that this will not be yet another example of central Government cutting local government funds by forcing local authorities to do things that they had not previously been expected to do. I shall be delighted to see local authority involvement, but I hope that local authorities will be given the resources to achieve it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> Extra resources are being made available for this&#151;a net &#163;79 million, from memory. The local authorities will have a fair share of the funding, which of course must vary on a case-by-case basis, not least because any contribution must be proportionate to the number of staff and the extent of local authority premises involved. Within those parameters, there will be a fair settlement, and local authorities will have access to additional resources.
<P>
Mr. Rendel
<P>
: Unfortunately, that was slightly less specific than the answer that I had hoped for. What the Minister did not say&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> It is not a blank cheque.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> No, no. What the Minister did not say was that there would be full reimbursement. He said that it would be a fair share of the total amount of money allocated, but he did not say that there would be full reimbursement to the local authorities concerned. I wish that he had given us that assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I, too, wish that the Minister had given us that assurance. I wanted to intervene on the Minister, but I think that you would have called me to order, Mr. Malins, had I done so.
<P>
The important point about the &#163;79 million is that it will be split several ways, and local authorities will have to bear the burden of that.
<P>
Having seen a number of authorities such as the Benefits Agency and employment agencies work closely together ahead of those pilot schemes by linking computer systems and telephone lines, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the provision would be very expensive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The hon. Gentleman is doubtless right to say that such things can prove expensive and difficult to achieve. Questions also arise about the rights of individuals with regard to information flows. Indeed, a number of problems may need to be sorted out. I cannot speak for other Committee members, but the Minister's reference to the introduction of people from local authorities into the single gateway sites was the first that I had heard of such a plan. Many Committee members will be concerned about that. The Minister should provide a detailed explanation of how it will be done and the extent to which it will be funded. If he cannot do so now, perhaps he would write to us on the matter.
<P>
I was delighted to hear the Minister say that all pilot scheme single gateway sites will provide full disabled access. I was also pleased to learn that he does not anticipate a lowering in the rate of disabled access, if and when the scheme goes nationwide. Where a scheme with full disabled access has been successfully piloted, it would surely be dangerous subsequently to introduce a nationwide scheme that fails to provide the same level of access. Apart from anything else, one would not have anticipated the difficulties associated with the lack of provision of full disabled access. Where such access is not provided, one must pilot the need for and frequency of home visits, the type of person that will need such visits, and so on.
<P>
Given that the pilots are to proceed with full disabled access, I hope that the Minster can assure us that the scheme itself will proceed in exactly the same way. As we know, most sites that are currently used for interviews do not provide full disabled access, and putting the problem right will cost a lot of money. God help us if the sum of &#163;79 million is supposed to pay for that as well. The provision of such access for all sites will cost a lot more than &#163;79 million, particularly given that, according to the Minister, new sites are to be built from scratch.
<P>
I am happy with many of the Minister's reassurances, but his argument against the amendment does not seem entirely logical. As was said, if the assurances given are correct and will be carried out fully, it is surely appropriate to accept the amendment. Therefore, I do not intend to withdraw it.

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Briefly, this amendment deals with situations in which someone who has been called to an interview does not have the right language or physical abilities to talk properly to the interviewer or to understand what he or she is saying. It would ensure that such a person would have the right to have someone else with them who can assist them to understand. That seems sensible and straightforward and it is likely to reduce the worry and concern that some people will have when called to an interview of this kind. Some people will feel&#151;notwithstanding the Government's belief that the interview will be beneficial to them&#151;that they are being forced through a process that will not be beneficial. The amendment seems to be a good method of reducing such anxiety.
<P>
There are a number of different reasons why people may be unable to communicate with an interviewer&#151;physical disabilities, language and worry about the interview itself. Those of us who have knowledge of the health service&#151;I have a wife who is a GP, so I can claim a certain amount of knowledge of what happens in GP surgeries from what I hear at home&#151;know that when a person has an interview with a doctor he often hears only the first few words that the doctor says to him. If those words are in some way worrying to that person, a lot of what is said in the remainder of the interview may go in one ear and straight out the other. It may be easier for somebody who is more objective and who does not feel a direct personal concern to listen more fully to what the doctor is saying. The same may be true of a single gateway interview.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept in certain situations it would be appropriate for an advocate to attend an interview, not only to ensure that what the interviewee wants to say is properly put across to the interviewer but to ensure that what the interviewer is saying is properly communicated to and understood by the interviewee. If that does not occur, much of the benefit from such interviews&#151;we have acknowledged that they may be beneficial&#151;may be lost. Neither the Government, nor Liberal Democrats, would want that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> This is a probing amendment&#151;it is not the Opposition's intention that it should become part of the law of the country. We would not want to prohibit people from being accompanied when being interviewed by any arm of the state. It would be sinister if any arm of the state were to say, ``We want to see the citizen alone. We do not want any witnesses to what might go on''. I would not want to live in such a country, even if it did not have a new Labour Government.
<P>
Conservative Members want to draw attention to this issue in a different way from Liberal Democrat Members, who have got the emphasis wrong. They seem to be saying that people should be encouraged to take a lawyer to the interviews, which we believe puts the wrong aspect on what should be a positive discussion. The interview should not be in any way antagonistic, but if one brings along a lawyer the discussion will&#151;with due respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough&#151;almost by definition become antagonistic.
<P>
We think it reasonable for claimants to be accompanied by a friend, a brother or sister, or a parent. Parents are often concerned about young people who cannot get a job; if mummy is worried and losing sleep because Johnny cannot get a job and is wandering around the streets getting up to no good, it seems reasonable for her to come to the interview. Her presence might be useful because it would create a double-handed approach to getting Johnny a job, without any conflict or misunderstanding arising between mummy and the adviser laid on by the employment service.
<P>
We do not want professional legal advisers, however they might be paid&#151;or even if they work pro bono&#151;trying, as a matter of course, to argue the toss. We do no want to encourage people to take along friends who are going to be barrack-room lawyers and adopt a negative approach, but we want to make sure that people can take friends or relations if they have difficulty in making themselves understood, if they are disabled and need someone with them or where the accompanying person has the interests of the claimant at heart&#151;as, we trust, will the interviewer, rather than merely following instructions from the Treasury. I apologise for repeating the point, but those suspicions have been borne out by so much of what the new Labour Government have done that we will take persuading that they are unjustified.
<P>
The amendment is probing and we do not intend to press it to a vote. However, we want a debate on the issue to see where the Government stand.

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It is interesting how flexible English is; the use of jargon suddenly produces incomprehension. The use of ``advocate'' in the Liberal Democrat amendment would be understood in one way in Scotland, where it denotes a legal representative; it has a direct correlation to the French ``avocat'' and to the basis of Scots law in Roman law. The English system is based on common law and while the English word ``advocate'' has developed from a similar stem to the Scottish word, it denotes taking a friend along to an interview. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford is neither entirely right nor entirely wrong, but I have sympathy with the drift of his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend will agree that this is the United Kingdom Parliament&#151;we trust that it will remain so. If ``advocate'' has the meaning north of the border that my hon. Friend says it has, it could have that meaning in the Bill. As she knows, ``advocate'' is used in a non-technical sense as someone who is a paid pleader for a cause. We do not seek to encourage people to hire advocates&#151;whether or not they are members of the Scottish Bar&#151;to take along to interviews, although we would not want to exclude them from doing so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is a very long intervention.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins. My hon. Friends and I are not miles apart on this, but it is a graphic illustration of how flexible English is and of how incomprehension and misunderstanding can arise.
<P>
Neither the hon. Member for Newbury or my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford mentioned the role of an advocate&#151;in the English sense, as I assume is meant in the amendment&#151;in dealing with people who are illiterate. I am conscious of the problems when people at my surgery who prove to be illiterate are confronted with form filling. Although what is being developed is a user-friendly interview, I assume that the results of questions will be put in writing and that it is likely that people will be asked to sign the form to consent that everything that has been recorded is as they said and constitutes a true and accurate record of the interview. That is completely meaningless for someone who is illiterate. Would someone who is illiterate and wanted to bring a friend as an advocate to the interviews be allowed to do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> Perhaps we should not be surprised that a simple probing amendment should so divide Conservative Members. Such is the state of today's Conservative party.
<P>
To respond first to the hon. Member for Beckenham, I should have thought that people who have problems with literacy would be among the prime beneficiaries of a shift to a person-to-person, face-to-face interview from a system overly dominated by form-filling and handling matters remotely. However, I am happy to give her that assurance. People who need help will be able to take someone with them, whether that person be a friend, a parent&#151;an advocate in whatever sense&#151;to help them communicate. The Liberal Democrats have also tabled a probing amendment on the matter.
<P>
Under the present system, people can take someone to help them when undertaking meetings in connection with benefit claims. As it is our desire to improve on present procedures, it would be strange to make something not possible that is possible under the present system. The opportunity that people have at the moment is not, however, specified in primary legislation but is none the less respected. The provision in this case therefore does not need to be included in primary legislation either, although I give hon. Members the assurance that people who want to take someone to help them or to represent them in the interview will be able to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> In view of the hour, it would be especially helpful if I were brief, as I shall be. That is exactly the assurance that we were looking for. We are grateful to the Government for it and have no intention of taking the amendment any further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I too am grateful to the Minister for that assurance, which is exactly what we were looking for. I hasten to add that I tabled the amendment before my visit to Scotland and had not recognised the importance of the wording. In view of what the Government have said and of the fact that what we are asking for is allowed and will be allowed, I am happy not to press the amendment, and beg to ask leave to withdraw it.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 245, in page 44, line 30, after `full', insert `or any'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendment No. 225, amendment No. 254, in page 45, line 34, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and that that person shall be limited to making one further claim in the same calender year'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 255, in page 45, line 38, leave out from `be' to end of line 39 and insert `stopped immediately.'.
<P>
Government amendment No. 226.
<P>
Amendment No. 256, in page 45, line 40, leave out from beginning to end of line 5 on page 46.
<P>
Government amendment No. 227.
<P>
Amendment No. 258, in page 46, leave out lines 9 to 11.
<P>
Government amendment No. 228.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am conscious of the time and doubt that I shall say most of what I want to. Again, these are probing amendments, which, to be fair, the Government have gone some way to answer in the amendments that they have tabled.
<P>
Amendment No. 245 would place people whose claims have been processed before they attend the interview on the same basis as those whose claims have not been processed before they attend. It makes failure to attend subject to benefit being stopped.
<P>
Amendment No. 254 relates to the fact that, under the Bill as drafted, within a year, people may make as many claims to benefit&#151;and therefore attend as many interviews&#151;as they want. That places unnecessary strain on the Departments.
<P>
Amendment No. 255&#151;
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
