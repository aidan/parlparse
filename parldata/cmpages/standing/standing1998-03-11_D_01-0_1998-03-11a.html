<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Members of the Committee may remove their jackets if they wish to do so. It may also help members of the Committee if I allow a reasonable debate on the sittings motion, on the understanding that that will affect my decisions about the length of subsequent clause stand part debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Shepherd </B>(Aldridge-Brownhills): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, if proceedings on the Public Interest Disclosure Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Wednesday 18 March, at half-past Ten o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill received its Second Reading without debate, so with your leave, Mr. Gale, I shall make a few introductory remarks about it.
<P>
Normally, I should be one of the first to think it remiss if a Bill were not debated on Second Reading. However, there are, extenuating circumstances, in that the subject was fully considered by the House for some five hours on 1 March 1996. The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), now Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry, said that that debate had been won more comprehensively than any other he had heard in the nine years that he has been in the House. That Bill also entitled the Public Interest Disclosure Bill received its Second Reading by 118 votes to nil. Regrettably, it did not reach the statute book last year, notwithstanding its wide support in the House and outside.
<P>
That Bill was introduced by the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) following an initiative that was launched in the House by the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright). I record my debt of thanks to both hon. Members, because the Bill builds extensively on their earlier proposals. I also thank the Minister and his officials for the assistance that the Government have afforded me, and I record the help that I have received from Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, from the charity Public Concern at Work and from Mr. Guy Dehn. I have also been fortunate to have received the assistance of the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) who, before coming to the House, was instrumental in setting up that charity.
<P>
As with its predecessors, the Bill's purpose is to make it more likely that where there is malpractice that threatens the public interest, a worker will raise the concern in a responsible way rather than turn a blind eye. The Bill seeks to achieve that by offering workers protection against victimisation if they raise their concern in the ways specified.
<P>
The Bill's approach is to encourage the worker to raise the matter internally in the first instance. It does that because such internal reports most easily attract the Bill's protection. Where that course is not safe and sound, or where the matter is not properly addressed internally, the Bill also protects the worker who makes an external disclosure in a specified way, provided that such disclosure is reasonable. On that point, members of the Committee should note that disclosures of malpractice to regulators which have been expressly authorised for that purpose by regulation will be more likely to attract protection than disclosures to the wider public. In all those cases, the Bill will protect only an employee who is acting in good faith. I am grateful to the Government, who have agreed in the light of Ministers' oversight for public bodies to make special provisions for those who work in quangos and in the national health service.
<P>
The clearest illustration of the need for the Bill is to be found in the major disasters and scandals of the last decade. Almost all official inquiries report that workers had seen the dangers, but either had been too scared to sound the alarm, or had raised the matter with the wrong person or in the wrong way. Examples include the rail inspector who, for fear of rocking the boat, did not report loose wiring before the Clapham rail disaster in which 35 people died. There were five warnings that ferries were sailing with their bow doors open before the tragedy at Zeebrugge took 193 lives. At Barlow Clowes and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and in Maxwell's empire a culture of fear and silence deterred workers from blowing the whistle, costing investors and pensioners billions of pounds. Finally, a Matrix Churchill employee wrote a letter to the Foreign Secretary about munitions equipment for Iraq but it was ignored by civil servants.
<P>
Those examples show how devastating the effects of a culture of silence can be when things are going wrong on a grand scale. However, hon. Members will know from their constituency work that employees who feel cowed whether or not with good reason may not wish to express concern about the types of malpractice specified in this Bill for fear of losing their jobs or careers.
<P>
A telling example of the need for the Bill was contained in a letter from Mrs. Bonnie Tall, who had been forced out of her post as secretary to the vice-chancellor at the university of Portsmouth after she had refused to turn a blind eye to his sophisticated and proven fiddling of public money. Mrs. Tall won a claim for unfair dismissal and received œ10,000. She has been out of work since. By contrast, the vice-chancellor left with a golden handshake, while the university spent œ200,000 on an inquiry by a Queen's counsel. As Mrs. Tall wrote, her experience was hardly likely to encourage others in her situation to act properly when they see public money being flagrantly misused for personal benefit.
<P>
I hope that the Bill will signal a shift in culture so that it is safe and accepted for employees such as those I have mentioned to sound the alarm when they come across malpractice that threatens the safety of the public, the health of a patient, public funds or the savings of investors. I hope that it will mean that good and decent people in business and public bodies throughout the country can more easily ensure that where malpractice is reported in an organisation, the response deals with the message, not the messenger.
<P>
The Bill is, as its name implies, a public interest measure. Were it merely an employee rights measure, I doubt that I would be able to inform the committee that its objectives are supported by the Institute of Directors, the Confederation of British Industry and the Committee on Standards in Public Life as well as the Trades Union Congress.
<P>
In all but one area compensation, the detail of which is yet to be settled the Bill adopts or improves on the approach of last year's Bill. As just one example, the public interest test is set out more clearly in this Bill neither employee nor employer will have to second guess the likely decision of the courts in an action for breach of confidence. Credit for those improvements largely belongs to the Minister and those who advise him, and I am grateful for the careful and positive consideration that they have given to the general points that were made by me and on my behalf.
<P>
In the light of extensive agreement between myself and the Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry and the overwhelming support that the Bill has received from consultees, there is a good chance that we may complete our considerations of it this morning. If we need more time, I hope that the Committee may sit next on 18 March.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Rowe </B>(Faversham and Mid-Kent): I am grateful to have caught your eye so early, Mr. Gale. I have a somewhat shameful reason for doing so. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) knows, from my point of view this is the worst possible day for the Committee to sit. I am delighted that I have been able to arrive on time so that I do not risk putting this excellent Bill at risk. I hope that I may soon be able to leave without jeopardising the Committee's consideration.
<P>
I have supported the Bill from the beginning, as it is hugely important. I am delighted that the Government appear to welcome it. I have one memory that is an illustration of the importance of the Bill. At the height of the Lloyd's scandal I was visited by a gentleman who had eventually found the courage to make his anxieties public. He was a Lloyd's broker whose membership of Lloyd's was paid by his employers. He was therefore in an enormously difficult position, although he was aware that some of the practices at Lloyd's were wholly indefensible.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills said, anything that can be done to make it possible for decent, straightfoward people to feel that they can make their genuine anxieties known, without jeopardising their entire future and that of their families, must be good. The Bill is well drafted and I am sure that any disagreements that remain, for example on the question of compensation, are capable of resolution. I hope that the Committee will be able to complete its work in one day, but if not, I shall make sure that I am present for the second day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): I support the motion. As it may be lost in the debate later, I congratulate the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills on introducing the Bill. He has demonstrated his concern for individual rights and it is appropriate that he should take the Bill forward.
<P>
I also thank my hon. Friend the Minister. From the outset, when he was appointed a Minister, he became a driving force behind making the Bill a reality. I also recognise the important work done by the charity Public Concern at Work. Its director, Guy Dehn, along with Maurice Frankel and my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey), trustees of the charity, have put the matter on the agenda in recent years and have all done much to drive it forward.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, if proceedings on the Public Interst Disclosure Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Wednesday 18 March, at half-past Ten o'clock.

<P>

<B>The Ministr of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, leave out lines 10 to 18.
<P>
The last time that we met, Mr. Gale, was sometime in the early morning of Tuesday. You seem to be in a better humour than you were then; it was a long night for us all. With your assistance, I look forward to being able to see the Bill through Committee this morning, so that we are not required to return next week.
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills on presenting the Bill and on the work that he has done with Public Concern at Work. He is right to say that the House has attempted several times to put the proposal on the statute book, with all-party support. By fair means and foul, it has never quite achieved it. After today's debate and the passage of the Bill through Committee, we will quickly have the legislation on the statute book, which will provide protection for some very brave people. We cannot go back and apply the legislation retrospectively, but in future those who are prepared to put themselves and their careers at risk for the public good will be protected. The Bill will be well supported by the Government.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 will lead to clearer provisions. Several consultees expressed doubts about the effect of the subsection, which relates to danger or damage to the environment or to health and safety. They have argued, and I agree with them, that it is unnecessary and could be counter-productive.
<P>
Some processes are inherently damaging or dangerous. We would not want the full protection of the law to apply to, for example, a worker who discloses that his boss smokes, drives a car, or quite legitimately manufactures hazardous chemicals. If, however, his boss smokes in a munitions factory, that might be a different matter, as might the fact that the firm pollutes a river by discharging poisonous waste into it, or that the manufacturing process cuts corners on safety, or that the disposal of dangerous chemical by-products is unregulated. Disclosures about such matters will be covered by the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The subsection was intended to exclude the trivial and the mundane. However, it could have deterred[Mr. Ian McCartney]people from raising issues of proper concern and led to legalism and complex case law.
<P>
The Government are satisfied that the Bill contains sufficient safeguards to ensure that workers will not be encouraged to disclosure trivial matters or concerns. Individuals must act in good faith if they are to attract protection. External disclosures are protected only if a worker acts reasonably.
<P>
Industrial tribunals will take into account what has happened and the seriousness of the matter. They are unlikely to agree that a worker has acted reasonably where a matter is trivial or if the Health and Safety Executive is satisfied that everything has been done correctly. I do not think that new section 43B(3) adds to the necessary safeguards and it could cause confusion about what is meant by "normal use" or the type of danger normally associated with it. I commend the amendment as a reasonable clarification of the proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit &#214;pik </B>(Montgomeryshire): I just wanted to ask the Minister about one slightly contentious issue involving the environment and the grounds on which the provision could be abused until precedents are set. Does he believe that new section 43B(3) does not add value to the Bill because there are other means of setting precedents and etiquette? Does he want to remove new section 43B(3) because the normal processes of law and past precedent will be sufficient to ensure that employees will not abuse the Bill's provisions and manufacturers will not be unnecessarily exposed to disclosure?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We are clarifying the process that an employee must follow in a reasonable and not trivial way, where a complaint is clearly substantial. The Bill as drafted leaves doubts about the process. We are providing clarity. The amendment does not affect the basic concept or original form of the new section, which gives absolute protection to a worker who reports to an agency outside the company such as the Health and Safety Executive that a serious breach of law is being covered up. The amendment adds to the protection because it clarifies what is not trivial and what is reasonable.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 3, line 14, at end insert "and".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The amendments will enable prescribed bodies to make discretionary awards to public spirited workers who raise concerns with them, without jeopardising a worker's protection. New section 43L(2) allows for rewards to be made under an enactment without affecting the protection provided to a worker. For example, the Inland Revenue will be able to make payments to encourage people to come forward with information useful to it. The payment is a recognition that the individual has acted in the public interest.
<P>
Some consultees queried why bodies that are designated by the Secretary of State to have particular responsibilities should not similarly be able to offer discretionary rewards to individuals who properly bring concerns to their attention. The Bill as drafted would make it possible for a worker's protection to be jeopardised by accepting such a reward or even by the prospect of a reward being available. That is not right and could be abused.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 3, in page 3, leave out lines 21 to 23. [Mr. Ian McCartney.]
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 3, leave out lines 24 to 27 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2) An order prescribing persons for the purposes of this section may specify persons or descriptions of persons, and shall specify the descriptions of matters in respect of which each person, or persons of each description, is or are prescribed."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Secretary of State can designate health and safety representatives who are recognised by their employer as having a particular health and safety role in the company. Sections 44 and 100 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 protect employees from victimisation if they raise health and safety matters and specify the circumstances in which they have occurred.
<P>
Recognised health and safety representatives, whether elected by a recognised trade union or not, should be protected when carrying out their duties. At the moment, individuals are protected only in circumstances of imminent and serious danger. If they take concerns to their representative and their employer finds out, they have no special protection. That gap was criticised when the provisions of the 1996 Act were being introduced and those consulted about the Bill drew attention to the opportunity to close that gap by designating health and safety representatives. We agreed. We need to ensure sufficient flexibility in the provisions for suitable people, such as health and safety representatives, to be designated. The amendment would achieve that and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I support the amendment for the reasons given by hon. Friend the Minister. It is important that organisations should be encouraged to develop their own internal procedures whereby they can deal properly with whistleblowing; but where an employer might be abusive or corrupt, employees must be protected when they make complaints to the health and safety representatives.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 4, line 14, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"()whether the disclosure is made in breach of a duty of confidentiality owed by the employer to any other person,".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would ensure that tribunals take into account the damage that may occur to a third person by disclosure. The tribunal may already take that into account, but it is not obliged to do so. Own example might be that of a doctor's receptionist who disclosed medical records in good faith and in accordance with information available to her. But she could be wrong and the patient might have suffered an irreversible invasion of privacy.
<P>
Another example might arise out of a business relationship. A bank employee might disclose that one of the bank's clients appeared to be insolvent. That could be very damaging to the client, who trusted the bank's duty of confidentiality to protect him. It would certainly damage his relationship with the bank and there might be damage to the bank's wider reputation and future business. Any potential damage might be justified by the circumstances, but the amendment has neither the intention nor the effect of suggesting that a duty of confidence to a third party will override all other factors. It would merely ensure that the tribunal will take that and any damage caused into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> As originally drafted, the Bill did not require tribunals to give weight to whether the information was confidential and, if so, what damage the disclosure may have caused to the third party whose confidence had been breached.
<P>
In consultations, the Minister and I agreed that any cross-reference to the law of confidence in the Bill was inappropriate for a number of reasons. First, we were keen to make the public interest in all disclosure of wrong-doing the pre-eminent factor. Secondly, we feared that it would not be sufficiently clear to employers and employees how this area of case law might apply if there were some umblicical link. Thirdly, we recognised that workers who reported a serious wrong-doing should not forfeit protection because it later transpired that that information was not in law confidential. When the courts have granted or refused an injunction to stop the disclosure of that same confidential information, the view of the Minister, with which I acquiesced, was that those decisions should be relevant, but not binding on the tribunal. As such, no reference was made to the law of confidence in the Bill.
<P>
During consultation, the point was made that there are some particularly important obligations of confidence for example, those owed by a doctor to his patient or a bank to its customer. A fear was expressed that the Bill as drafted might unwittingly permit or encourage a secretary in a doctor's surgery or a clerk in a bank to disclose a concern about malpractice or misconduct without regard to the fact that that information was subject to an important obligation of confidence owed by the employer to a third party. The amendment has been tabled simply to allay those fears. Its purpose is not to thwart protection simply because the information was subject to a routine claim of confidentiality. It covers those exceptional cases in which there is a particularly important duty of confidence, as between doctors and patients, when a worker's disclosure breaches that duty and harms the third party. In such cases, it is right that the tribunal should consider the breach and the degree of any harm that it causes in deciding whether the disclosure was reasonable.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I am not sure that the amendment is necessary, but if it will allay fears I have no objection to it. I do not think it necessary because the duty of confidentiality has always been trumped where public interest is involved, and the matters that are set out in subsection (1) of new section 43B are clearly of great public interest. If a criminal offence were involved, for example, that would be a public interest matter that would trump the duty of confidentiality. The doctor to use the Minister's example or the bank would not be under a duty of confidentiality if a criminal offence or serious health and safety problem were involved. Neither the bank nor the doctor would suffer any detriment at law, as there would be no duty of confidentiality in the first place. None the less, if the amendment allays fears it is not objectionable.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> The amendment might make the Bill more workable in respect of individuals who might otherwise be discouraged from disclosing important information. The arguments that I have heard make the amendment seem manifestly sensible.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 4, line 39, leave out "and".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The Government firmly believe that where exceptionally serious matters are at stake, workers should not be deterred from raising them. It is important that they should do so, and that they should not be put off by concerns that a tribunal might hold that they should have delayed their disclosure or made it in some other way.
<P>
That does not mean that people should be protected when they act wholly unreasonably: for example, by going straight to the press when there would clearly have been some other less damaging way to resolve matters. A matter might have been remedied earlier by the employer, or an allegation might have been proved entirely false. That might have become clear if the worker had raised it with a responsible body first. The Bill could cause significant damage to employers, and fears were raised that the balance of the Bill was tipped too far against the employer in such circumstances.
<P>
The amendment will encourage people to act reasonably even in serious matters, but it should not make them afraid that they will lose protection when they do so. It restores the balance between the need to make a disclosure and the need to do so in an effective and reasonable manner. Such disclosures should not be made in an offhand, rushed way to the press, as if that were the first or only way to raise the complaint or allegation. The amendment re-tilts the balance to an even keel by recognising employers' needs as well as the dangers of discouraging urgent and serious disclosures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> The effect of the amendment, as I understand it, is to introduce a reasonableness test in determining whether the worker who raises an exceptionally serious matter should be protected. The amendment is intended to meet a concern raised by the CBI that the Bill's provision was open to abuse.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I agree with the Minister that workers should not be deterred from blowing the whistle about exceptionally serious matters and that they should not lose their[Mr. Shepherd]
protection because the employer argues that they should have delayed or made the disclosure in some other way. When an exceptional risk to the public interest is at stake, such arguments should be treated with a pinch of salt by the tribunal. I agree with the Minister, however, that when the tribunal is satisfied that the worker has acted wholly unreasonably in blowing the whistle to an entirely inappropriate body, the tribunal should be allowed to hold that the worker loses the protection of the law.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Clause 8 provides that compensation for employees who have been dismissed for making a protected disclosure will be determined by regulations. The basis on which the compensation should be calculated is the one issue on which the Government and I have not so far been able to agree.
<P>
My view is that a worker who is punished for acting in the public interest should be compensated in full for any loss he suffers. That follows the approach of the earlier Bills introduced by the hon. Member for Cannock Chase in 1995 and the hon. Member for Islwyn in 1996. That approach was not questioned in the House or by any respondent to the extensive consultation that was conducted in 1996 by the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood as it was then called.
<P>
That is already the approach under clause 4 for a worker who is disciplined or demoted, but not sacked. The worker will receive such compensation for his actual loss as is just and equitable. Where the worker has been at fault himself or where he has failed to mitigate his loss, that award may be reduced. The awards for victimisation, short of dismissal, are subject to neither a minimum nor a maximum sum. The same principle should apply where a worker suffers the greater penalty of dismissal. However, I have so far failed to persuade the Government that the same approach should apply to the sacked whistleblower.
<P>
As we went to consultation, the Government's preferred approach was that compensation for dismissal under the Bill should follow the precedent for health and safety representatives, under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The effect would be that a sacked worker would receive his financial losses up to œ11,300 plus in exceptional cases the penalty award of between œ16,545 and œ33,800.
<P>
My concerns are that the minimum award of œ16,545 would be made, irrespective of any loss and thus may be made in circumstances in which the tribunal does not think it just. As such, it might encourage claims that, otherwise, would not be brought. Indeed, the award might provide an irresistible temptation to people to blow whistles unjustifiably. I am equally concerned about the maximum award under this approach, which would be just under œ45,100 at current levels. That may not meet the actual losses of the higher-paid individual or the whistleblower who remains unemployed for several years after being dismissed. With such a maximum, the Bill may have less effect in the City than it needs to, as the scandals at BCCI, Barlow Clowes and the late Robert Maxwell's companies demonstrate.
<P>
To hundreds of thousands of people be they doctors in the NHS, middle managers in commerce, or highly-skilled workers in industry the Bill offers no prospect of recovering their actual losses if they are sacked for trying to stop serious malpractice. The Minister and I agreed to put this issue to the consultees, and did so in a consultation paper that was agreed by his Department. The result has been overwhelming support for my preferred approach. Indeed, for the first time, the CBI and the TUC are agreed on the correct way to compensate workers who are sacked.
<P>
I know that the Minister is as committed as I am to this measure. I also know that he will be impressed by the weight and breadth of the responses and I hope that he will be able to act on them. I also hope that the matter will be resolved before the Bill completes its passage, so that the House knows the outcome before it is asked finally to approve the measure.

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The clause places whistleblowing and the issue of compensation in the existing employment legislation framework. It allows the Secretary of State to make regulations in due course, specifying the details of calculating the compensation awards. The Bill provides for the regulations to set out the calculation for compensation on the grounds of dismissal. These will not be made until the Bill has completed its passage through Parliament. The Government's view remains that the Bill is an employment rights measure and should provide remedies in line with those that are generally available under employment legislation.
<P>
I aware of the fact that the majority of consultees who expressed a view sought unlimited compensation, based on loss, although others agreed with the Government. We need to consider the issue carefully when the regulations are made, in the context of the general limits under employment legislation. As far as the limits in compensation are concerned generally, we think that limits should be increased in line with inflation. That will improve the remedy that is provided to those people whose employment rights have been infringed or who have been made redundant.
<P>
Yesterday, in Committee, following the all-night sitting, we had a discussion about the terms and conditions of employment and the Employment Rates (Increase of Limits) Order 1998. It was rather a quiet affair. As a result, the Committee moved quickly and established new levels for compensation to come into force on 1 April 1998. I will give the Committee some idea of what the figures would be in relation to the measures that we are discussing and to the views expressed by the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills.
<P>
The hon. Member is right in saying that the minimum award under the health and safety provisions would amount to œ16,545. Under the new arrangements from 1 April, there would be a basic award of œ2,000, a compensatory award and a special award of œ14,500. There will be a basic maximum award of œ220 multiplied by 30 weeks, which amounts to œ6,600; a compensatory award of œ12,000 is added to that and a special award of œ29,000. The total, maximum figure will be œ47,600.
<P>
In the longer term, the Government want to consider the general limits in those areas and to ensure that the arrangements for reviewing them work in the best way. We want to ensure that we achieve fair maximum standards in a competitive business environment. When I discussed the Bill with the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills, I pointed out that the Government wanted to proceed along those lines because we did not want consideration of those matters to move into other areas.
<P>
Awards and compensation levels are complex matters. There are about a dozen different types of award, and different circumstances in which awards could be made, in the schedule to the Employment Rights (Increase of Limits) Order that was agreed yesterday. The Government want to consider those issues in the round and to come to some conclusions at a later date, after consultations about the best way to make decisions about awards and limits, and about the Department's role in such matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills should not see that as an attempt to weaken or undermine his proposals, but as a means of setting the proposals in the context of other matters that the Government are considering. We want to establish a common approach across the wide range of areas covering awards and the circumstances in which workers suffer detriment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister has given us some pleasing news. It is high time for a review of the limits in the legislation. The Government will now do that, and I hope that the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills will be content to agree to the clause as it stands.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment, No. 22, in page 8, line 18, leave out from beginning to "in" and insert [Mr. McCartney]
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1) Section 193 of the 1996 Act (national security) is amended as follows. (2)".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 24.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The amendments exclude the security services from the protection provided by the Bill. Protection is extended to a wide range of workers: to those who are not employees and to those who are; to civil servants and to those working in the public and in the private sectors. It is right and necessary that exclusions from that important protection should be narrow. However, it is in the nature of the security and intelligence services that their work should be secret; whistleblowing is the complete opposite of their ethos.
<P>
The amendment is in line with the Government's policy on freedom of information. The White Paper states that the security services
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"could not carry out their duties effectively in the interests of the nation if their operations and activities were subject to freedom of information legislation".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The security services will, therefore, not be covered by the Freedom of Information Bill, to which protection in relation to whistleblowing is analogous.
<P>
I commend the amendment to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Sir Teddy Taylor </B>(Rochford and Southend, East): I do not wish to hold up my hon. Friend's important and significant Bill, but I have some questions about the amendment's wording. First, are we clear beyond doubt about the definitions of "Security Service" and of "Secret Intelligence Service"? Secondly, will the exclusion apply to all persons working within the organisation? If there were a complaint about a bogus cleaning contract, should the matter be pursued? Will all people who are employed by the service, in whatever capacity, be covered by the regulations? Thirdly, what is the position on subcontracting firms that carry out work for the organisation? Is the exclusion correctly based, or are we excluding people who should not be excluded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I could reply to the hon. Gentleman, "That is a secret, and I shall not tell you," but I am sure that he would not find that a reasonable answer.
<P>
The security services are representatives of the state. Arrangements that deal with their role involve a framework that preserves confidentiality. Matters relating to the security services receive an entirely different treatment from that proposed in the Bill. I assure the hon. Gentleman that a carte blanche arrangement is not involved; the proposals deal with matters relating to national security. That approach has been adopted by Governments of all political colours and persuasions, and our views are set out in the White Paper. We want to protect the state and to ensure that information that enters the public domain does not put the state or individuals who work on its behalf at risk.
<P>
As to the Bill, we want to allow people to bring information into the public domain. I cannot say more to the hon. Gentleman, but I suspect that I may not have answered his questions. Our intentions are clear we want to protect those who represent us, in whatever capacity, in the state's security apparatus.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> The clause states that, like other provisions of the 1996 Act, the Bill's proposals will not apply to police officers.
<P>
There seems to be no good reason for denying the Bill's protection to police officers. On the contrary, such protection is especially necessary for the police, when particularly severe pressures operate on those who try to raise concerns about malpractice from within. Only last December, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis told the Select Committee on Home Affairs that he accepted that a minority of his officers were, in his words, "corrupt, dishonest, unethical". The Police Complaints Authority and the Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland urged that the police should be included in the Bill's provisions.
<P>
The chairman of the PCA, Mr. Peter Moorhouse, said, in response to consultation on the Bill:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I can see no reason why police officers should be exempted from the provisions of this Bill. To the contrary I believe it would be an important contribution to the integrity of the police service for officers to be included within the procedures."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say that an increasing number of police officers is coming forward to report malpractice. He added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Many Forces have in place provisions to support officers in this situation but officers, nonetheless, are subject to victimisation by colleagues as a result of what is perceived as `whistleblowing'."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Association of Chief Police Officers welcomed the Bill. The chief constable of Sussex, Paul Whitehouse, responding on ACPO's behalf said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I was surprised to see that it is proposed to exclude Police Officers ... I find this puzzling since Police Support Staff who may well have access to the same information will not be excluded. If I take my own case as a Police officer I would be excluded from the provisions of the Bill, but my personal Assistant, who has access to all the information that I do, would be protected by it. I believe this is wrong.
<P>
This Association has taken a very firm stance in seeking to emphasise the need for integrity in Police operations and honesty among all staff of the Police Service. Police Forces have nothing to fear from malpractices being revealed. In fact the contrary is the case Chief Officers of Police need to know where corrupt and improper practice is going on so that they may tackle it as soon and as effectively as possible".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It may be that internal whistleblowing procedures could be strengthened, and I would welcome that. However, those procedures, no matter how good they are, cannot protect a police officer who is wrongly dismissed for making a protected disclosure. That requires the protection of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for setting out the detailed reasons why he and his colleagues vigorously supported his original proposal to include the police. He has also set out the reasons why the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Police Complaints Authority question the non-inclusion of the police.
<P>
I hope to deal with that fair point in a different way. It is right that we should have a regime that means that police officers are able to put issues into the public domain. The police are currently excluded from employment legislation because, as constables, they are office holders who are subject to a separate regulatory regime.
<P>
We have explored the question of whistleblowing in the police with the Home Office, which says that the police are protected from detriment for blowing the whistle. However, the Home Office will re-examine existing statutory provisions and, if they fall short of the requirements of the Bill, will amend police legislation to ensure the same level of protection.
<P>
It is clear that the police should be covered by whistleblowing protection, but the question is how best to achieve that. The Home Office has given a commitment that the existing regulatory regime will be upgraded if necessary to make sure that the Bill and the police regulatory regime offer the same standards of protection. That is a significant move and I hope that it helps the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills.
<P>
I intend, following enactment of the Bill, to correspond with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on this matter so that we can move the process forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I am reassured by what my hon. Friend the Minister has said. The Home Affairs Committee recently considered police discipline. It is essential that honest police officers should be able to blow the whistle without being victimised. Their omission from clause 13 is surprising but, as my hon. Friend has explained that the matter is under active consideration, I look forward to amendments to legislation so that police officers who blow the whistle will be protected.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Is the Minister able to say when he thinks the corresponding legislation might reach the statute book?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is a matter for the regulatory regime to be determined by the Home Office and the police force. Once the Bill is approved, it will be incumbent on the Home Office immediately to review whether other legislation meets the requirements of the Bill. If it does not, action will be taken to ensure that it does. The programme will start as soon as the House approves the Bill. I am sure that the Home Office is watching carefully. No doubt it has taken a great deal of interest in the consultation process and will be interested in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. It is extremely helpful. Those arrangements, if met, will address my concerns.

<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> On behalf of the Government, I want to thank you, Mr. Gale, for the most efficient and effective way in which you chaired the Committee. In[Mr. McCartney]11 years in the House, I do not recall having a prospect of sitting on a winning side of a successful private Member's Bill.
<P>
The Government appreciate the actions of the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills and those who campaigned long and hard with him. This is an historic occasion. Work on this matter has gone on for more than a decade, and my colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry and I have enthusiastically assisted the process. I look forward to the Bill going to another place, returning to the House and very soon becoming part of a regulatory regime which will give honest citizens an opportunity to be protected from dishonest ones.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Gale, may I add my gratitude to that of the Minister's for your chairmanship and to all those who assisted in the process by which we got a private Member's Bill to and through a Committee? I am slightly numbed because, over the years, I have mooted and argued for private Members' Bills that have brought about Government three-line Whips on Fridays and all manner of retributive action. I find it miraculousthat I have succeeded in being an instrument for steering a private Member's Bill through a Committee.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I must express again my gratitude to the Minister for his extraordinary good grace in helping hone the Bill to what is a fair and reasonable reflection of my objectives, which reflect the work of Public Concern at Work, Guy Dehn, Maurice Frankel and, of course, hon. Members, in particular the hon. Member for Dudley, North, who is in the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank all hon. Members for their participation this morning and for their kind words. I congratulate the Minister and the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills on bringing the Bill to the Committee. By doing their homework, they have allowed it to go through smoothly and efficiently while, none the less, being well considered.
