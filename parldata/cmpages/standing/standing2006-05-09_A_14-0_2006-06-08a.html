<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000214"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> I will just
make a short set of opening remarks about the clause as we begin the
discussion on clauses 103 to 146, which will introduce the new system
of UK real estate investment trusts&#151;UK REITs. The debate follows
that in Committee of the whole House on clause 106, during which the
Under-Secretary of State forHealth, my hon. Friend the Member
for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), my predecessor as Economic Secretary, gave
a detailed account of the Government&#146;s rationale for introducing
UK REITs legislation. I am sure that we shall cover today all the
points that he made in that debate, so I will not go over that
ground.</div> <a name="06060860000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
been a lengthy period of consultation&#151;I think that for some hon.
Members it has been frustratingly lengthy. Our main aim is to ensure
that we introduce a system that has not only widespread support in the
House but support and applicability in the wider world. Following the
consultation, with two consultation documents in the past couple of
years, and the Government&#146;s detailed responses to the
consultation in recent months, the indication from the market is that
companies are getting ready for the new regime. That is an encouraging
sign. It is not possible to achieve consensus in every policy area, as
we said in our debate on another matter on Tuesday. I hope that,
following the detailed debates that we will have on amendments today,
there will be a consensus about the right way forward for the UK REIT
regime.</div><a name="06060860000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060860000215"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Francois</b> (Rayleigh) (Con): As the Economic Secretary
has said, we now come to the clauses in part 4 of the Bill, dealing
with the regime to introduce real estate investment
trusts&#151;REITs&#151;into the UK. I would like to make a few
brief introductory points on part 4 before we debate the clauses in
detail. As I pointed out on behalf of the Opposition on Second Reading,
we welcome in principle the introduction of a REIT regime into the UK.
It is an initiative that we have been advocating for some time, so we
seek to work constructively with the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 464</div>to ensure that the regime is in good order when it commences formally in
January 2007.</div> <a name="06060860000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
accept that there may be some changes to the scheme in light of
experience post-launch. For instance, we welcome the
Government&#146;s commitment to reviewing whether REITs can list on
the alternative investment market, which we advocated in the sitting of
the Committee of the whole House on 3 May, to which the Economic
Secretary referred. However, we are particularly keen to avoid
circumstances that would lead to a major rewrite of the legislation
shortly after the launch. In other words, REITs cannot be allowed to
become another SIPPs&#151;the case of self-invested personal
pensions. We therefore welcome the Government&#146;s amendments to
clause 116 and the contingent amendments to clause 130, and their
intention to delete clause 143, which was always an unnecessary
requirement for reasons that we shall come to in due course. We have
residual concerns about some of the measures in the proposed REITs
regime, not least that the system appears to do comparatively little
for the residential property
sector.</div><a name="06060860000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
brief introductory remarks, I look forward to debating the details of
part 4 with the Economic Secretary and the rest of the
Committee.</div><a name="06060860000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060860000216"></a><b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I too wish to
make some introductory remarks as we begin our discussions on part 4.
It is important to put it on the record that we welcome the
Government&#146;s proposals and can add to the consensus that has
been registered. Although REITs are increasingly used in many countries
to attract investment into the property industry, they are a new
concept for the UK and it is important that we go through all the
proposals thoroughly. It is a reflection of the Government&#146;s
consultative and co-operative approach on the proposals that they have
been so broadly welcomed, not only by the property industry, but in
this place.</div> <a name="06060860000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
result, as the Economic Secretary says, many existing commercial
property companies are tripping over themselves to convert to REIT
status as soon as they are able. That will result in greater
opportunity for individuals among the public to invest in the property
industry without exposing themselves to the risk of holding a property
individually.</div> <a name="06060860000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultative approach that I mentioned contrasts with that taken on
other issues in the Bill. It is no coincidence that that consultative
approach has resulted in largely workable proposals, while the industry
has proclaimed pretty unanimously that the proposals for changes to
trusts, put forward without any consultation, are unworkable.</div>
<a name="06060860000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the 40-odd clauses
contain many positives, I should like to highlight one thematic concern
that relates to the extent to which the proposals will result in
increased investment in the residential property sector. We know that
the existing listed commercial property companies intend to convert en
masse as soon as they are able, but how many residential property
companies does the Minister estimate will make the switch in initial
years, and how many will be eligible to do so?</div>
<a name="06060860000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">From recent media reports, we
know that the Grainger Trust, Britain&#146;s only listed residential
property company, will not convert to REIT status 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 465</div>because it does not fulfil the criteria outlined in the proposals. Its
main business is with tenanted properties&#151;old homes occupied by
former state workers paying low capped rents. The company makes its
profits by selling those properties when the tenant moves, which means
that it does not meet the interest cover test. It is affected also by
provisions relating to trading companies, under which it would pay 30
per cent. corporation tax on capital gains when it became a REIT.
However, companies holding investment property will pay no such
charge.</div> <a name="06060860000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">During our
discussion of later clauses, we shall see difficulties relating to
companies wishing to set themselves up from scratch as REITs rather
than converting from an existing company. Given that there are not so
many residential property companies, there is an initial disadvantage
to encouraging investment in that sector.</div>
<a name="06060860000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, on a slightly more
positive note, there have also been reports that 17 housing
associations, working closely with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, plan
to put together a consortium to convert to REIT status and provide
greater investment in that residential sector. I welcome that, although
there are clearly mixed messages about how attractive REITs will be for
the purposes of getting investment into the residential property
sector.</div> <a name="06060860000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
appreciate any light that the Economic Secretary can shed on how he
expects participation in REITs to break down in terms of new trusts and
converted companies and of the split between residential and commercial
properties. What more does he think his Department must do to encourage
REITs to expand more into the residential sector, where greater
investment would clearly bring the greatest
benefit?</div><a name="06060860000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000217"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) is
right to say that the consultation took some time and that the
Opposition have been pressing for faster progress during the past two
or three years, although the Government put the issue on the agenda
even further back than that. I do not think that we should apologise at
all for the fact that we have taken the time to get things right. The
hon. Gentleman said also that we must have an open mind about future
developments, while doing our best to get all the detail of the clauses
in the Bill right.</div> <a name="06060860000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that we should be able to respond to changes, developments
and new information, and we went out of our way to provide the public
and Opposition Members with the details of the regulations last
week&#151;very early, given that those details do not have to be
completed until the autumn, in time for the REIT regime to start next
year. Furthermore, clause 103 includes a purposive element to make it
clear that we expect companies to abide by the spirit of the intent
behind the Bill.</div> <a name="06060860000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for what the hon. Gentleman said about AIM, the Under-Secretary of
State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South, said in
Committee of the whole House
that</div><a name="06060860000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an extension of the
regime to include companies traded on AIM would not meet the
Government&#146;s objectives at this
stage.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 3 May 2006; Vol. 446, c.
1045.]</div><a name="06060860000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reasons for that were
fully debated. He also said:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 466</div><a name="06060860000157"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are willing to
consider any consequence of market developments and what we are
learning about what happens in the international community. We must
always be willing to consider whether we want to change the regime in
the interests of the market and clearly not to the disadvantage of the
Exchequer. Of course, we can give a commitment today, in the context of
the concerns that have been made or suggestions to do things slightly
differently, that we will keep the situation under
review.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 3 May 2006; Vol. 446,
c. 1041.]</div><a name="06060860000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what we will
do.</div><a name="06060860000172"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="06060860000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for what was
said by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy),
an amendment has been tabled to clause 107, which deals in particular
with residential property. I intend to respond to such matters when we
discuss that, although they may arise
earlier.</div><a name="06060860000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
referred to the Grainger Trust. Over the past few weeks, several
significant top-listed companies, including British Land, Hammerson,
Land Securities, Brixton and Great Portland Estates, have announced
that they will be converting to the UK REITs regime from next January.
The main focus of their business is commercial property and together
they have valued more than &#163;25 billion worth of assets. Those
companies, along with the British Property Federation and others, have
also been significant participants in the consultation process. The
fact that they are now willing to start the process of being ready for
conversion shows that the consultation has worked and that, at this
stage, we have a good chance of a thriving REITs regime from next
January.</div><a name="06060860000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
FTSE-listed company with a major portfolio of residential assets is
Grainger Trust, which announced on 5 June that it would not be
converting. The reason is that the business model that it employed is
not the kind of business model that we aim to support under the Bill.
It is a business model whereby a substantial proportion of income is
derived from renting out property. Grainger said that it will not be
converting because it will not meet the interest cover test, as a large
part of its business involves not deriving income from renting out
property, but buying tenanted properties with low-capped rents, which
have insufficient rental income to its interest payments, and then
making a profit through selling the properties on at a gain when the
occupiers
move.</div><a name="06060860000035"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000218"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> The Economic Secretary has just made an
extraordinary statement. The whole REITs regime is about renting
property and the fact that it is residential property is the key
point.</div><a name="06060860000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000219"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> We shall debate residential property when we reach
clause 107.</div><a name="06060860000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
saying that Grainger does not derive its income from renting property.
A substantial proportion of its income comes from making gains on the
sale of property. The actual income that it derives from the renting of
property is low. Even though as part of the consultation we have
substantially reduced the interest cover test, it is still a test that
would not allow Grainger to pass because it does not derive the
majority of its income from renting out property. It instead goes about

<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 467</div>a different business seeking to make the bulk of its returns from
capital gains on the appreciation in the value of the
property.</div><a name="06060860000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we made
clear all along in the consultation and have debated many times, that
is not the business model that we are trying to support under the Bill.
We do not think that it will have a significant impact, and the FT
article to which the hon. Lady referred acknowledged that both Grainger
and other companies, including housing associations, are considering
floating new residential UK REITs from next
year.</div><a name="06060860000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060860000220"></a><b class="B">Ms
Celia Barlow</b> (Hove) (Lab): I welcome the
Government&#146;s proposition to introduce real estate investment
trusts. As the majority of the industry recognises, the Bill provides a
practical framework for that and the idea has a high probability of
being a success, as recently seen in other countries such as the United
States and France. I was encouraged to hear the hon. Member for
Rayleigh welcome the proposals. The financial markets also seem to
regard them as a great investment opportunity, but our primary concern
should be somewhere
else.</div><a name="06060860000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The area that I
represent is suffering from a severe shortage of available,
particularly affordable housing. Furthermore, Hove has the highest
proportion of houses in multiple occupation outside London. My argument
is that we should not lose sight of the original purpose, which is to
provide better housing. The Government have decided to make REITs
available to residential and commercial property. I support that
idea.</div> <a name="06060860000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Second
Reading debate on 24 April, the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire (Sir George Young) argued that REITs should focus on
residential property. What he left out was that the Conservative scheme
of housing investment trusts (HITs) was a failure and had never taken
off. The benefit to the residential housing market was zero as the
regulations were too restrictive. I am glad that the Government have
not repeated that mistake. The example of HITs shows the risk of making
one investment vehicle available instead of giving the industry the
flexibility to invest in various projects. That wise decision
notwithstanding, we should not lose sight of the fact that REITs were
originally considered an opportunity to channel money into more
residential housing projects.</div>
<a name="06060860000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2003, the interim report of
the Barker review stated
that</div><a name="06060860000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in recent years,
direct institutional investment in residential property is very low in
the UK...Given the benefits that may result from greater
institutional investment, and the role REITs play in other
countries&#146; housing economies, there may be merit in the
Government looking at ways to promote greater interaction between
institutional investors and the residential property
market.&#148;</div><a name="06060860000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
recent debates in the financial press, which have been referred to, and
the policy documents issued on the scheme, the purpose of the
legislation seems to have taken a back seat. I do not need to stress
how badly my region of south-east England is affected by a shortage of
decent and affordable homes. Any solutions to improve the shortage of

suggestion that REITs in the residential sector might not be popular?
Will he clarify the scope of the new REITs and the fact that they are
designed to provide an opportunity to invest in better housing
provision, not just more
housing?</div><a name="06060860000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060860000221"></a><b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): I welcome you to
the Chair, Mr. Benton. Following on from that excellent contribution
from my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow), could the Economic
Secretary say what research the Government have done on whether REITs
will increase, decrease or have no effect on the price of residential
property?</div> <a name="06060860000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
things that plagues us in the UK, particularly in the south-east of
England but all over the country as well, including hot spots in
Scotland and Wales, is the shortage of properties. Together with a
growing population, that has led to high residential property prices.
If REITs are introduced and a flood of money goes into the residential
property market, for example as REITs start buying up residential
properties to rent out, I am concerned that that will exacerbate the
problem. There will be higher house prices and nothing will be done to
address the underlying shortage of residential properties within the
UK.</div> <a name="06060860000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, does the
Economic Secretary think that the introduction of REITs will affect
residential properties in the UK? If so, in what way? Secondly, does he
think that REITs will encourage more building and a greater supply of
residential properties within the
UK?</div><a name="06060860000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000222"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> We will have other opportunities to provide some of
the details as we go along. As we made clear in the debate on the Floor
of the House, REITs are a way of improving the efficiency of the
housing market and encouraging more people to invest in housing by
using pool vehicles. We hope that they will allow for a greater volume,
efficiency and flexibility in the use of that investment.</div>
<a name="06060860000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">REITs are part of a wider
strategy to encourage more investment in UK housing. That is why they
were one of the recommendations of the Barker review, which reported in
2003. It recommended that we pursue the UK REIT regime precisely to
deliver the objectives of my hon. Friends. Those included improving the
supply of housing in the UK and therefore tackling the problem of the
substantial increase in the price of housing relative to earnings for
first-time buyers&#151;a substantial problem facing many families,
particularly in the southern parts of our country but all across the
country. The Barker review and the Government, which endorsed the
conclusions of the review, both consider it to be fundamentally a
problem of a lack of housing supply. I do not think that the REIT
regime, in and of itself, impacts on the volume of the supply of
housing as opposed to market efficiency. Therefore, we do not think
that introducing UK REITs, in and of itself, will have a significant
impact on aggregate prices. However, we hope that REITs, along with the
other reforms that we are introducing that originated in the Barker
review, will have a significant impact over time on the supply of
available UK housing and on prices for first-time 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 469</div>buyers and others, thereby having a beneficial impact on the stability
of the British economy and the affordability and fairness of our
housing
system.</div><a name="06060860000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000223"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I understood the Minister to say that he did not
think that REITs would themselves have an impact on the supply of
housing, although other Barker review reforms might. Although I am not
an economist, it seems to me that greater investment in housing without
an increase in supply is likely to lead to increasing prices unless the
investment is in things such as
refurbishment.</div><a name="06060860000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000224"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The fundamental thrust of the Barker review is to
increase the supply of housing in our country both so that more houses
are available, and so that there are more houses at an affordable
price. The review has a number of different strands: reforms to the
planning system, the management and planning of infrastructure and the
availability and supply of social housing.</div>
<a name="06060860000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Kate Barker recommended as part
of the overall package that we should also consider ways to increase
the efficiency of the building industry, and she made some
recommendations about skills and planning for skills. She also made
recommendations about the efficiency with which people are able to
invest in the commercial property sector. In our view, that package of
measures, which we are taking forward, will reduce prices for
first-time buyers and increase the supply of housing.</div>
<a name="06060860000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">As an economist, I bow to the
legal and economic knowledge of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West (Rob Marris). He is right: if we increase the supply, we
ought to be able to reduce the price. That is our intention. What I
said was that I did not think that the UK REIT regime, in and of
itself, would increase the overall supply of residential housing, but I
thought that it would improve the market&#146;s efficiency. But the
Government think that the overall package will have a positive impact,
implementing the Barker
review.</div><a name="06060860000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060860000225"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): If I can throw a
business man&#146;s perspective into the witches&#146; brew of an
economist and a lawyer, to help the Economic Secretary out, I would
argue that an increase in supply of capital into an attractive REIT
market could push down the cost of capital and the price of houses. The
profit motive is what drives REITs. At the end of the day, more capital
flowing into an attractive REIT regime could, hopefully, push down
prices.</div><a name="06060860000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000226"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s economics
lesson, and I shall endeavour to reflect on it
further.</div><a name="06060860000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK
residential private rental sector is a rather small part of the overall
housing market. To make a significant impact on supply and price, we
must consider building houses in the purchase market. That is the
thrust of the Barker
review.</div><a name="06060860000057"></a>

<a name="06060860000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000228"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I will answer them one by one.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 470</div><a name="06060860000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said at the beginning, the
prospect of a consensus on REITs today is encouraging. It is worrying
that we still have some way to go before we come anywhere near a
consensus on implementation of the Barker review. We had only to listen
to Prime Minister&#146;s questions yesterday to hear the Conservative
party&#146;s concerns about Government proposals to increase the
supply of housing, because although those proposals might make it
easier for first-time buyers to make a purchase, they are causing
concern to some Conservative Members&#146; constituents. Indeed, if
one does a short survey of the comments seen on Conservative
Members&#146; websites regarding constituents&#146; views on
particular development opportunities, one finds that we are some way
short of a consensus, certainly with Opposition Members, on those
issues. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Indeed, the shadow Housing Minister has
not been shy of objecting to a few different housing
developments.</div> <a name="06060860000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we
have some way to go, but the Barker proposals more broadly will have an
impact on those wider supply issues. As to its impact on residential
property, the REIT regime is much more about making the market work in
a more efficient, open and transparent way, which will benefit
investors and the City of London. I hope that that clears up the
point.</div><a name="06060860000173"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="06060860000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060860000229"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I note the
Economic Secretary&#146;s comments about supply, but I think the hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West was asking about the effect on
demand. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would clarify
the point about the impact of REITs on the demand for
property.</div>
<a name="06060860000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000230"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The fundamental problem in Britain is that of
supply. What drives the price is restrictions on supply over a long
period, and what will affect the aggregate price will be finding
ways&#151;with consensus&#151;to remove restrictions on the overall
supply of housing. Given the size of the sector we are discussing, the
demand-side effects are trivial in comparison with the much bigger
overall effects of the supply side, and would not wash in any sensible
comparison.</div> <a name="06060860000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
apologies to my hon. Friend the. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West,
it would not take us very far to be drawn into an arcane debate about
how things may actually work, which will depend on factors relating to
particular sets of elasticities. In the end, the big issue in terms of
price is supply, and so far as the impact on the residential sector is
concerned, UK REITs will not tackle the supply issue. The decisions
need to be made
elsewhere.</div><a name="06060860000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060860000231"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): We all recognise
the supply-demand situation. Obviously, REITs will make a contribution,
whatever it is, and the consequences may not be clear for a little
while. However, as to the cost of housing, especially residential
housing, it is the cost of land that is the problem. Available land is
getting scarcer, particularly in my part of the world where there are
more and more areas of outstanding natural beauty and more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 471</div>planning restraints, therefore the cost of land is increasing. If there
is a significant increase in the money available because of REITs,
would that not enable land prices to rise? If that happens, we will not
get any further
forward.</div><a name="06060860000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000232"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer that I
gave to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), as
the same point applies. In respect of the REITs regime, its impact on
the residential and private rented sector, which will be the same in
Cornwall and Devon as it is in the rest of the country, will not be
large enough for changes at the margin to have a significant effect on
the overall level of land and house prices. Therefore, although I
understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, they need to be
addressed to other routes in the planning system and the way in which
the housing supply is managed and improved.</div>
<a name="06060860000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are having a broad debate
about housing policy, which is very interesting and important, but it
is not particularly relevant to the UK REITs legislation which, in and
of itself, will not solve the problem; that needs to be solved by
measures elsewhere. With your permission, Mr. Benton, we should agree
the clause and move on.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000233"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> Before we debate the clause in detail, I welcome
you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. I want to take this opportunity to raise
one of the key issues relating to the REITs regime as it is currently
proposed: namely, that the regime is written principally for commercial
property and seems likely to do much less to stimulate the residential
property market in the UK. That theme cropped up in our discussion on
part 4 this morning. By way of example: a number of the principal
commercial property companies in the United Kingdom announced recently
that they are planning to convert wholly or partly to REIT status.
Those companies include British Land, Hammerson and Land Securities,
but the list is growing.</div>
<a name="06060860000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Few, if any, of the residential
property companies have declared an intention to convert to REIT
status, however. So I am seeking to open a debate about that apparent
weakness in the regime, to investigate why that might be and to suggest
at least a few areas that might be worthy of consideration in order to
try to remedy the situation. Given the background in housing and
finance of my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire, I
suspect that he might also have something to say on that subject, if he
is lucky enough to catch your eye at some point, Mr.
Benton.</div><a name="06060860000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In view of the
current balance between commercially and privately rented property,
that is a particular issue in the United Kingdom property market.
According to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 472</div>the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the private rented sector
currently accounts for one in ten households in the UK. A 2002 report
produced jointly by Shelter and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation entitled
&#147;Private Renting: A New Settlement&#148; estimated that
investment in excess of &#163;1 billion per annum is required to
maintain the private rented sector at that level of market share, as it
were. To enlarge that markedly&#151;the report did not define
that&#151;would require investment in the region of &#163;3 billion
pounds per annum.</div> <a name="06060860000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
vast bulk of private sector investment in the UK property market,
however, is still weighted heavily in favour of the commercial rather
than the private residential sector, which is in marked contrast with a
number of our European counterparts. In fact, the RICS estimated that
in the Netherlands, 43 per cent. of total institutional property
investment is in residential property. That compares with 26 per cent.
in France,20 per cent. in Denmark and only 1 per cent. in the
United Kingdom.</div><a name="06060860000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
RICS paper commented on that
phenomenon:</div><a name="06060860000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Research
has shown that there is a high level of institutional investor interest
in the private rented sector although a number of barriers to entry
still remain. These barriers include market and political risks, the
small scale and amateur nature of most landlords, small lot sizes and
high transaction costs, the difficulty of assembling a portfolio that
will yield adequate returns, high cost and poor quality management.
These factors are amongst the reasons why the exposure of UK
institutions is much lower than most other European
countries.&#148;</div><a name="06060860000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was hoped
that the introduction of the REITs regime would help to address some of
those issues and to boost investment in the residential sector, but it
is not clear that the regime, at least as it is now configured, is well
designed to do that.</div>
<a name="06060860000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going back slightly, the
combined response by the British Property Federation, the International
Property Forum and the RICS to the Government&#146;s original
consultation on property investment funds&#151;PIFs&#151;as UK
REITs were originally known, suggested that they have the potential to
generate major investment interest in the residential private property
sector, and possibly also to fund registered social landlord
developments, depending on the structure applied to the regime.
Incidentally, that response noted that in the United States residential
REIT investment accounts for about 15 per cent. of the total listed
REITs sector.</div> <a name="06060860000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
recently, having seen the new proposed regime, the BPF
said:</div><a name="06060860000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;One
difficulty for the private rented residential sector is that it is
relatively small in the UK, at only 10% of the total residential stock
and while it has served the higher end of the rental market well, there
has been comparatively little servicing of the intermediate rental
sectors, though there is growing evidence of activity in these areas by
housing associations and possibly this is something that could in
future be developed by residential REITS with the appropriate
regulatory
framework.&#148;</div><a name="06060860000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall have more to say on that in a
moment.</div><a name="06060860000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Government have admittedly made a number of alterations to the regime
in response to the consultation exercise&#151;the Economic Secretary
intimated that during deliberation on the previous clause&#151;the
regime as it is now configured still contains a number of features that
make it relatively unattractive to companies that specialise in
residential property. The first of these is the taxation regime itself 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 473</div>and specifically the treatment of residential properties that have
traditionally been held on trading accounts. We will deal with that in
more detail when we reach clause 111, so I do not propose to reprise
that whole argument now, suffice it to say that unless this is
meaningfully addressed it threatens to act as a significant barrier to
residential property companies seeking to achieve REIT
status.</div> <a name="06060860000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
impediment is the condition that a UK REIT must be listed on a
recognised stock exchange, such as the London stock exchange, and
cannot be listed on smaller and more lightly regulated markets, such as
AIM. This issue is a particular drawback for residential companies,
which tend to be smaller in both market capitalisation and turnover
than their commercial counterparts and which might not be suited to
full listing on the stock exchange, but which, conversely, might be
able to do well on
AIM.</div><a name="06060860000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, according
to the <i class="I">Daily Telegraph</i>, some 60 property companies are listed on
AIM at present, and between them they raised some &#163;750 million
in the first quarter of 2006 alone. Before the Economic Secretary
retorts that the refusal to allow REITs to list on AIM is to reduce
risks for investors, I would just remind him of the interview that he
gave to the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> on23 May, when he argued
in favour of light-touch regulation in principle in the City, and as a
result of which the paper reported:</div>
<a name="06060860000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ed Balls, the new
Minister for the City, insisted yesterday that London must retain its
&#145;light-touch and risked based regulatory
regime&#146;&#148;.</div>
<a name="06060860000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Andrew Flounders, from the law
firm Cobbetts, argued that to imply that AIM is not sufficiently
regulated to be included in the scheme is unreasonable. As he put
it:</div> <a name="06060860000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
majority of investment managers are highly qualified and experienced in
matters of financial risk and so would be able to identify whether or
not an AIM-listed company is a good investment opportunity or imposes
too many risks.&#148;</div>
<a name="06060860000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a broader debate about
the spread of REITs to markets such as AIM, which to some extent we
covered in the Committee of the whole House. But, it is worth
reiterating that this condition could act as a particular disincentive
for residential property companies to convert to REIT status, not least
because many of them may not hold sufficient properties, which are
already highly regulated in terms of their rental income, to justify
them seeking to convert to residential REIT status with a full listing
on the London stock
exchange.</div><a name="06060860000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Angus
McIntosh, a partner and head of research at property consultants King
Sturge, pointed out:</div>
<a name="06060860000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;One of the main
advantages to the Government is that it can use the REIT market to
privately finance public initiatives, such as schools and social
housing...By limiting restrictions on AIM, it will slow down its own
public-private agenda. The Government needs to think outside the
box.&#148;</div> <a name="06060860000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third issue that I want to highlight in this context is the restriction
on owner-occupied properties being included in the tax exempt portion
of a REIT. While there may be good reasons for this, if interpreted
literally, it could act as a bar to residential REITs which want to
have a mixed portfolio including, say, shared ownership properties
within their tax exempt business. Could the Economic Secretary clarify
how shared ownership properties qualify in this context? For 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 474</div>instance, were a residential property REIT eventually to be formed,
which included in its portfolio both rented and shared ownership
properties, would profits from both categories of property be included
within the tax exempt business? And, for good measure, what would
happen to the taxation of the gain if the remaining portion of a shared
ownership property were sold to the part-owner/part-tenant in due
course? </div><a name="06060860000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly,
what interaction does the Economic Secretary foresee, if any, between
the REITs concept and housing associations? That has already cropped up
and interests a number of hon. Members, not least because housing
associations are now the major providers of social housing in this
country, particularly given the trend towards block transfer of social
housing stock from local authorities to registered social landlords,
principally housing associations, which was largely initiated by the
previous Conservative Government but which the Labour party has
continued, with certain alterations, while in
office.</div><a name="06060860000174"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="06060860000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors pointed out in a recent paper, which
it kindly prepared for me on this subject, that housing associations
may face certain impediments in seeking to convert to REIT status, not
least the listing requirements that I referred to earlier. In addition,
the 2 per cent. entry charge could represent a considerable cost for
housing associations that have a sizeable
portfolio.</div><a name="06060860000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such points
were echoed in a recent paper by the Affordable Rural Housing
Commission, on the ability, or otherwise, of housing associations to
convert to REIT status. If we are ever to do anything ambitious about
social housing in this country, housing associations will need to be
actively involved, but the REIT regime is not configured to facilitate
that. As housing associations are among the largest landlords in most
parts of the country, will the Minister indicate the role, if any, that
he envisages housing associations will play in the REIT
regime?</div><a name="06060860000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that
we shall not solve all of the problems this morning. As Clint Eastwood
famously said, a man&#146;s got to know his limitations. However,
from my perspective the REITs regime seems to have been drafted with
commercial property principally in mind, and to be much less ambitious
in relation to residential property. That is somewhat disappointing
given the challenges that the country faces on housing policy, and
arguably it is a missed opportunity that the Government should not have
passed up.</div><a name="06060860000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
sought to initiate a debate this morning and I hope that that debate
will be revisited by other parties as the regime is rolled out. I look
forward to hearing contributions from other Committee members and to
the Minister&#146;s
reply.</div><a name="06060860000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060860000234"></a><b class="B">Sir
George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I welcome you
to the Chair, Mr. Benton, and I declare, yet again, my entry in the
Register of Members&#146; Interests. As a footnote to the speech made
by my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh I want to say that I believe
this part of the Bill to be the most interesting. That may not be
setting a high threshold, but a new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 475</div>vehicle is being introduced by these provisions, and they will secure a
better operation of the property
market.</div><a name="06060860000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remain
concerned about the issue that I mentioned in the debate on 3 May,
because a vehicle that was designed for one purpose is now going to be
used for another. Originally we had in mind a family saloon that would
be at home on the residential estates of this country, whereas we are
now getting a corporate limousine that would be more at home in the
City and in the country&#146;s office blocks and industrial
centres.</div><a name="06060860000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we heard
in the earlier debate, the original concept of a REIT, or a HIT, or a
PIF, was to promote investment in residential property, and I think
that that is still the Government&#146;s objective, because in the
Budget speech the Chancellor
said:</div><a name="06060860000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
attract more capital into house building, we are now legislating to

Secretary&#146;s predecessor was pressed on what would actually
happen after 1 January 2007, he conceded that the initial impact of the
measure would be not on the residential sector but on the commercial
sector. He
said:</div><a name="06060860000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At this
stage the introduction of a UK REIT is intended to improve the
situation for existing companies, but as a consequence of doing that we
expect new companies to emerge in the
marketplace.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 3 May 2006; Vol.
445,c. 1040.]</div><a name="06060860000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
words, there is no certainty that things are going to happen, but
merely an expectation or a hope that there will be the response that
the Economic Secretary and other Members in the Committee
desire.</div><a name="06060860000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The midwife
for REITs, as has already been mentioned, was Kate Barker. At the time
of the 2003 Budget, she was asked to conduct a review of issues
affecting housing supply in the UK. She was not asked to look at the
commercial or office sectors, nor any other sector. When she published
her interim report, she noted that the level of institutional
investment in residential property in the UK was relatively low, and
that there was a case for a new investment vehicle to encourage growth
in such investment.</div>
<a name="06060860000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">She summarised the arguments
for that in paragraphs 7.32 and 7.33,
saying:</div><a name="06060860000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Despite
the strong performance of property compared with other assets in recent
years direct institutional investment in residential property is very
low in the UK&#148;,</div><a name="06060860000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
contrasting that with what happens in other countries, referring also
to the history of housing investment trusts. When we reach clause 144,
which winds up the HITs, it might be useful to have a gentle debate
about why those did not take off&#151;there was extensive
consultation&#151;and what action the Government took after 1996 to
find out why they did not work and, if necessary, to change the
regime.</div><a name="06060860000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The response
to the important point made by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West about the impact on supply is in paragraph 7.35 of the
Barker report, which states:</div>
<a name="06060860000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These submissions have
argued that changes to the tax system would encourage greater
institutional investment in property which might have positive benefits
for housing supply&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 476</div><a name="06060860000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to list the reasons, namely
that</div><a name="06060860000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the quality of
private rented stock may improve through greater investment in the
physical fabric...given a guaranteed institutional buyer, house
builders may be more willing to increase supply; and...long-term
investment may promote greater stability in the market, as
institutional investors are typically less reliant on debt financing,
and thus less vulnerable to interest rate
changes.&#148;</div><a name="06060860000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">So Kate Barker
took head-on the powerful argument deployed by the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West that it is necessary to do something on the
supply side as well as on the demand side.</div>
<a name="06060860000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the report was published,
the Government embarked on some consultation. At that point, the
concept of REITs was changed from what Barker had originally
envisaged&#151;that they should be purely for residential
property&#151;to a broader vehicle that would embrace commercial
property. That was received with alacrity by the commercial property
sector. The shares were all marked up and the debate then moved away
from what we ought to do about residential property to commercial
property, and there was a debate about the entry charge and all the
rest of it. The Government recognised that it was always going to be
difficult to get institutional investment in the residential market,
because in their second discussion paper, which was, I think, published
last year, they
said:</div><a name="06060860000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In line
with recommendations in Kate Barker's Review of Housing Supply, reform
would also aim to address the unresponsive supply of housing through
greater institutional investor participation in the residential
market.&#148;</div><a name="06060860000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later,
we shall consider my amendment to clause 218. My hopes are rising
because, before we have even reached that, I have heard speeches from
two other parties indicating sympathy for what I am trying to do,
namely to ensure that the energies that are released by this new
investment vehicle are directed towards the housing market. I hope
that, before he reaches my amendment, the Economic Secretary will speak
to the Minister for Housing and Planning, because she might well be
very sympathetic to the objectives behind it.</div>
<a name="06060860000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this stage, all that I want
to do is to reiterate this question: during the whole consultation
process, when the Government were clearly in dialogue with the
commercial property sector, what parallel dialogue was taking place
with the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the housing
associations&#151;the residential sector&#151;to ensure that when 1
January 2007 arrived there was something on the runway waiting to take
off rather than, as we heard in the debate on 3 May, a general hope or
expectation that if they introduced this measure there would be a
response?</div> <a name="06060860000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case
for residential investment is far stronger than that for more
investment in the commercial and office market. Of course, we need
better offices, and we probably need more of them, but the housing
market is the one that needs the investment. The Treasury seems to have
responded disproportionately to the commercial aspect of the issue to
the neglect of the residential sector. Can the Economic Secretary go
beyond the rather disappointing response that we had on 3 May and give
us some hope that this is a top priority and that every energy is being
exercised&#151;not just by the Treasury but by the relevant
Departments&#151;to ensure that the opportunity is seized, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 477</div>that they hit the ground running and that we get the extra investment in
housing that I am sure all hon. Members want to
see?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000235"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> We have had a wide-ranging debate that anticipates
amendments on future clauses. The orderly thing for me to do is to
respond to the general issues raised by the right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire that anticipate his amendment No. 218 and to
respond in detail to that amendment when we come to clause
107.</div><a name="06060860000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">It slightly
concerns me that the right hon. Gentleman gave the impression that our
response to the consultation exercise was disproportionate. One of the
strengths of the consultation is that the Government have been willing
to respond to a number of concerns to make sure that the regime works
well.</div> <a name="06060860000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">A moment ago, I
glanced at the progress that we made as a result of the consultation.
We reduced the interest rate cover test from 2.5 per cent. to 1.25 per
cent. in direct response to concerns from the industry, and we will
debate that when we come to clause 115. We reduced the minimum
requirement on net profits to be distributed from 95 per cent. to 90
per cent., and we will debate that when we come to clause 107. We moved
to a much more flexible position on the 10 per cent. shareholding
limit, as a result of which Liz Pearce, the chief executive of the
British Property Federation, made the following comment:</div>
<a name="06060860000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Government has listened
to the property industry&#146;s views and concerns. We are certainly
optimistic that UK-REITS will make a significant contribution both to
the UK property industry and to the country&#146;s wider economic
success.&#148;</div><a name="06060860000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
endorsement of the consultation process. It shows that the Government
have listened and responded to make UK REITs
work.</div><a name="06060860000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was slightly
concerned that the right hon. Gentleman was suggesting that we
responded too much. Responding properly to points made to us in a
consultation exercise is the right way to go about
things.</div>
<a name="06060860000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000236"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> We are happy that the British Property
Federation welcome the proposals, but it largely represents commercial,
rather than residential, property companies. I hope that the Economic
Secretary will come to representatives of residential property
companies who have also welcomed the
proposals.</div>
<a name="06060860000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000237"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The point I was making was that, in our
consultation, we listened to a number of detailed points put to us
from, in particular, the commercial property sector, but also from
others. We have responded to those concerns. I was anxious that the
right hon. Gentleman might be suggesting that the concerns of the
commercial property sector and the City have been listened to too much,
and I made the point that we had not been disproportionate but had done
the right thing in responding to those concerns to make sure that the
list of commercial companies who sign up to UK REITs is substantial and
significant. I do not think that Conservative Members think we were
wrong to listen to those concerns and respond in that way. They are
making the point that we ought to do more in other areas as well, which
is fine, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column477" />Column number: 478</div>but the rhetoric about listening too much to people from the City in
Jaguars seemed to me to be a view that their Front-Bench spokesmen
would not necessarily share.</div>
<a name="06060860000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000238"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I acknowledge that the Government conducted a
detailed consultation exercise and that they changed a number of
aspects of the regime as a result. We all realise that. However, for
clarification, bearing in mind that a number of commercial property
companies have announced that they intend to apply for REITs status,
how many residential property companies have made a similar
announcement?</div>
<a name="06060860000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000239"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I will answer that point in a second because I was
going to come on to the issues concerning the residential sector.
Without wanting to dwell too much on it, I was making the point that,
in the early stages of his career when he was a Minister, the right
hon. Gentleman probably pioneered the concept of arriving at the House
of Commons on a bicycle. That concept has since been followed by
others. However, we should not downplay the important role that the
City of London and the commercial property sector play in our economy.
He referred to my interview. As the Minister with responsibility for
the City, I think that a thriving commercial property market in London,
which will be delivered through the way in which we responded to the
consultation, is good for the British economy and for the City. We
should not downplay the importance of our response to the commercial
property sector. It is an important part of the process. I will come to
the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s points in a minute.</div>
<a name="06060860000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point that was made a
moment ago by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, I listed three
different ways in which we responded to the consultation in three
different areas. One of those ways was by reducing the distribution
test from 95 per cent. to 90 per cent. That point was put to us during
the consultation by, in particular, representatives of the residential
sector. Our response also reflected the concerns of the residential
sector. The consultation was overseen by my predecessor, so I was not
directly involved in it, but I understand that it was widespread, and
it certainly considered points put to us by the residential as well as
the commercial
sector.</div>
<a name="06060860000175"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="06060860000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
balance between residential and commercial property. As the right hon.
Gentleman said, UK REITs are responding to the demand for pooled
investment in the residential and commercial property sectors that has
been seen in Britain and around the world. We have learned lessons from
other countries, where all types of property can be invested in by
REITs, and that is the approach that we are taking in the UK REIT
regime. It has always been our intention to support investment in the
commercial, as well as the residential, sector.</div>
<a name="06060860000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consultation document that
we published in 2004 was entitled &#147;Promoting more flexible
investment in property&#148;. In it we discussed the importance of
both the commercial and the residential sectors. The difference between
the commercial and residential sectors is that commercial properties
are usually rented but that the majority of properties in the
residential 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column478" />Column number: 479</div>sector are owner-occupied. As we say in the consultation document, the
UK residential housing market is dominated by the owner-occupied
sector. If one looks historically at why that is so, and therefore at
why our private rented residential sector has developed so slowly over
many decades, I suggest that the predominant reason&#151;I think that
Kate Barker would agree&#151;is that restrictions in supply in the
UK, along with a growing demand for housing, have made it possible for
owner-occupiers to make substantial capital gains on housing; and that
has encouraged people in that direction rather than in renting out
their homes. That is why the points that I made to my hon. Friend the
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West
stand.</div><a name="06060860000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fundamental
problem in the UK has been a supply-side one, and that is the main
driver for the UK private market being small, although I hope that it
will soon be growing. Before 1997, the Conservative Government tried to
address that issue. The right hon. Gentleman asked what lessons we had
learned from the HIPs regime, and why it did not take off. The scheme
was introduced in that Government&#146;s later years; they were
probably frustrated by their lack of progress over many years in
turning around the low level of investment in the private residential
sector. He will probably agree that the regime did not work; in our
view, it was too prescriptive and insufficiently flexible and thus did
not attract capital.</div>
<a name="06060860000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying to deliver a
regime that will be more flexible and more appropriate for residential
property investors. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but
an important part of our consultation was to learn from past failures
in order to find ways that we could be more successful. I am grateful
to the right hon. Gentleman for reminding me of some of the problems
that were experienced in the past so that we can try to build upon
them.</div> <a name="06060860000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Barker
review was clear that the predominant problem was a supply-side one but
that things could be done to improve the investment regime for
residential property. That is why one of the recommendations in her
interim report was to find ways to increase institutional participation
in the private sector, as it would bring benefits through greater
professionalism, improved standards of rented stock and a more
efficient investment market. That is exactly what we want to achieve
with the REITs regime. We want to encourage greater investment in
residential as well as in commercial property.</div>
<a name="06060860000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although, as the hon. Member
for Rayleigh said, a number of the companies that initially said that
they would establish a UK REIT were large companies in the commercial
sector, the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> and our own private researches
suggest that a number of residential sector investors are considering
switching to a UK REIT regime. It is not for me to give their names or
to pre-empt the processes that they need to go through. The very nature
of the business, as described by the hon. Member for Rayleigh, and the
fact that these are likely to be smaller companies than the very large
ones that I listed earlier means that they need to take time to work
out how they will deal with this matter and work out the manner in
which it will be done.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column479" />Column number: 480</div><a name="06060860000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, by the time that we get to
the beginning of 2007, we have not seen significant residential
investors establishing UK REITs, that will be a cause for concern. I
said to the hon. Gentleman earlier that we would be keeping such
matters under review, and that is one of the issues that we will need
to look at closely. I do not think that we can conclude, at this stage,
that the UK residential sector will not engage in this market. In fact,
as I said, the early indications are the opposite, but we will
definitely keep that under
review.</div><a name="06060860000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, we
hope and believe that providing a vehicle for the residential as well
as the commercial sectors will allow pension funds, charities and other
institutions to invest in residential property and will provide a
better and more efficient alternative to the individual buy-to-let
market that we have seen over the past few years. We hope that that
will have a significant impact on the private rented and commercial
sectors.</div><a name="06060860000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06060860000240"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): Would the Economic Secretary
agree that the measure imposes an unnecessary obstacle to small and
medium-sized companies that are seeking to invest in the residential
sector and that might also, for good commercial reason, wish to list on
the AIM market, rather than the main market? Would he consider
introducing an amendment to the
Bill?</div><a name="06060860000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000241"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> As I progress through the points made in
interventions by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire, I was
moving in the direction of answering directly the four points put to me
by the hon. Member for Rayleigh. If I do so now, that will take on
board the points made by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr.
Dunne).</div><a name="06060860000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Rayleigh made four points about clause 111, AIM, shared
ownership properties and housing associations. I shall address each of
those in turn. The first point, which we will debate in detail when we
come to amendment No. 209 to clause 111, concerns the trading stock
rules, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. The trading stock rules are
one reason, according to published press reports, why Grainger&#151;a
listed property company that owns residential property&#151;will not
be converting.</div><a name="06060860000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot comment on the particular needs of any individual company, but
just to provide some clarification on this point and to reiterate
points made consistently through the consultation process, we are
providing in the Bill a much more generous tax regime for investors
investing in bricks and mortar, for whom the substantial portion of
their income comes from renting. That is why we are providing in the
Bill a clear ring fence between activity that is appropriate for tax
exemption&#151;the rental income&#151;and activity that is not,
such as trading profits. Many of the debates that we will have later
will, potentially, be about exactly how the line is drawn between
schedule 1 and schedule 4
activities.</div><a name="06060860000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
company can join the regime, provided that at least 75 per cent. of its
activity is in rental income. That provision is consistent with the
experience of other regimes around the world and has survived intact
through the consultation process. There is no reason why that
requirement should impact on residential 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column480" />Column number: 481</div>property with a more deleterious effect relative to commercial property.
We are trying to ensure that we support investment for the long term in
the rental market, rather than finding ways in which we could tax
advantage the short-term dipping in and out of investment for capital
gains purposes. We have been consistent about that. As the hon. Member
for Rayleigh said, we can debate that again when we come to clause 111.
However, the tax models that we have put in place achieve our
objectives while protecting the Exchequer and do not impact negatively
on the residential sector relative to the commercial property
sector.</div><a name="06060860000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s second point was about the alternative investment
market. As he said, we debated that in detail on the Floor of the
House. Also, we made it clear that, in our view, excluding AIM is
right, but we have said that we will keep the matter under review. To
reiterate briefly the points made on the Floor of the House, we have
never said&#151;and it would be wrong to say&#151;that AIM is an
unregulated exchange; it is not. It exists to provide small companies
with a regime with an even lighter touch, in order to encourage them
into listing before they move on to the more onerous requirements of a
full listing, which involves regulation not simply from the exchange
itself but from the Financial Services Authority. That is what occurs
when one moves into a full listing on the stock exchange.</div>
<a name="06060860000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have encouraged the
development of AIM precisely to allow that progression. One of the
great strengths of AIM is that it has taken off and grown substantially
in recent years, providing such a progression in London. Companies
start off under the AIM regime precisely because they do not have to
take on the full regulatory burden or provide the protection for
investors that is needed when one moves into a full
listing.</div><a name="06060860000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000242"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> Does the Economic Secretary not respect the fact
that AIM is one of the most successful markets in the world for small
companies? Allowing REITs to be listed on AIM will give a boost to a
market that is already highly respected, and that is not completely
unregulated. That would be welcomed by those already involved in the
AIM industry. I highlight the fact that, in the United States, which
has the most mature REITs market in the world, the ratio of unlisted to
listed is 4:1; there are four unlisted REITs for every listed REIT. I
ask him once again to consider allowing AIM to be a viable market for
REITs.</div><a name="06060860000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000243"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I fear that we are at risk of repeating the debate
on the Floor of the House. In that debate, some indicated that they did
not see the strengths of the role of the AIM market, but other Labour
Members and I are fully committed to the role that AIM plays; it has a
hugely important role in our economy, and the fact that it has grown in
importance and scale is a great strength for our economy and the City
of London.</div> <a name="06060860000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">AIM has
succeeded because it provides a less regulatory, and therefore more
risky, environment for investors than a full listing. That is not to
criticise AIM or to do it down, and I object to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s suggestion that to make that point is somehow to
disparage AIM. The very purpose of AIM is precisely to provide a less
regulated and therefore more risky 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 482</div>environment for investors. That is its strength, not its weakness. The
questions to consider when trying to encourage the development of that
market is what the right way is to provide a tax incentive, and whether
we should provide it in the smaller and more risky environment of AIM,
or in the more regulated and secure listing environment of the London
stock exchange. The judgment that we have come to, at this stage, is
that allowing REITs into that more risky environment would not be the
right route to take, for reasons that were set out on the Floor of the
House.</div> <a name="06060860000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be for
companies to consider at what stage it makes sense for them to move
from the AIM environment to a full listing. Under the new regime, one
of the advantages of a property company making that move is that they
could then move into the REITs regime. I hope that more companies
progress from AIM into a full listing to benefit from the REITs regime.
AIM is supposed to help people make that move from the less established
and regulated AIM environment to a full listing, with all the benefits
that that confers. Those benefits will be good for companies, as they
make their move.</div>
<a name="06060860000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is another point to make:
if we were to allow companies with shares listed on AIM to be eligible
for the regime, we would also have to extend the position to companies
listed on similar markets in the European Union. We are concerned about
the potential risk of allowing that to happen, not just to the
Exchequer but to
investors.</div><a name="06060860000176"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06060860000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s second argument was on the wider listing obligations
that will need to be taken on. The provision will not restrict the
number of residential REITs; in fact we hope that it will encourage
more residential REITs to obtain a full listing. I hope that with those
remarks I have answered the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second question
consistently with comments made on the Floor of the House and the
commitment to keep the matter under review. I understood that the hon.
Member for Rayleigh welcomed that commitment. I have committed today
that we will look at the development of UK residential REITs over the
course of this year. It is no surprise to me, and I would imagine not
to the hon. Gentleman either, that the residential sector has not moved
as quickly as British Land, Hammerson, Land Securities or Great
Portland Estates, given that it is smaller and that companies that
invest in it also tend to be smaller. At this stage, it is not right to
be pessimistic. We will debate in a moment the difficulties of the
amendment proposed by the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire.</div><a name="06060860000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
question that the hon. Member for Rayleigh asked concerned shared
ownership, on which I think I can provide reassurance. Rent from shared
property will count as tax-exempt rental income. Gains from the sale of
parts to tenants will be exempt from tax, and the part owned by a REIT
will be within the ring fence and so will be able to be included in the
REIT. If that does not answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question
then, to refer back to the debates on Tuesday, I shall straddle for a
while until I am able to provide him with further assurance.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 483</div><a name="06060860000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
fourth point was on the interaction between REITs and housing
associations. As he knows, the UK regime is being introduced
fundamentally to remove tax distortions in the property market. There
will purposely be no distinction between commercial and residential
property. We hope that housing associations will be part of the
development of REITs in the coming months. The indications to us and in
public are that they are considering establishing UK REITs. One of the
matters that we must all follow is whether that happens. If not, we
will need to re-examine the matter, and I have made the commitment to
the hon. Gentleman to do so. We intend to support both the commercial
and residential property sectors, but we cannot do so in a way that
would leave us to take undue risks for either the Exchequer or small
investors. That is why we are putting in place a regime that is fit for
purpose.</div><a name="06060860000139"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000244"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I should like, if I may, briefly to reply to
some of what the Economic Secretary said. My right hon. Friend the
Member for North-West Hampshire has considerable experience in this
area, and I urge the Economic Secretary to listen carefully to the
points that he makes, not least on clause
107.</div><a name="06060860000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful for
the Economic Secretary&#146;s reply and clarification on shared
ownership. There was some uncertainty about where shared ownership
properties would sit, and he has made the situation reasonably clear. I
thank him for that, and for his commitment that the Government will
review the status of residential REITs once the regime is up and
running. We have expressed genuine concern about that, and he has said
that the Government will examine the matter once the regime has been
rolled out. He said that if there was not a significant number of
residential REITs, the Government might take action. I note that he did
not define &#147;significant&#148; and I suspect that he would be
reluctant to do so, but he did give a commitment to review the matter,
which I welcome.</div> <a name="06060860000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point about AIM crops up again and again, and I was not entirely
convinced by the Economic Secretary&#146;s answer. I shall put down a
marker that that is something that we may wish to pursue on Report in
one way or another.</div>
<a name="06060860000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having initiated the debate, as
was my purpose this morning, I think that we have given it a good go.
There is still a potential weakness in the regime and the Committee has
done a good job in ventilating that point this morning. We are grateful
for the Economic Secretary&#146;s commitment to review the issue, if
necessary, and at that point I shall end my remarks happy and we shall
see how the process rolls out in
practice.</div><a name="06060860000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000245"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I would just like to make three brief points.
First, I appreciate the expertise of the right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire and I would be pleased to have some more detailed
discussions with him: it would be of benefit to me. As he will
understand, I have come to this issue late in the consultation process
and I would be happy to take such an opportunity. As I said earlier,
that would partly be to understand why some past initiatives did not
work, but also to get his advice. He has expertise in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 484</div>matter, as do other hon. Members, and I would welcome the opportunity to
speak to him about
it.</div><a name="06060860000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the hon.
Member for Rayleigh challenged us to raise our level of ambition
regarding social housing. I challenge him to raise his level of
ambition on social housing, and more broadly on the implementation of
the Barker report. Part of the reason we have a problem with housing in
our country is because for decades&#151;particularly the last
two&#151;there has been severe underinvestment in private and social
housing. The increase in social housing investment has been substantial
in recent years, but as the hon. Gentleman knows, that has been from a
very low base. That base was low because of the underinvestment we
inherited in
1997.</div><a name="06060860000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000246"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I am surprised that the Economic Secretary
wanted to get into this territory. Why has the number of social housing
units built since 1997 dropped dramatically&#151;under this
Government?</div><a name="06060860000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000247"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I am very happy to answer that question. When we
came into Government in 1997, we were told that the backlog of repairs
and indecency in homes in our country was so significant that even if
we spent&#163;19 billion over many years, we would
still&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The decision was made
in 1997 that we needed to invest to improve the quality of homes
because of the huge deterioration in the standard that had
occurred.</div> <a name="06060860000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy
to say to the hon. Gentleman that in my view we did not quite get the
balance right. We should have gone slightly more slowly on tackling the
backlog in order to invest slightly more in social housing. Kate Barker
told us, in her report, that we need to raise the level of social
housing. If one looks, one sees that there has been an increase in
social housing since the 2002 and 2004 spending reviews. The reason why
we had a challenge was because the number of new homes being built was
so low, and the property repairs backlog was so massive. I do not
apologise at all that we tried to improve the quality of homes in our
country for people in social housing. To be honest with the hon.
Gentleman, what we inherited was a complete
disgrace.</div><a name="06060860000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, I
assure the hon. Gentleman that in appreciating the expertise of
Opposition Members and in agreeing that we are all challenged to
improve the position of private and rented housing in our society and
economy, we seek consensus. As challenged by Opposition Members,
consensuses can often start at home and build out. I assure him that we
do our best to ensure that there is a consensus on the home front,
which I would like to extend to Opposition
Members.</div><a name="06060860000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06060860000248"></a>Mr.
Francois:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 208, in page 84,
line 32 [Vol II], leave out paragraph
11.</div><a name="06060860000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
defines various categories of business and income that are specifically
excluded from the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 485</div>REIT regime. Paragraph 11 defines as an excluded item &#147;dividends
from shares&#148; in other REIT companies, which has the practical
effect of preventing a REIT from being established to hold shares in
other REITs. Will the Minister explain, in general terms, why the
ability of one REIT to hold shares in another REIT in a different group
is considered undesirable?</div>
<a name="06060860000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The general intention of REITs
is to create a new and efficient form of collective investment in the
property. In practice, individual investors&#151;the small investors
that the Government presumably wish to encourage&#151;are likely to
invest in underlying property 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 486</div>businesses via intermediaries. A great deal of investment in the stock
market, for example, takes place via funds of underlying shares. In
some other jurisdictions, such as the United States, which has
developed a successful REIT investment market, this restriction does
not apply.</div><a name="06060860000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
