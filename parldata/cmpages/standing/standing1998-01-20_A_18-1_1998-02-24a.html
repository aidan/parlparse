<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be convenient for members of the Committee if I say now that, if necessary, I intended to suspend the sitting between 7 pm and 8.30 pm
<H4><center>Clause 90</center></H4>
<H4><center>General restriction on selection</center></H4>

<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 32, in page 66, line 40, leave out from "ability" to "any" in line 43. [Mr. Don Foster.]
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 33, in clause 91, page 67, line 25, leave out "by ability or".
<P>
No. 34, in page 67, line 27, after "continue", insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> Before lunch, I was trying to deal with the concerns expressed about partial selection. I expressed some sympathy with what the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said about partial selection, but said that I had less sympathy with what the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) and his Friends said about selection. I was about to talk about the Government's decision to deal with partial selection locally rather than by central Government diktat.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Bath that the facility exists to end partial selection where it has caused the havoc to which he referred. The difference between the Liberal Democrats and the Government is that the Government want to leave it to local discretion. That is a common theme of the Bill; we believe that, where possible, it is better for local people to discuss important issues and for all parents and try to resolve problems locally. If they cannot be resolved locally, the Bill provides for the adjudicator to make a decision.
<P>
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Bath that the adjudicator will be able to assess the impact of partial selection and to act accordingly. I hope that I have allayed some of the hon. Gentleman's fears.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don. Foster </B>(Bath): Will the Under-Secretary answer my question about the instructions that the adjudicator will be given, especially in connection with the letter to which I referred this morning?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The adjudicator will be guided by the code of practice. It has not yet been published, but it will be fully debated in the House. No one will be denied the opportunity to discuss the details of the code of practice, but my hon. Friend the Minister for School Standards made it clear at our first sitting that that document would not come before the Committee. I make it clear to the Committee that the code of practice will allow the adjudicator to assess the impact of partial selection and to act accordingly, and thus avoid the situation that the hon. Member for Bath so graphically described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way a second time. Although I understand that we shall not see the code of practice yet, can she comment on the particular section in the letter to which I referred. Will the adjudicator be given
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a clear steer that, in principle, it should indeed by ended."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
"It" is partial selection. Is it intended that the code of practice will include ministerial guidance to the adjudicator on how he is to make decisions?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The hon. Member for Bath pushes me on that; but I am sure that he appreciates that neither I nor my hon. Friend the Minister wants to seem to have criticised named civil servants either in Committee or in the House. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore take careful note of what I said, and take it as a statement of policy. He can draw his own conclusions about a certain phrase in that letter. That is as far as I wish to go. However, I can confirm that what I have just said is Government policy. I shall leave it at that.
<P>
I share some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Bath and I understand the troubles that partial selection have caused locally, but I am confident that the Bill proposes a mechanism to resolve such issues locally. For that reason, if the amendment is not withdrawn, I shall ask members of the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): The Government rest squarely where I said they rested this morning: they are in complete confusion on the subject of selection and, in particular, on partial selection. What the Under-Secretary said is irreconcilable with the principles espoused by the Labour party before the general election. The quotes to which the hon. Member for Bath and I referred to 
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman talking about quotes from the 1970 general election campaign?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> No. I am talking about quotes from interviews that the present Secretary of State for Education and Employment gave in the 18 months before the general election of 1997. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have made a clear pledge that there will be no more selection. I'm going to be as blunt about it as that."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not what the Under-Secretary said. She did not talk about there being no more selection or about being[Mr. Dorrell]
blunt. She said that she had a marginal preference for rowing back on partial selection, but that she was content to leave [Interruption.] Not marginal, then. The Under-Secretary had a personal desire to see the end of partial selection. She said that she was not going to write it into the code of practice and would leave it for local education authorities to decide.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> We do not accept amendments Nos. 34 and 35, which aim to give local authorities that right. Schools organisation committees, the admissions authority and those who have an interest in the quality of education admissions in the area will make such decisions. I acknowledge that I did not refer to that, but we do not accept those two amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Government are against partial selection, which is not consistent with the relevant provisions of the Bill, and are not willing to write that into the code of practice. It is not therefore an official steer to the adjudicator and, in the great majority of decisions, it will be a matter for local decision. I accept that it will not always be for the local education authority to decide, but that is not what the Labour party said during the election campaign its position has changed in an important respect since then.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner (North-West Norfolk):</B> The right hon. Gentleman quotes selectively. I suspect that he will complain later that "no more selection" were the words that we used to say that we would not allow further grammar schools to be developed. If he were to read our manifesto commitments and what we said during the election campaign, he would realise that that is precisely what the Bill will deliver.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I have always said that, when a political party clearly states something during an election campaign, those who vote for that party are entitled to expect that argument to be sustained in Committee. That is why, when we discussed the class size pledge, I did not overturn or challenge head-on what the Government said during the election campaign. What the Under-Secretary said before lunch and this afternoon, however, is not compatible with what her right and hon Friends were saying in the run-up to the election.
<P>
Secondly, what the Under-Secretary said is not even compatible with the Bill. She argues that she is against partial selection, but that she is prepared to leave it to local discretion, which runs contrary to the arguments that Ministers have advanced previously. Even when discussing the clauses that deal with selection, the Government have said that they do not simply want to hold back on the aspect of selection that they refer to as selection by aptitude, which is just another form of partial selection. They have consciously opened the door to partial selection in the form of what they call selection by aptitude and have allowed a freer rein than was allowed under the previous Government.
<P>
To reconcile the Bill with what the Under-Secretary said or with what the Labour party spokesman said during the run-up to the general election and, as the hon. Member for Bath said, on Second Reading, the Government have adopted a series of different positions on partial and other forms of selection and on local discretion.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The right hon. Gentleman must be aware that, before the election, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, the then shadow Secretary of State, talked about local decision making and parental wishes, both of which are reflected in the clauses on partial selection and selection. The right hon. Gentleman has spoken today and throughout our debates in favour of grant-maintained schools and grammar schools, but why did not the Conservative Members ensure that that policy was carried out throughout the country during their 18 years of government? Why was that left to local decision making? Cannot he see that we are balancing our policy with the right of local people to make decisions? Cannot he accept that that is best way to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I can see that that could be reconcilable with what the Government are doing, but not with what they told the electorate before the election that they would do. They did not say that they would leave selection to local decisions by governing bodies and parents. We have adopted a straightforward position: sensitive decisions on admissions are best made whenever possible by those most directly involved the professional staff of the school and the parents.
<P>
The Under-Secretary is changing her position like a cat on the proverbial hot tin roof. She is trying a way deal with the argument of the moment. One moment, she favours local discretion; the next, she is against partial selection; the next, she says that schools should deal with partial selection; and the next, she is against providing advice to the adjudicators on the policy that they expect to pursue.
<P>
I have some sympathy with Labour Members because they are being asked to follow a ministerial team that simply has not decided what its policy on this crucial issue is. It is not a consistent policy of local discretion, nor one laid down from the centre; it is whatever is necessary to get Ministers through the argument of the moment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath has made good play of the difference between what the Secretary of State said on Second Reading and what Ministers have said during the debate. I look forward to hearing the Minister mediate between the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State in later debates. No doubt, when the Minister speaks, we shall hear a third version of the Government's policy.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Theresa May (Maidenhead):</B> A third way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> As my hon. Friend says, a third way between that of the Under-Secretary and that of the Secretary of State. That is totally unsatisfactory not only for the Committee, but more importantly, for those who are charged with trying to run individual schools' admissions policies; they simply do not know which way the Government are likely to go next.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> We have had a lengthy, wide-ranging debate on a matter of importance to the Committee. I began by saying that, although I fundamentally disagreed with the Conservative party's position, at least it had been consistent over a relatively lengthy period. I have shown that the Labour party's position has certainly not been characterised by consistency.
<P>
We have dealt with the distinction between aptitude and ability, and we look forward to debating those matters further. In doing so, we might find ourselves in the interesting position of hearing Ministers trying to reconcile themselves with the Secretary of State's views. In introducing the Bill on Second Reading, he said.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The adjudicator that I shall establish will ensure that aptitude is not used as a cover for selection." [Official Report, 22 December 1997; Vol. 303, c. 666.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Members of the Committee will be fascinated to hear how Ministers reconcile those remarks with clause 93, under which aptitude will be used to expand selection.
<P>
We have seen Ministers in considerable difficulty trying to reconcile the contents of the clause with the Secretary of State's words on Second Reading.
<P>
It is now clear to me and, I hope, to all members of the Committee, however sympathetic they may be to that difficulty that there is a huge disparity between what the Secretary of State said that the Bill was intended to do, which is to remove partial selection where it exists, and what will happen under the Bill. In a number of circumstances, partial selection will be allowed to continue; under clause 93, partial selection will be allowed to develop still further. That clearly contradicts what the Secretary of State said.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
With your indulgence, Mr. Gale, I was able to speak at some length when moving the amendment, so in conclusion I will merely say that this is an important issue so important that we need to debate it on the Floor of the House. I therefore want to withdraw the amendment now, so that our important debate can continue on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 374, in page 67, line 3, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(d) any selection by ability by a particular school or group of schools which is authorized by a scheme proposed by the admissions authority for that school or group of schools, which has been approved by the majority of parents voting in a ballot which has been held in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations which he shall be required to issue.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 8 Approval to establish a new school 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>". Where a local authority, group of parents or other body seeks approval to establish a new school which would select its pupils on the basis of general ability, the Secretary of State shall give consideration to that application.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The purpose of the amendment and the associated new clause is to allow a local ballot to take place if demand arises, to create a grammar school additional to those on the list of 161 grammar schools that is universally expected to be drawn up under the Bill.
<P>
This is an opportunity to put to the test the Under-Secretary's new espousal of the doctrine of local responsibility and of allowing people to make decisions locally. In response to the previous debate, she made it clear that she had a general preference as did the Government against partial selection. That is what she said, although we will later be invited to approve a clause that will allow the further development of partial selection. She said that the Government had a view although it is a contradictory view but that they would not seek to impose it: they would leave the matter to local decision.
<P>
If it is right to allow such decisions to be made locally, I do not understand why the Government do not accept the principle that if demand arises to create a new grammar school, the law should allow that demand to be acted upon. The purpose of the amendment is to move away from the principle set out in the Bill, which is that there will be a closed group of 161 grammar schools 
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There are 165.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister tells me that there are 165 he has an extra four schools on his list that are not on my list; I shall be interested to know which they are. Anyway, there will be a closed group of grammar schools which cannot be added to. The Bill sets out what is essentially a one-way ratchet under which, if various processes are performed, the selective principle on which grammar schools are based will be removed.
<P>
The Government are setting up a process that is deliberately designed to reduce the number of grammar schools; that will be well received on the Government Back Benches, but it contradicts the principle that the Under-Secretary has just espoused. Although the decision to end selection, which is the basis of a grammar school, can be made locally, it cannot be locally decided to introduce the principle of selection to schools which do not already operate it.
<P>
I want to take this opportunity to make my party's attitude on the principle of grammar schools very clear. I agree with those who are agains the continuation of the 1960s' argument, which was an argument to the death between two opposing ideologies; the unchallenged assumption being that the issue was a fundamental principle for all schools that must be decided at national level. That is not the right way to decide this issue. It is important to recognise, and it flows logically from the principle that I espoused this morning, that such decisions are best made by the institution, which is there to serve the parents and the community. I accept entirely that different communities will come to different conclusions, but I want a system that will allow all those different schools and groups of parents to come to different conclusions about the desirability of a full selective approach at the age of 11, or any other age that local people choose. The approach that should inform official policy is one of policy neutrality.
<P>
The Government are right to say that they have no objection to grammar schools in principle. That must be their position because the Bill, as drafted, allows grammar schools to continue. It follows, therefore, that they have no objection in principle to the concept of a [Mr. Dorrell]
grammar school, which is the right official policy for the Government to adopt. I want a system that can be developed if local people want it, and not the closed group which the Bill will create.
<P>
It is worth pausing to consider the evidence on the performance of grammar schools. During the Committee's lunchtime suspension, I looked at the figures based on A to C passes in 1994  of selective systems compared with comprehensive systems. I am not comparing the performance of grammar schools with comprehensive schools. I am comparing the total performance of the population served by a selective system both grammar schools and secondary modern schools with the performance in an area served by a comprehensive system. It does not mean that I am in favour of grammar schools everywhere, but the evidence of A-level pass rates achieved in the two different systems should give the Committee pause for thought. When we go through the main subjects maths, English, science, history, geography and French and compare the A to C pass rates at A-level, we are drawn irresistibly to the conclusion that the performance in selective areas is more than 20 per cent. better than in comprehensive areas. That figure is based on the A to C passes achieved in 1994.
<P>
I am not saying that a piece of universal wisdom has been revealed by that evidence, but it shows that the selective system of education demonstrably achieves attractive results. Secondly, it is supported in a significant part of the country; and, thirdly, when communities have considered the evidence, they may want to try the idea in their area. The purpose of the amendments is to allow that to happen.
<P>
It is always easier to agree with people in general terms when one thinks one knows where they stand, whether one agrees or disagrees with the fundamental principles involved. I do not expect the Liberal Democrats to agree with our amendments. They made it clear this morning that they are opposed to the principle of grammar schools, so it would be inconsistent for them to support the amendments. The hon. Member for Bath nods his head, which comes as no great surprise.
<P>
The Government should accept the amendments because they cannot claim to object in principle to grammar schools; if they do, why are they allowing such schools to remain? The Minister not only went to one himself, he is responsible for a Bill that would allow his old school if it were still a grammar school; I understand that it is not to maintain its status. His hon. Friend the Under-Secretary says that it is Government policy for such decisions to be made locally. I welcome that affirmation of principle, which we sought to draw from the Minister in earlier sittings of the Committee. Ministers now have the opportunity to demonstrate that that principle consistently informs their actions rather than being a convenient argument to call on when nothing better can be found. If there is demand in a community for a grammar school, based on evidence about the performance of grammar schools and on the choices that parents, professional teachers and governing bodies may wish to make about the best interests of their children, it should be able to be met. That principle should be accepted.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): That issue was much debated in my constituency during the election campaign; no one in my area wanted a grammar school. Could the right hon. Gentleman tell me, in my ignorance, where the groundswell of such demand lies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Lady says that there is no demand in her constituency for a grammar school. If the Government are legislating for a range of models for the delivery of education, including the continuation of grammar schools, while setting up provisions that may lead to the abolition of the existing structure in some areas, they should ask themselves whether there may be a demand to go in the other direction. It must be common ground between the Opposition and the Government Front Bench I am less clear about the Government Back Benches that there is no objection in principle to grammar schools; why therefore should the list be closed? Why should there not be the opportunity to develop a new grammar school structure if local support for that arises?
<P>
A factor that could easily lead to increased demand for the foundation of new grammar schools is the Government's abolition of the assisted places scheme, which has shut off access to selective, academic education to a significant section of the community people who cannot afford private school fees in areas such as mine in Leicestershire. The Government are closing the gate and saying that although they think grammar school provision appropriate for people in Trafford, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), who can continue to have such provision, the people in the hon. Lady's constituency of Colne Valley will, if they change their minds, be prevented by statute from establishing such a system whatever they say and whatever the level of demand.
<P>
The hon. Member for Colne Valley shakes her head she should read the Bill; it would prevent her constituents from establishing a grammar school because the clause would prohibit admission arrangements that are not part of a defined group. The only expandable category is that of parital selection, based on the Minister's espousal which we look forward to hearing about of selection by aptitude. Every other group is closed. The hon. Lady's constituents will be prevented from making the choice that my hon. Friend's constituents in Trafford are allowed to maintain. That is the one-way ratchet that will be in operation.
<P>
I look forward to Government Front Benchers, who are newly converted to the principle of settling those issues locally, telling us why, in the event of demand emerging, they will not be prepared to provide a statutory framework to allow the issue to be decided locally.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): The right hon. Member for Charnwood will not be surprised if we do not support his amendment and new clause.
<P>
I do not want to revisit this morning's debate, and I intend to keep my remarks much briefer than those of my hon. Friend the Member for Bath, who stated our position very well. Later this afternoon, he will give clear details about our policies on specialist schools, which I look forward to hearing with a great deal of interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does my hon. Friend not recall our conversation at lunchtime, in which he agreed that he would handle that matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank my hon. Friend although I may not be calling him that for much longer.
<P>
The amendment gives rise to an extremely important issue and it is right and proper that it should get a hearing, if only a brief one. When the Committee commenced, many hon. Members felt that Conservative Members displayed a desire to move into the next century with an education system that would meet the needs of a modern generation moving into a new millenium. It is extremely sad that after some interesting debates over many weeks, they have reverted to type.
<P>
Today's debates have given us a clear picture of Conservative party policy on secondary education it goes back to the 1940s and 1950s, and to the Education Act 1944. The right hon. Member for Charnwood can wrap that up in as many nice words as he likes, but in the end he is saying that as we move into the 21st century, the basis of the new Conservative policy on secondary education is to select, to divide and to reject.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning), who is noted for her forthright views on literature and other matters, made that point even more clearly this morning when she let the cat out of the bag that the policy is to return to wholescale selection.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments. There is nothing like a gammar school education to give one a good knowledge of English literature.
<P>
Several times this morning I pointed out that in drawing attention to the excellent results of grammar school selective education in Northern Ireland I was using a general example, not advocating it as a statutory requirement for every area of Great Britain. I put that on record because the hon. Gentleman is unintentionally misrepresenting what I said to the Committee, and I know that he would not want to do so. The situation is even better than he imagines, because as the Conservative party is undertaking a policy review, it is considering all aspects of education. The hon. Gentleman will have to contain his excitement until we are ready to publish a policy document.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am delighted that during the lunch break there was also a discussion among Conservative Members about who should say what this afternoon to clarify the position. I accept the hon. Lady's comments. Members of the Committee will decide for themselves whether her comments this morning or those this afternoon are representative of Conservative policy.
<P>
It is clear that there is now a strict divide in the Committee certainly between ourselves and Conservative Members on policy for grammar schools. We make it clear that we are opposed to grammar schools and selection, partial or otherwise. At least we have established that there is a clear divide. We do not know, of course, where the Government stand on any of those issues. Much of what was said this morning muddied the waters rather than cleared them.
<P>
We now know why the right hon. Member for Charnwood was so keen to ensure that foundation schools have their own admission authority arrangments. Such arrangements are the only way in which those schools will be able to come into the system as new grammar schools. The mechanism will be available for them to do so. At least there is consistency in the amendment and in the proposed new clause, which would very quickly enable foundation schools to go straight to grammar school status, which they could not do under the previous Administration. That is the aim of the amendment and of the proposed new clause.
<P>
I hate to correct the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, because I have a high regard for her grammar school education and for her intellect. This morning, however, she made a most appalling statement. She said that children were not traumatised by the 11-plus and by the selection system. I remember when my brother failed his 11-plus to attend Burnley grammar school in 1948, believe it or not and went to the secondary modern instead. He never recovered from the stigma of failure. I remember with horror that when I passed the 11-plus to go to Burnely grammar school, he was at the secondary modern school, without uniform, with no playing fields, and with none of the extras that went into grammar schools. There I was in blazer, cap, socks, tie and all the rest of it. That emphasised the appalling divide.
<P>
Many people, although they may have recovered from that failure and built reputations of international repute, were severely damaged by the experience. Anything that can be done in the Bill or elsewhere to stop future generations of children having to go through that experience should be done. That is why my hon. Friend and I argue for our policy.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about what happened some years ago, and the difference between the children who went to grammar school and the atmosphere of failure that surrounded children who did not, but things have moved on. Surely it is incumbent on hon. Members as politicians and on the teaching profession that the sink schools secondary moderns that dealt with children by educating them up to the age of 15 for them to go into unskilled jobs should no longer exist.
<P>
Hon. Members know that the situation described by the hon. Gentleman does not exist today. There is no reason why there should not be a range of schools, including those in selective education, and no reason why they should not produce young people who come out of education feeling good about themselves. At the time about which the hon. Gentleman talked, the wrong language and culture were used. There is no reason why they should be used today. If the knowledge that is possessed now had been available then, the [Mrs. Browning]
circumstances that the hon. Gentleman described would not have occurred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> That is exactly my point. We have the knowledge and the experience, and we should not repeat the situation. It is only a few months since the appalling case of the Ridings school. The school existed in a system in which children were selected to go to the grammar schools and to Church schools. What was left over went into the Ridings school, and it was wondered why it failed. It is now doing marvellous work, and turning itself around, on which we congratulate it, but an enormous amount of resources have had to be put in to support it.
<P>
In 1998, 50 years after my brother failed his 11-plus, children have failed their 11-plus to go to Ripon grammar school in north Yorkshire. It is a superb school, which is always near the top of any league table that anybody would care to mention. In a small town such as Ripon, however, there is a grammar school and another school. The results of the other school are always in the bottom 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. in the league table.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is talking about two schools in Ripon. As it happens, about an hour ago, I talked to my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) in the Library. He told me that the last thing that is wanted in Ripon and particularly in the secondary modern school, which has made substantial improvements in its performance in recent years, is a reopening of the argument. The argument with which the hon. Gentleman must deal is whether the needs of the children who currently attend the secondary modern school in Ripon would be best met by continuing the current improvement in its performance or by throwing the whole issue into the melting pot and having another round of uncertainty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I have a great deal or respect for the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, who attended Ripon Grammar school as a boy and who is a staunch supporter of Ripon and its education system.
<P>
My hon. Friend and I are not reopening the argument the right hon. Member for Charnwood is. He and his colleagues are saying that we should go back and introduce grammar schools. That is the policy that he has introduced with regard to the clause. The new clause and the amendment say that we should be able to introduce grammar schools wherever there is a need and a ballot can take place to support them. That is the principle and the reality, whether the right hon. Gentleman likes it or not.
<P>
I want to deal now with the way in which the schools will be selected. The amendment clearly says that there will be a ballot and it refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the majority of parents voting in a ballot which has been held in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations which he shall be required to issue."
<P>
Who will be balloted? At the beginning of the Committee, I naively made some comments about ballots, of which the right hon. Gentleman will no doubt remind me in a second. The great problem with ballots, specifically in regard to schools, is determining who to ballot. Will it be the parents of children in the schools, or children in the primary schools? If so, which primary schools? Perhaps the grammar school would be the only one in the town, so would everybody be balloted in the town?
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I have a lot of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's points about the difficulty of the balloting principle. The amendment is drafted to import the same principle that exists in other parts of the Bill and to focus attention on the issue that matters. If we have a ballot that allows us to remove the selective principle, the same kind of provision should apply to its extension. If the hon. Gentleman will accept the principle of extending grammar schools to balance out the closing of those that do not secure support, I will happily work with him on a more sensible means of determining the matter locally. I agree with some of his reservations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I accept much of what the right hon. Gentleman says and there is a logic to it. If, however, he proposes an amendment and a new clause that give parents the right to chose whether a school becomes a grammar school, he has a duty to tell the Committee how the ballot will take place. Surely, he must have thought about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> May I finish the point about ballots? The right hon. Gentleman opposed a rejection of the Greenwich judgment last week. In London, one would have to ballot every one of the London authorities to reach a decision. I do not know how that would work perhaps the right hon. Gentleman or one of his hon. Friends would like to explain that later in the debate.
<P>
I leave my last remarks for the Government. I do not know how they will respond to the right hon. Gentleman's amendment and new clause. Logically, they should support it. Between 22 December and 24 February there was a complete change. My hon. Friend the Member for Bath has asked on many occasions whether Ministers reject what the Secretary of State said on 22 December, and it now looks as if that is the case. The Government cannot keep the existing grammar schools, allow partial selection in other schools, introduce new categories and then say that there is no category specifying ability. It will be interesting to hear the Minister's response, but if this is pressed to a vote, we shall oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am surprised and disappointed that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) has said that his party will oppose the amendment. However, I share my hon. Friend's optimism that the Government will take a more enlightened view.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
During this morning's proceedings, I was scribbling notes regarding the members on both sides of the Committee who wisely and properly endorsed the principles of local decision making in education policy, school admissions and organisation. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough was the first to extol the virtues of local decision making, as did the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk. The hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) spoke about the importance of local decision making and decentralisation. The hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes), in response to an intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (mr. St. Aubyn), agreed that if parents choose selective education, it is perfectly appropriate. This was capped, at the end of the morning, by the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris), also waxing lyrical about the importance of local decision making. So I have every hope that in spite of the inconsistency of Liberal Democrat Members in this matter, the Government will hold true to their principles and stand up for local decision making and the rights of parents and local communities to make decisions of this sort.
<P>
I was surprised at the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who accussed Conservative members of the Committee of being trapped in the past. He then sought to confine his arguments about selection in education to the educational system of 50 or 51 years ago. I submit that in those areas of the country which still have selective education systems, the picture is very different from that which he and his brother encountered all those years ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Is there a selective system, and a grammar school system, anywhere in Britain which does not reject the majority of children who apply?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman encapsulated the real problem that tends to ensue with selective systems. It is nothing to do with the system, but with the interpretation that some people choose to apply to it. The whole principle of selection in the 1944 Act was meant to be selection between different types of education, not between passing and failing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that one reason why the idea of comprehensive education took such a hold on both sides of the political divide in the 1960s was precisely because that division to which to which he referred was discredited between 1944 and the 1960s?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I happily accept that. It would do no credit to my argument or to those who support selective education as a principle today to argue with that proposition. Of course the system was badly implemented. The one leg of the supposed tripartite system which has introduced then and which unquestionably worked was the grammar school. The others needed to be improved, to be made more effective and to serve children better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. It is difficult to remain in one's seat when listening to such a speech. When the hon. Gentleman was at school, did he learn the law of physics I cannot remember the name which says that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Newton's third law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Bath for that information. Surely for every grammar school there is an unequal and opposite secondary modern school. If the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West thinks that grammar schools are so good, why did the previous Government not make every school a grammar school, and why is he not saying that every school should be a grammar school? We could not have such a system, because for every grammar school there has to be a secondary modern losing out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman has again demonstrated the critical difference between Conservative Members' view of educational policy in terms of local decision making and diversity and choice in schools, and Labour Members' kneejerk reaction that a monolithic pattern of education should be imposed on the whole country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Does not the experience of the past 30 years teach us not to espouse a single model? Rather, it illustrates the wisdom of the words of Sidney Webb. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West might like to reflect on that paradox. Sidney Webb wrote in a contribution to a book on secondary education.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"What we have learnt, gradually and slowly, is that nothing worthy of the name of a national education system can be built up of schools of a single undifferentiated type, however, numerous and however excellent they must be."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Would my hon. Friend for perhaps the only time in his life, like to agree with Sidney Webb?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend. Sidney Webb was a proper socialist and worthy of the name. He was a man of principle who would as socialists used to do stand up for what he believed was the way in which ordinary folk could hope to get on in life. Sidney Webb, R. H. Tawney and others endorsed the grammar school principle because they saw it as a way in which people could advance in life, regardless of their means or origins. That is precisely why I support grammar schools. I support them with a passion because of my experience. While I certainly was not raised in grinding poverty, there was no way in which my parents could have sent me to a private school. A grammar school gave me great opportunities, for which I have been enormously grateful. That explains in part why I am prepared to fight so hard to ensure that future generations continue to have those same opportunities.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) referred members of the Committee to Sidney Webb, but I draw the Committee's attention to an excellent Social Market Foundation paper, which was written by Stephen Pollard, a former research director of the Fabian Society. He made the point with which I certainly could not disagree that the system set up in 1944 was sound but that it had not been implemented in the right way, as we were saying before. he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"But you don't overcome a failure by destroying a success grammar schools. Indeed, so true is this, that the real motivation of the educational establishment is all too clearly revealed: to preserve its current power."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to explain how all children benefit from a selective education system and added:
[Mr. Brady]
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Yet the very purpose of increasing the range of schools available is to ensure that it is not just the academically gifted who are offered a decent schooling (as they were with grammar schools) but also those with other abilities be they sporting, musical, technical or practical."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what we ought to be driving at: a proper diversity of schools, not just a system that is hamstrung by the idea that the only kind of selection that can possibly work is partial selection. It should be possible to hark back to the principles and ideas that underlay the 1944 Act, particularly the principle that one school might be able to benefit more academically inclined children while another school, which is equally good and equally well resourced, can provide a technical education for other children. Again, the Government have gone some way to accepting that in allowing city technology colleges to continue. If we could just keep the grammar schools that we have and expand the technology colleges, we would go some way towards a proper form of selective education, which could serve the interests of all our children.

<P>

<B>Helen Jones </B>(Warrington, North): As the hon. Gentleman appears to be arguing for a return to a tripartite education system, will he tell us what test he has discovered which enables someone to predict which 11-year-olds should go to which school? It all hinges on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am not arguing for a tripartite system, but for a diverse system with all sorts of different schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> If I can save the hon. Member for Bath his trouble, I suspect that he would want me to invite the hon. Member for Warrington, North to explain how she would create a test that does what she suggests for a system of partial selection, which the Government and the Bill endorse.
<P>
I do not say that selection has to take place at 11, that it has to be done by a single examination or that selective schools have to be boroughwide or universal. There should be diversity and choice in education. A properly functioning and effective selection system, which gives equal standards, equal credit and equal resources to all the different types of school, can produce a system of education that serves all the pupils in a given area better, as the examination statistics quoted by my right hon. Friend demonstrate, than a monolithic comprehensive system, which has so often failed.
<P>
Labour or Liberal Democrat Members who seek to demonstrate 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> No, I wish to conclude this point. If Labour or Liberal Democrat Members are trying to discredit the system of selective education by saying that certain types of school between 1944 and the 1960s failed, which may well be an accurate analysis, members on both sides of the Committee must recognise that many comprehensive schools and systems across the country have under-performed woefully, to the gross detriment of all the children who live in the communities that those schools are intended to serve.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Eighteen years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman says 18 years. Perhaps he feels that the Government should take a more dirigiste approach and should allow no local decision-making. I suspect that that is the view of many Government Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) was waving the Bill as though somehow that was an answer to the question, but we have just heard the Minister say that the answer is not in the Bill: it is all for local discretion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend. I suspect that at least two different versions of the Bill have been produced for the benefit of Labour Back Benchers, just as there may be more than one version of the guidelines that were belatedly made available to members of the Committee relating to balloting procedures, to which we shall come later.
<P>
I would observe this is a serious point how disappointed I was that at 4.30 yesterday I still had not received the outline of the proposed balloting arrangements. Only when I phoned the Minister's office to request it was it sent over to me. Some hon. Members may have received copies earlier. If the Government are playing the game of timing the release of information so precisely as to limit or stifle debate, whether in the press or in the Committee, they might at least have the courtesy or competence to make sure that papers are delivered by hand at the 11th hour rather than trusting to the postal service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> On Friday, when I wanted to circulate the paper to hon. Members, it could not be walked over to the House because the House was not sitting. Therefore, we had to use the post. That is the explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank the Minister for that explanation. That is why Opposition Members had the foresight on Thursday to request those papers, before a non-sitting day occurred.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> On a point of information, I was paged at 10 minutes to 11 this morning, 20 minutes after the Committee had begun its proceedings, to be told that the letter from the Minister had just arrived at my office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for her further point of information. I fear that I may be approaching a record in the Committee's proceedings for taking interventions. I hope to make a little headway.
<P>
I began to say that I was most hopeful that Labour Members would support the amendments, because they are entirely consonant with the principles of local decision-making which many of them have espoused in Committee today. The Government have come a long way from their days of kneee-jerk reaction of vicious antagonism towards all grammar schools and a desire to close them down. They have moved, or at least they say they have, to recognising that grammar schools may be all right and they have no objection to them in principle, but that some local procedure should be in place so that it is possible to remove grammar schools from their locality by a ballot of local parents, however defined.
<P>
I invite the Government to improve the Bill by removing the thread of hostility to grammar schools and to selection in education which runs through much of the Bill and also through the outline for ballots that we recently received. The thread of hostility is implicit in the fact that the balloting procedure is this one-way door, a ratchet effect that can be used only to remove grammar schools and not to create new ones. That is most regrettable. The new clause would remove some of the dogma from the Bill. It would also remove some of the public's hostility to the Bill and give the Government a further opportunity to fulfil their pre-election pledge that grammar schools would be safe under a Labour Government.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is vital that Ministers recognise how strongly many people feel about schools that have served their local communities so well. Members of those communities, including my constituents, deserve a fair balloting system, but, as I read the proposals for the balloting system, it would disenfranchise a number of parents who now take advantage of grammar school places across the border in Cheshire. Parents would not be allowed to participate in a local education authority-wide ballot as they live on the other side of the LEA boundary. I shall look again at it, but that is my reading of the outline.
<P>
New clause 8 would allow a community, a group of parents, a school or even a local education authority that decided that there was a demand and desire for some element of selective schooling, to make proposals. It would not guarantee acceptance of the proposals; it would simply require the Secretary of State to consider them. That is a rather limited request. We simply require that the Government should not close their minds to the possibility of a local community or group of parents wanting to establish a new school. They should be willing to consider it, but not bound to accept it. They should simply consider the arguments put by local people and give them due consideration.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that democracy has to play a part, and that the electorate made it clear on 1 May 1997 that they did not want new grammar schools? Indeed, it was made clear that there would be no new grammar schools. Nothing has been said today to suggest that there is a groundswell of demand. How does the hon. Gentleman answer that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am not sure that the point requires an answer or even that a point was made. It beggars belief that a Labour Member of Parliament could suggest that the Bill was democratic when the amendment and the new clause would extend local choice and democracy. The hon. Lady is seeking to stifle that democracy. I find that astonishing.
<P>
The notion that democracy began and ended on 1 May 1997 is distressing, but it is surprisingly and worryingly common among Labour Members. Although the Government gained a large majority on 1 May, it does not absolve Members of Parliament from thinking for the next four or five years. They are not bound to adopt the position that they adopted on 1 May and stop thinking.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Will my hon. Friend comment on two matters arising from the intervention of the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford)? First, although the hon. Lady claims that the Government went to the country on a particular manifesto on 1 May 1997 and that the country endorsed that manifesto, the Government have now gone back on it. They are now doing something different from what the hon. Lady claims the electorate wanted them to do.
<P>
In the light of the hon. Lady's statement that there is no groundswell of opinion in favour of grammar schools, does my hon. Friend not wonder why the Labour party found it necessary to fudge its position on grammar schools for the purposes of the Wirral, South by-election?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for her timely and appropriate intervention. She is quite right. The shift in the Labour party's position a remarkable coincidence that it should occur at the time of the by-election at Wirral, South was incredible to behold. Indeed, the position adopted by the Labour party at the general election was, as far as my constituents were concerned, that grammar schools would be safe in the Labour party's hands. The Government were not elected on a platform pledge to abolish grammar schools, nor were they implacably opposed 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee has been commendably in order until now. I shall be grateful if the hon. Gentleman does not fight the last election, but speaks to new clause 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I have no desire to fight the last election again I would rather look forward to the next election.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps we should not fight that one yet either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I shall deal with some of the points that have been made about the effect of a selective educational system. My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood referred to some of the statistics on examination results. I do not say that that evidence shows that a selective system should be imposed across the country of course, it should not but parents might wish to take it into account in deciding where they wish to send their children.

<P>

<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> No, I want to make headway. Parents should be able to make choices based on the excellent examination results achieved in selective systems.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; I shall not now need to make a speech. Will he ponder these figures: Harrow, the fully comprehensive, non-selective LEA in my constituency, came fourth and [Mr. McNulty]
third respectively in 1995 and 1996 in the GCSE league tables. Trafford, about which he has waxed lyrical, came 20th and 21st respectively in those tables. Kent, another selective LEA, came 30th and below 30th. We can all choose figures, as the right hon. Member for Charnwood has done, but please quote the right ones and do not do it selectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman. My figures, which the Library gave to me, appear to be more up to date than his. I am happy to give credit to areas that achieve good results in comprehensive schools. In fact, Trafford came 10th in GCSE results and first in A-level results. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough rightly gave credit to North Yorkshire.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes </B>(Stretford and Urmston): The hon. Gentleman is not comparing like with like in his claim about Trafford's A-level results. Children leave secondary modern schools in Trafford at 16, and any A-levels that they take are not included in the figures, whereas all the children who take A-levels in a comprehensive system are included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The figures that the Library has given to me do not show that; they show the average performance at A-level and at GCSE. I now want to make headway.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Jamieson </B>(Plymouth, Devonport): Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his characteristic generosity and support.
<P>
Some hon. Members' suggestions that a selective educational system might traumatise people for life, calls to mind the Deputy Prime Minister's recent appearance on "Parkinson", in which it was clear that the trauma from which he has suffered remains unresolved. My sympathy goes out to him. The former Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), went to a grammar school and performed spectacularly well during seven years in government as a result. I think that you would rightly call me to oder, Mr. Gale, if I allowed myself to be drawn any further down that leafy lane.
<P>
The effect of a selective educational system is to give opportunities to people regardless of ability. Ideally, the selective system that I am pleased to say exists in my constituency, which I would like to see in other areas, provides genuine choice and opportunities not just for those who attend grammar schools but for all children. There are excellent secondary schools, achieving outstanding results, in my constituency.
<P>
Hon. Members who sought to denigrate the performance of selective systems over the years must recognise that things have moved forward in effective, properly run selective educational systems. Such a system is a great leveller, and Sidney Webb would support it for this reason: it is perhaps the greatest social leveller in the country, which provides ordinary people, regardless of means, with an opportunity to compete with those who have been able to go to private schools. The Government might want to reconsider their opposition to grammar schools and selection for that reason.
<P>
Another point, which is important to my constituency, is that such a system makes room for selection by ability rather than selection by post code area or the ability to pay for accommodation in an area. The loss of selective admission arrangements would result in some excellent grammar schools in my constituency for example, the boys' and girls' grammar schools in Altrincham, which are in areas of extremely high housing costs being barred to people who could not afford to live in their catchment area. The Government should ponder such matters.
<P>
Many people have moved to my constituency to take advantage of its educational system. It is anecdotal, but we must take into account the fact that people are prepared to move house to be in a local authority area that has a grammar school or selective system. At our sitting last week, the Liberal Democrats advanced arguments about the effect of the Greenwich judgment, because of the desire of parents to send their children across local authority boundaries so that they can attend selective schools.
<P>
There is clear evidence of parental support and demand for selective schooling. If the Government did not believe that there was any evidence, we could perversely say that there is a further argument for the Government not resisting the new clause. What is there to stop them allowing choice, opportunity and diversity to local communities? The new clause would not impose a uniform blanket system of selective education throughout the country; it would even up the balance and make it a two-way street.
<P>
At present, the Government's proposals are clearly hostile to remaining grammar schools, because the only purpose of the balloting arrangement is to remove them. There is no countervailing possibility of creating new grammar schools where local people want them. The new clause is a democratic proposal; it is entirely consonant with any ideas of freedom or local decision making, choice and diversity in education, which is why I am proud to have tabled it and why I urge the Committee to support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guilford): I wish to explain why I shall also support the amendment. Coming from an area that has a non-selective system, it is no part of my brief to say that we should have a selective system. We have a happy medium, and that is partly because there is an element of self-selection in my constituency, where one in five children attend independent schools. For many years, we have had the important ingredient of the assisted places scheme. That has helped to answer the problem of the child from a less well-off area who truly deserves the opportunity of the focused, academic education that they may receive at some of the fine independent schools in the area. That system works because of the nature of the whole social set-up and because of the way in which the schools have learnt to live together.
<P>
Let us suppose that the Government's policy changed and that it became prohibitively expensive, even in areas such as Guildford, for people to support the private system on the scale that they do at present. Furthermore, let us say that the abolition of the assisted places scheme works to the detriment of many parents who want opportunities for their children. What would happen then?
<P>
Parents in an area such as I represent may look at other areas where a selective system was working happily and successfully and decide that, while that system might not be suitable for every area, it was suitable for them. If the Government oppose the amendment, they are refusing to take part in that debate. My constituents have a right to participate in that debate, should they wish to do so in the future.
<P>
I was speaking to the headmistress of an excellent local school the other day. She said that she regretted the fact that some of the most able children in the area did not go through the state system. I pointed out that although she may regret it, if there were no independent alternative available for children in the town, the demand for places at her school in a non-selective system would inevitably have an effect on the cost of housing in the catchment area, and might mean that a significant number of parents whose children currently enjoy the benefits of a first-rate education would be denied that because they could not afford to live in the area.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Every part of the country will have its own pressures and demands. The Government think that they have the best answer and they want to prescribe it for every area in the country. They seem to think that the selective system is the residue of a previous period. The hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) went back 300 years to Newtonian physics to find justification for his point of view. I remind him that we are about to enter the 21st century. It is more than 100 years since the theory of relativity was introduced; surely we should be more concerned about relativity. If there is a fine grammar school in an area, we should ensure that other schools in the area are relatively well resourced to provide the right type of education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. As he is taking us down the road of modern physics, may I suggest that he considers the latest development in modern physics, as expounded by Mr. Stephen Hawking the concept of black holes which large sections of this country are in because of the previous Government's attitude toward selection and grant-maintained schools?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I urge the hon. Gentleman not to go too far down that road.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am delighted to concur, Mr. Gale. The hon. Gentleman's intervention showed the limitations of trying to apply scientific methods to what is much more an art than a science. An examination of GCSE or A-level results is inevitably fairly limited. It is well known that part of a school's A-level results will depend on who it fields for which A-levels and to which board it applies. Equally, performance in GCSEs may reflect a host of differences. The hon. Member for Bath tried to compare Kent and Hampshire, although he did not tell us that he was referring to those two counties. He merely showed how limited comparisons can be, because anyone who knows those two counties will agree that there are many significant differences between them. We cannot reach simplistic conclusions based on experience in our constituencies.
<P>
I am happy to support the amendments not because I want a selective system in my area I do not, as we are happy with the system that we have but because I want my constituents to have that right, if they so choose. The constituents of Labour Members also deserve the right to be included in the debate, if they feel that it is appropriate for their children's future.

<P>

<B>Sir David Madel </B>(South-West Bedfordshire): There is an important quote from the Liberal Democrat election manifesto of last May, which is relevant to the debate and to which I shall refer in a minute.
<P>
First, I want to refer to the comments of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. He and I would agree that since 1944, the education system in this country has been a national service delivered locally. We would also agree that the third pillar, which never really got going, was technical schools. There is no point in arguing why that did not happen, but it should perhaps be noted that Germany has always had them and we know how much richer than us Germany is. However, that is very much a historical argument.
<P>
In a display of what I shall call mischief, the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough tried to suggest that somehow or other, the Conservative party wants to take the country right back to the 1940s or 1950s by our attitude to selection and the 11-plus. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that that is not the case.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford started his speech by referring to his area and to the advantages that its education system is bringing, so I shall start by saying something about my area. Bedfordshire has been comprehensive since 1970. It was a Conservative county council that turned the system comprehensive, and it was a Conservative Secretary of State for Education in 1970 no prizes for guessing who who allowed Bedfordshire to go comprehensive. We are one of the very few counties that have the middle-tier system I shall not repeat my mistake; the system is not the same as the Norfolk system, about which the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk corrected me; our middle schools take pupils from the ages of nine to 13, not from eight to 12.
<P>
There is no way that the Conservative party in Bedfordshire could possibly have gained an overall majority of one on 1 May if we had advocated a return to the 1940s and 1950s. The system in Bedfordshire is generally settled; it has generally been Conservative-driven. Of course we need to make improvements, but there is no demand from Conservatives and no general demand in Bedfordshire to have a tremendous upheaval and return to a selective system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> In a minute [Interruption.] Well, all right, I will give way now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I rise with trepidation; never have I been spoken to so violently.
[Mr. Willis]
I refer the hon. Gentleman to my constituency and to the excellent schools in Harrogate. I entirely agree with what he has just said. We in north Yorkshire have no wish to change, although there are one or two anomalies there are only two sets of grammar schools in the whole county, for historic rather than any other reasons. What was enormously divisive in Harrogate was when the former Secretary of State, urged on for political motives by certain governors and the head teacher of a school that wanted to go for grant-maintained status. That ripped the heart out of the system; it put school against school and made heads and governors fight each other. Ultimately, the attempt was defeated. The amendments would lead to exactly the same problem where motivated governors and heads wanted their school to become a grammar school, whether in Bedfordshire or north Yorkshire.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> It does not have to be like that that is one of the differences between Yorkshire and Bedfordshire. In the major town in my constituency, Dunstable, two upper schools have gone grant-maintained. People in Dunstable are well aware of the Liberal Democrats' passionate opposition to grant-maintained schools, just as they are aware of their passionate commitment to putting a penny on income tax for schools. As a result of the Liberal Democrat passionate opposition to grant-maintained schools, they never win any seats in Dunstable. They have not won a single seat 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am reluctant to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, because he has not participated in earlier debates, but I ask him to stick to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I will do that, Mr. Gale, but I am sure that you will allow me a tiny bit of licence 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I already have.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I was provoked into making this short speech by the tainting of the Conservative party as wanting to lurch back to the 1940s and 1950s over grammar schools, and I wanted to say in passing that we are well aware of the opposition of the Liberal Democrats to grant-maintained schools. The result is that they gain no seats the Liberal Democrats have not gained a single seat in Dunstable since 1973.
<P>
Next door to Bedfordshire is Buckinghamshire, which is selective. Thanks to the Greenwich judgment, Buckinghamshire pupils pour over the border into Bedfordshire schools. I do not know whether we want to change the Greenwich judgment, but the point is that despite the hon. Gentleman's opposition to grammar schools and grant-maintained schools, the 1997 Liberal Democrat manifesto states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Liberal Democrats are opposed to selection, but believe that decisions on this should be made by local communities through their local councils and not by politicians at Westminster."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The prize is therefore for the grasping in Buckinghamshire. If the Liberal Democrats want to get rid of grammar schools there, they should persuade the electors to change to a different system. Hitherto, however, the electors have said, "No thank you very much; we will stay with the selective system". Thanks to the Greenwich judgment, pupils who do not want to take advantage of that system can pour into the schools of Bedfordshire.
<P>
The amendment would merely give parts of the country that might, for various reasons, be considering a change to grammar schools, the opportunity to do so. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford said that in his area they were perfectly satisfied with the present system and had no desire to choose selection; the same applies to Bedfordshire. Other areas of the country may be different. The Government are struggling to find the middle way on the issue. The best way to proceed at this stage is to accept my right hon. Friend's amendment and allow us to progress in an orderly way, with no more arguments from the Liberal Democrats about grant-maintained and grammar schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The reason why the Conservatives lost the election has been demonstrated in the past hour and a half. They are fighting old battles that mean nothing to the majority of people in our country. As they go through the intellectual exercise of undertaking policy reviews, they will have to look to the future, not the past. If they do not, the target seat of Altrincham and Sale, West will fall into our hands at the next election as may who knows even Maidenhead at the election after that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I want to make progress. I shall give way when I address the main policy points.
<P>
The most disturbing feature of the debate and one that underpins everything that Conservative Members have said in Committee and on Second Reading is the belief that children can get a high quality education only in the private sector or in a grammar school [Interruption.] The record 
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> No, I want to make progress.
<P>
The record will show that that is what Conservative Members have said, today and on Second Reading on 22 December. I refer particularly to the comments of the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank the Minister for giving way. He has been casting aspersions about Opposition Members that are inaccurate. I have been at pains to make clear my support for all the schools in my constituency, which do an excellent job. At an earlier sitting, I drew attention to the Ashton-on-Mersey school, a secondary modern school that predominantly takes its pupils from a Manchester overspill estate. It has just had an outstanding Ofsted report and is doing an excellent job. I resent the Minister's suggestion that I and my colleagues believe that only grammar schools and private schools can provide decent education. That is not true and I invite him to withdraw that remark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The record will show the hon. Gentleman's comments about his own experience. He spoke about how important it was for him, not coming from a wealthy family and therefore not having access to private education to go to a grammar school to get a good education. He may deny it, but the record will show that that is what he said les than an hour ago.
<P>
We need to address the issue of how we can move forward to an education system that can meet the needs of all our children, not just a few who will be selected on the basis of general ability that is not appropriate for an education system in the 21st century. It would be turning the clock back, not to the good old days, but to the bad old days, when the majority of children were rejected at the age of 11. That is why we made it crystal clear in our manifesto that there would be no return to the 11-plus and that it would be for local parents to determine the future of the 165 existing grammar schools. We did that for principled reasons. We believe that the comprehensive system offers better educational opportunities and a higher standard of education to our children. I will rehearse some figures in a few moments. As for the existing 165 grammar schools, it would have been easy particularly with a majority of 179 to put a Bill through Parliament which abolished grammar schools. We will not do that because we believe that the debate should be held locally. It should be for local parents to determine whether they want to keep their grammar schools.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, because he is dealing with the nub of the issue. He said that it is for local parents to determine whether they want to have a grammar school. Why should that choice be open to the parents of children at those 165 existing grammar schools and not to a group of parents who might want a grammar school to be established?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman was not listening to my comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I was listening carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The right hon. Gentleman should read our manifesto, which makes a clear distinction between not returning to the 11-plus and the position affecting the existing 165 grammar schools. He may disagree with that distinction 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Fine, but our manifesto was endorsed by the British people, which is what counts in a democracy. We made a clear distinction. We said that, in principle, we do not want an expansion of grammar schools and a return to the 11-plus which is why we will resist the amendment but we considered, quite separately, how we would deal with the remaining 165 grammar schools. We said that we would not abolish them through an Act of Parliament, but allow local people to determine what should happen.
<P>
We will discuss the balloting arrangements later, but I hope that we will be able to introduce a set of fair, transparent regulations which local people will recognise give relevant parents a fair say in the selection procedures in their area. That is the basis on which we want to make progress and it is a forward-looking policy. We are drawing a line under selection and we will not expand the grammar school sector. That is what we said in the manifesto, and we are honouring that commitment. We also said in the manifesto that the future of the remaining 165 grammar schools would be a matter for local determination by relevant parents.
<P>
Someone mentioned Wirral, South and the by-election there. I have spoken to grammar school head teachers in Wirral and they are broadly supportive of the Government's approach. One of the reasons why we won the by-election and why our majority there in the general election was increased was that grammar school head teachers and head teachers of local schools believe that we have struck the right balance between competing demands.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister more carefully than he listened to Conservative Members when we tried to explain that we are in favour of diversity of choice, not putting back the clock. He must explain not only the contents of the Labour party manifesto we all know those well enough, and if they had promised to abolish grammar schools, the Government would not have the majority that they now pray in aid of the Bill but why he is opposed to diversity of choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I will try to do that, but in doing so I will draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the amendment and new clause that the Committee is debating. New clause 8 clearly shows that the question is not one of parental choice because it refers to a new school which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would select its pupils onthe basis of general ability".
<P>
Where is the choice 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am answering the hon. Gentleman's point. Where is the choice for parents when the selection is conducted by the school? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would explain that to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Under our proposal, parents would be able to choose to go through a system of selection to decide how children in that area would be allocated to schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The point is that the choice is being made by the school. There is a fatal flaw in the argument that parents can then choose the selective system. That is not how it works they will be compelled to be part of a selective process whether they like it or not. Some of them can opt to go to another local authority, but if parents are resident in an area that is selective they have no choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall not give way; we could endlessly bat the issue backwards and forwards. The point is that the parent does not have a choice. Through partial selection based on aptitude, clause 93 will give choice and diversity within the comprehensive system. The clause will allow up to 10 per cent. of children to be given priority on the basis of aptitude. The Bill contains a coherent set of policies. Opposition Members may disagree with them, but what they will do is clear.
<P>
Points have been made about the code of practice on admissions, which will affect admissions for the first [Mr. Byers]
time in September 2000. I make no apologies for that code of practice not being before the Committee today. The Government will refine it, and it will be a good code of practice that will have broad support. The House will probably consider it in January of next year. Hon. Members can wait until then to debate its finer points.
<P>
I have never taken a dogmatic approach for or against grammar schools. On seeing the figures, however, we can see that, first, a comprehensive system for the majority of children will offer better options with regard to standards. Secondly, the difference between grammar schools and comprehensive education does have the traumatic effect to which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) referred I shall go through the figures in a minute.
<P>
People have their own personal experiences. I had a grammar school education, as the hon. Member for Tiverton and Horiton said this morning. I remember vividly that I was in a class of 44 11-year olds. Class sizes were bad even in those days. When we sat the 11-plus, the rest of the school had the day off so that there would be no noise and we could then concentrate on the examination. A special meal was laid on. On the day on which the results were announced, we found that of 44 of us, four children had passed and were to go to a grammar school, but 40 had failed and were to go to a secondary modern.
<P>
I do not want to return to those days. Today's debate showed all too clearly that a willingness exists to represent the insterests of the few while sacrificing those of the majority as a result. Those days will not come back under this Government. We said we would be a Government for the many, not for the few. The Bill is one of the most concrete ways in which we can ensure that we deliver on that pledge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister has pursued the old line of focusing on the effect of a moment of decision following an exam. That argument applies, to a greater or lesser degree, to every exam that is taken at every stage in the education process.
<P>
Will the Minister focus on the effects of the exams that will necessarily flow from his commitment to continue, and in certain circumstances to expand, partial selection? He seeks to persuade the Committee that it should be hostile to selection in the context of grammar schools. He has made it clear, however, that he espouses exactly the same principle with regard to the exams that children will sit in the context of partial seleciton. What is the difference from the point of view of the children, who will in some cases pass and in others fail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I hope that later, when we reach clause 93, I shall have the opportunity to take the right hon. Gentleman through a list of different types of assessment that can demonstrate whether a child has an aptitude for a specific subject or vocation. Those assessments are well established because of the introduction of city technology colleges. There are some very good ways of testing whether an individual child has an aptitude in a particular area. I shall happily list them, and clause 93 will be the relevant peg on which to hang those particular illustrations.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Minister speaks of his party being the party for the many and not for the few. Among Labour Members, including the Secretary of State for Social Security and the Prime Minister, are right hon. and hon. Members who have openly demonstrated the fact that they are among the parents who opt for selective education in order to be among the few. Will we see an end to that on the Labour Benches, or is it just that some of the few will be all right, but not the rest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am delighted to say that my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Social Security fully support the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> For other people, anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I know that Conservative Members like to conduct education debates on the basis of what one or two individuals might do, but that is one of the reasons why you lost so badly on 1 May. It does not wash with the British public.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I did not lose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> You are a rare example, Mr. Gale, of a Conservative candidate who was successful on 1 May 1997 but I am not sure whether your seat is on our target list for the next election.
<P>
We must take into account the traumatic effects of our education structure and the low aspirations of many youngsters. This morning, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary talked about a modern economy's need to have a majority of people being educated, doing well and continuing their learning. We need also to consider the benefits and standards that come from, yes, a selective system, but also from a comprehensive system.
<P>
I have some figures, although we know that figures can be used in all sorts of ways. One of the most telling statistics that I have come across is that, over the past 15 years, the proportion of young people gaining five or more higher-grade passes at GCSE has risen to 46 per cent. that is, it has doubled at the same time as the number of pupils attending comprehensive schools has also doubled. There is no doubt in my mind that comprehensive education has led to that expansion of opportunities.
<P>
I also believe that one of the reasons why one in three youngsters now go into higher education is the introduction of comprehensive education. In my day, the proportion was 10 per cent., which reflected the 10 per cent. of pupils who went to grammar schools. That was the nature of the system.
<P>
I take the point that Kent and Hampshire are not good examples. Hampshire has a far smaller number of people receiving free school meals than Kent, where the proportion is high. I looked through all the figures to find a selective area and a non-selective area with the same percentage of children on free school meals it was not easy. Two such areas, however, would provide a good comparison, because most people accept that the level of free schools meals is a good indicator of children's socio-economic backgrounds.
<P>
Two authorities that had exactly the same percentage of children on free school meals in 1997 these are the latest figures available are Essex and Solihull, where the figure was 12.8 per cent. Essex has a selective system and 44.6 per cent. of its pupils got five good GCSEs that is, A* down to C. In Solihull, which is totally non-selective and which is where the Conservative party lost many seats when it wanted to move to a selective system the figure is 51.2 per cent. Thus, there is no doubt in my mind or that of the Government that a modern comprehensive system that looks forward, offers diversity and meets the needs and abilities of all the children can meet additional needs and improve standards.
<P>
That is why I will ask the Committee to resist the amendments. They go down the wrong road because they are a product of the old agenda.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> For the reasons that I gave before we suspended, I invite the Committee to resist the amendments and the new clause.
<P>
<B> Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister treated us to his prejudices on the grammar school and secondary modern selection issue. He made it clear that he is personally I assume that he was also speaking on behalf of the Government against the principle of selection which underlies grammar schools. He said that he would make clear the principle on which the Government base their policy, but it was crystal clear it could not have been clearer that the Government's policy [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the usual channels conduct their discussions in the usual corridor, please?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Government's policy is based not on a principle at all, but on an aversion to the idea of grammar schools and a political judgment that, while they are content to see the slow death of such schools one by one, they do not want to see the principle on which those schools are based put to the test. The judgment that the Government have reached is a cocktail of principle and political judgment.
<P>
None of that was out of order, but it was not relevant to the question that the Committee is being asked to decide. The Government's policy is to allow a ballot to take the admissions policy of particular schools in one direction; the purpose of the amendment is simply to give a different group of parents the same opportunity to participate in developing admissions policy in the other direction.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are talking about the same admissions policy. Although the Minister says that the Government are not in favour of it and would be happy to see it decay, they presumably do not believe that it is contrary to the public interest because they are content for it to continue. They have reached the judgment that it is not so important that they should have a battle of principle about it. The Committee has been asked to decide whether the principle of choice that is available to parents of children in the 165 existing grammar schools should be available to parents who might wish to set up a new grammar school. The Minister has not explained why a choice that is available to one group of parents should be denied to another. It is on that basis that I seek my hon. Friend's support in a vote on the amendment.

Clause 90 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 91</center></H4>
<H4><center>Permitted selection: pre-existing arrangements</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 375, in page 67, line 28, leave out from "provision" to end of line 32.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 376, in page 67, leave out lines 37 to 41.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to change the basis of clause 91 to allow pre-existing arrangements to continue to develop within the framework of the decisions about admissions policy that the Committee discussed at last Thursday's sitting and which is the basis for making decisions on the rest of admissions policy issues.
<P>
I should make it clear at the outset that this group of amendments has nothing to do with grammar schools; we are talking purely about one of the Government's protected forms of selection. I hope, therefore, that Ministers and Labour Back Benchers who respond to the points that I want to make on the amendments will not make spirited attacks on the principles of grammar schools, the 11-plus and so forth. That is irrelevant to clause 91. The clause allows pre-existing arrangements outside the grammar school sector for selection to continue. Subsection (4) makes it clear that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Nothing in this section applies to a school with selective admission arrangements (as defined by section 95(2)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the grammar school section. We are talking not about grammar schools but about pre-existing selection arrangements.
<P>
Clause 91, as drafted, provides that existing selection arrangements for academic year 1997-98 are allowed to continue provided that they are totally unchanged in any significant respect, either in terms of the proportion of selective admissions that are allowed in any relevant age group or on any other basis of selection. The Government will allow them to continue, but will not allow any development even one that may be sought and for which there may be support within the terms of the admission arrangements that were accepted by the Committee last week.
<P>
I seek to eliminate the block on development that is imposed by the clause. If existing arrangements are to be protected by statute and this is the first time that there has been such protection for existing selective arrangements in legislation I cannot understand what principle of public policy should allow us to accept the idea that they are so perfect in the form in which they were inherited from the previous Government that they cannot be developed or improved upon at any foreseeable point in the future. That is the logic of the Government's position: they inherited such a high state of perfection as a result of legislation that they vehemently opposed at every stage of the previous Government's period in office that they cannot envisage any improvement.
<P>
I am not so arrogant as to assume that the previous Government reached such a high state of perfection of human knowledge. The Committee should reflect on this issue before according statutory protection to arrangements that evolved over a period before 1 May 1997. I think that it is contrary to the public interest to accord those arrangements such a high degree of statutory and automatic protection. I want an arrangement that allows the evolution of admissions policy in the context of schools that have pre-existing admission arrangements. I invite the Committee to agree that if it is right in principle that those basic ideas be allowed to continue, it must also be right in principle to allow people to think about how they might be improved. Otherwise, there are schools in which the further development of ideas which the Government accept and write into statute will be banned by exactly the statute that asserts the desirability of the continued existence of those arrangements. It is an extraordinary statutory provision to say that the idea is right so good, in fact, that it should be protected by statute for the first time but that no further development should be allowed.
<P>
I therefore seek the Committee's agreement to a relatively straightforward amendment. I have no doubt that the Ministers will, as always when amendments are tabled, have all sorts of technical objections to them. However, I invite the Committee to agree to the principle and I would be very happy to accept a refined amendment, if there were a better way of achieving the policy objective that where there is a pre-existing selection arrangement, it should not be considered incapable of improvement because it was in place on 1 May 1997. Instead, it should be capable of improvement and development within the context of the admission arrangements and arrangements for making admissions policy decisions that were agreed by the Committee last week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall ask the Committee to resist these two amendments, but not on the grounds that they are technically flawed. We have tried to resist the temptation to pray in aid sloppy drafting and have generally tried to address the principle behind the amendment. I shall try to do that in relation to these two amendments. As the right hon. Member for Charnwood said, the debate is about partial selection, so I shall address that issue specifically.
<P>
In the Bill we have looked, as we have done with the grammar schools, at two categories. We have said that we do not want an expansion of partial selection and we shall draw a line where we are at the moment in relation to schools that have an admissions policy based on partial selection. We will leave things as they are for schools where partial selection is already in being, but one will allow no new partial selection.
<P>
That is why we believe that it is inappropriate to endorse the two amendments. If those schools want to develop differently they may be attracted by the later provisions of the Bill, which allow schools to give priority to aptitude for up to 10 per cent. of the pupils in a school. If schools that partially select at present want to develop, they may want to look at that opportunity, but we do not want an increasing number of children to be selected through the partial selection system. It could be a way to achieve grammar school status, because a school could partially select 98 per cent. of its intake and effectively become a grammar school as a result. We want to resist that, given the points that I was making before the Division in the House earlier.
<P>
We want to look forward and say that there will be no new partial selection, while leaving schools that have it at the moment as they are. They will be dealt with by the adjudicator, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment said this morning, but we do not want them to use the opportunity provided by the amendments to expand the amount of selection.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister has dealt with the point about the proportion of selective admissions, although I am still not clear why the final state of knowledge was achieved on 1 May. What other issues is the Minister concerned about, and why is he not prepared to allow any significant change to the basis of selection if a school wishes to evolve the basis of selection, leaves aside the question of the proportion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The issue is how an increase in partial selection will affect provision in the locality. We already know that in many parts of the country, particularly in Hertfordshire and Bromley, real difficulties are being caused as a result of partial selection by a number of schools. We believe that to allow that to continue and develop in the way outlined by the right hon. Gentleman will make matters worse and that negative competition will develop between schools, because of the number of young people coming in as a result of an increase in partial selection.
<P>
Our view is that it is better to look at the diversity and the opportunities that will be offered by later provisions in the Bill, as part of modernising the comprehensive principle. Going down the road outlined by the right hon. Gentleman will wreck the comprehensive principle and cause difficulties for far more youngsters. For those reasons we ask the Committee to resist the two amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I asked the Minister specifically about the purpose of subsection (1)(b). Subsection (1)(a) deals with the increase in proportion, and we should not go on reciting those arguments indefinitely. The Minister addressed those arguments. He was not concerned about any other proposed change that might be introduced. It is perfectly possible for a school to wish to change the basis on which it selects a constant proportion of pupils. The clause would freeze the proportion that it would be permissible to select on the principles of partial selection. Not only that, it would freeze the basis on which the selection was made. The reason for that is not clear to me. I cannot understand why policy development on the basis of an admissions policy that is permitted in a school and protected by statute should be put on hold. That would be the effect of the clause.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am happy to give way to the Minister if the note that has been passed to him suggests why we should oppose change in the basis of selection. As he does not want to intervene, I conclude that the draftsman probably included the provision as belt and braces undesirable belt and braces. The Minister made the case, which the Committee can accept or reject, for limiting the proportion. He did not make the case for preventing a change in the basis of selection, the second aim of the clause. Why should we limit the ability of the admissions authority to change the basis of selecting a constant proportion of the pupils of a school?
<P>
The Minister does not seem to be pressing to rise and offer a suggestion as to the basis of that feature of the clause. Because he does not attempt to justify the clause, I shall seek a Division on the amendment, which would make the system more flexible and a better reflection of the policies that Ministers have in other circumstances claimed to support.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I regret the fact that the Committee rejected amendment No. 375, which would have created a desirable clause for which I should not have hesitated to vote. I am left in a quandary over the clause as it stands. I look forward to the debate on clause 93. I do not expect the Minister, in debating partial selection by aptitude, to be any better able than previously to persuade me that there is a difference of principle [Interruption.] I should be happy to give way to the hon. Member for Bath; I cannot hear what he says from his present position. I do not anticipate being more persuaded on the next occasion than I have been previously that there is a difference of principle between clause 91 and clause 93. Both relate to partial selection. They involve principles concerning sets of circumstances that will become increasingly difficult to distinguish in practice.
<P>
I shall invite my hon. Friends to support clausse 91, unsatisfactory though it is, because voting against it would imply that we were against the continuation of existing arrangements which were in place on 1 May 1997. I do not believe that they are the best arrangements that could ever have been invented, but they should be supported. Therefore, with a rather heavy heart, I invite my hon. Friends to support clause 91.

Clause 91 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 92</center></H4>
<H4><center>Permitted selection: pupil banding</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not wish to detain the Committee for long, but although I shall recommend that my hon. Friends support clause 92, it is important to pause for a brief period to reflect on the fact that it casts a few doubts on some of the arguments against the principle of selection. Ministers and Labour Back Benchers have often told us of the inaccuracy of assessments, tests, the 11-plus and various other forms of assessment of ability or aptitude, or whatever we are invited to call them. I think that the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston said that there is no known means of assessing aptitude, which will be an interesting concept in debating clause 93.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I think that the record will show that I was not aware of such a means; I know a man who is, and he will reveal all later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> This promises to be a more interesting debate than I had expected. The hon. Lady could perform a dress rehearsal, so that the Minister haas time to think about the questions that he must answer on clause 93. Exactly the same issues are raised in clause 92. If the principle of selection to deliver efficient banding is to be accepted, the questions that the hon. Lady poses to the Minister on selection by aptitude also apply to clause 92.
<P>
The only purpose of clause 92 is to allow school admissions authorities to assess the ability of children across the abiltiy range to produce a balanced admissions cohort, under the principles of banding defined in the clause, reflecting the ability range of the local community. That policy cannot be delivered unless there is a reasonably accurate means of assessing a child's ability. Otherwsie, children will take the test, and undergo the assessment or whatever in an attempt to produce an entry cohort that accurately reflects the ability range of local children, but there will be no means of assessing their ability to build that allegedly representative cohort.
<P>
I invite the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston to tease out in her mind how she might deliver effective banding. I imagine that she will support clause 92, especially if she wants to challenge the Government on clause 93. However, she would be well advised to follow Harold Macmillan's dictum to rebel on not more than one issue at a time or the Whips will become muddled. The hon. Lady must decide for herself whether there is an efficient means of assessing aptitude or ability. If it cannot be done in the context of clause 93, there is no logical basis for supporting clause 92.
<P>
I support clause 92, imperfect though it is, because one can have a reasonable stab at assessing a child's ability. The Committee will remember that the principle of banding set out in clause 92 underlies the admissions policy of city technology colleges. It is a form of admissions policy that, in a diverse system, I would be perfectly happy to see continue. The Government are right to allow banding, but it is inconsistent with an admissions policy that allows banding to then say that ability cannot be assessed. If ability cannot be assessed, one cannot band.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is wrong to equate banding as a form of admissions policy with the 11-plus or with selection where all admissions are of children of high ability.
<P>
Some people think that for a school to be effectively comprehensive it should have a cross-section of ability. That is debatable, and I do not feel strongly about it. I certainly do not feel that a school cannot be comprehensive unless it has a cross-section of ability. The right hon. Gentleman will know that, as well as its being used by CTCs, banding was used by the Inner London education authority. Some schools in London continue to use it.
<P>
One of the crucial differences is that schools tend to put children into bands on the basis of ability mostly on reading scores and reading tests, which is a simple measurement, rather than the more complex tests used by grammar schools, which try to judge ability across a wider range of skills. However, in the banding system there is still room to take account of parental preference, proximity to a school or having a sibling there. That is why the Bill allows those authorities that currently band as a means of admissions at the age of 11 to continue to do so. We do not want to deny them that right; we want to protect it.
<P>
Nothing that the right hon. Gentleman said could equate with a system that seeks to take only children of the highest ability, denying parental choice among other criteria. Banding will allow other criteria and allow parents to express a preference on which school their child attends at the age of 11.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary considered the case that I described this morning of a town with three schools, one attracting the very best ability that is so oversubscribed that the second school decides to band, the third school therefore taking children who, according to the Labour party, may feel a sense of rejection.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I remember the hon. Gentleman's comment. I doubt if that would happen. If there were three schools, one selective and two not selective, one of the latter would decide not to band. It is more likely to happen if the whole authority has an admissions policy on banding, but if it was of concern to other admissions authorities in the area, it would be open to them, under the provisions of the Bill, to take the matter to the school organisation committee and then to the adjudicator.
<P>
We should not fear that that could jeopardise the admissions arrangements of other schools. It is important to allow schools to admit through banding if they choose to do so. For those reasons, I ask that clause 92 stand part of the Bill.
