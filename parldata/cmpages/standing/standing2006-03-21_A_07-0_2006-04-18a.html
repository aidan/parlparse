<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000224"></a>Stephen
Hammond:</b> I welcome you back to the Chair, Sir Nicholas,
and I trust that I can say on behalf of the Committee that I hope that
you had a good and restful recess as
well.</div><a name="06041825000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our next subject
is a series of clauses on driving instructors and driver training.
Amendment No. 97, which I and my hon. Friend the Member for North
Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) tabled, deals with the power to make
available information on people who provide courses and give
instruction. The amendments selected with it, to schedule 5 and clause
41, are all to the same effect, which is to prevent the Secretary of
State or the Minister taking powers to disclose the personal details of
those persons who are
registered.</div><a name="06041825000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I guess
that the Minister will say that the powers are necessary for
transparency and so on. However, many members of the Committee will
have been briefed by the Driving Instructors Association, which
represents more than 13,000 driving instructors and is consulted
regularly by the Department for Transport, the Driving Standards
Agency, the Driver Vehicle Testing Agency, the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>Vehicle and Operator Services Agency. It is a member also of the
Department for Transport&#146;s advisory group on testing and
training. Therefore, it is interesting to hear what the DIA has to
say.</div><a name="06041825000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The DIA is quite
concerned that unless the amendments are accepted we will single out
driving instructors and deprive them of some of the normal rights to
privacy that are afforded to other citizens under the Data Protection
Act 1998. It claims&#151;and based on our research, we would
agree&#151;that it can find no parallel in statute to the draconian
use of such mandatory disclosure of personal information. I wonder
whether, when the Minister responds, he will be able to satisfy us that
he has used such disclosure
elsewhere.</div><a name="06041825000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
concern that a huge amount of information would be requested. For
instance, the DIA believes&#151;again, it is a concern that I
share&#151;that there would be some clear human rights implications,
and certainly under article 8 of the European convention on the right
to respect for private and family life. If the amendments are not
accepted, much of that privacy will be affected. Therefore, the
Secretary of State&#146;s statement that the Bill is compatible with
the convention on human rights must be
challenged.</div><a name="06041825000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government set out in their road safety strategy,
&#147;Tomorrow&#146;s Roads&#151;Safer for Everyone&#148; the
objective of ensuring that performance and other information was made
available to the public to &#147;empower customers&#148; and
to</div> <a name="06041825000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;encourage
intelligent use of driving
instruction&#148;.</div><a name="06041825000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
message, therefore, is that that could have been more easily achieved
by aiming for voluntary consent rather than including in the Bill the
need to disclose such personal information. The information
commissioner has said that it would have been possible to look for a
voluntary disclosure of the information on certificates rather than
statutory
disclosure.</div><a name="06041825000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment would give back some protection to the driving instructors. I
know that a number of them are concerned that the enforced publication
of their home addresses may result in a substantial invasion of their
privacy. As many as 98 of the UK driving school businesses are sole
traders or franchises. In both cases they are either based at their
home address or their home address will be published under the Bill.
Therefore, they might be worried about being contacted by people
wishing to get information out of them unreasonably by extortion or to
steal their vehicles, which is a ready concern. Publishing such
information is unnecessary. The fact that someone has attained the
necessary qualifications is all that needs to be published on a
certificate; there is no need for the extra
disclosure.</div>
<a name="06041825000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000225"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Transport (Dr. Stephen
Ladyman):</b> Like the rest of the Committee, I hope that you
had a good Easter, Sir Nicholas. You will not be surprised to learn
that I shall advise the Committee to resist the amendments. There are
legitimate concerns that driving instructors might have about the
release of information about them. Obviously, I understand that they
would be concerned if personal information were released. That clearly
is not our intention. I can also see that they might have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>legitimate concerns if we published raw data about their performance
that was out of context and did not enable consumers to make sensible
choices. That is clearly not our intention. We want to be able to
provide objective information to individuals who wish to purchase
training so that they can ensure that they do so from an appropriate
person.</div> <a name="06041825000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I readily
accept that the approved driving instructors and some of the people who
represent them have not felt that the Driving Standards Agency has
properly engaged with them on some issues in the past. I have spoken to
the new chief executive about that and she and I are determined to put
that right and to have a much better relationship with those
organisations and with approved driving instructors in the future. We
want to take them with us and to ensure that they understand why we are
attempting to drive the sector forward and how we intend to do
it.</div> <a name="06041825000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend that
any information we publish should be thoroughly discussed with all
sides of the industry, including the organisations mentioned by the
hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond). We want to construct a way
of publishing that data that takes account of people&#146;s very real
concerns. As far as personal information is concerned, those
individuals already enjoy the protection of the Data Protection Act.
Nothing in the Bill will take that right from them.
</div><a name="06041825000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would
make the whole clause redundant. Its purpose is to give us an enabling
power so that, when we and the industry devise the best way of
producing statistics on performance, people can make good judgments
about who is good and who is bad, who is effective and who is
ineffective, and who is providing the best training service. We want to
make that information publicly available so that people can make those
choices. If the amendments were accepted, we would not be able to
provide that information. We would not even be able to provide
information about the availability of trainer assistants who are there
to help people who are deaf or have other special needs and require the
services of an assistant when they are training to drive. It seems
entirely reasonable that we put that information in the public domain.
The Driving Standards Agency is collecting it anyway, and it is
appropriate that we make it available to the public, but in a form that
the public can understand and that does not treat unfairly a driving
instructor who concentrates on more difficult cases. The information
will need to be published in context.</div>
<a name="06041825000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give the hon. Gentleman an
absolute assurance that we will consult thoroughly on what the
information will consist of, how it will be published and in what
context. In order to utilise the power we will, at some point, have to
come back to the House for its approval of the necessary regulations. I
hope that, with that promise and assurance, the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw the amendment and the Committee will allow clause 39 to stand
part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06041825000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000226"></a>Stephen
Hammond:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. We got a number of
important assurances from him, including that while he is Minister this
Act will not be used to deny the right of driving instructors to enjoy
the protection of personal data provisions. I am still concerned that
if my amendments are not accepted it will be possible for driving
instructors&#146; personal details 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>to be published. I will need to look further at the matter and take
further advice.</div><a name="06041825000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful to the Minister for his assurance that there will be further
consultation. As he is well aware, it has been a long-running concern
of the DIA that it is not suitably consulted by the DSA. The concern
was initially that raw data on driving examinations would be passed on.
Indeed, a series of inquiries has shown, in data for individual driving
instructors, that some of the fault markings in tests have not been as
accurate as one would have hoped. I reserve the right to return to the
matter on Report if I am not satisfied by legal advice on the
disclosure of personal information, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="06041825000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000231"></a>Stephen
Hammond:</b> That is the problem with the recess, of course. I
am sure that it applies to everyone in Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div><a name="06041825000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern is simple. We
understand entirely the need for approved test assistants, although we
want to ensure that they are subject to proper scrutiny. Had I risen to
my feet a little quicker, I would have liked to raise a number of
issues about test assistants and some of the tables in schedule 5 that
relate to them.</div>
<a name="06041825000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 86 is quite
specific. It deals with subsection (2) and some of the circumstances in
which a test assistant may be used. We have little difficulty with
support being given to those who have difficulty hearing, but we are
considerably concerned about the word &#147;understanding&#148;. If
someone does not understand what is said to them, does that mean that
they might fail to understand road signs, or various other instructions
that may be given?</div>
<a name="06041825000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is a probing one.
We want the Minister to explain the Government&#146;s thinking in
referring to someone who may have difficulty understanding questions or
instructions in the relevant tests&#151;factors that will clearly be
applicable on the road as well. Is what is meant a lack of
understanding of language, learning difficulties or mental impairment?
We seek clarification from the Minister on exactly which circumstances
someone&#146;s lack of or difficulty in understanding would be
warranted. I look forward to his response.</div>
<a name="06041825000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000232"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I, at least, appreciate the speed with which you
go through the amendments, Sir Nicholas.</div>
<a name="06041825000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I can give the hon.
Member for Wimbledon the assurance he seeks. When one is sitting the
driving test, there are a number of instructions that the person
setting the test has to give about the test itself. It is only right,
in our view, that a person should have any assistance they need in
order to understand those instructions. If they are hearing impaired,
they need to have those instructions relayed in such a way that they
can understand them, so someone who understands sign language would
need to be made available. Equally, if a person does not speak English
or Welsh&#151;the languages in which we can provide the driving
test&#151;it may be necessary to have a translator.</div>
<a name="06041825000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The lack of comprehension that
a person is allowed relates to the instructions for the test itself,
not the content of the test or the nature of road signs. It is not
possible to have an assistant translate a road sign; one needs to be
able to understand a road sign oneself and act accordingly. The
assistant will be present to help the individual only with the
mechanism of the test, not with the skills on which one is being
tested. I hope that with that explanation the hon. Gentleman will be
happy to withdraw the amendment.</div>

with debate on this clause, but I should just like some clarification.
The clause seems sensible, but I should like the Minister to clarify
who is in charge. What is the order of command between the DVLA,
district councils, and county councils, which have now been brought in
where there are two-tier authorities? The measure is sensible, but I am
not clear about how it will work in practice. I would be grateful if

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000235"></a>Dr.

not replace the police and trading standards officers. The idea is that
in future the DVLA will work with them as a joint enforcement team. As
he suggests, it is a sensible measure. It removes a burden on the
police; it will allow the DVLA to take enforcement action in its own
right, rather than reporting matters to the police for them to take
action on its behalf; and it will resolve an anomaly whereby trading
standards officers possess the power of enforcement if they are
employed by district councils, but do not if they are employed by
county councils. In future, officers employed by county councils will
possess the power, too. The intention is that all three&#151;the
police, the DVLA and trading standards officers&#151;will work
jointly.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000238"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> Again, we do not have any great disagreement
with this clause, but I should like the Minister to declare what
constitutes a legal number plate, what qualifies as a number plate and
what marks are allowed. There has been much press controversy about
European Union flags being allowed, but not Union jacks and crosses of
St. George&#151;relevant to next week. What constitutes a legal
number plate? Will the Minister have any discretion over this matter,
or will it become entirely a Commission
responsibility?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div><a name="06041825000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">All technical matters&#151;the
typeface, colour, dimensions, spacing and so on&#151;to do with the
appearance of number plates are set out in a British standard, and I
would be happy to make that information available to the hon.
Gentleman. I am not certain about who decides whether an EU flag or
some other symbol can be on a number plate, but I shall write to the
Committee and give chapter and verse on who has responsibility for
that.</div><a name="06041825000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">To my horror, I
discovered that some people like to hang gimmick number plates on their
bedroom wall. I have absolutely no idea why anybody would want a
gimmick number plate under any circumstances or why they would want to
display it, but apparently there is some trade in such things. I
suspect the truth is that people have a number plate that conforms to
the British standard when they have their MOT test, but replace it
immediately afterwards with a gimmick number plate that uses different
typefaces and spacing and therefore spells
something.</div><a name="06041825000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the clause is to insist that in future when people buy a gimmick
number plate it is clearly marked as such and therefore cannot be used
as a substitute for a real one when the person thinks nobody is
watching. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about flags and other
markings.</div><a name="06041825000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041825000241"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): We have all
seen gimmicky number plates, which are becoming more prevalent. I noted
four in the past month: L4RRY, B4RRY, D3GSY and S3XY&#151;or Larry,
Barry, Degsy and Sexy. As the Minister says, people use different
typefaces, put in a black dot for the screw and turn numbers into
letters. It brings a certain amount of pleasure and amusement to quite
a few people, but I would not dream of having such a number plate, as
it would be more likely to attract the attention of the police or
someone else like that. What will the Minister do about people who have
such number plates? Will the police be empowered to stop them? Will
traffic wardens be empowered to report them? What measures will be
taken?</div><a name="06041825000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000242"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The police already have powers to stop
individuals who have changed their number plate in such a way that it
no longer conforms to the standard. I would not for one second want to
discourage people from having personalised number plates. Indeed, the
DVLA makes a good deal of money for the taxpayer from auctioning them,
and if anybody named Mr. Singh or Dr. Singh is listening to our debate,
I can tell them that the forthcoming DVLA auction will include the
number plate 51NGH and various extensions of that. I hope that it will
raise a great deal of money for the British
taxpayer.</div><a name="06041825000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
numbers must look like numbers, and the spacing needs to be such that
it is clear which part of the plate is numbers and which part is
letters. If anybody has played around with their number plate in such a
way as to make it difficult to read, or if it is in any way not obvious
what the original number plate was, the police should take enforcement
action against
them.</div><a name="06041825000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000243"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> I understand that the intention is to tighten up
on various practices, particularly fiddling with odometers, or
clocking, which obviously is a serious problem. The Conservatives
support the Government&#146;s attempts to ensure accurate data for
people who are purchasing a motor
car.</div><a name="06041825000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause raises
the question of the accuracy of DVLA data, and I do not envy the DVLA
in its task. It wrote to a member of the public giving information from
its database in March last year. It holds in excess of 36 million
vehicle records and 47 million driver records, and reckons that 68 per
cent. of those records are correct in every detail and that 22 per
cent. contain spelling mistakes in name, address, details or postcode.
It considers those to be minor errors which do not prevent mail from
being delivered or prevent the police or manufacturers from tracing
vehicles. It reckons that that amounted to a 90 per cent. traceability
level from the information on the vehicle database. It made the point
that it is totally dependent on the motoring public for much of its
information.</div> <a name="06041825000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
not difficult to work out that with 36 million vehicle records, 47
million driver records and its best accuracy level of 97.5 per cent.,
900,000 vehicle records and 1.175 million driver records must be
inaccurate. With a perfect record rate of 68 per cent., 11.52 million
vehicle records and 15.04 million driver records are not perfect. With
a 90 per cent. traceability rate the figures are even easier to work
out: 3.6 million vehicle records and 4.7 million driver records are not
traceable.</div><a name="06041825000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
envy the DVLA in trying to keep track of those records, but I should
like to know the Minister&#146;s thoughts on how the system can be
tightened up because there are press reports of people deliberately
driving around with inaccurate number plates. One of my constituents
was the proud possessor of an ancient series 1 Cortina which, on a good
day when it was warmed up, might have got as far as
Shrewsbury&#151;perhaps I am being rude about the car. He was clocked
three times for breach of the congestion charge and I had to take the
matter to the Mayor because it was obvious that someone had used his
registration number. There are anecdotal records of a substantial
number of people driving around deliberately using illegal and
inaccurate number plates to avoid the congestion charge, speeding fines
and so on. That seems to be a growing trend, although I have no figures
on it.</div> <a name="06041825000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the
Minister&#146;s opinion on the lessons that could be learned from
other countries? I was recently in Germany where there is a tight
system under which the number plate follows the owner. When people buy
a new car, they must hand over the documents for their insurance and
for their equivalent of the council tax, which is a local tax showing
their domicile, which then attracts the three letters&#151;one letter
in large towns&#151; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>showing where the owner lives. That may be bad luck on the Singhs who
are looking forward to buying a number plate at auction, because that
system wipes out personalised number plates. Also, importantly, there
is the MOT test&#151;in Germany it is a TUV&#151;when the vehicle
is three years or more old. When the vehicle is sold the number is
surrendered and a new number is created for the new owner. A similar
system operates in America, which I have not yet inspected, where each
number plate includes an insurance sticker and an annual sticker and is
handed out by the state
authority.</div><a name="06041825000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our current
system, as the lady from the DVLA said, depends entirely on the
motoring public for information and is not 100 per cent. accurate. I
repeat that I do not envy the DVLA its job, but if we are to have
proper enforcement and to clamp down on the hard core of really bad
drivers we must have an accurate database, and there are lessons to be
learned from the German and American systems. I was in Sweden recently
where the road pricing scheme in Stockholm is similar to that in
Germany. It simply cannot work without accurate data.</div>
<a name="06041825000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government are all over the
shop on road pricing and if we are ever to have a new road pricing
scheme it must have a cast iron, accurate database. We fully support
the Government&#146;s aim to clamp down on the hard core, but that
seems to be extremely difficult when the current system is not as
watertight as it might be and as I am told it is in other countries. I
should like to hear the Minister&#146;s comments on that, but in
general we support the clause and its attempt to tighten up on
inaccurate mileage on second-hand
cars.</div><a name="06041825000101"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000244"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman deals with an important issue.
I am very proud of the integrity of the DVLA database. The DVLA team do
a fantastic job, given the sheer volume of people and vehicles that
they have to register. It is true that inaccuracies get into the system
and there are a number of ways of dealing with that. First we should
continuously compare the information that is recorded on each of the
DVLA databases to see how we can improve our data. Secondly, as part of
the annual re-registration process, we hope that honest motorists will
correct any mistakes in documents from the DVLA and send back the
information so that the DVLA&#146;s database can be
updated.</div> <a name="06041825000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for those
motorists who are out to cheat the system and have cloned a vehicle,
which sounds as if it were the case with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constituent, or who are trying to avoid their liabilities in some other
way, we have to work very closely with the police to try to stop them.
We can now immobilise vehicles when they turn out to have
irregularities. We have made available to the police not only the
registration database, but the insurance database. There is increasing
use of automatic number plate recognition systems, which is another
reason, to refer back to the point that the hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) made on the last clause, why it is important
to have readable number plates where numbers are numbers and letters
are letters and they all are properly spaced.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div><a name="06041825000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">As automatic number plate
reading systems are increasingly available to the police they can
instantly check whether a car is registered, whether the tax disk is up
to date and whether the car is insured. We need to work with the police
to stop more cars and to impound them if there are any irregularities.
Once we start to do that more frequently, and once people start to
realise that the consequence of having inaccurate data on the DVLA
database at best seriously inconveniences them while they put it right
and at worst means that their car is confiscated and they are taken
through the courts, I have no doubt that there will be a further
improvement in the system.</div>
<a name="06041825000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon. Gentleman, one of
the things I did during the recess was to visit Stockholm to see its
road pricing system. Even there I am afraid that the records are not
100 per cent. and a number of individuals who want to cheat the
Stockholm road pricing system have started to stick a little sun visor
over the top of their number plate which effectively blocks the
camera&#146;s downward view of it. There are dishonest people in
every society, even in those well ordered Scandinavian societies like
Sweden, who will try to cheat the system. We must try to be one step
ahead of such people, which is one reason why we have a trial at the
moment of electronic tagging of number plates. We are looking at a
number of initiatives using microchips and other systems that will
perhaps enable us to go to the next level of security at some point in
the future and get that database much closer to the 100 per cent. where
we need it to
be.</div><a name="06041825000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000245"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> I was told that 18,000 people in the Stockholm
area pay no taxes, live outside the law and are driving around. No
system is perfect. But does the Minister think there are merits in the
system that I have described, where there is effectively an annual
check? It is not possible to get a sticker for a number plate in the
States without insurance. The TUV certificate and insurance have to be
presented in Germany. Although what the Minister describes is very
sensible and it must help with the titanic task of the DVLA in tracking
this huge number of vehicles, in Germany there is an annual check on
every vehicle, which is administered locally and the information passed
on to the central database. Does the Minister not think that that would
have some
merit?</div><a name="06041825000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000246"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> There is an annual check in this country as well.
When a person buys vehicle excise duty he has to fill in the
appropriate forms and make contact with the DVLA. If the vehicle is
more than three years old, there is a physical check on it when it is
taken for its MOT test. One of the things that an MOT tester is
expected to do is to check the number plate and ensure that it conforms
with
expectations.</div><a name="06041825000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are checks, but there are equally people who cheat them. As the hon.
Gentleman said, 18,000 people in the Stockholm area do not pay any form
of taxes and are trying to cheat the system. I cannot remember off-hand
exactly how many cars use the Stockholm congestion charging system, but
I think that it is only about
300,000.</div><a name="06041825000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000247"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> It is 400,000.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div><a name="06041825000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000248"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Well, 400,000. If 18,000 of them are completely
unregistered, that indicates that they are not achieving the level of
accuracy that we are in this country with 34 million vehicles on our
roads. Let us sing the praises of the DVLA for the excellent job that
it is doing, while recognising that we can always do better. Our target
must be as close as possible to 100 per cent. accuracy, and with future
technologies coming on stream and closer co-operation with the police
on enforcement, I hope that we can get to 100 per
cent.</div><a name="06041825000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right: as we get closer to the day when we move to
national road pricing, the incentive to cheat the system will get
bigger and bigger. The system will have to be even more robust than it
is now if it is to be a
success.</div><a name="06041825000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000249"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000250"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000251"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> Our amendments are simple. They would limit the
countries to which information can be divulged under the clause to
those that have signed up to the European vehicle and driving licence
information system treaty. As was said in another place, the clause
appears to be drafted extremely widely. If its purpose is to allow
ratification of the EUCARIS treaty, we have no objection. It is
sensible that there is an exchange of information. We debated foreign
vehicles and drivers and think that the treaty is a sensible measure.
However, it is interesting that significant countries such as France,
Italy and Spain have not signed the treaty yet. There are serious
questions why the clause is so broad. Subsection (2)(b) states that
information will be available
to</div><a name="06041825000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the authorities of
any country or territory outside the United Kingdom with responsibility
under the law of that
country&#148;.</div><a name="06041825000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">That goes a lot
wider than a requirement to sign up to the treaty, of which we
approve.</div> <a name="06041825000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also
consider the circumstances that would justify the disclosure of
information. To which departments in a foreign authority would
information be disclosed? Are there reciprocal relationships with the
country involved? What are the legal systems of the countries to which
we might be giving information? What is the exact purpose for which
information is being disclosed in each case? British drivers would like

<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>clear answers to those questions and an assurance of the intent of the
foreign authorities that will receive information.</div>
<a name="06041825000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We frequently find our
constituents tangled up in the Data Protection Act 1998. Where will
they stand if information is given to a number of foreign authorities
to which we are not bound by treaty? How can we ensure that the
information is not then passed on from that country to a third country?
We approve of the sensible exchange of information between European
countries that have signed the treaty and will use it with that
intention, but the clause as it stands is drafted too widely. We have
serious concerns about why the information is being sought by some
countries and what will happen to
it.</div>
<a name="06041825000200"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000252"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not intend
to push what is clearly a probing amendment to a vote. The amendment
would give rise to some strange anomalies. As he said, EUCARIS has so
far been ratified only by the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg. We
have not ratified it yet and will be able to do so only after the Bill
has been passed.</div><a name="06041825000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman himself pointed out that the French have not ratified
the treaty, so if we were to limit the exchange of information to
countries within EUCARIS we would not be able to exchange information
with the French authorities. My constituents in Kent are keen to move
towards a system by which we can take enforcement action alongside the
French authorities. It is in all our interests to have a slightly wider
scope than EUCARIS. I understand that there is a significant problem
with stolen vehicles being imported from Japan, which is outside the
EUCARIS treaty. We need to be able to exchange information with the
Japanese authorities to try to get to grips with the situation; that is
in our interests and in theirs.</div>
<a name="06041825000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman clearly does
not want information about British citizens to be released to countries
that would have less stringent requirements in respect of data
protection, for example. I can give him the absolute assurance that
before engaging in a relationship with any foreign authority to
exchange information about British citizens, the DVLA would first
ensure that that country&#146;s standards, its data protection
legislation, the security of its systems and its procedure were at
least a match for ours. However, in respect of our partners in the
European Union and the key countries with which we would want to be
able to exchange information, I have no doubt that we can come to
arrangements that enable us to be confident that the information we
provide is being properly treated, so that we can act
accordingly.</div>
<a name="06041825000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041825000253"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Paterson:</b> Can the Minister tell us which countries he is
thinking of that are currently outside the European treaty? He
mentioned Japan, but are there other
countries?</div><a name="06041825000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000254"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The key one is Japan, but any wealthy country
where vehicles might be stolen and where there might be a trade in
importing them is potentially a country with which we would want to
have a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>relationship. We may need such a relationship with the United States in
future, for example, but Japan is the most obvious country in the short
term. I understand that Australia and New Zealand are countries with
which it would be appropriate for us to have such
relationships.</div><a name="06041825000125"></a>

Paterson:</b> The Committee has made such rapid progress that
we have caught up with a clause to which the Opposition tabled an
amendment this afternoon. I am not sure about the status of that
amendment, but perhaps I can describe it.</div>
<a name="06041825000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000257"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I announced at the beginning of our proceedings
that we do not debate amendments so lately tabled, so I am afraid that
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment has no status
whatever.</div><a name="06041825000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000258"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> That is very
sad&#151;</div><a name="06041825000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000259"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I want to be helpful to the Opposition. I
am sure that it is not beyond the wit of man, and particularly of the
hon. Gentleman, to weave into this stand part debate a reference to
what he wanted to do.</div>
<a name="06041825000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000260"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> That was most helpful advice, Sir Nicholas, and
I shall try to follow it
closely.</div><a name="06041825000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s idea of having rest areas is interesting. We have
received a briefing stating that a significant number of road crashes
are caused by people going to sleep. I think that the figure is 17 per
cent. We are not convinced that this measure is the right way to go
about things, however, and we disagree quite strongly with the clause.
There are better ways of skinning this cat.</div>
<a name="06041825000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041825000261"></a><b class="B">Rosemary
McKenna</b> (Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch, East)
(Lab): Perhaps that is the point. Roadside service stations
are quite often skinning people, instead of skinning the cat by
providing service areas that are pretty much free, where people do not
have to spend much money.</div>
<a name="06041825000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000262"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> That was an interesting intervention. I am
delighted to see that the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) has
joined us. We hope that the Liberal Democrat party had an enjoyable
Easter as well.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div><a name="06041825000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not happy with the
clause. The idea has been picked up from the continent. I was in France
recently, looking at how the motorway system is run there. It is
entirely different from the system here. The French have sold the lot;
they have raised about €16 billion by selling off the right to
maintain, manage and expand their motorway system for the next 50 or 60
years. The private companies have the finance and the staff to patrol
and manage properly their rest areas.</div>
<a name="06041825000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">That system is quite unlike
ours. The measure would create substantial public expense; the Library
said that it would cost &#163;3 million to set up one of the proposed
areas, and a further &#163;300,000 for maintenance. We have doubts
about whether it is wise to create areas that cannot be properly
policed. If they do not have 24-hour CCTV coverage, the danger is that
they will attract ne&#146;er-do-wells, and they could rapidly become
dangerous places at night. We should concentrate on improving existing
services, as the hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and
Kirkintilloch, East (Rosemary McKenna) said.</div>
<a name="06041825000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also a disadvantage in
creating too many exits and entries on our crowded motorways. We
already have enough, and many traffic studies show that any exit or
entry point creates traffic problems. Substantial amounts of traffic
will be disrupted while the areas are built, and there will be yet more
entry and exit points. We are also not at all convinced that without
proper, 24-hour surveillance, such areas will work. They will need CCTV
that operates all the time, and regular patrolling. If they are to have
any refreshment facilities at all, they will become a sort of shadow
area&#151;possibly even worse than those with which the hon. Lady is
unhappy&#151;and they will be costly for the public purse. We do not
want them to become attractive areas for rapists, thieves and
burglars.</div> <a name="06041825000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer
is to improve existing motorway service areas. I entirely agree with
the hon. Lady about that. Our suggestion, on which the Minister might
like to comment, recognises the merit of allowing the existing service
areas to have picnic areas. We already have entry and exit points,
24-hour CCTV coverage and private money available to
staff.</div><a name="06041825000141"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000263"></a>Rosemary
McKenna:</b> May I make it clear that I was not particularly
attacking existing service stations? There should be alternatives where
those with families can go without experiencing the pressure young
children put on them to use the facilities and go to the various food
outlets. There should be an alternative place where people with young
families&#151;or anyone else&#151;can go to picnic without feeling
pressurised into purchasing
something.</div><a name="06041825000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000264"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> That was a most helpful point and I entirely
agree with the hon. Lady. I am proposing outdoor picnic areas on the
sites. She might like to know that the Traffic Signs Regulations and
General Directions 2002 exclude the ability to have adverts for picnic
areas in motorway service stations, which seems a complete anomaly.
That would be a much cheaper solution, because private money is
involved, and a much safer one, because such areas will be properly
patrolled and looked after. On that basis, my party is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>not prepared to support clause 48, which we think is well intentioned
but
wrong.</div><a name="06041825000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000265"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern
that the type of picnic areas in question, which are modelled on the
French aires, may not be suitable everywhere. Clearly, if not managed
correctly, they would be a problem. However, this is an enabling power.
It does not require us to open such sites up or put them all over the
place. It is simply a power that will allow us to create picnic areas
where we think them an appropriate way to provide an opportunity for
motorists to have a break.</div>
<a name="06041825000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the hon. Gentleman
that motorway service stations are privately operated, but that
motorway service operators do not necessarily want to build very
expensive service stations everywhere. Might it not be possible that
there are parts of the motorway network that currently do not have
service stations? People often have to drive too far along those parts
of the network because of the long distance between service stations,
and where operators are not interested in investing in service
stations, such a picnic area might be a cheaper way of providing people
with the opportunity to take a break. It is intended that they will
have 24-hour CCTV and basic facilities such as toilets and washrooms,
which will be regularly cleaned and inspected, and there will a minimum
level of security in these areas.</div>
<a name="06041825000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it possible that people
might be able to use these picnic areas for nefarious purposes? Yes, I
expect that that will be possible in certain circumstances. We need to
design such areas accordingly, with that in mind, but I do not see what
harm we can do by giving ourselves the power to create them where we
think they will benefit road safety. I suspect that that process will
be fairly limited; I would not have thought that very many of these
facilities will be constructed at public expense, but I think that,
where appropriate, they could be a good place for families to
stop.</div> <a name="06041825000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s idea about picnic areas associated with motorway
service stations. I think that some motorway service stations already
have them: I seem to recollect having a cup of coffee and a sandwich at
a table outside a service station at various times during the summer
months when I did not want to sit among the crowds inside.</div>
<a name="06041825000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am already discussing the
signage for motorway service stations with motorway service operators,
and if it is necessary for us to think of some way of indicating that a
picnic area is available at a service station, I am by all means
prepared to consider such an idea. I am open-minded about that, as long
as the signs do not distract drivers and have a negative impact on road
safety.</div><a name="06041825000201"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="06041825000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as far
as the clause is concerned, I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman
would be fundamentally opposed to our creating such areas where they
seem to be practical. I hope that he has not allowed himself to be
nobbled by motorway service operators, who might view them as
competition and therefore might have suggested to him that they should
be stifled at birth. I am sure that that is not the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>motivation for his amendment, and I am equally sure that he will
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06041825000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000266"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are not debating an amendment. We are
debating clause stand
part.</div><a name="06041825000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000267"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I am grateful to you, Sir Nicholas, for reminding
me of that. Opposition Front Benchers have been moving slowly on
several fronts today, and this is one of them. Clearly, it is my view
that the clause should stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06041825000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000268"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> I am not entirely convinced by the
Minister&#146;s reply, but perhaps I can do a deal with him. If he
will agree that he will seriously consider amending the Traffic Signs
Regulations and General Directions 2002 to allow picnic area symbols to
be put on service signs 2919.1, we will not oppose the
clause.</div><a name="06041825000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000269"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> It will probably stun the hon. Gentleman to learn
that I do not keep traffic sign regulations in my head, and the
particular traffic sign to which he refers is not springing to the
front of my mind. Therefore, I am not prepared to give him a specific
assurance about that sign, but I can assure him that I am open-minded
about issues around signage for motorway service stations. I am already
discussing such matters with the industry and my officials, and if we
can add value by making it clear that a picnic area is available at a
service station, I am prepared to consider it as long as it can be done
in a way that will not have a negative impact on road safety by
distracting
drivers.</div><a name="06041825000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000270"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> I am sure that you are aware, Sir Nicholas, that
sign 2919.1 is the sign that indicates a motorway service area
ahead&#151;it is very simple. At present, it is not legal to announce
that it includes a picnic area, but if the Minister is seriously
prepared to consider that and amend the regulation, we will not oppose
the
clause.</div><a name="06041825000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000271"></a>Dr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000272"></a>Stephen
Hammond:</b> This is an entirely sensible clause, and we wish
to commend it to the Committee. I am sure that the Minister will rise
to commend it as well. It is perfectly sensible that network operators
and the rail safety authority be consulted, particularly with regard to
railway crossings, before the start of major developments such as
distribution depots, which would result in an extreme or material
increase in the volume 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>of traffic or a change in its nature. The clause is entirely sensible
and appropriate, and I commend it to the
Committee.</div><a name="06041825000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000273"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I rise to indicate that clause 49 is not needed
in the Bill and should not stand part, and that I shall offer the same
advice about clauses 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 and 55. This group of clauses
deals with issues around level crossings, most of which will be covered
by the Government&#146;s new clause, which I shall propose when we
come to clause 53, if you allow me to do so, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="06041825000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue in
this clause is indicative of much that is in the group of clauses,
which was inserted in the Lords, in that it is covered by existing
legislation. The powers and the responsibilities already exist. There
is already a requirement for appropriate consultation to take place
when developments are proposed near a level crossing. Clause 49 is
therefore unnecessary; indeed, all the clauses to which I am referring
are unnecessary if the Committee is prepared to consider Government new
clause 30 in their
place.</div><a name="06041825000162"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041825000292"></a>Stephen
Hammond:</b> This clause relates to the most important and
necessary road safety development. Anyone who is seriously interested
in road safety will not and cannot oppose the clause. Anyone who has
taken a briefing from Network Rail will have seen that the incidence of
this offence on the railway network is increasing. It poses a threat to
other drivers on the roads and to train drivers and passengers. What
concerns us about the clause is that the scale of the punishment does
not meet the seriousness of the
crime.</div><a name="06041825000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I invite any
member of the Committee who has not done so to ask Network Rail to
provide them&#151;it will be happy to do so&#151;with the DVD
briefing that deals with the problems caused by motorists not obeying
traffic signals at level crossings. It is the most scary and disturbing
DVD that people could watch. There is the driver who decides that he
will play chicken with the oncoming train and there is the driver who
plays chicken with the barrier descending. There is the driver who goes
around the line of traffic and the half-barrier and across the
track&#151;the train passes less than three seconds later. There is
the driver who goes around the line of traffic on to the railway line,
sees an oncoming train and reverses into the front car in the line of
traffic. This is a serious offence, committed with intent. It is not a
careless act, and it is time for us to recognise
that.</div><a name="06041825000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government are serious about catching hardened criminals and continual
offenders and those people who act with the intent to endanger the
lives of others on our roads, it is time to increase the penalties.
Amendments Nos. 74 and 75 would give magistrates considerably more
flexibility. Six months is not sufficient, 12 months would be more
appropriate. This offence is as dangerous to public safety as
drink-driving is, and, therefore, it requires the same period of
disqualification.</div><a name="06041825000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 76 is slightly different in intent and effect, and I suspect that
given what the Minister intends to do with clause 51, we will reach
some agreement. If a person causes malicious damage to a bridge, it is
an offence. However, if someone causes damage to a bridge by skidding
on black ice, which might be considered to be driving without due care
and attention, it does not seem right that that person should be
subject to imprisonment. It is worth combining amendment No. 76 with
amendments Nos. 74 and 75 because it highlights the seriousness of the
offences listed in clause 50, and it is the intention of amendments
Nos. 74 and 75 to increase the penalties for these most serious of
offences.</div><a name="06041825000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041825000293"></a><b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): In our earlier sittings, we
discussed reckless and careless driving. The crux of the Bill is road
safety, and the clauses we are debating today concern an
area&#151;cars coming into contact with railway lines&#151;that has
not had much attention in the past. If a train were carrying several
hundred people, it would be extremely difficult for it to stop quickly,
and, therefore, railway signals on roads are there for a purpose. There
have been several well-documented examples of drivers ignoring those
signals and causing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>accidents. In one sense, an accident to themselves could be considered
their own fault, but more importantly, as we acknowledged when we
discussed reckless and careless driving, they are potentially putting
several hundred people at risk. That is as serious as some of the
offences we discussed earlier, such as driving without insurance or a
licence.</div><a name="06041825000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important, as the hon. Gentleman said, that we treat this with the same
degree of seriousness as drink-driving. In many respects, it is more
serious. Potentially, more people are at risk, and that is why it is
important that amendment No. 74 be made. It sends a clear message,
particularly as we expand and build in a greater number of areas. There
will be more traffic travelling over the crossings, and people must
know that a severe penalty will be administered if they attempt to jump
a crossing
light.</div><a name="06041825000192"></a>

is part of our campaign to bear down on the hardcore offenders. I
raised this local element on Second Reading but I would like to remind
the Minister that the number of instances seems to be astonishing.
According to the British Transport Police, there have been 70 incidents

path of an oncoming train. I hope that the Minister will support the
Opposition parties in wanting to get tough on such criminally stupid
behaviour.</div><a name="06041828000103"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041828000104"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> There is some common ground among us here. As the
hon. Gentleman said, the behaviour in question is criminally stupid.
None of us would have a moment&#146;s sympathy for drivers who treat
level crossings in such a manner; there can be no excuse for it. It is
the most hideously stupid and horrendous act imaginable of callous
disregard for other people&#146;s
lives.</div><a name="06041828000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Rochdale inadvertently put his finger on the reason why we should
not support the amendments, however. As he described, and as in the
case of the offences that we discussed earlier in the Committee, these
offences are dangerous driving. They go beyond the offence of just
jumping a red light; they clearly involve a dangerous disregard for the
lives of other people on the road. They should be treated as such, and
people who commit them should be prosecuted for dangerous driving with
all the penalties that that can
bring.</div><a name="06041828000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am again
going to advise the Committee not to allow the clause to stand part of
the Bill and to turn 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>down the amendments. I assure Opposition Members that I am prepared to
take other action that does not necessarily need legislation. Under the
terms of the Bill, we will have further consultation about graduated
penalties. I am prepared to offer the Opposition the
concession&#151;they are entirely right to highlight this
issue&#151;that we will include in that consultation the possibility
of increasing the penalty for jumping a red light at a level crossing
to &#163;5,000 and six penalty
points.</div><a name="06041828000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
prepared to discuss with the Home Office whether it would be
appropriate to change the sentencing guidelines to recognise the
seriousness of offences committed at level crossings above and beyond
the seriousness with which the courts currently consider them. I stand
firm on the principle that when somebody is responsible for jumping
across a level crossing when the train is coming, if the police have
evidence, that person should be tried for dangerous driving with all
the penalties that it brings to
bear.</div><a name="06041828000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
assurance that I am prepared to give Opposition Members is that I will
discuss with the Association of Chief Police Officers its attitude to
such offences at level crossings, to trying to enforce them more
rigorously than at the moment and to having a campaign to crack down on
them. In so doing, we might demonstrate that it would be more
appropriate to use such offences as dangerous driving when people are
guilty of such
activity.</div><a name="06041828000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041828000105"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> I would be reassured if we were getting
prosecutions, but I cited a local situation: there have been 73 cases
in Shropshire that have not led to prosecutions for dangerous driving.
Why is the current law not being
used?</div><a name="06041828000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041828000106"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> That is exactly the point with which I was going
to conclude. I do not know whether those involved in the 73 incidents
to which the hon. Gentleman refers were prosecuted at all, even for
jumping a red light. That offence is already available and it is not
being used. If such things are happening at level crossings&#151;the
evidence that he and Network Rail have provided clearly shows that they
are happening&#151;we need to do something more about enforcement.
There is no point worrying about the level of the offence if even the
current offences are not being properly used. I want to talk to the
Association of Chief Police Officers about what we need to do to ensure
that greater efforts are made to catch people who jump the lights at
level crossings.</div>
<a name="06041828000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041828000107"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): Since my hon. Friend is
talking about enforcement and looking ahead to new clause 30, may I ask
whether it is possible to install safety cameras at crossings to record
people who jump the lights? Does new clause 30 make it clear whether
Network Rail or local authorities will pay for
them?</div><a name="06041828000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041828000108"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Yes. The red lights at a level crossing are
exactly the same as red lights anywhere else, and they have the same
status, so enforcement can be done by CCTV. We will come to the matter
of who will pay 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>later in our considerations, but I assure my hon.
Friend that the responsibility will be clear when we have finished
debating the Bill.</div><a name="06041828000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should clamp down on those who commit this offence and work with the
police, Network Rail and the British Transport police to catch people
doing it. When there is a clear and callous disregard for human life,
the offenders should be prosecuted for dangerous driving, and we will
consider in the consultation the possibility of imposing a much steeper
fine for a less serious offence. It would be worth discussing the
imposition of six points in such cases.</div>
<a name="06041828000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the assurance that I
intend to try to crack down on such incidents, I hope that Opposition
Members will not press the amendment and join me in removing the clause
from the
Bill.</div><a name="06041828000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041828000109"></a>Stephen
Hammond:</b> I have given great thought to what the Minister
said. He and the Committee recognise the seriousness of the
offence.</div> <a name="06041828000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s concessions will go to another round of
consultations, but we are concerned about the hard core who commit the
offence and about the lack of action now and when the Bill comes into
force, and the potential delay. We feel that a term of imprisonment
would be appropriate for this
offence.</div><a name="06041828000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

powers to restrict certain types of traffic on certain roads and to put
in place all the necessary measures to protect bridges. The fact that
powers are not being used is no good reason for us to legislate to
provide more powers which presumably will be just as little used. We
need to ensure that local authorities and others are aware of their

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000164"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Once again, I recommend that the clause does not
stand part of the Bill. I hope, however, that the Committee will
support new clause 30 and amendment No. 111.</div>
<a name="06041831000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">This group of clauses is well
intentioned. Every one of us agrees with the intent behind them. As we
said, drivers who try to go through level crossings need to be dealt
with severely, and we must think much more clearly about what
protective measures and other measures are appropriate at level
crossings. The clauses represent a cri de coeur by Network Rail, which
felt that people were not listening to it when it identified the need
to improve level crossings. I take full responsibility for that,
although I wish that it had come to me first, rather than tabling
amendments. We could have helped each other to arrive at the
Government&#146;s new clause, rather than the group of clauses
inserted in the Lords.</div>
<a name="06041831000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a difference of
opinion between the Government&#146;s lawyers and Network Rail.
Network Rail felt that the current legislation did not specify clearly
enough the duty of local authorities to help it make level crossings
safe. Equally, it felt that when deciding what measures to put in
place, there was a legal dispute about what constituted rail equipment
and road equipment. The Government&#146;s view was that the law was
clear and that there were responsibilities on local authorities as well
as Network Rail. However, when we discussed the legislation with
Network Rail, we realised that it could be drafted more clearly so that
everyone understands their responsibilities. Hence, new clause 30 makes
it clear who is responsible for safety at level crossings and who is
required to work with Network Rail to devise and provide new measures
for making level crossings safer.</div>
<a name="06041831000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some cases, those measures
will include rumble strips to remind drivers how fast they are going as
they approach a level crossing. In others, the measures might be as
simple as improved signage on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>approach or the provision of CCTV for better enforcement at a level
crossing. Whatever measures are necessary must be provided to make
level crossings safe, and everybody responsible for providing that
equipment must realise that they have a duty to work together to devise
and put in place safe arrangements.</div>
<a name="06041831000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to my hon. Friend
the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), I am pleased to say that in case
there was any doubt about whether the new arrangements would fall on
the council tax payer, Network Rail has agreed to pay for any
improvements identified as a result of the new clause. However, it will
still be the responsibility of local authorities to help implement the
improvements and to work with Network Rail to design them and make
level crossings much safer.</div>
<a name="06041831000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000165"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> From new clause 30, I see that the Secretary of
State may make an order under the Level Crossings Act 1983. I am always
annoyed with myself for not doing my research in sufficient depth, but
will my hon. Friend assure us that CCTV cameras or safety cameras fall
within the definition of &#147;protective equipment&#148; under the
1983 Act?</div>
<a name="06041831000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000166"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Not being the lawyer that my hon. Friend is, I am
always slow to give such assurances. It is my intention that such
equipment should fall within the 1983 Act. If it does not, and for some
reason CCTV cannot be provided because of the way in which our new
clause is drafted, I shall seek to deal with that at the remaining
stages. My understanding is that new clause 30, together with amendment
No. 111, will allow CCTV enforcement systems to be provided at level
crossings in exactly the way he seeks.</div>
<a name="06041831000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000167"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> When my hon. Friend was explaining new clause 30,
he said that the Secretary of State would be able to order anything
that he thought necessary to make level crossings safer. Things other
than safety cameras might not be covered by the 1983 Act as they should
be. Will he extend his research to ensure that we are fireproof on this
matter?</div><a name="06041831000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000168"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I am certainly happy to do that. My understanding
is that one of the difficulties that we got into was that the
legislation called for rail equipment to be provided and therefore
there was a problem defining exactly what &#147;rail
equipment&#148; was. Equipment specifically to do with the road might
not be covered by the term &#147;rail equipment&#148;. Our
proposals now make it clear that rail equipment in this regard means
equipment necessary to make the railway safe. Therefore, such things
will fall within the legislation&#146;s remit, and I hope the
Committee agrees on that. I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that
I shall double check that before we reach the remaining stages, because
it is our intention that all parties that have a responsibility to make
the railway safe use their powers to do so and co-operate in ensuring
that appropriate designs are agreed so that we can make
progress.</div> <a name="06041831000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I just
reiterate that none of us in the Committee is in any disagreement about
the need to make level crossings safe or about the heinous nature of
offences where people try to drive across such crossings. New 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>clause 30 and amendment No. 111 will be an effective way of dealing with
the problem, along with the assurances I gave earlier about
enforcement, on which we will make progress as rapidly as possible. I
cannot speak for Network Rail, but my understanding is that it is
content with what we propose. Given that, I hope that the Committee
will subsequently support the Government proposals and agree to clause
53 not standing part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="06041831000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000169"></a>Stephen
Hammond:</b> As I understand it from the Minister&#146;s
explanation, new clause 30 tidies up and makes more specific the
responsibilities in clause 53. To that extent, I suspect that the
proposal is largely welcome. I hope that he will cast some light on
amendment No. 111. Why do we need to repeal the words &#147;barriers
or other&#148;? What is the intention of the amendment?</div>
<a name="06041831000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other problem with new
clause 30 is that while it introduces a number of preventive measures,
it does not achieve what we were aiming to do in terms of examining the
failure to stop at traffic lights. The Minister gave assurances about
consultation, saying that it would be tackled by his subsequent
amendments. I am unsure whether anything in new clause 30 does anything
to tackle the problem that we tried to
highlight.</div>
<a name="06041831000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000170"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> As far as the latter point is concerned, my
reference to stricter enforcement and to increased penalties does not
relate directly to new clause 30, but to powers elsewhere in the Bill
where we have already agreed that we can increase penalties if
appropriate and that we can increase the number of endorseable points
that someone can get on their licence if they commit a particular
offence. One of the assurances sought by the Conservatives was that
there should be a thorough consultation about graduated penalties
before we debated the matter properly in Committee and before the House
took a position on it. That is why there will have to be a consultation
process and further debate in the House. I do not believe, however,
that that will unnecessarily delay increasing the penalties in a way
that the hon. Member for Wimbledon might fear.</div>
<a name="06041831000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based on the experience of the
hon. Member for North Shropshire, it is not so much a question of
whether the penalties are right at the moment, but that they are not
being imposed at all because people are not being caught jumping
traffic lights at level crossings. Those involved in the 73 incidents
that he mentioned have not been penalised at all. We can get to grips
with that situation straight away while discussing the increase in the
seriousness of the penalties that can be incurred when someone is
caught.</div> <a name="06041831000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I judge
the mood of the Committee correctly, and if that mood is reflected by
the mood of the House when the consultation is over, I suspect we will
have no difficulty agreeing more severe penalties for those who commit
offences at level crossings. The penalties in respect of dangerous
driving and the definitions of dangerous and careless driving are
already on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>statute book, and the police can already catch people for such offences
and prosecute
them.</div><a name="06041831000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 30
deals with a different aspect, which is to clarify who is responsible
for making level crossings safe. Network Rail was concerned about the
identification of improvements needed at particular level crossings.
Such improvements had to be implemented by the highway authority, which
was usually the local council, and the highway authority was not
prepared to engage with Network Rail in discussing design improvements
and the provision of equipment, either because it thought it would cost
money or because it did not see it as a priority for its road system.
Network Rail was left in the frustrating position of having identified
a problem that could be dealt with by some sort of engineering solution
or the provision of safety equipment, while being unable to get the
highway authority, which was legally the body that had to provide that
equipment, to take the necessary action.</div>
<a name="06041831000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause will determine
that local authorities have such a duty to engage with Network Rail and
that they have the duty to provide equipment when it has been
identified as the appropriate equipment necessary to make conditions
safe. Network Rail has said that it will pay for the process so local
authorities do not need to be concerned about getting involved. It will
clearly not be a burden on the council tax payer.</div>
<a name="06041831000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also making the
definition of equipment clearer. It is not just going to refer to
equipment specific to the railway; it can be equipment specific to the
process of making the railway safer. Such equipment might otherwise be
better defined as road equipment. I am advised that the term
&#147;barriers&#148; is to be removed as part of the process of
making it clearer that equipment that can be provided will not just
come from a prescriptive list of equipment appropriate to the railway.
Instead, there will be a much wider definition including equipment more
akin to that used to control traffic movement on the road. That will
make the legislation clearer from the point of view of the local
authorities and Network Rail, which will have to work together on the
redesign of some level crossings following the implementation of the
Bill.</div> <a name="06041831000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that is the reassurance that the hon. Member for Wimbledon seeks and
that he will support the Government&#146;s
position.</div><a name="06041831000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000198"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> I will not detain the Committee for too long.
Clause 56 seems to be a sensible measure, and anyone who has seen the
old films of the R101 and the Hindenburg blowing up will know that
these fuels are of an extraordinarily explosive
nature.</div><a name="06041831000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">A constituent
of mine, Mr. Bill Smith, converts vehicles in a process known as
retro-conversion. Since 2000, he has converted regular motor cars,
usually fuelled by petrol, to run on a form of liquid petroleum gas. I
have discussed the process with him, and he makes the valid point that
if a person decides to change his or her gas boiler at home, he or she
must call in a Corgi-accredited engineer. I am sure, Sir Nicholas, that
you are a qualified engineer. If you wanted to convert your petrol car
to run on LPG, you could go on the internet tonight, buy the necessary
bits, stick them in, and the car would run&#151;possibly safely,
possibly not. Apart from a voluntary code of practice laid down by the
LP Gas Association, covering the installation, there is absolutely no
recognised procedure to check the conversion. It is, therefore, a
completely unregulated activity, dealing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>with increasingly used fuels that are of an explosive nature. It seems
sensible that these fuels be regulated as is suggested in clause
56.</div> <a name="06041831000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Smith made
another germane point to me: the current MOT test requires the vehicle
to pass an emission test only for the fuel that it is running on when
presented for the test. If it is LPG, its required emission performance
is much lower than that of a car with the original petrol system. It
seems sensible&#151;it could be covered by the regulations under
subsection (4)&#151;for the Minister to consider checking when an MOT
test is carried out that it is carried out for both fuels if a vehicle
has been retro-converted. Apart from that, the proposal is sensible and
the Conservative party supports
it.</div><a name="06041831000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000199"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman recognises that
it is a sensible measure. I was pretty horrified, as I think he was, to
discover that a car could be modified so as not to be inspected and
could go out on a public road. We need to move rapidly on that and to
ensure that modified cars are inspected. As he says, we must ensure
that the annual MOT test takes into account the fact that such cars
have been modified. I am not entirely certain what the answer to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is, but I shall undertake to check
that the MOT includes that in the future, and that the change gives us
the necessary powers to ensure that it takes
place.</div><a name="06041831000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000201"></a>Stephen
Hammond:</b> We are making good progress, and I shall not
detain the Committee for too long. We have heard the Minister argue
several times that parts of the Bill are not necessary because their
impact is already apparent or because they would be detrimental. I
argue that clause 58 is unnecessary.</div>
<a name="06041831000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister knows, the
Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 was introduced to regulate
private hire vehicles or minicabs in London. The problem with that Act
has been the three words &#147;to the public&#148;. A number of
private hire vehicle operators and drivers who provide their services
on a contract basis say that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>those vehicles are not available to the public and therefore should not
be covered by the Act. That seems relatively appropriate. They are not
saying that their whole fleet should not be covered by the Act or that
their drivers should not be Criminal Records Bureau checked. They are
merely saying that those vehicles hired on a contract
basis&#151;usually to local authorities to provide special transport
for those in particular need or for schools or educational
establishments&#151;should not be
covered.</div><a name="06041831000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Private hire
vehicle operators provide a valuable public service. Their cars are not
available strictly to the public, but they are in use for the public
benefit. The 1998 Act works extremely well. The clause is unnecessary,
and I hope that the Government will think again about why they feel the
need for
it.</div><a name="06041831000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000202"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> One&#146;s parents often say, &#147;Be
careful what you wish for.&#148; On Second Reading, colleagues on the
Opposition Front Bench asked me to consider why we are making this
provision in London. I met one of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
colleagues and a constituent of his to discuss a particular issue
related to the one that we are discussing. I granted him his wish and
considered the issue, and the more I looked at it, the more I came to
see why this level of regulation is required in London. I equally came
to see that the problem may be not that we are moving to a system of
regulation in London but that we do not have the same powers of
regulation everywhere else in the country. It is possible that your
constituents and mine outside London, Sir Nicholas, are not getting the
protection that they deserve.</div>
<a name="06041831000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have started to put in place
discussions inside the Department and with local authorities on whether
we need at some point in the future to improve the way in which we
regulate services outside London. However, that will be in the future.
I cannot see any excuse for our not moving as rapidly as possible to
deal with the problem inside London. It was intended for it to be dealt
with by the 1998 Act, but unfortunately the lawyers subsequently
decided that that Act was insufficiently clear. The amendment simply
makes it clear, so that the 1998 Act works in the way in which it was
intended to work and can accordingly be enforced. I have to accept that
there is an anomaly between London and elsewhere at which we need to
start looking sometime in the future, but that is not an excuse for not
dealing with the problem in
London.</div><a name="06041831000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000203"></a>Stephen
Hammond:</b> I am at a loss to understand what extra
regulation is needed. We are considering people who are under contract
to local authorities, schools and hospitals. They will inevitably have
been CRB checked and their vehicles will be compliant with insurance
and MOT requirements. They are reputable minicab and private hire firms
not available for public service and the extra level of licensing that
the Minister wants is
unnecessary.</div><a name="06041831000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000204"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that they will inevitably
be CRB checked. If it turns out that outside London they are always CRB
checked, that the check is always carried out to an enhanced level and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>that the concerns raised by the Bichard inquiry have properly been dealt
with under the current legislation, we will not have a problem outside
London.</div> <a name="06041831000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
serious debate in the past 12 months on the implementation of Bichard.
The Opposition, like the whole House, have made it clear that they
regard ensuring that we live up to 100 per cent. of the recommendations
of Bichard as a very high priority, as do the Government. I certainly
do not intend to be the Minister who falls short of that mark, which is
why I feel that I have to review the situation outside London. The
amendment will help London to achieve the level of regulation that was
intended in the first place. That is why we should move ahead and agree
to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000221"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> We are making good progress, and I hope that we
can continue to do so.</div>
<a name="06041831000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government new clauses 5 and 6
return to the Bill two clauses that were removed in the Lords. I like
to think that that was because the Lords were mistaken in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>their intent, and that had they heard my arguments, they would not have
done so. I hope that the Committee will agree to put them back
in.</div> <a name="06041831000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact is that
there are in circulation not just photocard licences&#151;licences
with drivers&#146; pictures on them, each accompanied by a piece of
paper establishing the driver&#146;s details and any endorsements
that he carries&#151;but licences held by people who have never
received a photocard. They have only paper licences and, therefore,
have no photographic identification to establish that they may drive
particular vehicles, which can present the police with considerable
problems. When they stop somebody and are presented with a perfectly
valid driving licence in the form of a piece of paper, they have no way
of determining whether the person handing them that piece of paper is
the person who is entitled to that driving
licence.</div><a name="06041831000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was our
intention that the Bill would enable us to require, at various points
in the future, the return of those paper driving licences, and the
issuing in their place of photo ID card-type licences. Their lordships,
mistakenly, I can assure the Committee and them if they are listening,
thought that that might be a cunning plot to introduce the ID card by
the back door, so they removed these clauses from the Bill. I assure
the Committee that it was not an attempt to do any such thing. The
driving licence is not designated as a document that one cannot receive
without having first applied for an ID card. This is a sensible measure
to improve law enforcement and to ensure that somebody who presents a
driving licence is the holder of that licence.</div>
<a name="06041831000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as allowing the
Government to charge for the process of changing licences at various
times in the future, the clause will give the Government the power, if
the licence changes again, to require people once again to submit their
old licences in exchange for new-format ones. If, for instance, we
decide in future to add a further security device to the driving
licence, to make it even more secure and to try to improve the
integrity of the database, as the hon. Member for North Shropshire
requested, we will be able to do that under these new powers. In
addition, the Committee agreed earlier that the paper part of the
driving licence&#151;the so-called counterpart&#151;is no longer
the legal document. In fact, the database of the DVLA will be the legal
document for enforcement purposes in future.</div>
<a name="06041831000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the things that we will
be able to do will be to require people to return their old paper
licences, and to receive photo ID card-type licences. We will also be
able to require people to return their existing photo ID card-type
licences and to receive in return licences that include information
about endorsements and so on&#151;if that is what we wish to
do&#151;and to get rid of the counterpart. These are sensible
measures. They will improve road safety and the enforcement of driving
licences, and will help the police immeasurably. They will also help to
improve the integrity of the DVLA database and they are in no way a
Trojan horse that will allow ID cards to be introduced without the
approval of Parliament.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div><a name="06041831000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000222"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> The new clause was given a thorough airing in
another place, where there were real fears that it was a Trojan horse
for identity cards. My main concern is that this will be a huge task.
We have already discussed the burden that the DVLA has because of the
way that it is constituted, and we established that it is not 100 per
cent. accurate. We also established the difficulty in other countries
of getting an accurate
database.</div><a name="06041831000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
sure what the gain will be, although it is clear that the establishment
of a valid, water-tight database is important. My worry is that we will
go to huge efforts regurgitating data from that vast majority of
law-abiding people whose records are not out of order. There will be a
titanic administrative task, but in the meantime my party&#146;s
fears about what we call the hard core&#151;that small group of
people who have come up again and again in our debates, who are outside
the law, who drive uninsured and without MOTs or licences&#151;will
not be addressed. Those are the people whom we should be
after.</div><a name="06041831000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">My worry about
the proposal is that it will involve an enormous administrative effort
by the DVLA to change everyone&#146;s paper licence when well over 98
or 99 per cent. of people are thoroughly law abiding. Their records are
in order and they will not cause a problem. I wonder how many staff
will be involved in the exercise. Will the DVLA engage a whole new
section? Will it have a new budget? How long will the process
take?</div><a name="06041831000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">We detect the
hidden hand of the European Union, which has taken competence in this
area. It proposes that licences should be renewed every 10 years for
drivers up to the age of 65 of mopeds, motor cycles, cars and light
vans, and every five years for drivers of medium and large goods
vehicles, mini-buses, buses and coaches. It has been said that the
proposed new measure will have the potential for administrative and
customer service advantages, and that it would facilitate greater
accuracy of the record and of the data on the licence. That may be
right, once the DVLA gets to dry land, but it will be an enormous
exercise getting
there.</div><a name="06041831000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
the Minister to comment, first, on the mechanics&#151;how this will
be done, how many people will be involved, how long it will
take&#151;and, secondly, on the Commission&#146;s proposal that
licences should be changed every 10 years for those up to 65. In fact,
the recommendation is that they should be changed every five years for
drivers over 65 of mopeds, motorcycles, cars and light vans, and every
year for drivers over 65 of medium and large goods vehicles,
mini-buses, buses and coaches. That will lead to an enormous churning
of data about people who act within the law. They are not the bad lads
whom we should be trying to catch. I would be grateful if the Minister
would comment on that before we pass judgment on the new
clause.</div><a name="06041831000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000223"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The proposal certainly will involve a huge
task&#151;there is no question about that. The intention is that the
DVLA will deal with it as a one-off exercise over two years. We
estimate that in 2008 there will be some 13 million paper licences
still in circulation that will have to be changed over the two-year
period.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div><a name="06041831000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new licences will not be
free. A small charge will have to be made for them, and that is covered
in the new clauses. We estimate that it will be about &#163;5 to
&#163;10.</div><a name="06041831000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000224"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> A stealth
tax.</div><a name="06041831000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041831000225"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> It is not a huge amount of money, but the
benefits to society will be considerable. As I explained earlier, it is
a common offence to present a paper licence to a policeman if one does
not hold a licence oneself. Providing a paper licence and not giving
the policeman an opportunity to check any identification is a good way
of getting around law enforcement, and the police are clear that they
want photographic ID.</div>
<a name="06041831000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman will also be
well aware that the driving licence is seen by many people as the first
step on the ladder to creating a false identity. There are people who,
for nefarious purposes, want to build an artificial identity for
themselves&#151;some because they should not be in the country and
others because they want to avoid their obligations or avoid law
enforcement. The driving licence is a first step; once a person gets
any sort of driving licence it is easy to deal with several
organisations and obtain further items of correspondence addressed to
them, creating the aura of identity that can be used to fool law
enforcement.</div><a name="0604194000039"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="0604194000005"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is very
important&#151;I think all members of the Committee would agree that
it is essential&#151;that we can rely on driving licences and that
the police can check that a person is a genuine holder of such a
licence. One of the best ways to achieve that is to make it possible to
check the holder&#146;s face against the photocard. It will be
possible, under the relevant powers, at some point in the future, to
require people to return the card for updating&#151;perhaps every 10
years. I suspect that not many people would be able to identify me had
they seen a photograph of me 10 years ago. We all change in our visual
appearance. It is therefore important that we should have the power to
update the licence. The measure is a sensible one. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will accept that it is in no way related to the issue of ID
cards and that he will support the new
clauses.</div><a name="0604194000006"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000040"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I do not know whether I should declare an interest
as the holder of one of the old-style paper records. Initially, when I
heard the Minister speak I wondered what all the concern was about.
However, having listened to his answers to the points made by the hon.
Member for North Shropshire, I became concerned. We are told that the
measure is to help the Government. Then we are told, &#147;Oh, there
is to be a small charge.&#148; We are then told that licences will
have to be renewed every five or 10 years depending on the
holder&#146;s age. It does not take much in the way of deduction to
see that, although the charge may be reasonable now, future Ministers
may increasingly use it as a cash cow for the
Department.</div>
<a name="0604194000007"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000041"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The issue that the hon. Member for North
Shropshire raised about renewal every five or 10 years relates to an EU
directive which is under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>discussion. The hon. Member for Rochdale must accept that the European
Union has a view on the robustness of licences and the need to ensure
that they are enforceable throughout the European Union. The mere fact
that something is being discussed does not mean that it will
immediately be
implemented.</div><a name="0604194000008"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000042"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I accept the Minister&#146;s point, but I am
sometimes sceptical enough about the EU to believe that we should not
necessarily always implement everything that Brussels bureaucrats want
to impose.</div> <a name="0604194000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cost is an
issue, and so is the fact that the cost can be increased over time.
Another thing that causes me concern is the provision to increase the
amount of information stored on the card. We have had the debate on ID
cards. It will not be that difficult, when the measure is enacted, for
all sorts of information to be stored on a microchip on the card.
Either people have one ID card or they do not; we should not then go
about increasing the amount of information about citizens that is
stored on other bits of paper. I have my old licence and can provide
many other pieces of information to demonstrate who I am. I can be
required by a policeman to go to the police station to provide that
information. I cannot see why that is not
sufficient.</div>
<a name="0604194000010"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000043"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> If the hon. Gentleman feels that way about ID
cards he should have voted with the Government when he had the
opportunity. That was the point that we made. However, he did not, and
the simple fact of the matter is that the driving licence, as I, the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Transport have said, will
not be part of the ID card system. However, if the hon. Gentleman
cannot understand the need for the new clause, I would ask him to
imagine that he was a policeman. If somebody handed a policeman a paper
licence, what right would that policeman have to require that
individual to go to a police station to show the licence that he had
just shown? That person&#146;s paper licence might be a forgery or
might not belong to them, and that would be the only opportunity that
the policeman had to catch that person. If the hon. Gentleman thinks
about the example that he gave, he will understand why he should vote
for the Government&#146;s new clauses.</div>
<a name="0604194000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000044"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point, but I do
not agree with him. There are safeguards. I return to the point made by
the hon. Member for North Shropshire that the vast majority of people
are honest and law abiding. We are talking, however, about a vast
bureaucratic exercise&#151;the Minister admitted that it will involve
13 million licences&#151;the benefit of which might apply only in a
tiny fraction of cases. The public will, however, be required to pay
for it. We have to ask whether the benefits will outweigh the costs,
but I do not agree with the Minister on
that.</div>
<a name="0604194000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000045"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> Like the hon. Member for Rochdale, I am rather
moved the other way by the Minister&#146;s words. We have not got to
the bottom of the issue of cost, but the exercise is going to be very
expensive. Instead, the DVLA could be spending funds on tightening up
on the hard core, as we suggested.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div><a name="0604194000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other point that we have not
mentioned is that the vast majority of people with paper licences will
be in the older section of the population&#151;in which I include
myself&#151;and will be more likely to be of a law-abiding tendency,
as the hon. Member for Rochdale said. We go on about this, but we want
to concentrate on the hard core, who tend to be younger and who will
already have been issued with new photo licences.</div>
<a name="0604194000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister did not touch on
proposed new section 98A(2)(b), which relates to</div>
<a name="0604194000037"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;licences in the form of a
photocard of a description no longer
specified&#148;,</div><a name="0604194000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">but he did say
that some existing photo licences will be recalled. The whole exercise
sounds as if it will be even more complicated. It is a bit glib to say
that the DVLA will carry out a special concentrated blitz and that
everything will take two years. Surely that will cause a massive
disruption to the DVLA, and I am not convinced that it is worth the
candle.</div> <a name="0604194000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely
sympathise with the Minister&#146;s aim. It would be easier for
policemen to check motorists if they all had photo identity cards, but
the provisions will catch the older section of the population, who will
almost certainly have other forms of identity on them, such as credit
cards, so their signatures can be checked. This will be an enormously
expensive, complex exercise, with little gain. It seems to be driven by
the European Union directive, under which our licences will apparently
be changed every 10 years.</div>
<a name="0604194000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister laughed when I
blurted out the words &#147;stealth tax&#148;, but there is no
doubt that this is another tax on hard-working, law-abiding citizens. I
really am not convinced that the Minister has made his
case.</div>
<a name="0604194000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000046"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Briefly, it certainly would be a stealth tax if
we did not charge people for it, because the cost would then fall on
those in the rest of society, who would have to pay higher taxes. If
people want to drive, they need to cover the cost of their driving, and
a small charge of the order of &#163;5 to &#163;10 for the renewal
is entirely reasonable. We have just launched a thorough consultation
about the charges the DVLA imposes for renewing licences and for other
services that it provides. That consultation has gone through two
phases to identify the most appropriate structure for future
charging.</div> <a name="0604194000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
simple fact of the matter is that someone who has only a paper licence
can drive while disqualified, and the policeman will not know that they
are doing so, because they will hand over a piece of paper that looks
like a driving licence. People have also used paper driving licences to
steal hire cars. They have handed paper licences over to hire car
companies, only for it to turn out that they are not the individual
concerned. People can also use paper licences to get on the ladder
towards creating false identities and being engaged in many types of
fraudulent activity. The people who will benefit from new clause 5 are
the 13 million honest motorists who currently have paper licences and
who in future will be part of the robust licence system, because they
will no longer be cheated by the very few people who currently use
paper licences to cheat the system.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div><a name="0604194000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I strongly advise Opposition
Members to think carefully before voting against a measure that is of
obvious benefit to the vast majority of people, who are honest. It is a
measure that the police clearly want and that all other law enforcement
agencies and advisers suggest is necessary. I can understand why the
Liberal Democrats would vote against the new clause, because they do
not vote for anything on law enforcement. People can do what they like
in Liberal Democrat world these days, but I thought that the hon.
Member for North Shropshire, on the Conservative Front Bench, would at
the very least stand up for an easyand practical, although
admittedly large-scale, improvement in the way in which we enforce law
and order in this
country.</div><a name="0604194000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000047"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> If photocards are the answer to all the
problems, why must certain existing photocards be withdrawn? We have
not got into
that.</div><a name="0604194000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000048"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about what
withdrawal there is of existing photocards. I am not aware of any
withdrawal, unless there are doubts about people&#146;s identity.
Following inspiration from above, I can say that there are no plans to
recall the existing photocard licences, so I do not know where he got
his information
from.</div><a name="0604194000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000049"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> I got it from proposed new section 98A(2)(b),
which refers to</div><a name="0604194000038"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;licences
in the form of a photocard of a description no longer specified by the
Secretary of State as a form in which licences are
granted&#148;.</div><a name="0604194000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am only
reading the Minister&#146;s own new
clause.</div><a name="0604194000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000050"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I am sorry; I did not understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question. I thought that I had explained that
provision. We are taking the power now, because at various times in
future it will be necessary to issue new types of photocard licence.
For example, we may wish to put a chip on a photocard licence to
prevent it from being copied. Such technology might emerge in future
and provide a better way to identify the licence holder. We want to
ensure that when we need to change the photocard licence, we have the
power to do so. However, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, we will not
do so willy-nilly, because there are 34 million vehicles out there and
God knows how many people have a driving licence&#151;probably about
40 million. Changing everyone&#146;s driving licence would be a big
exercise, but we need, and future Governments will need, the
opportunity to do that when it becomes necessary. That is the only
reason why the new clause has been drafted in this
way.</div><a name="0604194000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000051"></a>Mr.
Paterson:</b> May I return to the question of the length of
time? I understand now what the Minister is talking about as regards
the withdrawal of existing photocards, but the Commission document that
I have seen indicates that, up to the age of 65, people will have their
licences changed every 10 years and those over that age will have their
licences changed every five years. This is a whole new way of carrying
out the exercise. It may be worth while, but it seems to be an enormous
churning exercise and I should like the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>Minister to explain how the DVLA will cope with it. He says that it will
have a blitz and that we are talking about a figure of two years for
existing paper licences, but we then appear to go into a permanent
state of revolution whereby every year we renew large numbers of
licences. I am with the Minister on any measure that will bear down on
the hard core, but I am worried that this will be an enormously
expensive administrative exercise, churning existing information on
large numbers of law-abiding
citizens.</div><a name="0604194000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0604194000052"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Rather than detain the Committee any longer, it
is probably best if I write to the hon. Gentleman and the Committee
about the mechanics with which we plan to phase in the exchange of
licences and the consultation on changes that will be needed.</div>
<a name="0604194000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is gradually
coming to realise the merit of the Government&#146;s case. My final
point to him is that the hard core whom he is so anxious to get at will
immediately be exposed by the measure. They are the ones who will be
unable to get a photocard licence and will have to rely on a paper
licence until the very last moment. Once a paper licence is no longer
legally useful as a driving licence, they are the ones whom the police
will instantly be able to recognise when they stop them out on the
roads. I hope that he will now support the new clause.</div>
