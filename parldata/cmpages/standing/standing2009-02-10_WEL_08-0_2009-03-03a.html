Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): I beg to move
amendment 33, in clause 40, page 43, line 39, leave out subsection
(7).</div><a name="09030390000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood, on
this last day of the Committee&#146;s
proceedings.</div><a name="09030390000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment; its primary purpose is to probe Ministers on
the means by which disqualification orders will be served, to ensure
that they are received by those persons that they are aimed at. One
organisation that campaigns in that area, Families Need Fathers, has
told us that quite a lot of communication from the Child Support
Agency, and more recently from the Child Maintenance and Enforcement
Commission, tends to go missing. It also said that, to be honest,
people tend to be blas√(c) about letters from the Child Support
Agency.</div><a name="09030390000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to probe Ministers on the method by which the
disqualification orders will be served, the nature of them, and the
procedure to ensure that individuals have actually received notice of
the intention to disqualify them from their driving licence or travel
authorisation. How would we avoid, for example, the notice turning up
in the post, someone being away for a week and discovering on their
return that their driving licence has been taken away? I should like
some detail about how that will work&#151;will it be delivered by
post, recorded delivery, or a visit? Will there have to be some
evidence that the document has been received? This is a probing
amendment to cover such issues and to ensure that, given the
seriousness of this penalty and the fact that it can be imposed by an
administrative order, the proper procedures are in place to ensure that
the right people receive the notice and that they have been made aware
of it before those steps are
taken.</div><a name="09030390000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the benefit of the Committee, as general background to the clause, I
think the Secretary of State was quite right to point out at Second
Reading that this procedure represents a change from the Child
Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008. One of the things that is
important, and one of the reasons that we decided to support this, was
that in a subsequent clause there is effectively a sunset
clause&#151;this will have to be looked at to determine how effective
it would be. I know from discussions that my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), who speaks for us on child
maintenance issues, has had evidence, albeit anecdotal, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>from the United States of America that the threat of those
disqualification orders for both driving licences and travel
authorisation is apparently a very effective way of changing the
behaviour of non-resident parents. Given that effectiveness, it is at
least worth trying this
approach.</div><a name="09030390000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill makes it clear that, after the two-year review period, Ministers
have to look at the evidence and lay that report before Parliament and
take a decision either to allow this to continue or to stop it. Given
that the provisions are time-limited to 30 months and that there is
then an opportunity for Parliament to assess whether they have worked,
it is worth trying them. If we are going to do it, it is imperative
that the Government make sure that it works properly&#151;nothing
would discredit this more quickly than a small number of non-resident
parents receiving disqualification orders and there being a problem in
their delivery, creating a number of injustices. That would be the
quickest way to bring this procedure into disrepute, which would
ultimately harm the children and the families that it is meant to help.
It would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister could clear that
up.</div><a name="09030390000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000358"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Kitty
Ussher):</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr.
Hood.</div><a name="09030390000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful for the amendment as it gives me an opportunity to provide
a little more detail about how a disqualification order would work in
practice. I was relieved to hear that this is a probing amendment. I
would have been slightly worried by the possibility that this
subsection could be deleted because that would have meant that we could
take away people&#146;s passports or driving licences without
notifying them that that was our intention. I am therefore grateful for
the opportunity to explain how it would
work.</div><a name="09030390000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation is crystal clear: the order cannot take effect until the
person receives notice of the order. The legislation does not specify
exactly how this should happen, but I am happy to confirm that, in
practice, this will be by registered post or by hand delivery. There is
a right of appeal, and the legislation makes it clear that, where there
are reasonable grounds to do so, the appeal rights can be extended in
time and even renewed. We think that is sufficient
.</div><a name="09030390000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned the possibility that communications from the
Child Support Agency might be routinely ignored by precisely the people
whose attention we are trying to attract. I am afraid that argument
does not wash too well with me. He is right to say that international
evidence on the effectiveness of both these measures is quite clear. I
was particularly taken by the Australian example, which shows that,
strangely enough, when the holiday season comes around there is an
increase in the maintenance paid by people who wish to use their
passport. That is exactly the kind of thing we will be looking
at.</div><a name="09030390000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman has also rightly said that there is a two-year trial
period for driving licences. The international
evidence&#151;particularly from various states in
America&#151;showed that the threat of being disqualified from
driving does seem to have precisely the type of behavioural effect we
would want on people who have been routinely ignoring Child Support
Agency communications. Since 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>disqualifying someone from driving has more complicated effects than
removing a travel document, we felt it was right to have a trial
period. We will be looking at all the evidence, including the effects
on the courts and the criminal justice system. I hope that is
sufficient detail to enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="09030390000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000359"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, and pleased that
she is able to confirm that there will be a process in place to use
either registered post, which requires a signature for delivery, or a
personal visit, to ensure that the correct individual has actually
received the notice. I think that is right. First, it will help to
ensure that there are as few cases of injustice as possible. Secondly,
the last thing we want to do is clog up the magistrates courts with
lots of appeals that are only there because of administrative
foul-ups.</div>
<a name="09030390000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having got
those assurances on the record, and having heard the Minister elaborate
on some of the evidence&#151;and confirming, as the Bill says, that
this will be assessed over the trial period and looked at very
carefully&#151;I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09030390000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000360"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I beg to move amendment 34, in
clause 40, page 44, line 10, leave
out paragraph (b).</div>
<a name="09030390000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there any
Members here who were on the Committee of the Child Maintenance and
Other Payments
Bill&#151;</div><a name="09030390000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09030390000361"></a><b class="B">Paul

Yes.</div><a name="09030390000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000362"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The hon. Gentleman says he was&#151;those
Members will find this amendment rather familiar. The amendment looks
at the definition of travel authorisation: there are two definitions in
clause 40. The first is a United Kingdom passport and the second is an
ID card. The reason for mentioning this is that, under the
Government&#146;s proposals, an ID card is not just a travel
authorisation document. The Government plan eventually to use the ID
card as a method of accessing a whole range of public
services.</div><a name="09030390000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to probe what exactly the Government mean
by removing somebody&#146;s ID card. Are they proposing to remove
just the travel feature of the card&#151;I am not entirely certain
how that would work&#151;or are they proposing to take the ID card
away altogether? Given what the Government have said about their future
plans&#151;that ID cards will be the way that people access public
services&#151;we would not just be taking away travel authorisation;
we would potentially be taking away the means of accessing a whole
range of public services, including health care and
education.</div>
<a name="09030390000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will not
comment in this Committee on whether the Government&#146;s plans for
ID cards are wise: that would try your patience, Mr. Hood.
However,they must be very clear about how they intend to implement the
travel authorisation provisions. Is there a way of having a particular
feature of the ID card enabled or disabled, or does the whole ID card
have to be taken away? It would be of great assistance to the Committee
if the Minister could explain that in more
detail.</div><a name="09030390000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000363"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am extremely happy to do that. It may reassure
the hon. Gentleman to know that the approach we are taking here is
exactly the same as that in the Identity Cards Act 2006. That amended
legislation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>concerning football banning and travel restriction orders where an
individual is required to surrender his or her passport. In due course,
he or she will also have to surrender their ID card. Our approach is
consistent with that legislation and is not ever to deny the
non-resident parent access to any public services that could
potentially be accessed through the use of an ID card in
future.</div>
<a name="09030390000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 13 of
the 2006 Act ensures that ID cards will not be required as a condition
of accessing free public services or the payment of benefit until
enrolment on the national identity register is made compulsory by any
future Act of Parliament. It is not an issue under current legislation,
therefore, but if and when that happens, and where the commission makes
an administrative order of this sort, the Identity and Passport Service
will replace the non-resident parent&#146;s normal ID card with a
version that does not record that he or she is a British citizen.
Therefore, the document will cease to be a travel document, but will
continue to be valid for use in any other way in which a future Act of
Parliament might enable it. The non-resident parent would be able to
use the replacement ID card to access public services or any benefit
entitlement, but that card will not be suitable for travel within the
EU.</div>
<a name="09030390000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000364"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> If the replacement ID card does not indicate that
the holder is a British citizen, how can it be used as a method of
determining whether they are entitled to a range of other public
services or benefits, some of which may require that they be a British
citizen in order to qualify for
them?</div><a name="09030390000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000365"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> It is in order to mirror the provisions were it to
be a passport that is effectively annulled under the current legal
situation. It is removing that part of the ID card that is equivalent
to a passport and a travel document, while retaining all the other
entitlements that could, hypothetically, be accessible after a future
Act of Parliament. It is residence, not citizenship, that denotes
entitlement to public services, so I can reassure the hon. Gentleman
that people will not be disentitled to those. They will, however, be
prevented from travel. That works in the same way as the legislation
applies to football hooligans.</div>
<a name="09030390000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000366"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her explanation.
It is rather better than the one we heard when we probed this on the
Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill&#151;maybe that issue had
not been worked out then. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> That was not a dig at
the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington. He did a generally
excellent job of championing that Bill through the House of Commons and
turning it into an Act of Parliament. It was just on that particular
question that he did not provide anything approaching such an elegant
explanation as the hon. Lady has.</div>
<a name="09030390000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
hon. Lady&#146;s explanation and as she has confirmed that taking
away the travel authorisation part of the ID card is all that is
proposed, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09030390000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="09030390000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09030390000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000367"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I beg to move amendment 35, in
clause 40, page 47, line 1, leave
out subsection (3).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div><a name="09030390000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless the
Minister will provide a good explanation to the contrary, subsection
(3) seems to be particularly unjust. It means that if someone receives
a disqualification order to have either their driving licence or their
travel document removed, and subsequently appeals to the court, and the
court agrees that there has been a problem and revokes that
disqualification, the commission would still be able to receive its
appeal costs from that individual. We are talking about a case where
someone has received their disqualification, gone to court, and shown
that it was not proper or right for them to be disqualified from having
either their driving licence or travel authorisation. However, they
will still be held liable for the commission&#146;s costs in the
appeal process.</div>
<a name="09030390000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to
me that this is not just. If the commission seeks a disqualification
order and is successful, it is not unreasonable that it can recover its
costs. However, if the person appeals and is successful, the commission
should have to bear that cost. Clearly, if the person appeals and is
unsuccessful, which demonstrates that the commission took the right
steps, it does not seem unreasonable that they should bear the cost.
However, if they are successful it is not at all just that they are
expected to bear the cost of the commission&#146;s
behaviour.</div>
<a name="09030390000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could be
that the commission was completely unjustified in seeking to disqualify
the person from having a driving licence or travel authorisation and
had no grounds to do so, and the person appealed to the court to put
that right; I do not see why the person should be expected to pay the
costs. Given that this whole piece of legislation is about getting more
money from non-resident parents to their families, in a case where it
is not shown that they have behaved in a way that warrants removing
their driving licence or travel authorisation, taking money from them
seems perverse. Will the Minister explain why this apparently unjust
measure is contained within this otherwise perfectly acceptable
clause?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000368"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am happy to explain why this subsection is
there, and I do not think it is unjust. The key to it is this: it is
something that the courts may do. They may award costs to the
non-resident parent on appeal. It is not something they necessarily
have to do.</div>
<a name="09030390000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is quite right. If the non-resident parent has followed all
the rules and it transpires on appeal that they should not be
disqualified from using their passport or driving licence for one of
the reasons that is set out clearly in legislation&#151;for example,
their children&#146;s welfare would be affected, they need it for
their livelihood or they have not wilfully refused or culpably
neglected to pay maintenance&#151;then it is at the discretion of the
court not to award costs to
them.</div><a name="09030390000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn this around. You can construct an argument where even if one of
those criteria is met&#151;the non-resident parent could be one of
the people that the hon. Gentleman characterised in a previous
amendment, who perhaps is routinely ignoring any correspondence or
attempt to communicate and find out the facts from the Child Support
Agency. The parent may well need their driving licence in order to earn
a living, but has never bothered to communicate that despite numerous
attempts to ascertain the situation. It is only when presented with the
last possibility to ensure this does not happen that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>they actually engage. At this point, I think it would be wrong that the
taxpayer should pay the costs. In such cases, it should be at the
court&#146;s discretion&#151;it should have the option of imposing
costs. The fact that a non-resident parent may have to pay
costs&#151;which is obviously something that would be communicated to
them at an earlier stage&#151;would also help prevent manipulation of
the appeals process. It would raise the stakes slightly, so perhaps
fewer cases would come unnecessarily to court. That would also be a
good use of taxpayers&#146; resources.</div>
<a name="09030390000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
always the case that the non-resident parent would have to pay costs,
but I can envisage circumstances where a court acting with the
discretionary powers we are giving it may consider it fair to award
costs to the non-resident parent. That is why the subsection is in the
legislation.</div><a name="09030390000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000369"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> That was not a terribly good explanation. It
sounded remarkably as though the Minister is talking about using the
appeal costs as some sort of punishment. If she wants to have a form of
punishment in the legislation, it should be explicit; the costs of the
appeal should not be used as a back-door method of punishment. I am
concerned about non-resident parents who have done nothing wrong but
end up having a disqualification order sought against them, who
successfully appeal against the order because the commission has taken
the incorrect steps, and then find that they have an award of costs
against them.</div>
<a name="09030390000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
there is nothing in the Bill to suggest that the commission&#146;s
appeal costs are in any way reasonable. Will the Minister go away and
consider whether the commission&#146;s appeal costs ought to be
reasonable, and come back to us, perhaps on Report? We do not want the
commission, using taxpayers&#146; money, to spend a lot of money on
these processes, at the end of which non-resident parents who have done
nothing wrong and have successfully won their appeal are hit with a
significant bill. That is the danger with this type of legislation: if
we are not to create a lot of martyrs, it is sensible to ensure that
these powers are used proportionately.</div>
<a name="09030390000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
is correct that the subsection just gives the court the ability to
award costs&#151;obviously we are depending on the court&#146;s
looking at all the facts of the case and being reasonable. Given that
that safeguard is in there, and given the Minister&#146;s explanation
about where she thinks this power is likely to be used, I am quite
happy to seek leave of the Committee to withdraw my amendment. But I
would like to ask her to go away and have a look to see whether any
check is needed&#151;whether in the legislation or the
regulations&#151;on what the commission is allowed to spend on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000370"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> So that we can satisfy ourselves that unreasonable
costs will not be put on non-resident parents appealing, even when
there is no fault on the commission&#146;s side, I would be happy to
have a look at the issue and perhaps write to the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000371"></a>Mr.

basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09030390000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div><a name="09030390000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000372"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Before we go on to agree on the clause, there are a
couple of comments that I would like to make and a few questions I
would like to ask the Minister, to which I hope she can
respond.</div>
<a name="09030390000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, it is
clear from the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill that the
Department already has the ability to disqualify and take away licences
and passports. In the House of Lords on 13 May 2008 the Lord McKenzie
of Luton made the following
statement:</div><a name="09030390000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
therefore acknowledge your Lordships&#146; concerns relating to that
provision and accept that the prevailing view at present is that the
decision should be made by the courts.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 13 May 2008; Vol. 701, c. 963.]</div>
<a name="09030390000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to ask the
Minister what new evidence has come to light that, since that
statement, it has proved necessary to remove the reference to the
courts. Give that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission has
only been operational since October last year, perhaps she would tell
us how many applications have been made to the court and whether there
is evidence that that process has proved slow and
unsuccessful.</div>
<a name="09030390000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
question that I would like to ask the Minister concerns the
implementation of the orders. Who will actually be implementing the
order and at what level in the structure? There is concern that very
junior civil servants might issue these orders. What internal checks
will exist to ensure that it is the last resort and that proper checks
have been made before an order is issued?</div>
<a name="09030390000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
there is a wider concern&#151;I admit that it applies more to
CMEC&#146;s predecessors&#151;about the number of orders that the
Child Support Agency already gets wrong. One of the issues in the
clause is that, although the court can discuss whether disqualification
is appropriate, it is not allowed to discuss whether the sum that is
being talked about is correct. A concern about the CSA&#151;rather
than CMEC, because the CSA has been in operation longer&#151;is the
fact that it often gets it wrong. I am sure members of the Committee
have examples from their own constituency casework of the CSA getting a
maintenance order figure wrong and, following a challenge, having to
revise it.</div>
<a name="09030390000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
question was also raised by Fathers for Justice. When a driving licence
has been withdrawn, what action will the Department take if that parent
loses his job or is unable to do his job? There have been examples of
the withdrawal of licences having disastrous effects, not only in
respect of people&#146;s livelihood but in respect of their ability
to see their children.</div>
<a name="09030390000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be
grateful if the Minister will answer those
points.</div>
<a name="09030390000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000373"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to answer the
points raised by the hon. Gentleman. On his final point, I am
interested that he quotes evidence from Fathers for Justice; I do not
see it particularly as a credible organisation, but obviously the hon.
Gentleman does. I do not know whether he or Fathers for Justice have
read the legislation, because the Bill makes it quite clear that, if
the document concerned is required for the non-resident parent to earn
his livelihood, it should never be removed; and if its removal would
have an effect on the welfare of a child, whether it is the child in
question or other children of whom he is the parent or with whom he is
associated, then it will not be removed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div><a name="09030390000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, the
onus of proof will be on the commission to demonstrate that the parent
is wilfully and culpably refusing to pay child maintenance. That is
quite a high level of proof, and is one of the safeguards in the
legislation showing that this provision will not be used willy-nilly by
junior clerks in the organisation. There will be quite rigorous
internal mechanisms, and the outstanding debt would have already been
checked when the liability order was made&#151;which must be done
before tougher forms of enforcement can be considered.</div>
<a name="09030390000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission will obviously complete any outstanding maintenance
assessment action on each individual case where it is relevant to the
level of arrears. The caseworkers will be trained in the new
legislation to guide them in the decision-making process. The
non-resident parent will have been given notice of the fact that a
liability order is being considered, and they will have the opportunity
at that stage to make representations. So if an error has been made, or
if they fall into one of the categories on the face of the Bill, they
will have an opportunity to pick that up at an early stage. I am
therefore certain that this is not something that will be used lightly
or inappropriately, and I wish Fathers for Justice had the same
view.</div>
<a name="09030390000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s first point related to the history of last
year&#146;s child maintenance legislation. We did say that we would
continue to consider which decisions needed to be made by the courts,
and which needed to be made administratively. In the intervening period
of time, more international evidence has come to light that makes it
clear that it is an extremely effective policy. Between July 2006 and
August 2008, for example&#151;this is extra data that we did not have
during the passage of the previous legislation&#151;an additional 11
million Australian dollars was collected in child maintenance payments
brought about by the use of around 1,800 prohibition orders relating to
Australian travel documents. A review of a sample of 124 cases where
such an order had been made indicated that 88 per cent. of customers
had continued to pay the right amount of child support 12 months after
the order had been lifted, whereas they had previously simply
disengaged with the
process.</div><a name="09030390000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that makes the case for legislating even clearer than before. But
I also have to say&#151;I am repeating the point made by my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State&#151;that, in a sense, we had no
option but to withdraw our proposals on administrative disqualification
of a travel document, because the main Opposition party had made it
quite clear that it would not support the rest of the Bill unless that
was removed. There was a touch of realpolitik in it that was extremely
regrettable. I am very glad that the main Opposition party now appears
to have done an elegant U-turn, hopefully enabling this clause to go
through. I hope that that is sufficient to allow the Committee to agree
to clause
40.</div><a name="09030390000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000374"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I beg to move amendment 83, in
clause 43, page 49, leave out line
8.</div><a name="09030390000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause requires a person liable to make payments of child support
maintenance to notify a change of address, or any other change of
circumstances. The amendment leaves out the line that says</div>
<a name="09030390000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other
change of circumstances&#148;.</div>
<a name="09030390000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a probing
amendment to ask the Minister to give the Committee more detail about
the type of information that the Government envisage being
used.</div><a name="09030390000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the face of it, the clause is drafted incredibly widely: someone would
be guilty of an offence for not notifying any other change of
circumstances with no information as to what that might mean. Ministers
clearly envisage some of that detail being contained in regulations,
but I should like to set out for the Committee some of the areas of
concern in order to inform the nature of the regulations and how
tightly they are
drafted.</div><a name="09030390000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
of the information and some of the concerns have been raised by
Families Need Fathers, which is keen to campaign in this area. It has
spelt out the concerns about the lack of due specificity on the face of
the Bill. It has also raised concerns, which I know the Government
share as they set out in their document how they thought the
regulations might be used, that, should those regulations not be
defined tightly enough, it will generate a significant number of flows
of information into the Child Maintenance Enforcement Commission. That
would have the opposite effect to what the commission is seeking. The
commission is trying to streamline its future case load by reducing the
number of cases in which it carries out reviews of change of
circumstances; for example, it is reducing the number of times it will
look at a child maintenance award where the income varies by less than
25 per cent. It would seem that, unless this provision is narrowly
drawn, it would generate the inflow of a huge amount of information to
CMEC, which would offset the work it is doing to reduce its work load
in order to focus more effectively on the cases that require the most
attention.</div>
<a name="09030390000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not
seen any evidence&#151;perhaps the Minister could supply the
Committee with some&#151;about the kinds of information that should
be supplied to CMEC under the clause, and how that would make the
payment of child maintenance more effective and more likely to reach
the family in which the child is resident, which is the purpose of the
test.</div><a name="09030390000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have looked at the document that the Ministers have published detailing
how they plan to use regulation-making powers. They have said that the
definition of &#147;other change of circumstances&#148; would be
left to secondary legislation, which would allow the commission
flexibility and time to consult stakeholders as part of its process for
developing policy. That sounds sensible, but there is nothing in the
Bill that constrains any of that&#151;no guidance is
provided.</div><a name="09030390000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a positive note, to be fair to Ministers, paragraph 376 of that
document does say that Ministers
are</div><a name="09030390000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;mindful
of not creating unnecessary offences&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div><a name="09030390000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that they want regulations to
be</div><a name="09030390000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;tightly
and precisely termed to ensure there is a clear understanding of any
requirement placed on
parents.&#148;</div><a name="09030390000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
fact, Ministers have acknowledged the concern that I and Families Need
Fathers have outlined about the burden of information coming into the
commission. They have
said:</div><a name="09030390000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Indeed,
the changes of circumstances to be notified to the Commission must be
narrow enough to enable the system to process the information without
becoming over
burdened.&#148;</div><a name="09030390000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
I think Ministers recognise that the clause is widely drawn and that
the regulations will need to be narrow and tightly focused so as to be
fair to parents and so as not to burden the commission. It will help
the Committee&#151;as it has not seen the regulations&#151; if the
Minister will give some idea of the kinds of information that the
Government and the commission have in mind. The Committee can then be
reassured that Ministers will be committed to the objective of having
tightly defined terms when they bring the regulations before the
House.</div><a name="09030390000091"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000375"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am delighted to be able to reassure the hon.
Gentleman. We absolutely want to be able to define precisely the types
of change of circumstance that people will be required to notify to the
commission. If I give some history of the journey of the policy, it may
help to explain why this is in the legislation.</div>
<a name="09030390000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
passage of the 2008 Act, the Government rejected an Opposition
amendment that would have made it a requirement for non-resident
parents to inform us of any change to their circumstances that would
affect their liability; the onus would be on them to decide whether a
particular change would affect their liability. The amendment was
rejected because we felt that it would create precisely the problems
that the hon. Gentleman now says he wishes to avoid. Individuals might
not know, or they might be so cautious that they would overburden the
commission with lots of minutiae of changes that did not affect their
liability.</div><a name="09030390000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsequently,
we introduced an amendment to make it an offence for non-resident
parents not to inform the commission of changes to their address. The
reason for that is practical: it should be an offence if someone moves
house and does not notify the commission, to avoid paying the liability
that they owe to their children.</div>
<a name="09030390000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">After some
reflection, we would like now to explore with stakeholders whether
there are other clearly defined circumstances under which we would like
to make it an offence for people not to notify the commission of
changes of circumstances. The primary power is not drafted widely so as
to have a wide responsibility, as with the amendment we rejected last
year. It is drafted widely to give us the opportunity tightly to define
in regulations following consultation precisely what would be included
in the power&#151;I cannot be precise about what that will be because
we want to consult to work that out. However, I am happy to reassure
the hon. Gentleman that it will be simple to understand and designed
not to overburden either the commission or the non-resident
parent.</div>
<a name="09030390000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The type of
avenues that we may wish to explore with anyone who has an interest
are, perhaps, significant changes to employment, significant changes in
earnings in either direction, a change of job, or losing one&#146;s
job and leaving the work force for a while. I do not want to say
definitely that those will be the avenues because we want to explore
the issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div><a name="09030390000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware of
the concerns that Families Need Fathers has rightly raised, I
understand, in a conversation last week with the chief executive of
CMEC. We will continue to work with it and other groups and we will not
propose regulations until we are sure that we have a simple, workable
way to ensure that children are more likely to receive what they are
owed. I hope that reassures the hon.
Gentleman.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000376"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. Although the
amendment to which she referred was not as brilliantly drafted as this
one&#151;not having had the benefit of parliamentary
counsel&#151;it clearly had some merit, as Ministers have thought
about it again. It was tabled on the basis of making sure that parents
would have to disclose relevant information and that the burden was not
put on the parent with care or CMEC, who might have to go on a hunting
expedition.</div>
<a name="09030390000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased
that the Minister confirmed that it is intended that regulations be
tightly drawn. Clearly, as has been acknowledged, it would not be in
the interests of the commission to have widely drawn regulations
because it would simply be overburdened by information. She has clearly
indicated that the changes likely to be consulted upon are to do with
employment status, earnings and income. I am pleased that she wants to
ensure that the commission engages with all the stakeholder groups to
have a proper conversation about those. We will obviously scrutinise
the secondary legislation when those regulations are brought before the
House, but in these circumstances and with those reassurances, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000379"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> It is worth saying at the beginning that the
amendments standing in my name and those of my
colleagues&#151;amendments 36 and 37&#151;are probing amendments.
They attempt to understand the intentions that underlie this
schedule.</div>
<a name="09030390000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The lead
amendment leaves out paragraph (d) of proposed new section 2B of the
Amendments of Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953. That paragraph
is within a set of conditions where it would not be required for the
mother to provide the registrar with information relating to the
father&#151;she would be able to declare that certain conditions were
in place. The particular condition I am suggesting should be left out
is,</div>
<a name="09030390000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the mother
does not know the father&#146;s
whereabouts.&#148;</div><a name="09030390000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that not knowing the whereabouts of the father should not
affect whether the mother is required to declare that the person is the
father of the child. I completely agree with paragraph (c),</div>
<a name="09030390000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that if the
mother does not know the father&#146;s identity&#148;</div>
<a name="09030390000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">she clearly is not able
to notify the registrar who the father is. However, not knowing his
whereabouts does not seem a very good reason for not notifying the
registrar who the father is. She does not have to know his whereabouts
to know who he
is.</div><a name="09030390000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
bring the matter up because with the inclusion of paragraph (d), the
requirement effectively becomes completely voluntary. It places no
particular burden on the mother at all and there is a very clear
get-out clause. I want to understand what purpose the Government have
in introducing the paragraph. There is clearly a signal about the
importance of fatherhood and getting both parents registered, which is
welcome and significant. The other aspect&#151;brought up in the
early stages of this Committee&#146;s proceedings in an
evidence-taking session by the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Heeley&#151;was about the importance to the child of knowing who both
their parents are, and knowing who the father
is.</div><a name="09030390000309"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">During
the question and answer session it seemed to me that the Minister did
not really grasp to the fullest extent the point that the hon. Member
for Sheffield, Heeley was making. If it is important to the child to
know who both the parents are, allowing the mother not to disclose, or
not putting an obligation on disclosing who the father is just because
the mother does not know his whereabouts, does not seem a terribly
powerful reason. It would be helpful if the Minister set out the
purpose of this part of the Bill and stated what the Government are
trying to achieve. Are they looking at the child&#146;s right to know
who its parents are, and/or are they looking at sending a clear message
that fatherhood is important and fathers should take responsibility? In
that case it is linked partly to the child maintenance provisions. If
it is important for the child to know who its parents are and important
to send out this message, there seem to be far too many reasons why the
mother can avoid disclosing who the father
is.</div>
<a name="09030390000330"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
<a name="09030390000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 37,
which is in the same vein as amendment 36, refers to paragraph (f), the
condition
that</div><a name="09030390000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
mother has reason to fear for her safety or that of the child if the
father is contacted in relation to the registration of the
birth&#148;.</div><a name="09030390000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment replaces &#147;reason&#148; with &#147;reasonable
grounds&#148;. The motivation for probing on that is twofold. First,
in an evidence-taking session the hon. Member 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>for Sheffield, Heeley made the point that if the Minister included this
provision because of the importance of the child&#146;s knowing who
its parents are, any danger posed by the parent is not in itself
relevant to identifying who they are. Clearly, steps may need to be
taken as to whether that parent has legal access to the child; but
purely knowing who they are is not really relevant.</div>
<a name="09030390000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
concern about having paragraph (f) as an exclusion clause is that,
given the way human relationships sometimes work, I would not want to
see a situation where a mother was able to avoid naming the father,
giving as a reason an unjustified fear for her safety or that of her
child, and effectively use that as an allegation against the father.
Those are the grounds for removing the word &#147;reason&#148; and
inserting &#147;reasonable grounds&#148;. A court would have to
judge what &#147;reasonable grounds&#148; meant, which is the usual
test of what a reasonable person might think in those
circumstances.</div>
<a name="09030390000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment is to probe the Minister on those two concerns. If she
would set out the Government&#146;s objective in bringing forward
this clause and schedule, and what it is trying to achieve, we shall be
able to move somewhat further forward.</div>
<a name="09030390000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000380"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The Liberal Democrats support the principle of
joint registration. We know that only one parent is named in about 7
per cent. of all births registered at the moment, and we believe that
we should encourage and seek as far as possible for both parents to be
registered on the birth certificate.</div>
<a name="09030390000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
have some concerns about the phraseology of the schedule and the
clause, which is very much based on there being a violent relationship
and the registration of the birth being used by the father to get at
the mother or the child. Amendment 105 seeks to extend the provisions
in the Bill to not just the child who has been registered, but any
other children who may be living with the mother, where the mother can
give a reason for not registering their birth. There are instances
where fathers have used the ability to get contact with a child to get
at the mother. I am asking the Minister what safeguards she will put in
place against that.</div>
<a name="09030390000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">To remind the
Minister, she said on 12 February
that</div><a name="09030390000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
it is reasonably thought that the father is of such character that the
very act of contacting him would lead to aggression towards the mother
or the child, it is right that the state should not do something that
would probably have such an unfortunate
outcome.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Welfare
Reform Public Bill Committee, </i>12 February 2009; c. 85,
Q154.]</div><a name="09030390000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
totally agree with those sentiments. With amendment 105 we are seeking
to broaden the exemptions within the Bill so that the father is not
enabled to get to another child. We believe that we should not just be
concerned about the safety of the child whose birth is
registered.</div><a name="09030390000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000381"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman clear up what he thinks
about the question that I brought up about his amendment, which refers
to section 4(1)(a) of the Children Act 1989, and about his concerns
about a father requiring parental responsibility? That section of the
1989 Act simply says that, on the application of the father, the court
may order that he shall have parental responsibility for the child.
Given that the court has to do that, there seem to be perfectly
adequate safeguards. If the mother 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>has legitimate concerns about the safety of the child in question, or
that of her other children, or indeed her own safety, all that evidence
can be put before the court, and the court can take all that into
account when it is making orders about the relationship and the legal
rights that the father will have over that child. That is perfectly
adequate without the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment.</div>
<a name="09030390000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000382"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but his
comments actually relate to amendments 103 and 104, which I was just
about to come to. I am seeking assurances from the Minister about how
this will operate. I am sure hon. Members will be aware that, in the
week just prior to a birth and immediately after a birth, a
mother&#151;particularly one who is subject to domestic
violence&#151;might be very vulnerable. Given that the Bill proposes
that registration has to take place within 42 days, we are
seeking with amendments 103 and 104 to apply an exemption.</div>
<a name="09030390000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, it is
the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
Gingerbread and Family Action that are concerned about how the clause
will operate. The father could use that registration to seek parental
responsibilities and use that as a threat to the mother. I appreciate
that, at the end of the day, the father will have to go through the
courts, or the mother will have to go through the courts to prevent
that access, but the concern here is that, at this stage, if the mother
has already been subject to domestic violence, she would be very
vulnerable.</div><a name="09030390000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
support the principle of joint registration but we do not feel that, at
the moment, the exemptions in the schedule go wide enough. We would
like to be reassured about cases involving a vulnerable woman on her
own who may have been subjected to domestic violence, and a father who
exercises his right to be registered on the birth certificate and uses
that as a lever to get to her and her family. That is the situation we
are concerned about, and we are aiming to ensure that, without the full
recourse through the courts&#151;I am sure that the hon. Member for
Forest of Dean would appreciate that going through the courts is often
a difficult and traumatic business, particularly for a young mother on
her
own&#151;</div><a name="09030390000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000383"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The hon. Gentleman has not read section 4(1)(a) of
the 1989 Act clearly enough. It is the father who has to apply to the
court to get parental responsibility for the child, not the mother. It
is the father who has to kick off this process, and the mother will
then be able to put relevant information before the court to inform the
court&#146;s decision. But it is not the mother who has to go to the
court and start the process off.</div>
<a name="09030390000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000384"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I appreciate that, but my concern is about young
mums who have recently given birth being put through that process. It
could be used as a lever, as a stick with which to get at those
mothers, who might have been subjected to domestic violence in the
past. While the hon. Gentleman or I&#151;in a very stable mental
condition, hopefully&#151;would not have a problem with defending
ourselves through the courts, it would be more difficult for someone
who has been subject to domestic violence. We are seeking safeguards to
ensure that the application of this joint registration will not be used
as a lever to get at the mother. We would like to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>reassured that this clause and schedule have been thought through.
Certainly, a number of charities&#151;Gingerbread, the NSPCC and
Family Action&#151;have concerns about how they are
worded.</div>
<a name="09030390000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09030390000385"></a><b class="B">Meg
Munn</b> (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab/Co-op): I do not want to
discuss the issues in as much detail as we did in the evidence session,
but it is important that we are clear that we are talking about two
separate things. I have a great deal of sympathy with the comments of
the hon. Member for Forest of Dean, but not with those of the hon.
Member for Rochdale. The Government need to be fundamentally clear
whether they accept that in principle, wherever practicable, a child
has the right to know, through its being recorded on their birth
certificate, who their birth parents
are.</div><a name="09030390000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are very clear in adoption legislation that at the age of 18 a child
may go back and find out who their birth parents are. What is different
in this situation? The practicalities of doing this are important. I
agree that knowing where a person is may pose a problem, but should
that be a reason not to seek to register the name of the father on a
birth
certificate?</div><a name="09030390000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have campaigned for many years and spoken a great deal on the issues of
domestic violence, but it is enormously important to separate birth
registration from the mechanisms by which we protect mothers and
children from violent fathers. We have processes through the court
which allow people to take out injunctions. Over the last few years we
have dramatically improved the processes to protect families and
children. This should not prevent registration of a father&#146;s
name on a birth
certificate.</div><a name="09030390000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike
the hon. Member for Rochdale, I am concerned that the exemptions are
too widely drawn. Our view needs to be that, wherever possible, the
father&#146;s name should be on the birth certificate; where there is
a need to protect a family, because there may be a threat of violence,
that should be pursued through other legislation, not this
legislation.</div><a name="09030390000130"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000386"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> We have heard some of the debate on this
issue&#151;a wide range of views have been expressed in the
Committee. With your permission, Mr. Hood, I should like to
begin by explaining the case for change before coming to the specific
points that hon. Members have
raised.</div><a name="09030390000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current system is far too complicated. It works very well for married
couples because they can register the name of both parents&#151;it is
presumed that the married couple are the parents of the child. At
present unmarried couples have two alternatives. They can both go down
together, which may be logistically difficult if one of them works. It
is pretty hard if they do not know that both have to go down together,
which our departmental survey shows is often a problem. It is also hard
if they are estranged, or if they are not in a relationship. The
alternative is to get a solicitor&#146;s declaration on the part of
the parent who does not go down to the registry office, which is also
not the easiest thing to do. It is perfectly possible that, even where
the mother is completely relaxed about the father&#146;s being on the
birth certificate, the system we have created puts hurdles in the way
of the father being on the birth certificate, even if he wants to be,
regardless of the rights of the child&#151;which my hon. Friend the
Member for Sheffield, Heeley clearly stated are also
important.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div><a name="09030390000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
tilt the balance towards the father and towards the child. It is worth
understanding that this will not mean that 100 per cent. of children in
the future will have both parents on their birth certificate, but it
will mean that fathers and children will not be denied that
right&#151;in the father&#146;s case, to be on the birth
certificate; in the child&#146;s case, to have both parents on the
birth certificate&#151;due to apathy or complexity of our own
making.</div>
<a name="09030390000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
worth clarifying that fathers can always request to be on the birth
certificate, regardless of what the mother does or says&#151;all the
mother has to do is confirm that they are the father. There is now a
simple system, where the father is known, for him to go on the birth
certificate without having to attend: the mother states who the father
is and where he is, a note is sent asking him to confirm that he is the
father and then both names go on. We feel that this will lead to more
children having both parents on the birth certificate and more fathers
being on the birth certificate of their children. The purpose is not
that fathers will then be chased by the Child Support Agency, because,
to be blunt, that can happen anyway. The mother simply tells the CSA
the father&#146;s details and the procedure is kicked off. The father
need not be on the birth certificate for that to
happen.</div><a name="09030390000331"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09030390000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
simple ceremony of birth registration&#151;anecdotal evidence shows
that this is quite important and some evidence shows that it has an
effect&#151;means that fathers will feel more empowered about taking
a positive role in their children&#146;s lives. Although it will not
be the case in every circumstance and across the board, it will help
fathers to do that&#151;not by means of tracking them down, but
simply by involving them in their children&#146;s lives. That was one
of the conclusions of a recent review that we did on the child support
system.</div>
<a name="09030390000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now
discuss the specific amendments, in the order in which the points were
made. The hon. Member for Forest of Dean is right to query that a
father&#146;s name should not be recorded if his whereabouts are not
known. We are trying to avoid a situation where the mother states the
name of the father and then that seems to acquire some kind of validity
simply because it is recorded somewhere by the state through the
registry office system. There is no reason to presume that it is true
just because the mother has said it. We take the view that no data are
true unless verified. In this case, they cannot be verified unless the
father actually says, &#147;Yes, I am the father&#148;. I would be
extremely nervous about having a system where, 30 years down the line,
the child, as an adult, finds out that the mother has given a wrong
name, either by accident or design, and presumes that it is true
because it is written in a book in a registry office, when we have had
no way of ascertaining that it is. Our approach is that no data should
be recorded unless they are verifiable. They have no status unless they
are verified. That is why, if the registry office has no way of
checking whether the data are correct, they should not be recorded and
there is therefore no need for them to be provided.</div>
<a name="09030390000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The registry
office is not the CSA. The CSA uses all sorts of methods to track
people down on the basis of partial information. But we are not
proposing through these clauses to give extra powers to the registry
office 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>to do so. That would be entirely inappropriate. The mother can always
tell the CSA the partial information. If that then leads to the father
being tracked down such that he is then in a position to verify whether
he is the father, the mother can always provide that information to the
registrar at a later date. And, of course, it is worth bearing in mind
throughout that it is illegal&#151;it is perjury&#151;for the
mother to give false information at any stage, and that will be made
clear to her when she goes to register her child. That is why we think
that the whereabouts are an important part of this
legislation.</div>
<a name="09030390000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000387"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am just checking that I have not misunderstood
the clause. We do not all seem to be arguing about the same thing. New
section 2B, about the duties of the mother to give information to the
registrar, does not relate to what the registrar then has to enter into
the register. The Minister is quite right that information should not
be entered unless it is verified, but subsection (7) clearly
states:</div>
<a name="09030390000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
information relating to the father is to be entered in the register
merely because it is given by the
mother&#148;.</div><a name="09030390000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we are talking about here, and what my amendment goes to, is whether
the mother has to provide the information to the registrar. It does not
talk about what the registrar then does with it.</div>
<a name="09030390000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, the clause says that the mother has to provide certain
information relating to the father to the registrar unless she makes
certain declarations. One of those declarations is on the
father&#146;s whereabouts. If my amendment was accepted and that
piece was taken out, it would not mean that the registrar was in any
way compelled to enter the information. The mother would still have to
tell the registrar who the father was. Clearly, if no one knew where he
was and the registrar was unable to contact him, the father would not
verify the information and would not be entered as the father on the
birth certificate. But the mother would still be compelled to put that
information forward. That is all that my amendment does; the argument
that the Minister has outlined does not really show why the Committee
should reject my amendment.</div>
<a name="09030390000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000388"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I see absolutely no point in providing
unverifiable information. Either it is recorded
somewhere&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Yes, I agree it will not be on
the birth certificate, in which case that gives it a type of validity
that is completely uncheckable&#151;or it is not written down, or it
is written down and put in a file. That seems to be creating
administration without any possible result at the end. There is no
point in providing unverifiable information. At best that could lead to
unnecessary paperwork, at worst it could lead to a future situation
where that record is discovered and could provide misleading
information about an individual&#146;s parentage. That is why I
reject the amendment&#151;it seems completely
superfluous.</div>

Harper</b>
<i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div><a name="09030390000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000390"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I will allow the hon. Gentleman one more attempt
at this
question.</div><a name="09030390000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000391"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am extremely grateful to the Minister and for
the tolerance of the Committee. The issue goes back to the purpose of
what we are trying to get at. It was said that it is important for the
mother to declare to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>the registrar who the father is because it is important for the child to
know who its parent is. If there are lots of reasons why the mother
does not have to do even that, then the chances of the registrar being
able to verify that information&#151;and verify it by the
father&#151;become increasingly slim.</div>
<a name="09030390000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
understand why not knowing the father&#146;s whereabouts is a good
reason for the mother not to have to disclose the information. Clearly,
not knowing the father&#146;s identity is a good reason because the
mother has no clue who he is&#151;that might say something about her
behaviour but it is not very useful to the registrar. If she does not
know the father&#146;s whereabouts, she should still have to declare
who he is. The registrar then has the opportunity to verify that
information. It seems that we are second-guessing whether that
information is verifiable and making it likely that there is another
child who does not know who one of his birth parents is. The
Minister&#146;s argument does not make
sense.</div>
<a name="09030390000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000392"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am very sorry that the hon. Gentleman thinks my
argument does not make sense; it makes perfect sense to me that
information is of no value in this context unless it is verifiable. If
it is not, then we should not be collecting it. It is simply
bureaucracy gone mad. If the hon. Gentleman wants to press that
amendment to a Division I will be delighted to explain to the registry
service why lots of bits of paper will have to be filled in for
absolutely no purpose. That situation would go against what some of his
colleagues say about cutting red tape; it certainly goes against what
we think about that and about spending taxpayers&#146; money
unnecessarily.</div><a name="09030390000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not the purpose of the registry function to become a private
detective agency, to use partial information to go out and proactively
find people. That is the role of the CSA; different legislation
applies. The registry registers things and information is not valid if
it cannot be verified. That applies to both sides&#151;if the father
rings the registry and says, &#147;I am the father of this
child,&#148; the mother has to verify that that is the
case.</div><a name="09030390000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000393"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> If a mother says, &#147;John Brown is the father
of my child and he lives at this place,&#148; the registrar writes
off to try to verify that. There is a process in which the information
is held and something is happening to it. If the mother says,
&#147;John Brown is the father but I do not know where he lives at
the moment,&#148; that information would be held somewhere. The
registry would be getting information which it could not immediately
put on to a document. I am with the hon. Gentleman here; I do not see
why a mother not knowing the father&#146;s whereabouts is a good
reason for not providing the
information.</div><a name="09030390000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000394"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I return to the point that I have made several
times; I am sorry if I am not making myself clear. In this context
information is not information unless it can be verified by both
parents&#151;I see no point in collecting it if it cannot be. If
further details of the parent&#146;s whereabouts come to light later,
the process can begin again and the child can have both parents on the
birth certificate.</div>
<a name="09030390000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
two situations are entirely different. If the mother says, &#147;Yes,
it is John Brown and he lives at this address,&#148; then that
information is collected in order to be able to write the letter to
confirm the father, and it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>is entered in the register. If she says: &#147;The father is John
Brown and I think he might live in Edinburgh,&#148; or, &#147;I do
not know where he lives,&#148; then there is absolutely nothing that
the registry office can do&#151;so there is no point in collecting
that information. Perhaps we can agree to disagree on the matter, but
it seems entirely clear to me. Should the information become available
later, of course, or if John Brown gets in contact and says,
&#147;This child is mine,&#148; then that will be checked with the
mother. Obviously these are hypothetical situations. John Brown is
doing well here.</div>
<a name="09030390000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 37
seeks to probe why we use the words</div>
<a name="09030390000151"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the mother has
reason to fear for her
safety&#148;.</div><a name="09030390000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Forest of Dean was proposing changing
&#147;reason&#148; to &#147;reasonable grounds&#148;. This
perhaps, comes back to what the role of the registrar is. It is not the
role of the registrar to perform some kind of quasi-judicial function
in determining whether the mother is behaving reasonably. There is
obviously a legal understanding of reasonableness. It simply gives the
opportunity for the mother to make a declaration that she has reason to
fear for her or her child&#146;s safety if the father is contacted,
and that is sufficient.</div>
<a name="09030390000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were we to
accept the amendment, it would the discretion of the registrar would
come into play. We do not want that to happen. It is for the courts to
decide the concept of reasonableness, not for the clerks who work in
the registry office. We are giving the mother the ability to state that
she has reason to fear. If that is not true she is committing perjury,
which is obviously illegal and that will be made clear to her. We think
it is something that will be taken seriously.</div>
<a name="09030390000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps this
is the appropriate moment to discuss the extremely welcome contribution
from my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley. She asked whether
the child has the right to find out who both their parents are. I think
they do, but the state should not create a situation that leads to
violence against that child. Perhaps where we disagree is about its
being an absolute right. I think the right can be overwritten in some
very specified circumstances.</div>
<a name="09030390000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
make it absolutely clear that it is extremely important to
people&#151;for their own identity and understanding of their sense
of self&#151;to know who their parents are. We should do everything
we can to make that as easy as possible. As I think I said at the
evidence session, what concerns me is a situation&#151;this cuts to a
point raised by the hon. Member for Rochdale&#151;where the very act
of contacting could lead to violence. It is not that the father is
generally a violent person, but the act of contacting almost makes the
state complicit in increasing the risk of violence against the mother,
the child or other children. Where we know that is likely, or where the
mother genuinely fears it, I do not think we should be doing that. It
is quite simple but there may be a difference between us on that point.
In those circumstances, if the father wants to put his name on and go
through the appropriate procedure to do so, the mother cannot prevent
it. The key question is whether the act of verifying will lead to
greater violence.</div>
<a name="09030390000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can give a
hypothetical example of a scenario of the type we are trying to avoid.
A woman becomes pregnant and the man says, &#147;I do not want you to
have the child&#148;. It is a violent relationship. It gets to a
situation where he says&#151;and one would believe he means
it&#151;&#147;If you have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>the child I will do x and y to you, I will come and get you and I will
come and get them.&#148; It is a nasty relationship and a horrible
situation. She lies and says, &#147;This relationship is over. I am
never going to see you again, I will not have this child;
goodbye&#148;. She then exercises her right to choose and decides she
does want to have the child. Perhaps she goes to stay with family to do
that. She has the child and then she has reason to fear that if the
father finds out, there will be violent reprisals against her. If the
state does not take it upon itself to contact the non-resident parent
there could be no more violence at all from this unhappy incident. I do
not think the state should put that mother, that child and any other

the person was violent anyway and it was not in the child&#146;s

the hon. Member for Forest of Dean. If a father is on the birth
certificate, he will have parental responsibility unless the courts
deny it, and that applies whether or not they are
estranged.</div><a name="09030390000159"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000395"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> That was very much the point I was seeking to make.
At the moment, the mother can deny the father the right to register his
name on the birth certificate. This procedure alters that and, by so
doing, the father automatically acquires parental responsibility.
Previously, the father would have had to go to the courts proactively,
but now he will acquire those rights and it will be for the mother to
go to the courts.</div>
<a name="09030390000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am thinking
of a scenario involving a father in an estranged couple exercising his
responsibilities. There might well be disputes about registration of
the family name or religion. According to figures that I have been
given by Refuge, more than 30 per cent. of all violence starts or gets
worse during pregnancy. Whereas, at the moment, the onus is on the
father to go to the courts, with the change under schedule 6, it will
be on the mother. I am asking the Minister to have another look at the
workings of the measure. Without further safeguards, we will find that
vulnerable women will be forced either to accept what the father is
doing&#151;a lot of women will be in that position&#151;or to go
through the courts to obtain some protection.</div>
<a name="09030390000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes
there will have been a clean break and the mother will have moved away.
She may be trying not to have any contact with the father, but if he
exercises that right, he can use it as a lever to get at her. There are
real concerns there, and if the Minister agrees to look at how the
process might operate, I am sure that a lot of people will be
reassured. Perhaps we can make some changes at a later stage to give
these women the protection that they
deserve.</div>
<a name="09030390000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000396"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> That is a useful point. It might be worth bearing
in mind that, if the two people are married, even if they are
separated, the father automatically acquires parental responsibility,
so the mother would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>have to go through the courts to protect herself. We are saying that if
a man proactively says, &#147;I am the father,&#148; he would be in
the same position as if the couple were
married.</div>
<a name="09030390000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
going to look at this again because I think we have the balance right
and that existing legal protections through the courts are sufficient
to address the problems. Prove me wrong, but I think that putting the
man on the register is not the act that is going to make him a
dangerous person. In a sense, the dangers are already known and the
procedures for protecting a family are already known and can be
commenced at an early stage. If an unmarried father is unfit to
exercise parental responsibility, it is for the courts to restrict or
remove that responsibility. The difference is whether the state is
proactively doing something that means that violence is more likely,
which is where we should be drawing the
line.</div>
<a name="09030390000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000397"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> The Minister has effectively just outlined the point
I have been making. The issues of violence are there anyway, so the
processes for dealing with violent people should be the ones that
operate, rather than allowing holes in the rights of children to have
their parents registered.</div>
<a name="09030390000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000398"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The difference is whether the act of the state
proactively creates a violent situation, or whether the violence is
already there because there is knowledge of the birth. We are trying to
create an exemption for a situation in which the father does not know
about the birth, but the act of telling him about it would create
violence. That is different from a violent parent seeking to get
parental responsibility and trying to use the birth certificate as one
way to achieve that, when it is right for the courts to restrict such a
thing. We have probably debated this sufficiently, but I should be
happy to take further interventions if another Member would like to
keep
going.</div><a name="09030390000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
amendment 105, the hon. Member for Rochdale wants to expand the family
unit that the mother may fear could be harmed beyond the mother and
child to any other children. We reject the amendment because,
practically, it is difficult to envisage a situation in which other
children would be at threat, but the child in question and/or the
mother would not. We feel that the exemptions as drafted are sufficient
to take all these situations into
consideration.</div><a name="09030390000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000399"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I would like to outline to the Minister a couple of
scenarios relevant to amendment 105 that have been given to me by
Gingerbread. The first is where a woman moves to a different area,
unknown to the man, following allegations of sexual abuse by him
against a teenage daughter. I know that there are a very small number
of such cases, but there is a fear that the man could use the process
of registration to find out where the family had moved to. The second
scenario
is&#151;</div><a name="09030390000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000400"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Interventions should be short, not second
speeches under the guise of an
intervention.</div><a name="09030390000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000401"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Gingerbread obviously has a list of examples, so
why do I not commit to having a conversation with the organisation
after the conclusion of the Committee?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div><a name="09030390000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000402"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I would like to return to the subject we are
arguing about&#151;this is where the Minister fundamentally
misunderstands my proposal. The provision is about the duty of the
mother to notify the registry office. She is still perfectly able to
notify the registrar of unverifiable information&#151;she is allowed
to tell the registrar who the father is, even is she has no clue where
he is on planet Earth. We are simply talking about whether she has a
duty to tell the registrar. She would be perfectly able to give the
registrar lots of information that the registrar could not verify, but
might be able to verify in the future. This is simply about whether she
has the duty to tell the registrar. It goes down to how important we
think it is that children know who their birth parents
are.</div><a name="09030390000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Birth
registrations should be about registering births. The hon. Member for
Sheffield, Heeley is quite right that protecting children and mothers
from violence can be achieved through the courts and a whole bunch of
other forms of protection. As the Minister said, it should not be the
function of the birth registration system to start arguing about
whether there are child protection or domestic violence
issues&#151;it is simply about who the parents of a particular child
are. If the mother has a duty to notify the registrar of information
about the father so that information can be recorded and, hopefully,
verified at some point in the future, the number of exemptions that
relieve the mother of that duty should be very small, or there should
be none at all. The mother should have to provide the
information&#151;the only exemption that makes any sense at all is
where she does not know who the father is, because clearly she would
not be able to communicate any information. I thus do not follow the
logic of the Minister&#146;s arguments about amendment
36.</div><a name="09030390000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 37, we have had a good debate about threats of domestic
violence&#151;they are clearly very important and, fortunately, real
in only a relatively small number of cases. The right way to deal with
them is to look at other processes, whether that is the criminal
justice system or the system of injunctions. When discussing violence,
the Minister did not address how we should deal with that within the
child maintenance system. The issues that she talked about are related
to whether the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is told who
the father is, and that then intervenes, which may then lead to a whole
bunch of other issues. Until relatively recently, a mother was
compelled to involve the Child Support Agency, or its successor, if she
was on benefits, whether she wanted to or not. That might have led to
all these complicated issues. The Minister would have been better to
keep these provisions short, sweet and crisp, and focused on the
notification of birth registrations, without over-complicating things.
However, given that we have had a good debate, I will not press my
amendments to a Division, although we may well return to the issue on
Report.</div><a name="09030390000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to close by commenting briefly on the amendments tabled by the
hon. Member for Rochdale. I take his point about circumstances in which
the father already had parental responsibility, but his amendments are
concerned with situations in which the mother might</div>
<a name="09030390000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fear for her
safety...if the father were to acquire
responsibility&#148;</div><a name="09030390000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">by
virtue of the relevant provisions of the Children Act 1989.
The father in that situation does not have responsibility from that
source already; it is something that he must go to court to get. There
is already a procedure to cover such
circumstances.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div><a name="09030390000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000403"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> As the Minister said earlier, a change is being
made to the law, and once the registration takes place the father will
not have to go to court to get parental responsibility. That is the
issue that I am concerned
about.</div><a name="09030390000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000404"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> No, the problem is the way in which the hon.
Gentleman has drafted his amendments, which specify only certain
circumstances in which the father might acquire responsibility by
virtue of the 1989 Act. If the father already had parental
responsibility, the situation would not be a valid reason for the
mother not to make the declaration in the first place. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intentions might be appropriate, and the Minister
might have confirmed that his concerns are valid, but the amendments
are not well drafted and do not achieve the objective he intends them
to. They are not very sound. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09030390000177"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09030390000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000405"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I beg to move amendment 38, in
schedule 6, page 94, line 19, leave
out subsection
(3).</div><a name="09030390000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to the provisions on scientific tests to determine
paternity, which make it clear that those tests would happen with the
consent of both parties. My amendment would omit the measure that
specifies that the regulations may not require people to participate in
the tests and makes it clear that they are voluntary. My reason for
probing the Minister on this is two-fold. First, if the tests are
purely voluntary, I am not quite sure what proposed new section 2E of
the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 Act adds to anything. It
seems to me that without the provision it would be perfectly possible,
when there was doubt about paternity, for the mother and father to get
a test and establish that the father was indeed the father of the
child. The mother could notify the registrar and the father could
confirm the information. It would seem that that could all be done
perfectly well without the provision, so if the Minister can explain
why it is in the Bill, that would be
helpful.</div><a name="09030390000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I want to probe a little about the reason for not including the
possibility of compulsion. I am not sure that I am in favour of it, but
I want to find out why the Government, having drafted the new
provisions, which are quite long and complicated, felt that compulsion
was not required. That brings me back to the question of the importance
for the child of knowing who its parents are. Why does the Minister not
think it appropriate that, in a situation in which the mother says one
man is the father and he says he is not, it should be possible to order
a test to clear the matter up? There are circumstances when that
happens, such as court cases involving assets, money, wills and
legacies. The courts can order tests to determine paternity, so it
seems that it would be perfectly possible to do so in the matter of
registering a birth so that the child could know who its parents were.
That principle is accepted in a range of other contexts, and I wondered
if the Minister could outline why the Government did not think it
appropriate for the purposes of birth
registration.</div>
<a name="09030390000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000406"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am happy to provide the explanation that the
hon. Gentleman wants. The principle is that when there is a dispute, it
is dealt with through the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>courts, and that when we can make things easier in a co-operative
environment, we can do so through the registry office. We do not want
to make adversarial a process that is designed to assist parents and
facilitate birth registration. We will provide parents with information
about tests and we can explain the advantages of co-operating but, on
reflection, we do not think it right for the registry office to insist
on tests if parents or putative parents have a bitter dispute about
parentage. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, there are many contexts
in which that might
happen.</div><a name="09030390000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the situation is adversarial, there are court provisions to resolve
it&#151;that is the best way to do that. When the situation is not
adversarial, it is right that the registry office is able to offer
advice and facilitate the taking of a paternity test to make it easier
for the parents to resolve the matter. In a voluntary situation, the
measure is a simplification that makes it easier for parents to resolve
the issue. If the situation is adversarial, we take it out of the
registry office and leave it where such situations are always resolved:
in the
courts.</div><a name="09030390000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000407"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
explanation. It is still not entirely clear if the proposed new
subsection enables the registry to do anything that it could not do
already. There seems to be nothing preventing the publication of
literature to explain how paternity tests work and how one might go
about getting one. The Minister does not seem to have set out what this
chunk of the Bill achieves or what it changes about the registration
process. It might just be me, but I do not think that she made that
clear&#151;perhaps she will have another
go.</div><a name="09030390000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000408"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am happy to have another go. This is simply
about having a process that is recognised by the registry office, which
is why it needs to be in legislation. At the moment, the registry
office has to go through a court for the registrar to be able to accept
paternity. This measure enables a civil process that would make it far
easier to resolve the matter in a non-adversarial situation. We need to
have that in law so that the registrar can accept the results without
having to go to a court. It is a simplification measure, and the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party has always said that it is in favour of
simplification.</div><a name="09030390000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000409"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The situation is still not clear. If the mother
and the father agree, having had the test, that they are the mother and
the father&#151;this is a voluntary situation&#151;I am not sure
what the registrar has to accept. It is not the result of the test,
because if the result was disputed, there would be an adversarial court
process, as the Minister said. If the situation is amicable, the test
is purely factual&#151;it says who the father is&#151;and parentage
is agreed, so both parents can say that to the registrar and the
process can continue. The measure does not add much except more words
to the Bill; it does not give the registrar any particular
powers.</div><a name="09030390000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000410"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Okay, I will give the hon. Gentleman one example,
although I do not want to get into specifics: a man says, &#147;That
child is mine&#148; but mum says, &#147;Actually, I&#146;ve had a
few partners and am not quite sure&#148;. Do we have to go to court
to sort that out, or can the registrar recognise
parentage?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div><a name="09030390000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000411"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> This is still not clear. That case does not seem
to bring us further forward, but I will not detain the Committee. In
that case, once the mother and father were clear about the result of
the test, they could say that to the registrar. However, we have talked
considerably about the issue, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000415"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09030390000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the new clause, which we have discussed with Gingerbread,
would enable child support appeal tribunals, when considering child
support appeals, to consider all matters up to the date of the hearing.
The present position under section 20(7)(b) is that a tribunal is not
allowed to take into account any circumstances that did not exist at
the time when the decision under appeal was made. That rule effectively
came through from social security
legislation.</div><a name="09030390000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason why child maintenance appeals are problematic is partly that it
takes so long for cases to be determined by a tribunal after an appeal.
The information supplied to me by Gingerbread&#151;it was obtained
from the Department for Work and Pensions; the Minister may or may not
be able to confirm its accuracy&#151;suggests that it takes about 33
weeks. On average, 11 weeks elapse between the submission of an appeal
to the Child Support Agency and the passing of the papers to the
Tribunals Service. Once the papers are received by the Tribunals
Service, on average just under 22 weeks elapses. The problem, which can
affect both the parent with care and the non-resident parent, is that
circumstances often change before the appeal is
heard.</div><a name="09030390000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
provide a specific example, after the decision has been made
someone&#146;s income or job circumstances could change and the
appeal tribunal would then be making a decision based on a set of facts
that no longer exists. That can take place over 33 weeks, which is the
best part of a year. In respect of child maintenance it would be much
better if the appeal tribunal could look at the present position and
reach a decision about the level of child maintenance with some
finality.</div><a name="09030390000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a relatively simple point and it is worth testing the Minister on
whether the Government think that it has any merit in child maintenance
cases. I am not suggesting that we adopt the process for social
security benefit cases&#151;effectively, that is where the idea stems
from&#151;but we should certainly do so for child maintenance cases.
With the delay in the system, it makes sense for the appeal tribunal to
be able to take into account all the relevant information up to the
date of the appeal, so that it can make a better decision that is more
likely to be final; otherwise, the process may need to be repeated
because the information has changed. That streamlining measure would
help both the parent with care and the non-resident parent get
to some form of closure. Will the Minister think about this
matter?</div><a name="09030390000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000416"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I understand why the hon. Gentleman tabled the
amendment. He has done so because of the long time it takes to hear
appeals. However, in seeking to deal with one problem he would be
creating another.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div><a name="09030390000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The solution
to the problem is to ensure that CMEC, the new body, deals with such
matters a lot quicker than the Child Support Agency currently does. The
information that a court or an appeal tribunal has to deal with cannot
be constantly changing. There must be a fixed reference point at which
all information is put before a tribunal, at which point that becomes
the information that the tribunal is dealing with. I suggest to the
hon. Gentleman and the Minister that the solution to the
problem&#151;and there is a problem&#151;is not to allow late
information, but to tackle the time it takes to consider appeals
through the
tribunal.</div><a name="09030390000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000417"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> For the first time I agree with what the hon.
Member for Rochdale has said. It is nice, as we enter the final stages
of consideration of the Bill, that there should be some harmony in the
Committee.</div><a name="09030390000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the appeal system is taking too long, that is a matter for the judicial
system. I agree with the hon. Member for Forest of Dean that we need to
try to sort out the length of time the process takes, although I do not
recognise the figures he used. Presumably, the lower the number of
errors made by CMEC, the lower the number of appeals, and therefore the
less likely this situation is to occur. We can judge from the
verifiable figures that the CSA is producing that the amount of
maintenance that it is collecting was rising over &#163;1
billion last year. The number of unprocessed applications has fallen
dramatically to 55,000&#151;that is still too high, although it used
to be 280,000&#151;so we hope that things are moving in the right
direction.</div><a name="09030390000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two immediate problems with the new clause. It could cause more
delays because the tribunal would have to look at more information,
which fluctuated over time. Therefore, we could get into the perverse
situation in which the tribunal was taking so long that there was more
new information. That would be costly for the taxpayer&#151;more so
than if the decision making on the award remained with the commission.
If the tribunal took new information into account and made a decision,
it is worrying that the non-resident parent would lose their right of
appeal, whereas if the decision rests with CMEC, there is a right of
appeal. Therefore it is right and proper to follow the design of the
social security legislation and leave the decisions with CMEC, which
can be appealed on a point of law only, to a tribunal with a snapshot
of the situation at that time.</div>

pm</div><a name="09030390000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is new information, it is still the commission&#146;s right to
withdraw the hearing so that the appeal lapses, and to simply revise
the award based on that new information in parallel with an appeal
process concerned with a point of law. In a sense, it becomes
hypothetical whether the underlying decision has been changed. It
raises an interesting question but we cannot accept the new
clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000418"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Will the Minister furnish the Committee with the
information about delays that I told her about, which was supplied to
Gingerbread by the Department for Work and Pensions and covered child
support appeals between April and December 2008? It was 11 weeks
between the appeal by the CSA and the papers going to the Tribunals
Service and just under 22 weeks&#146; clearance time for an appeal by
the Tribunals Service. The Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>said that she did not recognise the numbers, and I accept that they may
not be accurate. Can she furnish the Committee with accurate
information?</div>
<a name="09030390000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000419"></a>Kitty

the Committee before Report to clarify those

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000420"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for pledging to
share that information. It will be helpful. The hon. Member for
Rochdale, in his outbreak of harmony, was correct; it would be better
if both the CSA and CMEC were swifter.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I thought that the Minister had
finished.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000421"></a>The

<a name="09030390000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000422"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I thought that was what had happened. Thank you
for clarifying that, Mr. Hood. The Minister was good to set
things out. It would be beneficial if CMEC made more accurate decisions
in the first place and fewer were appealed. If CMEC and the Tribunals
Service dealt with appealed decisions more swiftly, the problems would
be minimised. We do not have the power to do that by tabling new
clauses, but doing so has enabled the hon. Member for Rochdale to make
his points and I support him.</div>
<a name="09030390000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Minister supplies us with the information, it will be helpful to see
what the delays are. The Minister&#146;s best argument&#151;and why
I will not press the new clause to a Division&#151;was about how
taking decision making away from CMEC would effectively remove the
right to appeal. On reflection, I think that the Minister has made a
good point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div>

Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): I beg to move, That
the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09030390000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is self-explanatory and needs little introduction, but the
clarity and familiarity of the issue should not obscure the justness of
the case and the need to right a long-standing wrong. The new clause
would amend the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to
enable a blind person to qualify for the higher rate mobility component
of the disability living allowance, which that Act excludes them from
unless 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>they are also physically unable to walk. It is easy to see why that
exclusion does not make sense, and more than 300 MPs have signed up to
support this change. There is also overwhelming support among the
general public, with more than 90 per cent. of people believing that
those who are blind should be eligible for the higher rate of mobility
component. The groundswell behind the new clause is down to the work of
the Royal National Institute of Blind People, and I pay tribute to its
campaigning on this issue and many others, and on its work across the
board as a charity. I have worked on welfare reform issues for a number
of years, and it has never failed to impress me.</div>
<a name="09030390000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
anomaly&#151;the way in which the DLA works&#151;from the 1992 Act
must surely have been a mistake and an unintended consequence that such
Committees must root out. They were probably difficult times back in
1991 when the issue was first discussed, but that is no excuse for
successive Governments&#146; not righting the wrong. Despite facing
some of the biggest, and often most insurmountable, barriers to
independent mobility, blind people were denied the higher rate of
mobility support, which was limited to those who face physical barriers
to getting around. That means a difference of &#163;29 a week for a
blind person on the lower rate of mobility component, or more than
&#163;1,500 a year. There is no good reason for discriminating
between someone who faces physical barriers of mobility and someone who
is unable to move around safely and independently owing to
blindness.</div>
<a name="09030390000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case of
one of my constituents, Mr. Alan McDonald, highlights the
paradox. He has been blind from birth and faces huge hurdles to getting
around. He is unable to use public transport because of difficulties
getting on and off buses and trains, and either he needs to spend other
benefits, which are meant to provide other support, on taxis, or he is
forced to rely on his sister for lifts to where he needs to go.
Otherwise, he stays at home. His blindness is not his only barrier to
mobility. He is currently awaiting a second kidney transplant and will,
in a few months&#146; time, undergo surgery for hardening of the
arteries. Despite all those difficulties, he has been told on several
occasions that he simply cannot qualify for the higher rate because he
is physically able to walk. The barriers that he faces are just as
great as those for someone who is not able to walk, however, and it is
nonsensical to pretend otherwise. Blind people like him feel
justifiably angry about this discriminatory and unfair treatment by the
DLA system.</div>
<a name="09030390000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equality is
not the only reason why we need to make this change, however. Without
the freedom that independent movement brings, it is all too easy for
blind people to become isolated and excluded from society and the
leisure and activities that they value. It also affects them at the
most basic level, preventing access to essential public services such
as
hospitals.</div><a name="09030390000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
exclusion is also played out in employment. Two thirds of working-age
people with sight loss are not in work, and a Leonard Cheshire
Disability report in 2003 found that visually impaired people are the
group that is most adversely affected in that respect. Yet, that group
is denied additional assistance. If we are serious about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>improving the employment rate for disabled people, surely we need at
least to ensure they can get to an interview in the first
place.</div>
<a name="09030390000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the RNIB
lobby of Parliament in October, the Minister with responsibility for
disabled people spoke in very positive terms about &#147;how&#148;
and &#147;when&#148;, rather than &#147;if&#148;, blind people
would be given access to that component. I understand that costing and
conditions for eligibility have been carried out by the Department, and
I suggest that the new clause, and the Bill, offer the perfect response
to both questions that the Minister raised.</div>
<a name="09030390000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind
Members that about 26,000 people in the UK have no useful sight for
orientation purposes, and I would challenge anyone to say that such
people do not face some of the most significant barriers to getting
around. It is time that the mobility component of DLA lived up to its
name, and it is time for us to live up to blind people&#146;s
expectations.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000424"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow,
North-West and the RNIB on the new clause. We can all support it,
because as he says, it would right a
wrong.</div><a name="09030390000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key point about the proposal is that people will become eligible for,
rather than have an automatic entitlement to, higher rate DLA. The
discrimination at the moment is that people are ineligible for the
higher rate and can qualify only for the lower rate. It should be left
to the normal processes of medical assessment to decide. Why should
someone who is physically handicapped be eligible for an award when
someone with a sight impairment is
not?</div><a name="09030390000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sums of money that the DWP spends on this annually are quite
small&#151;&#163;45 million for 22,000 people. That was the figure
that was given to the RNIB. It is a comparatively small amount of money
in global terms, even if all 22,000 people automatically qualify. The
caveat is that people will not automatically qualify. They will have to
demonstrate that their disability means that they qualify. That that
does not apply is the injustice that blind people feel at the
moment.</div><a name="09030390000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been given an example by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham
(Dr. Cable). A 14-year-old boy in his constituency had had an accident
when he was nine and had ended up being severely disabled, with poor
eyesight. He was initially given the higher rate, which meant that his
mother qualified for a Motability vehicle, which she has used to take
him around. He is now able to walk but his sight has not improved, and
following a reassessment he now gets the lower rate. His mother will
therefore lose eligibility for the Motability
vehicle.</div><a name="09030390000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our view, these decisions should not depend on which rate a person is
on; they should be based on a proper assessment. The fact that the boy
became ineligible for the higher rate caused the mother to lose
eligibility. The key point is that blind people should be
eligible&#151;we are not saying that they would all automatically
qualify. A number of hon. Members back such a change&#151;as the hon.
Member for Glasgow, North-West said, more than 200 Members signed
various early-day motions in the past two years&#151;and there is a
very strong feeling across the House that this is the right time for a
change. The Bill would be considerably strengthened in a number 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>of ways if the Government accepted the new clause. I am sure that people
would be very pleased if the Government accepted such a positive
measure.</div><a name="09030390000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000425"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I simply want to flesh out what the hon. Member
for Glasgow, North-West said about the definitions. He referred to the
phrase, &#147;no useful sight for orientation purposes&#148;, which
the RNIB used. For the benefit of the Committee, in a written answer,
the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for
Chatham and Aylesford, said
that</div><a name="09030390000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;during
helpful discussions with the RNIB they have suggested that...no
useful sight for orientation purposes...could be interpreted as
meaning that a visually impaired person would have: no perception of
light; perception of light only; perception of hand movement;
or...&#145;total&#146; or &#145;extensive&#146; loss of
visual field. Using these definitions of visual impairment we estimate
that, if implemented in 2010-11, we would require additional annual
benefit expenditure of around &#163;45 million to extend the higher
rate&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 February 2009; Vol.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000426"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Jonathan
Shaw):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow, North-West on the new clause. All members of the Committee
will agree that he put forward a compelling and passionate argument for
such an important change. He has a track record of campaigning for
blind and visually impaired people, both in his constituency and
further afield.</div>
<a name="09030390000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
hon. Member for Rochdale for bringing forward a case on behalf of the
hon. Member for Twickenham, and the hon. Member for Forest of Dean for
setting out the information that I was able to supply. His lack of
comment about whether he supported the proposal was deafening. Perhaps
we will hear at a later stage whether he and the Conservative party
have an opinion on
this.</div><a name="09030390000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000427"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am listening to you.</div>
<a name="09030390000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000428"></a>Jonathan
Shaw:</b> And we listened to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s very
succinct remarks, which offered no opinion. I invite him to intervene
to give me an opinion. There we are, we have heard the opinion of the
Conservative party.</div>
<a name="09030390000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I can
bring some context to this. Some 65,000 people who receive disability
living allowance are recorded as having a sight impairment as their
primary disability. Of those, around 58,000 receive the lower rate
mobility component and around 4,600 the higher rate. The DLA is clearly
working for a great number of visually impaired people. Having said
that, the Government are sympathetic to the call for change,
specifically regarding the rules on entitlement to the higher rate
mobility allowance.</div>
<a name="09030390000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
personal commitment to this. One of the first things that I did on
becoming Minister for disabled people was to review some of the
correspondence that the Department had received. I found a letter to
the Secretary of State dated 22 August last year that told my right
hon. Friend that he should read the enclosed letter from Ms Karen
Osborn, the chief executive of KAB Sight Centre, and that asked for
comments on the issues raised in that letter. It also said that
reassurances would be welcomed that the Department was determined to
end the exclusion of blind people from this important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>extra cost benefit when they face some of the greatest barriers to
independent mobility. The letter was signed &#147;Jonathan Shaw
MP&#148;, the Member of Parliament for Chatham and Aylesford. That
puts my activity as a constituency Member of Parliament on record. My
right hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire)
subsequently wrote back because there were some discussions about
costs. Hon. Members will remember that the original cost put forward by
the RNIB was about &#163;30 million per year. As we have heard, since
work has been undertaken, there has been agreement that the cost would
be about &#163;45 million.</div>
<a name="09030390000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State has also confirmed his support by
saying:</div><a name="09030390000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government do not have any objection to it in principle. They totally
understand the case that is being made.&#148;</div>
<a name="09030390000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to say
that, in recent weeks and months, we have been able to work with the
RNIB in the way mentioned by the hon. Member for Forest of Dean. I am
enormously grateful for its work in engaging with us positively to find
a workable solution. Although we have made huge progress in developing
this measure, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West
knows, the issue is about finding funds within limited resources. Our
priority at this time is to stabilise the economy and help people
remain in or return to work. Any spending decisions in this context
must be focused on a stable economy, businesses, supporting families
and helping people to remain in or return to the labour market.
Spending decisions at this time will clearly be difficult and must be
taken in the context of continued pressure to deliver efficiency across
the Government. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has alluded
to these pressures.</div>
<a name="09030390000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000429"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I have been listening carefully to the Minister.
Given that there is a process of people migrating from incapacity
benefit to employment and support allowance, and that a lot of work is
going on to get people who may have been on incapacity benefit back
into work, does he not accept that some savings are going to be made?
They could be passported over to this particular group, thus enabling
this wrong to be
righted.</div><a name="09030390000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000430"></a>Jonathan
Shaw:</b> There are always competing demands for the DWP
budget and I shall set out carefully the context on which we need to
focus.</div><a name="09030390000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second
Reading:</div><a name="09030390000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
we move forward with this, we will have to find the investment not only
for now, but for the medium term, because a continuing commitment would
be involved.&#148;&#151;[Official Report, 27 January 2009; Vol.
487, c.
186-87.]</div><a name="09030390000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
has been said, we now estimate that the additional benefit expenditure
would be about &#163;45 million per year, with a &#163;12 million
administrative spend in the first year alone. However, we estimate that
the ongoing costs of administrating the change would quickly fall to
around &#163;2 million per year, although we would still need to find
resources to cover at least &#163;45 million a year and rising in the
years going forward. Funding on such a scale could not be found from
this Bill&#146;s measures. While the Government fully recognise the
intentions behind the new clause, accepting it without having the
funding to support it would require us to withdraw funding from
elsewhere in the benefit system.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div><a name="09030390000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
as the hon. Member for Rochdale suggested in terms of incapacity
benefit, hon. Members will know that we are increasing Access to Work

people, in particular&#151;by enabling them to get into work. We want
to continue to work with RNIB and the partner organisations to ensure
we do all that we can for blind and visually impaired people. I
anticipate that some of my comments will disappoint my hon. Friend the
Member for Glasgow, North-West and, indeed, other members of the
Committee. We cannot, at this stage, provide substantive support for
the new clause. However, I assure him and the Committee that we will
continue to look at the

compelling and passionate argument, although it was obviously not
compelling and passionate enough. He is absolutely right that I was
disappointed by what he had to say. My head says I should press the new
clause to a Division because I know right is on my side. However, I am
going to overrule my head in this case and think about going away to
fight another day. I want to ensure&#151;and I say this to the
Minister as a promise, not a threat&#151;that such a measure goes
through in this House, not the other place. I believe that if the other
place considers such a measure, it will go through there. However, it
is important that elected representatives make this decision. I want
our House to agree to such an amendment, so with the promise that I
will return to this on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000436"></a>John
Mason:</b> I would like to challenge the Committee with a
question: what is our starting point as we look at this Bill? Is it
that the state is so generously funding people who do not really
deserve it that we must cap all our expenditure and, if possible,
reduce it? Some might say that is the traditional view of the main
Opposition party. Alternatively, are we approaching the Bill from the
point of view that every adult, family and child needs to have enough
to live on so that they are able to eat, have a proper home, and be
properly clothed? Anything that we do under the Bill must take account
of those points, and some would say that that is the traditional view
of the party in government.</div>
<a name="09030390000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of my
fundamental problems with the idea of sanctions is that some people are
already living on a minimal income. If we cut that income further,
where will that leave those people? In particular, where will it leave
families, and especially children?</div>
<a name="09030390000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
has discussed loans at some length. There has been mention of social
fund loans, but people take other loans as well, and they eat into
their ability to pay bills. In fact, on Friday, a constituent came to
me who had got seriously into debt because of his mother&#146;s
funeral. He was unwise to pay as much as he did on the funeral,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000437"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. There are four conversations going on in
the room. I ask hon. Members to listen to the hon. Member for Glasgow,
East.</div><a name="09030390000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000438"></a>John
Mason:</b> Thank you, Mr. Hood; you are very
generous.</div><a name="09030390000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
asked the Barnardo&#146;s representative in our evidence session
where this would leave families and children. The answer seems to be
that the extended family will help the children to eat, that the
parents might be out stealing, or that people will just not be eating
at all. The constituent to whom I referred told me that he had gone
three days without eating in the previous week. That is the kind of
world in which, I am afraid, we are still
living.</div><a name="09030390000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not against sanctions per se, if people have extra income above the
amount that they need to live on. However, the benefit system is not
exactly generous and does not give people a lot of leeway to meet such
sanctions. New clause 8 proposes a means inquiry, which would help to
re-emphasise that we must know people&#146;s real
circumstances&#151;not theoretically or on paper&#151;when we are
talking about moving into
sanctions.</div><a name="09030390000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
we are living in a society with many different kinds of people. There
are people who try to screw the system to get every penny they can get
and who contribute absolutely nothing to society. It is those people
who the Government are probably seeking to target through the Bill. I
am not opposed to that, but I urge them to think of the people in
society who are struggling, who are scared of this House and of
bureaucracy, and who find it difficult to read and write and to take
part in our incredibly complicated system. I appeal to Ministers to
consider how we can better protect these people, and I would suggest
that these new clauses would help to protect
them.</div><a name="09030390000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000439"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I support the hon. Gentleman, who speaks for the
Scottish National party, on these new clauses.</div>
<a name="09030390000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout
our proceedings, the Government have made much of international
comparisons when they have talked about the success of using sanctions
as a means of getting people back into work. However, there is one
major difference when one looks at these international comparisons: the
level of the benefits that are paid in the Netherlands or Australia,
for example, compared with what is paid in the UK. That is part of the
reason why many voluntary bodies and charities have expressed concerns
about certain aspects of the Bill. When sanctions are applied, that
should not, in itself, result in hardship&#151;for example, for
children&#151;and lead to people falling further into
poverty.</div>
<a name="09030390000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman said, new clause 8 would not stop the implementation of
sanctions, but would ensure that, before those sanctions were
implemented, a proper means inquiry was carried out into what effect
any particular sanction would have on a family. That would act as an
important stop on the Department, because one of the overriding threads
running through concerns raised about the Bill is the way in which
sanctions will affect vulnerable people. I know that Ministers have
tried to reassure us that situations will not arise that result in a
vulnerable person losing benefit, either because of a mental health
problem or some other issue. That is well made as a general point, but
the new clauses would ensure that there was adequate protection via the
means inquiry to ensure that safeguards were in
place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div><a name="09030390000336"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09030390000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the purpose of the Bill is to encourage more people back into work, it
is clearly not in anyone&#146;s interest if, as a result of sanction,
a child is put into care because the parent is unable to cope with the
situation, because the cost of that to the state would be much greater.
I thus hope that the Minister will consider this important safeguard.
If the wording being suggested is not correct, I hope that the Minister
will agree to look at it and come back with a suitable provision on
Report. We all want a Bill that works and a system of sanctions that
has the desired effect, but we have severe concerns that there are no
adequate safeguards in place to ensure that the effects of those
sanctions do not result in a person being put in a much worse position,
with consequential effects on other members of their
family.</div>
<a name="09030390000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000440"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Ann
McKechin):</b> This has been an interesting debate. The hon.
Members for Glasgow, East and for Rochdale have both forgotten the
basic point: there is a contract between the applicant and the state
and if one obeys the rules, no sanctions will be applied. It is not
unreasonable for us to insist that people should obey reasonable rules
that are set down, with appropriate provisions to consider
people&#146;s individual circumstances and also offer people a route
out of work.</div>
<a name="09030390000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000441"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I accept the Minister&#146;s point, but does she
not accept that the state often gets it wrong, and that the proposal
that is put forward&#151;whether it be at work, or
whatever&#151;can be inappropriate for a person, which can result in
hardship?</div><a name="09030390000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000442"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> With the greatest respect, that is why we have a
comprehensive appeals procedure in place. For example, only one in 10
jobseeker&#146;s allowance customers has their benefits sanctioned.
Only a little over 1 per cent. of lone parents received second, or
subsequent, sanctions in 2006-07. I respectfully put it to both hon.
Gentlemen that the sanction system works and that we have in place an
adequate system of protection and appeals.</div>
<a name="09030390000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">All three new
clauses relate to sanctions. New clauses 6 and 8
attempt&#151;although clumsily&#151;to redesign the sanction
system. They would introduce a minimum level below which the income of
an individual or family could not fall for them to be subject to a
sanction. That minimum would apply even if they were being sanctioned
for not fulfilling their obligations to engage with the support that we
were offering them. It would be applied only after all outgoings were
taken into account. I know that the motivation behind the measures, as
both hon. Gentlemen have stated, is to ensure that vulnerable people
are protected, but they are
unnecessary.</div><a name="09030390000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hardship
provisions, minimum levels of benefit and extensive safeguards already
exist in the benefit system to ensure that the most vulnerable
claimants are not unfairly sanctioned or left destitute. In addition,
income replacement benefits, which are the only ones subject to
sanctions, make up only a proportion of the overall support that a
customer would seek to receive from the Government. For example,
benefits paid to parents in respect of their children and housing
benefit, which is one of the most generous systems in Europe, as well
as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>council tax benefit, tax credits and disability living allowance, are
all unaffected. Vulnerable people are unlikely to lose all their income
and become destitute, because their housing benefit and council tax
benefit remain
intact.</div><a name="09030390000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
accept that the sanctions system is not perfect and we are continuously
reviewing current practice to see if it can be improved. That is why we
are exploring an escalating sanctions model in pathfinder areas as we
test the Gregg model of conditionality. We are in the early stages of
designing that model. As we progress, we will engage with a range of
stakeholders to ensure that the appropriate safeguards are in place to
make sure that vulnerable claimants are protected and that the existing
rights of appeal
remain.</div><a name="09030390000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must not lose sight of the fact that there is a very simple way for
claimants to avoid being sanctioned in the first place: by meeting
their obligations as citizens to prepare or look for work. That is the
essence of an active welfare state, and such a system has been adopted
by every other western
economy.</div><a name="09030390000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clauses would give the very different message that benefits could
be received with no conditions attached, and that even if a claimant
had no intention of ever attempting to better their chances of
employment, despite being clearly able to do so, taxpayers would still
be supposed to pick up the bill for supporting them. That is the
essence of the passive welfare state that has quite rightly been
rejected.</div><a name="09030390000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 7 is an attempt to ensure that no jobseeker will be sanctioned
for refusing employment if the job on offer paid less a week than they
would have got on jobseeker&#146;s allowance. It would not apply to
claimants of ESA or income support, because they are not required to
take specific employment. Again, we believe that the new clause is
unnecessary. The existing sanctions regime ensures that no one is
sanctioned for refusing a job that pays less than the national minimum
wage, which ensures a minimum income from employment. That is topped up
by generous tax credits for those on a low income and those with
children. Furthermore, we will help to ease the transition into work
with the job grant for jobseekers who have been unemployed for more
than six
months.</div><a name="09030390000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sanctions system is designed primarily to be an incentive to re-engage.
It is the threat of a sanction that has the greatest effect, not the
sanction itself, as is proven by the figures to which I have already
referred. For that to remain true, the system must remain transparent,
simple and clearly linked to the behaviour of the
customer.</div><a name="09030390000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
new clauses would create a system that, frankly, would be so
bureaucratic and resource-intensive that it would effectively cripple
the sanctions system. Given that, and taking account of our current
safeguards, I urge the hon. Member for Glasgow, East to withdraw the
new clause.</div>
<a name="09030390000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000443"></a>John
Mason:</b> I must confess to disappointment at the
Minister&#146;s harsh tone. If there had been a bit of sympathy, I
would have been a bit more supportive. The contract is an interesting
idea. If we enter employment, we clearly have a contract with employer
and we have to fulfil certain conditions, but there has to be a minimum

<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>standard in a civilised society below which we do not fall. Even our
prisoners are entitled to certain levels of food and benefit. Our
children should also be entitled to such benefits. While I am happy to
accept that the wording of the new clauses is not entirely perfect, I
am not happy to withdraw new clause
6.</div><a name="09030390000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

aim of the new clause is to ensure that a person of working age does
not face a pensions penalty in retirement because of taking on a
significant caring role for a grandchild or somebody else in need.
Grandparents Plus, which champions the vital role of grandparents and
the wider family in children&#146;s lives, has been working on the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030390000457"></a>John

new clause is important. Although I am not in the early throes of my
working life, I, like many grandparents, am far from retirement age. I
hope to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>have plenty of years in which to work and contribute to society.
However, my family comes first, and many grandparents sacrifice their
working lives for their grandchildren. The new clause would amend the
Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to create a credit
for those of working age who provide 20 hours or more per week of
unpaid care for a grandchild under the age of 12 or for an</div>
<a name="09030390000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ill, frail or
disabled family member, friend or
partner&#148;.</div><a name="09030390000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Pensions Act 2007, the Government introduced a weekly credit for
parents, foster parents and carers to be specified by regulation that
would go towards their pension to make up for the contributions that
they would be making through national insurance. That measure did not
include grandparents. When that issue was debated in the other place,
Ministers promised to look into it further. I understand that the
relevant regulations will be laid before Parliament in the coming
weeks. I urge Ministers to use the new clause or the regulations to
ensure that someone caring for a grandchild or a person in need to whom
they are close will be entitled to the weekly
credit.</div><a name="09030390000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that all hon. Members agree that anybody of working age who
cares for a young grandchild, family member, friend or partner who is
ill, frail or disabled for more than 20 hours a week is sacrificing
time in which they could be working or engaging by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>doing something that is as socially beneficial as being in employment
and making national insurance contributions. That is surely recognised
by the 2007 Act through the introduction of the credit for parents,
foster parents and other
carers.</div><a name="09030390000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an obvious question of fairness and equality. When a
person&#151;whether they are a parent or a grandparent&#151;is
caring for a child in the family instead of working, why should there
be discrimination on their state pension? How can we say that someone
caring for a family member, partner or friend is less deserving of a
full state pension than someone who has spent time caring for their
child?</div><a name="09030390000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is emphatically not about paying someone for care. There is
no gain for somebody who is receiving a full state pension. It would
give parity for state pension contributions. I wish to consider the
specific case of grandparents who are close to retirement age, for whom
the issue is more pressing. The current situation means that if a
