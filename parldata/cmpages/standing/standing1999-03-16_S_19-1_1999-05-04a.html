<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of
the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home</B><P>
Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien): Thank you, Mr. Maxton. By linking
the provision of support to asylum seekers with the processing
of asylum applications, we are ensuring that there is a greater
incentive to minimise delays in the process and to restore
integrity. Furthermore, it will also serve to ensure that a
better overview can be taken of the needs of asylum seekers and
the demands that they place on Government.
<P>
Clause 73, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 74</center></H4>
<H4><center>Persons for whom support may be provided</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): I beg to move amendment No.
738,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in page 45, line 27, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the
following amendments:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``No. 845, in page 45, line 31, leave out from `who' to
`destitute' and insert `are'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``No. 351, in page 45, line 32, leave out from `destitute'
to end of line.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``No. 352, in page 45, leave out lines 33 and 34.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I shall speak briefly to what is a simple and
straightforward amendment. It would replace ``may'' with
``shall'' in the first sentence of the clause, thus placing a
duty on the Secretary of State. I have no doubt that the Minister
will say that the Government have no intention ever of denying
all asylum seekers support or scrapping the schemes now being
introduced and I am sure that this is so. However, we shall not
always have the same Ministers and I am sure that they are
grateful for not having to deal with immigration and asylum
matters for years to come. What a sentence that would be.
<P>
A future Secretary of State might of course take a different
view. If we believe that there will always be a support
system&#151;and the system in the Bill is clearly capable of
considerable change because so much is open to regulation by yet
more regulation&#151;it seems reasonable to make a clear
commitment to it. The amendment would do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): The clause lays the
foundation stones for the Government's new asylum support system.
As I said this morning, we are not opposed in principle to what
the Government are doing here, but we have some questions about
the detail and about the way in which certain aspects of it are
being implemented.
<P>
The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), with his
amendment, has touched on something that immediately struck me
as curious when I read the Bill, as it did the Immigration Law
Practitioners Association, which also found it surprising. ILPA
is shocked that clause 74 imposes no duty on the Secretary of
State. I was curious because the choice of the word ``may''
rather than the word ``shall'' seems to envisage asylum seekers
or their dependants possibly being destitute according to the
conditions described in subsection (1). They could have become
destitute, but the Government might choose to withhold support
because they are under no duty to provide it. The subsection
seems to contemplate a situation where support is withheld. The
Minister needs to clear up that curious feature of the Bill.
<P>
The other amendments in my name in the group were also
suggested by ILPA. Amendment No. 845 deals with the nature of the
test that will be applied to those to be provided with support.
The Secretary of State will carry out the test, and ILPA regards
that as a worrying development. In its evidence to the Committee,
it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Also worrying, both here and in the numerous places that
it occurs in Part VI, is the subjectivity of the `who appear to
the Secretary of State to be . . . .' proviso.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It believes that that should be replaced with objective tests
throughout. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State's opinion, and
not an objective one, will count. The Minister will have to deal
with that point.
<P>
Amendment No. 351 deals with a separate matter. Subsection
(1) provides that the Secretary of State may provide support for
asylum seekers or their dependants who fulfil the test that I
have just described. The amendment relates to the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``within such period as may be prescribed''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that appear in the subsection. ILPA described that phrase as
one of a number of ``potential time bombs'' and it is worried
about possible future regulations. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``So if the asylum seeker is in a pretty bad way, but the
Secretary of State reckons he won't actually hit destitution
level until tomorrow week, and if the prescribed period is 7
days, then the Secretary of State is prevented from providing any
support today.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing
Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 241.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
ILPA thinks that the subsection would be improved if the
words that it is worried about were removed. Its concern is
reasonable and the Minister should answer it. None of us wants
to see asylum seekers, and especially their dependants and
children, becoming destitute.
<P>
In the interests of making progress, I shall not seek a
separate vote on amendment No. 352. The point that it makes is
not as important as the others. However, I hope that the Minister
will reply to all the issues that I have raised.
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): I
support the excellent amendment No. 738, which was tabled by my
hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow. It is better than
amendment No. 845, to which I put my name. It must be the first,
and the last time that I have attached my name to an amendment
headed by the right hon. member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir N.
Fowler).
<P>
Amendment No. 738 raises the fundamental issue that the
Government's envisaged provisions for support will be left
entirely to the discretion of the Secretary of State. In fact,
it will not be at his personal discretion, but that of officials
in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. That cannot be
right.
<P>
Later in the Bill, the Committee will be asked to support
removing asylum seekers' children from the provisions of the
Children Act 1989. Had that Act been left intact, it would have
provided a failsafe whereby no child could have been possibly
been left destitute under the provisions of the Bill. However,
the words in subsection (1) that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may provide''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
leave open the possibility that he may choose not to arrange
provision for asylum seekers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who appear to the Secretary of State to be destitute or
to be likely to become destitute''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would rule out the possibility of the Secretary
of State&#151;or more to the point, agents acting on his
behalf&#151;deciding not to offer support to asylum seekers or
their children who are, by any measure, destitute. It is
important in that it touches on the discretionary nature of the
system of support. If people are destitute by whatever means it
is defined, the Secretary of State should have a duty to offer
support. The wording in the amendment is much more satisfactory
and much more in keeping with what is appropriate from one of the
richest countries in the world as we approach the millennium.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I support all the
amendments in the group. Perhaps I approach the amendments that
we have tabled jointly at a different angle from the hon. Member
for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison).
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is the rainbow movement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Indeed. The rainbow movement is in operation on
the crucial issue of human rights. The forces of good are aligned
against the Government.
<P>
The amendments try to establish the grounds for excluding
someone from the support system. We oppose the system for which
the Bill provides, but if it is to be the only system, we want
to ensure that people are included in it. The Secretary of State
has too much power to decide the grounds for excluding someone.
Amendment No. 738, tabled by the hon. Member for Walthamstow, is
helpful because it outlines the duty rather than the discretion
of the Secretary of State.
<P>
Amendment No. 845 is important. Earlier, we discussed
eligibility for support arrangements. The Minister said that
there would be an appeal mechanism. That is welcome, but it might
be difficult to gain access to the mechanism if there are no
objective criteria on which an individual can appeal. The experts
from ILPA have already been quoted. The association said that it
may prove difficult to appeal against the test contained in the
phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``appear to the Secretary of State to be destitute''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is more difficult to appeal against that than a more
straightforward, objective test. The Secretary of State could
claim, ``Well, they appear to me to be destitute.'' A more
objective set of criteria would give individuals a realistic
chance of winning their appeals.
<P>
When the hon. Member for Hertsmere considered amendment No.
351, he referred to the seven-day period. I draw the Minister's
attention to victims of torture, whom we have often discussed.
I hope that the Minister concedes that the period of approaching
or near destitution for which the measure provides is wholly
inappropriate for victims of torture. In its evidence to the
Committee, the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of
Torture said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``One of the aims of the torturer is to destroy the sense
of dignity, self-worth and strength of the victim. One of the
central aims of the healing process is to nurture the sense of
dignity, self-worth and strength of the survivor.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It said that destitution in this country could contribute to
or exacerbate the suffering that victims of torture had already
experienced at the hands of the torturer. The organisation's
solution is the same as ours: to restore the welfare benefits
system. In the context of the waiting period for impending
destitution, I hope that the Minister will reassure the Committee
that victims of torture will not have to wait until they show all
the signs of destitution before they receive appropriate support.
Compassionate grounds should carry weight in those circumstances
if not in others.
<P>
I shall now speak to amendment No. 352. We believe that the
Government should make clearer their intentions in clause 74(2).
The subsection provides for a sweeping power. The Secretary of
State may prescribe circumstances in which someone can be removed
from the support system. It is worrying that individuals can be
removed from the support system, and the last safety net, but it
is especially worrying that we do not know the circumstances
under which such removal can take place. The explanatory notes
give an example of a person who caused damage to property that
was provided under the support arrangements. That person could
be excluded from the system. However, the appropriate method of
dealing with someone who damages property is the usual legal
remedy. I am not convinced that withdrawal of support
arrangements is appropriate for dealing with someone in those
circumstances. Destitution, or penury, is not a common punishment
in criminal law in cases of criminal damage. To use withdrawal
of support&#151;throwing people out of their
accommodation&#151;as a punishment for having abused an earlier
provision of support is not appropriate. The normal remedies
available in such circumstances should be used.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Subsection (2) will lead to people being told, ``You will
lose your house and all your income because you have broken rules
a, b and c set by the Secretary of State.'' As I said earlier,
we are in the dark because we do not know what those rules will
be. Such an outcome would not be conducive to the public good.
There are a host of reasons why a reprehensible incident may have
occurred, but to place someone on the streets without any support
will cause further public order problems rather than remove them.
<P>
The Government may have something in store, but they have not
come to a similar conclusion in the general criminal law, that
an appropriate response to someone who has caused damage or
carried out a similar offence is to throw him out on the street
with no access to the benefits system; but perhaps I am putting
ideas into the Home Secretary's head. I hope that all members of
the Committee agree that such an example would increase the
likelihood of public harm rather than remove it. There have been
disturbances at Campsfield house, a detention centre, and one can
imagine similar occurrences, the origins of and reasons for which
are complex. I am worried that in a similar situation, perhaps
not in a detention centre but in some other hostel, genuine
grievances and problems may turn into something uglier and
nastier and lead to unacceptable behaviour. However, I would not
want such situations to lead to people being placed on the
streets without legal access to support. I hope that the Minister
will flesh out his intentions by setting out the rules which, if
broken, will lead to people being denied help from the
Government.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Our aim is to prevent destitution rather
than waiting for it to happen. As to amendment No. 738, we have
a clear commitment to establish a proper support system for
asylum seekers and, as the hon. Gentleman will know from our
extensive consultations, we are well on our way to doing so.
There is no intention not to create the sort of scheme envisaged
in the Bill.
<P>
Clause 74 sets out a clear policy on how such a scheme will
operate. It will be further fleshed out in regulations governing
the operation of the scheme, drawing on the various
regulation-making powers contained in this part of the Bill.
There will be a scheme for the support of asylum seekers and were
the Secretary of State to resile from established policy without
good reason, he would clearly be open to challenge.
<P>
There is merit in keeping the powers open and flexible.
Measures such as the Bill may be on the statute book for many
years; we may have to address scenarios which are difficult to
envisage or of which we are completely unaware at present. The
number of asylum seekers has grown tenfold in the past 10 years.
That was not envisaged by the previous Government when they
introduced legislation. We do not know what the situation will
be in the next 10 years. We do not know what we will need to cope
in future, or how we shall do so. I doubt that future Governments
would thank us for tying their hands with a specific duty rather
than giving them a more flexible power, which is the usual way
of dealing with such matters.
<P>
We are committed to ensuring proper support for people,
pending the outcome of their asylum applications. In saying that,
I am aware of the implications of Pepper v. Hart and so on. It
is implicit in our obligations under the 1951 convention. It
would be difficult to circumvent those obligations, as previous
Governments have found.
<P>
However, that is not an entitlement in the formal sense which
is what a duty may imply. Therefore, there is an intention to
pursue that power, but we do not think that it is right to
include that as an obligation in the measure.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke
Newington (Ms Abbott) was anxious that there would be no
provision under the Children Act. However, let me draw her
attention to matters which she and I recently discussed. We
intend to amend clause 99 to ensure that it excludes families
from the Children Act only if adequate support is provided or is
made available under the provisions.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) said,
amendment No. 845 seeks to make the test of destitution an
objective one, rather than one that relies on the Secretary of
State's judgment. That would be unhelpful, making it much harder
to determine whether anyone is really destitute and entitled to
support.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman believes, the amendment could create
certain circumstances in which someone could by judicial review
impose an obligation on the Secretary of State. However, it is
possible that such a test might go the other way, as it could be
argued that, because an objective test would be in place, public
money would be provided when that test could not be fully met.
<P>
That is a dangerous, two-edged weapon if deployed in a way
not entirely to the liking of the hon. Gentleman, or those who
put the suggestion to him. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere said,
ILPA seeks to include such definitions in the Bill. However, the
best protection for asylum seekers is provided by the Secretary
of State making reasonable and proper decisions and by ensuring
that adjudicators form a view on whether the Secretary of State
has behaved reasonably in reaching a judgment on whether someone
is destitute. Such a judgment will obviously have to be reached
on the evidence and on the balance of probabilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Will the Minister clarify his intention to set out
the definition of destitution that will be tested and possibly
appealed against by the adjudicators? Will that definition appear
in the regulations, the rules or elsewhere? It is important for
people to have access to the definition that is used so that they
can decide whether their case merits taking to appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman got into difficulty when he
talked about definitions of essential needs. To avoid going down
that route, we must be wary of the problems that a definition may
bring. We must ensure that a definition is not rigid and we must
certainly not include in the Bill one that would cause
substantial problems.
<P>
It may be appropriate to set out in regulations a number of
tests which may need to be applied by someone who is deciding
whether asylum seekers or their dependants are destitute. Those
regulations would be available to the person making the decision
on behalf of the Home Office and the adjudicator deciding how to
apply such tests and whether they were applied reasonably and
properly.
<P>
So there will be tests, but whether there is to be the
definition sought by ILPA and others is another matter. We are
probably better off with a series of tests than a definition of
the type suggested by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam. He
will see that there is a definition in clause 74(3), in broad
terms at least. We may decide to amplify it by a series of tests,
which are referred to in subsections (5) to (7) and which, in a
sense, would be further developed. They give us more idea about
how tests will be applied. However, much will be covered by
regulations, on which there will have to be consultation. I am
much more reluctant than the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Hallam&#151;and perhaps ILPA&#151;to create a definition that
could too easily bring about more problems than those who want
a definition envisage&#151;and they might be even more
problematic for someone trying to get support for people, in that
a definition could be used to the opposite effect. Clearly, there
needs to be a series of tests to determine whether a person is
destitute. The tests will have to be applied reasonably. If they
are not, the adjudicator will be able to test how decisions have
been made and to correct a failure to reach a reasonable decision
by the Secretary of State. So I do not think that the hon.
Gentleman's worries are well founded.
<P>
Amendment No. 845 attempts to amend the way in which the
decision will be made, but it would make it much harder to
determine whether someone is destitute and entitled to support.
Although the Secretary of State will be able to exercise judgment
as to whether a person appears destitute, his judgment will be
subject to the reasonableness test, which will provide the
safeguards that the hon. Gentleman wants. If the amendment were
accepted and the Secretary of State mistakenly provided support
to a person, the money would have been paid unlawfully. Thus the
Secretary of State would have to make careful checks before
accepting a person for support, and thereby greatly delay the
process. So the hon. Gentleman's attempt to provide an objective
statement might frustrate the Secretary of State's ability to
respond quickly to the need of an asylum seeker rather than tie
down support for my right hon. Friend when needed. If such a
legal obligation needs to be weighed carefully, the requirements
of public funding and of making decisions with all due care might
cause delay in a payment being.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not want that any more
than I do.
<P>
Amendment No. 351 would remove the power of the Secretary of
State to make regulations prescribing the period in which an
asylum seeker or his dependants are likely to become destitute.
We need to take a perspective view of destitution and to
establish a smooth, effective system of support to prevent people
from falling into destitution. If a person turned up in the
United Kingdom with &#163;50 in his pocket, we would probably
say that he was not destitute. We would also say that we
anticipated that he would be within a very short time. We need
to be able to anticipate destitution. The clause enables us to
do so by allowing us to conclude from what a person has on him
whether he is destitute. A person with &#163;50 in his pocket
may soon be destitute, but what about someone who arrives with
&#163;5,000, and who three days later turns up claiming to be
penniless. Would that person be destitute? Who would know what
he had done with the &#163;5,000? An element of judgment has to
be exercised. How do we deal with someone who makes himself
destitute? The clause as drafted gives us a degree of discretion
that must be exercised reasonably with an appeals system, but
which enables us to deal with the variety of circumstances in
which a decision may have to be made. It deals with the person
who turns up with &#163;50 and may shortly become destitute. We
need to anticipate that and put in place support mechanisms to
prevent him from becoming destitute. It also deals with the
person who turns up with &#163;5,000 and deliberately makes
himself destitute in order to access the resources, possibly
having salted the money away somewhere for a rainy day.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> My reading of the clause is that the periods have
to be prescribed. We tried to explore that in our amendment. It
seems that there is a discretion and that the period will have
to be set in a formulaic way in regulations. It might allow for
&#163;X per week, so that if there is so much money, a person
can survive for Y weeks, but that would not give the Secretary
of State the discretion to deal with the person who arrived with
funds which may have disappeared.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to some extent. We
want to deal with the person who is likely to become destitute
within a certain period unless we intervene. We are currently
looking at a period of about 14 days. We need to take a
perspective view so that we can prevent destitution rather than
wait for it to happen.
<P>
Effectively, the power allows the Minister to deal with
threatened destitution within the following 14 days. A prescribed
period introduces the element of a test and some clarity into the
provision which could otherwise encompass those who are likely
to become destitute within the next two years, for example. No
one wants that vague a proposition. Almost anyone, including a
millionaire, could say that he was likely to become destitute in
the next two years.
<P>
We want to consider a period of about 14 days&#151;to look
at a person's circumstances and conclude whether he is likely to
become destitute within that period and then to provide funding
if necessary to prevent that. If he has &#163;5,000, he is
unlikely to become destitute within the next 14 days. The
discretion to deal with a person who spends &#163;5,000 suddenly
flows from the regulations under subsection (2) rather than the
prescribed period under subsection (1).
<P>
I have dealt with quite a few of the points, but let me turn
now to the specific matters raised by the hon. Member for Hallam.
First, he suggested that we should ensure that torture victims
will get on to this sort of scheme. If someone is a torture
victim, the quicker we recognise him as a refugee and give him
full access to benefits and work, the better. If he is able to
and so wishes, he should be allowed to work. Alternatively he
should have access to the full benefits system and the various
rights such as those to housing benefit that ordinary citizens
have.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was concerned that people who damage
property should not be penalised&#151;[Interruption.] He did
not want them put out on the streets. He rightly puts the
difficult case where a person might, for reasons of
protest&#151;Campsfield house was mentioned&#151;or whatever,
decide to damage the premises in which he was accommodated.
Criminal damage to property is a serious business. Where the
police consider it appropriate, people should be prosecuted.
<P>
However in some cases&#151;and here the Secretary of State
should have the relevant power&#151;it may be inappropriate to
allow someone to continue to reside in accommodation for a
prolonged period when he has damaged that property. The damage
may inconvenience not only the other residents, but the owner.
It may also prevent others from getting ready access to the
premises. It is a serious matter. Although the hon. Gentleman
rightly says that he will not push the amendment too far, I refer
him to the requirement on the Secretary of State to be
reasonable. He cannot evict people for committing minor
infractions. That would be unreasonable in the view of the
courts. However, if the infraction is serious&#151;and, perhaps,
if it is persistent&#151;the courts would no doubt conclude that
it was reasonable for the Secretary of State to use his power.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall not press the amendment that the
Minister mentioned. I take a fairly robust view of people who
damage property.
<P>
ILPA and the hon. Member for Hallam asked about
proportionality. The Minister seems to have grasped that point,
but he mentioned the Campsfield case. Is that not a curious
example, because the trial of the people who were alleged to have
committed the damage did not even get as far as a jury? The
prosecution case collapsed. Does that not illustrate the dangers
of proceeding against people without the normal legal safeguards
being in place?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The issue in the Campsfield case was the
identification evidence. The hon. Gentleman and I, as lawyers,
will be aware of the perils of identification evidence. It has
caused enormous difficulties over many years and judges have to
set out certain safeguards when dealing with identification. No
doubt when making a decision to exercise the power, the Secretary
of State and his officials will have to consider whether there
is appropriate identification of the culprits.
<P>
We need to be able to take appropriate action to deal with
those who abuse the help that is provided to them. If they do not
take care of premises or deliberately damage them, I cannot
understand why there should be a duty&#151;that is what the
amendment appears to seek&#151;to continue to support them in
those premises. They will be able to appeal, however, if a
decision is not taken properly. In those circumstances, it is
reasonable that the Secretary of State's power to intervene
should remain in the Bill. I ask the hon. Member for Hertsmere
to consider withdrawing that amendment.
<P>
To recap for my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow, I say
to him that we intend to set up a system that will provide for
asylum seekers. However, we want the discretion to deal with
unanticipated circumstances. That is the normal way to proceed
with a Bill such as this, so I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his
amendment. I hope that, in the light of what I have said,
consideration will also be given to not pressing the other
amendments in the group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that I said that I would not press the
amendments very hard and that they were exploratory amendments.
However, apart from the Minister's comments on the Children Act
1989, I do not think that his remarks have taken us that far
forward. I am not sure that his point about Campsfield assisted
his case, but I shall not pursue that matter because I want to
make progress.
<P>
I was curious before the Minister began his remarks and I am
still curious. The Minister spoke about amendment No. 738, which
was tabled by the hon. Member for Walthamstow. On the one hand,
he said that the Government are committed to providing support
to people who are destitute, but, on the other, he said that he
wants to leave future Governments a free hand to be flexible. The
Minister is leaving all his options open, which does not take
matters much further forward. I am curious because the Government
envisage a situation in which someone may be destitute but there
is no duty to provide support. I am curious, too, about whether
the test to be applied should be a subjective test by the
Secretary of State or an objective test.
<P>
I heard what the Minister said about the Secretary of State
exercising his powers reasonably. ``Clappison on Judicial
Review'' would be a short volume, as I am no expert on the
matter, especially in immigration law. However, I set some store
by the fact that the Immigration Law Practitioners Association
prefers an objective test. I wonder aloud&#151;I surmise; I may
be completely wrong&#151;if it is worried about a case in which,
for example, a Minister gets a decision wrong, but has not acted
unreasonably. He has come to a decision on a question of fact
which is wrong but acted reasonably in coming to that decision.
That would not afford someone grounds of appeal as good as if
there were simply a straightforward question of fact test; if the
Minister got the facts of the case wrong and someone was
destitute when the Minister said he was not, the Minister would
be in the wrong. There is more of a margin in the Minister's
favour by allowing him to apply the ``reasonable'' test. I may
be wrong; if I am the Minister will tell me.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> On that basis, I suspect that judicial review
would not be the right place for such a test, but the appeal to
the adjudicator would be the right place to deal with issues of
fact, in which the Secretary of State was wrong but reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> There it is. ILPA sees something in it.
<P>
I heard what the Minister said about the Children Act and I
hope that in due course I shall be able to welcome the
Government's change of heart on that important matter. I hope
that the Minister will understand why I say that I want to see
the Government's amendment before I rush to welcome it. At
present, only two amendments to clause 99 have been tabled,
neither of which is in the Government's name. I hope that they
will table an amendment to meet some of the widespread anxieties
about the clause, to act as a failsafe and to give asylum
seekers' children the protection that other children have under
the Children Act, and to remove the risk of such children being
taken into care.
<P>
I am not entirely happy with the Minister's earlier answer
about interpretation; it is possible that because of the Bill,
more children will be taken into care. Those are some of the
criteria by which I shall consider the amendment; I hope that in
due course I can welcome the Government's proposal.
<P>
We shall soon consider clause 99 stand part and we shall want
to consider what the Government now propose in the light of that
later clause. I shall not press my amendments to a Division.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response
to amendment No. 738 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow. The Minister preached the virtues of flexibility;
he told us that events can change and he said, in a rather
circuitous argument, that he was not prepared to change the
wording of the clause, as my hon. Friend suggested, to make the
provision of support a right because, in his words, support under
the Bill would not be an entitlement in a formal sense. That is
the problem. The Minister invites us&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> How would my hon. Friend deal with the situation
that I described in which a person had deliberately made himself
destitute but it was known that, a short time ago, he had had
&#163;5,000? In such circumstances, under the amendment, the
Secretary of State would be obliged to provide support. There
would be no option.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Yes, but that problem has to be dealt with in
other parts of the social security system, for example when
people present themselves as unemployed. It is possible to deal
with the problem without the all-embracing terminology:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may provide'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
rather than ``shall'' provide.
<P>
I want to return to the problems that are caused when
provision is not, as the Minister said, an entitlement in a
formal sense. After 12 years as a Member of Parliament, I have
extensive experience of navigating people through the highways
and byways of social security and housing provision, which are
not entitlements in a formal sense.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Where provision is not a formal entitlement, a variety of
problems inevitably arise. First and foremost, decisions about
provision are likely to be taken at a low level. The assumption
is that if people do not have a legal right to provision, why
bother about the quality of decision making? In the last
analysis, a serious legal challenge cannot be mounted.
<P>
The second main problem is where they run out of money for
that type of provision as, for example, with social fund
payments. I have to deal with constituents&#151;month-in,
month-out&#151;who cannot receive social fund money because the
benefit office's budget for that month has run out. It is not an
entitlement in a formal sense, so nothing can be done about it.
<P>
Another problem occurs when the people who are handing out
the provision simply do not understand the circumstances of those
presenting themselves. Again, the social fund is a good example.
I know of a stream of peole from Montserrat, fleeing the volcano,
who were refused social fund support because the officials had
never heard of Montserrat and did not know that its volcano had
exploded. That is another general problem that arises when
provision is at the discretion of officials.
<P>
To summarise, decisions are taken low down in the food chain
because it is known that there is no real legal come-back;
claimants are reliant on the money not running out and on others
having a proper understanding of the issues. Finally, where
provision is not a full entitlement, the person presenting
himself for the provision&#151;be it financial, housing or any
other social service provision&#151;is at the mercy of the
official that he has to face.
<P>
If the Minister&#151;or even that reverential figure, my
right hon. Friend the Home Secretary&#151;were taking the
decisions personally, I would have total confidence in them. My
knowledge of the big-heartedness of the Minister would mean that
I could rest more easily at night; but we are not talking about
the Minister, or about my esteemed colleague, the Home Secretary.
We are talking about rank-and-file Immigration and Nationality
Directorate officials and I have to tell the Minister, with all
due respect to the energy and zeal of those officials, that what
stands between some of my constituents having a standard of
living and housing and not having a standard of living or housing
is the subjective judgment of those rank-and-file
officials&#151;and they do not give rise to confidence.
<P>
The Minister affirmed that this form of support was not an
entitlement in a formal sense as an excuse for not changing the
wording of the clause. I would argue strongly that it is
precisely because it is not an entitlement in the formal sense
that so much doubt and concern has been raised in my mind and on
the part of many organisations dealing with the problem.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I rise to respond briefly to the hon. Member for
Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. I agree that it would be
comforting to know that the provision was an entitlement. The
Government's logic is flawed. They claim that they have every
intention of providing it as though it were an entitlement, so
I see no objection to changing the wording unless the Government
decide on a more generous and helpful scheme in future when this
one is no longer needed. At that point, they would have to amend
the primary legislation.
<P>
I would be quite happy to sit on the Committee considering
a future Immigration and Asylum Bill to remove the Home
Secretary's duty to provide&#151;and I am sure that Government
Members would also be more than happy to come back if there was
a replacement scheme. The only barrier to amending primary
legislation does not appear to me to be especially difficult
given the context of a clear commitment from the Minister that,
for the foreseeable future at least, he will treat the clause's
provisions as though they were an entitlement&#151;therefore why
does he not say so?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke
Newington said that she had no confidence in those whom she
described as being at a low level in the food chain. I am sure
that those of her constituents who have such a job would not
appreciate that description.
<P>
There has to be a system that provides those who make the
decisions with clear guidance in regulations. We must ensure that
they have effective management that will make quality decisions.
I emphasise that not only do we intend the new system to be
properly administered, but we are providing a right of appeal to
an independent adjudicator against a refusal of support. The
matter of who receives the various entitlements is not a
subjective judgment as such: the whole point of having regulatory
powers in the Bill is to introduce a considerable degree of
transparency and predictability into the system, as with the
power in clause 78(2). We want to put in place regulations that
make clear who gets what, and in what circumstances, but we
probably will not opt for the definitions that the hon. Member
for Hallam wants. We will probably arrive at a situation where
constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and
Stoke Newington make decisions about others of her constituents,
but that is the way of the world. We must have a system in which
people make judgments, but allows for proper flexibility so that
there is not the unnecessarily lengthy checking of backgrounds
that operates when Bills are subject to too much regulation. The
proposal will allow proper discretion to be exercised by
officials to deal with the reality of the circumstances faced by
constituents. If we tie down the Secretary of State and the
system too tightly to a set of rules and provisions that reduce
discretion, we shall end up with circumstances in which a long
time is taken to reach decisions which need to be made quickly,
and where greater bureaucracy is involved in a decision that
ought to be made simply and straightforwardly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> We have had an interesting debate, with some
persuasive arguments coming from my hon. Friend the Member for
Hackney, North and Stoke Newington and the hon. Member for
Hallam&#151;and from my hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale
(Mr. Hall).
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister explained his ideas on the need
for flexibility, but, regardless of whether the word ``shall''
or the word ``may'' were in the clause, the regulations would
still allow him considerable flexibility.
<P>
I take his earlier point that he had given a clear commitment
that the Government would provide such a scheme. He mentioned
Pepper v. Hart, a case that matters when commitments are given
in Committee that the Government will adopt a scheme such as is
proposed. In the light of my hon. Friend's commitment, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 739, in page 45,
line 36, after `adequate', insert `and suitable'.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Clause 75, page 46, line 27, after `adequate' insert `and

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> This group of amendments&#151;especially
amendments Nos. 739 and 853&#151;deals with eligibility for
support. I hope that amendment No. 739 in particular will allow
the Minister to clarify what some of the criteria will be. Some
of the debates about the support system and much of what has been
said about it outside the Committee demonstrate that it tends to
be talked about as if it were a right. We have just witnessed an
exchange of views on that.
<P>
Of course, the support system is not a right. There is a
gateway and there are tests for getting into the support system.
Clause 74(3) describes one of those tests. It is important to
remember that a test is involved, as the Government made clear
in the process manual for the support system. In the White Paper,
they said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provision offered as a last resort to those who have no
other means including support from relatives and friends''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The presumption on accommodation&#151;which is important in
relation to the amendment&#151;is that all applicants will
examine alternatives before seeking safety net support and that
many will seek help from their communities.
<P>
That is an interesting assumption, which implies that UK
refugee communities&#151;which are often deprived&#151;will be
regarded as the first port of call for supporting refugees
originating from the same place. That important aspect of the
support system needs to be borne in mind in deciding whether
accommodation or living circumstances are adequate. What does
destitution actually mean? It is not just the refugees seeking
support who need to be considered, but also the communities that
are being asked to support them.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 739 and 853 deal with what is meant by
adequate accommodation and what the term ``suitable'' would add.
Those who deal with homelessness legislation are familiar with
the term ``suitable''. Certainly, local authorities making
judgments about whether someone is homeless are familiar with the
concept and know what property people should be offered as a
result of a homelessness decision.
<P>
In my experience, many local authorities take a strict,
robust view of what is suitable accommodation. There is often a
mechanism for appeal, but there is not a wide open gateway. The
Minister may argue that ``adequate'' is as generous&#151;or more
generous&#151;than ``suitable''.
<P>
Clause 74 excludes certain matters from the Secretary of
State's consideration of eligibility. Those matters include
whether people are sharing accommodation, whether they have the
right to occupy it, whether the accommodation is temporary and
its location.
<P>
Amendment No. 853 deals with the supply of accommodation, on
which the clause imposes restrictions. The Secretary of State may
not take into consideration certain matters in deciding what
accommodation will be provided.
<P>
The Home Office lists the types of accommodation that it
wishes to be available in the document, ``Asylum Seekers
Support''. That list includes hostels providing full board or
self catering, houses with self-catering facilities, ground floor
accommodation and accommodation with disabled access. Therefore,
the document acknowledges that a variety of accommodation may be
required. However, the booklet and the process manual do not make
clear the precise way in which the individual's needs will be
taken into account, apart from the Home Office claim in the
process manual that it will consider such matters. That claim is
not included in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A wide range of factors should be taken into account when
considering whether accommodation is adequate. The Home Office
manual acknowledges that size is not the only factor. Disability
and health are among the issues that should be considered.
Specific health problems, for example, the human immune
deficiency virus, are concentrated in some refugee communities
in London. Being HIV-positive carries with it a range of
attendant difficulties, such as prejudice, lack of support, and
isolation in the community. Many people keep their condition a
secret, even from their families. Such factors can be important
in deciding whether accommodation is adequate or suitable.
Sharing accommodation may be a particular problem for someone who
is HIV-positive. It is difficult to share accommodation and hide
HIV-positive status while on the medication that is now common.
<P>
Amendment No. 853 refers to location of accommodation.
Specific questions should be asked. Are there family or community
ties in the area? Are there faith groups nearby? Is linguistic
support available? Those factors could be important. In a
different capacity, I have considerable involvement with those
who are HIV positive. Treatment and care services tend to be
concentrated in particular places. Even in London, those services
are better in some parts of inner London than in outer London.
Outside London, they are concentrated in the major conurbations.
Someone who was housed outside a conurbation could experience
extreme difficulty in obtaining suitable treatment and care.
<P>
A wide range of issues must be taken into account when
deciding whether someone is in adequate and suitable
accommodation and should pass through the gateway to the support
scheme. The process manual states that some consideration will
be given to such matters, but it is difficult to envisage how
someone would know the factors that were being taken into
account.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes some important
points. Has he studied the evidence of the Terrence Higgins
Trust, which was worried that the scheme that the process manual
describes would not necessarily match accommodation to the needs
of its clients, who are HIV-positive or suffer from AIDS?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I am very familiar with the work of the Terrence
Higgins Trust and have discussed with the organisation its views
on the clause. In our proceedings, I have tried to make points
about location, and access to care and treatment services, which
are important to anyone who has been diagnosed HIV-positive.
<P>
How can we ensure that those factors are taken into account?
The process manual suggests that they will be, but it does not
have status in law. The Minister may be able to reassure us by
saying that such factors will be written into regulations and
that the regulations will make clear what the rules will be.
However, we need to know how people will pass through the gateway
and how it will be judged whether accommodation or the offer of
accommodation is adequate.
<P>
These are important matters. Accommodation is not the only
issue that will give rise to such problems. The scheme is
discretionary and it is seen as a matter of last resort for
people who are destitute. Therefore, we need to be as clear as
we possibly can about how judgments will be made and about what
rights people will have to challenge them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was interested by the hon. Gentleman's
speech. It tied in with the submissions made to the Committeee
by several organisations, including the Terrence Higgins Trust.
I hope that the Minister will deal with the trust's concerns and
give it reassurance. In its evidence to the Committee, it
outlined its key concerns. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Asylum seekers who have HIV or AIDS will be housed in
areas away from essential medical and welfare support and with
no cash. This will result in lack of access to specialist medical
care and may create a risk of increased mortality and wider
heterosexual transmission of HIV.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will have to respond to that serious point.
<P>
The amendments in my name follow the theme outlined by the
hon. Member for Walthamstow. He referred to the clause as the
gateway to receiving support from the asylum support system.
Amendments Nos. 353 and 354 relate to the criteria by which the
Secretary of State decides whether a person is destitute. As the
hon. Gentleman said, one of the criteria of destitution is that
a person does not have adequate accommodation. This morning, we
spent some time discussing essential living needs, which are one
part of the equation. Accommodation is every bit as important.
<P>
When determining whether someone's accommodation is adequate,
the Secretary of State must have regard to matters that the Bill
tells us are ``prescribed''. However, we are not told what they
will be, but that is not entirely a surprise to anyone who has
studied the Bill. However, we have been told what the Secretary
of State may not have regard to. The hon. Member for Walthamstow
speculated as to what ``adequate'' would mean, but that word has
to be considered in conjunction with the matters listed in
paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (6). They outline the matters
that the Secretary of State may not have regard to. Paragraph (b)
states that one such factor is when an asylum seeker
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shares the accommodation, or any part of the
accommodation, with one or more other persons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (5) tells us that the Secretary of State may not
have regard to that fact when he decides whether the
accommodation is adequate. That is worrying.
<P>
Shelter has experience of such matters. In its evidence to
the Committee, it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are extremely concerned about the matters that must
be disregarded as these are indicative of housing need and would
usually be regarded as factors which denote the inadequacy of
accommodation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then develops at some length its concerns about the idea
that shared accommodation is not a factor in determining whether
accommodation is adequate. Shelter says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If an asylum-seeking household is staying temporarily
with friends or others, which causes overcrowding, the person or
family would not be considered destitute.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is as the Bill stands. Shelter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Shelter has been contacted by Environmental Health
Officers who were reporting severe overcrowding in certain
accommodation, particularly, Houses in Multiple Occupation where
asylum seekers are staying for lack of other options.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 A housing advice centre in Bedfordshire has reported the
case of an asylum seeker who sought assistance because he was
sharing with four other people in one bedsit. When the centre
investigated this they found similar living conditions for other
asylum seekers who were renting with a private landlord.''
<P>
Clearly, this is a problem that occurs from time to time.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The question of shared accommodation is
particularly troubling because, as anyone who deals with asylum
seekers knows, they tend not to have the best quality
accommodation, whether in the private or public sector. There is
thus the possibility of serious overcrowding in accommodation
that is not of particularly good quality to begin with. The
effects of that on adults is bad enough, but the effects on
children who might have to share a room or even a bed with adults
is most troubling. My borough, Hackney council, takes a robust
view about what is suitable and adequate accommodation. I have
seen some of the offers made to it under that regime. The mind
boggles as to what kind of accommodation asylum seekers will be
offered if more standards are not put in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Houses in multiple occupation are a serious
issue of public policy. They have been associated with all sorts
of health and safety risks. Governments of all parties have
grappled with the problem of trying to bring them up to standard
through registration, licensing schemes and so on. But as Shelter
points out:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Overcrowding and inadequate facilities for cooking and
washing create dangers to the health and safety of all occupants
not just the applicant.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My concern is that, according to subsection 6(b), the fact
that someone is in an overcrowded house in multiple occupation
seems on the face of it to be something that the Secretary of
State may not take into account. He is forbidden from taking that
into account. Therefore the person is not regarded as having
inadequate accommodation, is not destitute and cannot get an
offer of accommodation under this scheme. According to Shelter's
analysis, he would seem to be constrained to remain within that
overcrowded accommodation. Shelter has raised some serious
concerns here and the Minister must answer them. Overcrowded
accommodation would normally be regarded as indicative of housing
need.
<P>
Amendment No. 863 is on a slightly different point. Clause
76(1) sets out the matter to which the Secretary of State must
have regard in providing accommodation for supported persons. We
note that the two matters specified in the Bill to drive the
provision of accommodation are, first, the fact that
accommodation is to be temporary. We commented on that this
morning, and I do not want to go back over old ground. I may have
slightly underestimated the time that someone may have to spend
in that type of regime. The present waiting time for initial
determination is 17 months, but according to a parliamentary
answer in February, to that must be added the time someone spends
waiting for his appeal, which is another five months. We are
therefore talking of a total period of 22 months. In pointing to
the fact that the accommodation is to be temporary, the
Government are being a little optimistic. I will take it no
further than that.
<P>
The second matter specified in the Bill is much more
material: the desirability of providing accommodation in areas
where there is a ready supply of accommodation. That is the real
driving force in this process. As I have already made clear, we
are not opposed to this in principle, but it will have to be
managed carefully. The Government will have to take into account
the welfare of supported persons and especially their children.
It is noticeable that there is no mention of it in the Bill. The
information document on asylum seeker support mentions it in
general terms, but it is vague on details and makes no specific
mention of children's welfare. The process manual, emphasises
speed in allocating supported persons and their families
accommodation, but does not place a similar emphasis on welfare,
especially the welfare of children.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment explores the question of whether the Secretary
of State should be required to have regard to the welfare of
children in allocating accommodation to ensure that the children
of asylum seekers do not find themselves in accommodation in
which other children would not be expected to live. I shall come
to further points about the driving mechanism in later amendments
when we discuss the relationship between local authorities and
Government. We took important evidence from the Chartered
Institute of Housing about the sort of estates to which asylum
seekers might be allocated as a result of the process. I shall
not go into the matter now, but we shall discuss it later, as it
is important. I look to the Minister now for reassurance that
welfare, especially that of children, will be taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased to be able to speak to the rainbow
coalition of amendments tabled by, among others, the hon. Members
for Hertsmere, for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington and for
Walthamstow and by me. They seek to flesh out what the Government
mean by a standard of accommodation. The hon. Member for
Hertsmere said that once again we are shadow boxing, trying to
find out the detail of Government policy when we have only the
framework of the Bill. We expect much more to be prescribed
later. In a topical reference, I am tempted to refer to it as the
phantom menace of Star Wars I. The policy is something that we
fear may be around the corner; it exists as a phantom menace
because as yet we have no details to decide whether there will
be a problem.
<P>
Amendment No. 846 was tabled to get the Government to clarify
what they mean by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or any means of obtaining it''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in respect of accommodation. We fear that the Government
could, if they choose, use the clause to say that anyone who has
members of his community in the vicinity must seek support from
them. As the hon. Member for Walthamstow said, we know that many
refugee communities in this country live in impoverished
circumstances. The fear about subsection 3(a) is that the
Secretary of State could say, ``You are a Kurd; there is a
Kurdish community nearby. One of the members of the Kurdish
community is related to you, so you have means of obtaining
adequate accommodation and I do not need to provide any for
you.'' The amendment seeks to persuade the Government to flesh
out what they mean by ``any means'' of obtaining suitable
accommodation.
<P>
We need to know the extent to which someone will be forced
to fall back on the resources provided from within his own
community, or the extent to which the Government will say, ``You
have connections here, but we recognise that the accommodation
is not suitable. We will not force you to obtain accommodation
from people in your community.'' There is a test to be
applied&#151;there are more tests in the Bill than in the
national curriculum. The Secretary of State will certainly apply
a test of whether someone could easily obtain some other form of
accommodation. The Minister owes us an explanation of how the
test in subsection 3(a) will be applied.
<P>
The other amendments fall into two groups: those that refer
to what may be prescribed in this clause, and those that refer
to the adequacy of the accommodation to be provided in clause 75.
<P>
Amendment No. 847 would give a clearer definition. Again, we
are trying to push the Secretary of State to put a clear
definition in the Bill rather than leaving catch-all phrases like
``such matters as may be prescribed''. We want a definition of
reasonableness and suitability in the Bill to decide whether
someone should continue to live in the premises in which they
currently reside or have access to accommodation under the
proposed scheme. Those are reasonable and suitable tests to apply
in considering whether current accommodation can continue to be
used.
<P>
Amendment No. 849 would establish, in respect of the location
of accommodation, that its suitability should be taken into
account. The hon. Member for Hertsmere has already referred to
examples from Shelter. I refer, too, to the anxieties expressed
by UNICEF, which referred to the dangers to children; it took us
back to the Children Act 1989, stating that the clause as drafted
may contravene that Act,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which states that a child's welfare should be the
paramount consideration and which instructs the court to have
regard to a child's physical, emotional and educational needs
when reaching a decision which will affect her welfare.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As it affects those children who may be housed under the
scheme, the location of the accommodation is a significant and
material factor that the Home Secretary should take into
consideration when he decides whether someone requires
accommodation under the scheme or whether he already has suitable
accommodation. Material factors, such as whether there is
adequate schooling with appropriate language provision in the
locality, should be taken into account. That should be a
significant factor in deciding whether the current accommodation
is sustainable or whether the Home Secretary should take
responsibility under the scheme. 
<P>
A citizens advice bureau spoke of people taking accommodation
because the current accommodation was clearly unsuitable&#151;

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Before we suspended I was talking about a citizens
advice bureau in the east of England, which reported on asylum
seekers and evacuees who had recently arrived from Sierra Leone.
Several of the families were traumatised: some families had been
separated and evacuees had left under gun fire with young
children. The bureau was concerned that although it had received
some initial advice, there had been no discussion of the
longer-term needs of the asylum seekers.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 847 and 849 would deal with those
circumstances. The issue is whether the evacuees from Sierra
Leone who presented themselves to that citizens advice bureau
would be deemed to merit suitable accommodation where they could
continue to remain or, if housed in temporary accommodation,
whether they would be moved elsewhere. The amendments would deal
with such circumstances, which are not currently covered in the
Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 853 and 855 would deal with the accommodation
that the Secretary of State, having decided on whatever grounds
to take people out of existing accommodation, may provide under
clause 75, to which the amendments refer. Amendment No. 853 would
add ``and suitable'' to the provision of ``adequate''
accommodation&#151;an important addition because unsuitable
accommodation could be provided.
<P>
I know of council properties in Sheffield that can be had
within four hours of turning up at the council
offices&#151;because nobody wants to live in them. We are
concerned that the Bill's provisions to move asylum seekers to
areas of housing surplus might result in moving some of them into
the worst areas where the accommodation is deemed adequate, even
though it is unsuitable. The reason for the four-hour waiting
time in Sheffield is that those areas are devastated and
desolate. Any property placed into a house in one of those areas
would quickly be removed by other residents&#151;a simple fact
of life in parts of my own city and, no doubt, elsewhere too.
<P>
We want to strengthen the test for accommodation by including
a suitability as well as an adequacy test. Suitability should
cover security of the property. We are talking about not moving
into the most desirable areas of a town, but the security factors
that anyone would consider when looking for accommodation, which
should be taken into account for asylum seekers.
<P>
Amendment No. 855 goes even further. It refers to health,
safety, welfare and special needs of claimants and their
dependents. Factors such as community ties and linguistic support
should be considered. Faith needs are important, especially for
those who have fled trauma. The location of a mosque or temple
in an area could be a critical factor in determining whether
accommodation was suitable.
<P>
The long-term resettlement of claimants and their dependents
is especially important. The Government say that they do not wish
to penalise genuine asylum seekers and that they want to deal
quickly with those who have legitimate claims under the 1951
convention. They will presumably be settled in the United
Kingdom. Those individuals should not be taken from their point
of arrival&#151;for example, Heathrow or Dover&#151;to another
part of the country, be allowed to spend a few months working
through the asylum process and trying to cope with new
accommodation, before being granted refugee status and permitted
to move to a more appropriate area. The Home Secretary will not
consider whether an area is appropriate, but asylum seekers will
do that if they are granted refugee status.
<P>
The example of the Vietnamese boat people has been cited on
several occasions. They were dispersed around the country before
they moved to live in clusters in locations that they deemed
appropriate. Amendment No. 855 refers to resettlement, which is
relevant in the light of the Government's aim of processing
claims quickly.
<P>
Kosovars are currently arriving here, and Somalis came into
the country previously. Many Somalis were granted refugee status.
If a Somali enters the country, it is likely that he will be
allowed into the country permanently. Therefore, it is sensible
to accommodate Somalis in an area where resettlement might
eventually occur&#151;a place such as Sheffield, which has an
established host community.
<P>
I hope that, in response to the amendments, the Minister will
explain in detail the test that he will apply. We want to include
more detailed tests in the Bill. We understand the Minister's
reluctance to do that, but I hope that he will flesh out the
tests that he will include in the regulations, even if he is not
prepared to set them out explicitly in the measure, which would
be the best solution.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> It is important to debate what constitutes
adequate accommodation. There is an underlying assumption by the
Government that asylum seekers should initially be accommodated
by their relatives, friends or people from the same district or
village, however overcrowded the accommodation. It is not right,
just or socially equitable to expect the asylum seeker community,
which is among the poorest, to bear the brunt of housing
provision for new asylum seekers. That runs contrary to any
genuine attempt by the Government to meet their responsibilities.
<P>
The sort of accommodation that relatives of asylum seekers
can provide will not be of the best quality. Overcrowding in a
four-bedroom mansion in Hertsmere is one thing, but overcrowding
in a two-bedrrom flat on an estate in Hackney is quite another.
I take the consequences of the kind of overcrowding which the
provisions in the Bill might bring about extremely seriously.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other reason why it is so important to have some
discussion about what would constitute adequate accommodation is
that I am only too well aware of the accommodation that is
currently offered to my constituents by my own borough, through
no fault of its own, because of the pressure on its housing
stock. I am only too aware of the type of accommodation that can
legally be offered to my constituents under the more generous
provisions of existing housing legislation. If the accommodation
offered to asylum seekers falls below the standard of some of the
accommodation routinely offered to British nationals in the east
end of London I shall be very concerned.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King </B>(Bethnal Green and Bow): I support my hon.
Friend on this. I am sure that she, like me, has had detailed
accounts of the accommodation offered in our part of London,
although it may represent some of the worst in the country. It
would be extremely worrying if asylum seekers and their children
were offered accommodation of an even lower standard.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The further point that I want to make about the
adequacy of accommodation is that our debate must be seen in the
context of clause 76 and that is extremely alarming. I know of
no similar clauses in housing legislation to clause 76(1)(b)
which states that the Secretary of State must have regard to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the desirability, in general, of providing accommodation
in areas in which there is a ready supply of accommodation''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or to clause 76(2)(a) which states that the Secretary of
State must not have regard to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any preference that the supported person or his dependants
may have as to the locality''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 76(1)(b) is strange because it talks about a ``ready
supply of accommodation''. What it must mean is a ready supply
of cheap accommodation. There is plenty of accommodation to be
had any day of the week in Belgravia, but not at a cost that the
Minister would find acceptable. If there is pressure to find
cheap accommodation, asylum seekers will be put on estates in
parts of the country where property cannot be let because it is
so run down, isolated and crime ridden. Why should the children
of even that creature of nightmare, the bogus asylum seeker, be
forced to live on estates where on one else will willingly live?
<P>
Clause 76(1)(b) will force asylum seekers on to just those
estates as will clause 76(2)(b), which talks about disregarding
any preference they may have. All the pressure is on placing
asylum seekers in housing which is of too poor quality even to
be offered to the hapless residents of Hackney and Tower Hamlets
and on estates where even the hapless residents of Sheffield do
not wish to live. That is why it is so important that we have a
serious debate about what constitutes adequate accommodation and
whether some sort check and balance could be included in the Bill
against the tendency of clause 76 which will force asylum seekers
into poor-quality, inadequate accommodation.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Much of the debate on this group of amendments
has focused around the same theme of what accommodation asylum
seekers require during the consideration of their
claim&#151;either their present accommodation, if any, or the
accommodation they are to be offered. On the initial point about
what accommodation they have at the outset of their application
for support, in seeking to delete the proposed words, the
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hallam ignores the fact
that although someone may have no accommodation at the time of
his arrival in the country he may well have other means or
contacts to secure some. We would expect him to consider those
first before looking to the arrangements in part VI, which are
to be used if no other accommodation is available.
<P>
Concern has been expressed that asylum seekers are sometimes
located outside London. If someone wants to live in London, he
should be able to look for accommodation there and can choose to
live with relatives, friends or in other accommodation. That
option will be available. If he is not able to accommodate
himself and is likely to be destitute, he can turn to the state
for provision. However, we do not expect other people who can
accommodate themselves temporarily to call upon the state.
Therefore, we should not expect asylum seekers to call upon the
state unless they need to do so. If they do, the state should be
willing and able to provide reasonable accommodation.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 739, 353, 354 and 853 turn on the term
``suitable'', which has a clear place in housing legislation, as
my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow has already pointed
out. For example, it is used to determine the sort of
accommodation that must be provided on the discharge of a
homelessness duty under part VII of the Housing Act 1996.
<P>
Much case law is associated with that Act, but it is
essentially about providing a medium to long-term solution to the
housing problems of people established in this country and who
may have extensive possessions and a settled life style. When we
consider the accommodation needs of asylum seekers, we must
remember that they are likely to be here for only a few months
with that status. They often arrive with few or no possessions
and little concept of how they will cope in this country.
Therefore, their support needs are distinctive.
<P>
Clearly, we need to provide asylum seekers with accommodation
that is ``adequate''&#151;the word is used in the Bill&#151;to
their needs. That will require a certain standard of provision,
including shelter from the elements, facilities for eating and
sleeping, for the proper preparation of food and for personal
hygiene. However, the accommodation should reflect the
circumstances of asylum seekers, which is why we do not need to
import inappropriate definitions from other legislation into the
Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): Saying what will be
provided is a base, but the hon. Member for Hallam referred to
the submissions made by a citizens advice bureau. It said that
the absence of adequate community and other support mechanisms
should be legitimate grounds for an asylum seeker rejecting the
offer of accommodation. I would not use the word ``reject'', but
an offer of accommodation must go beyond simply keeping the
elements out and providing washing facilities.
<P>
I know that it is difficult to find the right words, but the
citizens advice bureau makes a genuine point that matters to an
asylum seeker for the first two or three months. After that, his
circumstances might change and he might have to find
accommodation in a part of the country with which he has no links
at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> May I make it clear that there is no reason why
an asylum seeker's circumstances&#151;to use the hon.
Gentleman's word&#151;cannot be taken into consideration even
if his preferences cannot? That is an important distinction. It
means that the Secretary of State and Home Office officials will
be able to consider an individual's circumstances and a decision
will be taken on how to reasonably and appropriately deal with
them.
<P>
The arrangements for evaluating an asylum seeker's
circumstances and for assessing his needs will be part of the
interview process. We referred to that in the process manual for
the asylum support system, which has already been published. The
details will have to be worked out in due course and various
questions will need to be asked. However, the central basis by
which we shall evaluate such circumstances is set out in the
process manual and in the document ``Asylum Seekers Support'',
which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow
and which has been published. Therefore, information is already
available setting out the principles by which we intend to
proceed.
<P>
Although we have gone over this ground before, it is worth
repeating one point. We do not seek to create a situation in
which permanent accommodation is provided. We shall use a
different test to consider what is suitable temporary
accommodation for someone while his case, and possibly an appeal,
are being considered. Our intention is that, in the vast majority
of cases, a decision will be made within two months. If there is
an appeal, it will be made within six months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Will the Minister clarify the distinction between
the terms ``adequate'' and ``suitable''? Will he make it clear
that the test for ``adequate'' accommodation will be lower than
that for ``suitable'' accommodation, as understood under the
homelessness rules, and that asylum seekers might be put in a
lower standard of accommodation than those housed under the
homelessness rules?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and
Stoke Newington referred to her concerns about the accommodation
into which some homeless people are put. Our objective is to
create conditions under which people provide suitable and
adequate accommodation that is of such a level that the Home
Office is prepared to enter into contracts to have people
accommodated in it.
<P>
The circumstances of local authorities are often very
different. I know from the experience of my local authority that
it often faces difficulties in finding the resources to do up a
property. We expect a property to be in a proper state before it
is let and we want to ensure that it is adequate for the needs
of the person who will be accommodated in it. The distinction
between ``adequate'' and ``suitable'' is that the test is
different, but not lower. It is different in that the term
``suitable'' has been imported&#151;I think
inappropriately&#151;from entirely different legislation aimed
at securing permanent accommodation for homeless people. We want
to provide adequate temporary accommodation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam is seeking to introduce two
definitions that would mean that the Government's obligations
would be to secure accommodation for asylum seekers of a higher
standard than they are obliged to provide for his homeless
constituents. The test is different. The term ``suitable'' is
used for someone seeking permanent accommodation under the
homelessness legislation; an ``adequate'' level of accommodation
will be available to someone seeking temporary accommodation
while his case is being considered.
<P>
How will the needs of an individual be taken into account?
As with the homelessness legislation, it is a matter of balancing
the needs of an individual with the supply of accommodation
available. The standards of accommodation in London that are
provided under the homelessness legislation tend to be lower than
elsewhere. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke
Newington said that if accommodation available to asylum seekers
is to fall below the level of that available in east London, she
will be very concerned. One of the main reasons for moving people
out of London is to secure better accommodation for them and to
relieve the pressures on London and on the people who live in the
area, including my hon. Friend's constituents. The result of our
approach is that accommodation in the provinces will be more
plentiful than local authorities in London can provide. We want
to ensure that the standard of accommodation is at least adequate
for the needs of asylum seekers. In the same way, the type of
accommodation used for asylum seekers will reflect what is
available, and will be matched to their needs as far as possible,
bearing in mind that, typically, they are being accommodated for
only a few months.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is a key factor that we must be aware of as we assess
how the system develops. We must remember that the vast majority
of asylum seekers are young, single and male, and that it is
perfectly reasonable to expect many of them to share
accommodation, perhaps in hostels. Genuine asylum seekers fleeing
persecution would rarely object to that. Asylum seekers,
irrespective of whether they have dependants, cannot expect
entitlement to their own self-contained accommodation of a
standard higher than is available to the constituents of the hon.
Member for Hallam. I should be reluctant to participate in
creating law which obliged the Secretary of State to provide it.
<P>
Other points were raised, one of which centred on the way in
which we take account of the needs of individual asylum seekers,
which we will have to assess.
<P>
The hon. Member for Walthamstow rightly raised the issue of
people who have HIV. We shall consider how to cope with the
special range of needs of various groups, including people with
HIV, but it is easy to overstate the need for specialist help.
We need to be able to provide decent adequate accommodation in
locations where there is access to proper medical facilities. For
all sorts of reasons, HIV is treated not only in London but
throughout the provinces, and people living in many parts of the
country need access to good quality HIV treatment. We will
provide it, elsewhere than in London. We shall discuss with the
Department of Health and others how best to ensure that we meet
the needs of people who suffer from HIV and who have other
medical needs. The full process manual, when finally published,
will indicate how we propose to do that, and we shall consult
before it becomes part of the rules.
<P>
Other issues, including sharing of accommodation, were
raised. The scheme under part VI of the Bill is for short-term
accommodation, where an asylum seeker has managed to find
temporary shared accommodation and is not destitute, and it is
needed for only a few months. That must be borne in mind. Trying
to import the general argument about overcrowding into a
discussion about simple, short-term accommodation is not a
reasonable way to proceed. Sharing is not the same as
overcrowding. Many people share, and some do so through
choice&#151;perhaps with relatives or in other circumstances.
We do not regard seriously overcrowded accommodation as being in
any way adequate. The word ``adequate'' deals with the worry of
the hon. Member for Hallam about overcrowding. We are not saying
that overcrowded accommodation is adequate because, clearly, it
is not. What may be adequate is shared
accommodation&#151;perhaps a hostel or other place. Equally, we
would not wish to define overcrowding by reference to a bedroom
standard, as in the Housing Act 1985.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister said that the overcrowding aspect
would be relevant when he had to decide whether accommodation was
adequate, but, under clause 74(5)(b), he may not have regard to
criteria mentioned in subsection (6), one of which is that a
person shares accommodation or any part of it with one or more
other persons. That totally contradicts what the Minister just
said.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It does not contradict what the Minister just
said for precisely the reason that I gave&#151;that the word
``adequate'' provides a clear safeguard here. The word
``adequate'' means that the accommodation must be adequate.
Serious overcrowding would mean that the accommodation is
inadequate. The fact that sharing cannot be taken into
consideration does not mean that overcrowding cannot. Sharing is
not the same as overcrowding&#151;a basic understanding of the
English language. Some people who are sharing may not be
overcrowded, while others may be living in overcrowded
accommodation.
<P>
We have made it clear that we do not want someone to be able
to require self-contained accommodation and that the Minister
should not regard the fact that someone is sharing as a valid
reason for concluding that the accommodation is inadequate.
However, overcrowding is a different matter and it could be taken
into consideration when deciding about appropriate accommodation
for an asylum seeker. We are not contributing to other long-term
problems such as overcrowding, but trying to ensure that the mere
fact that someone is sharing accommodation is not of itself
enough to oblige the Minister to put them into self-contained
accommodation.
<P>
I should like to move on to other points. My hon. Friend the
Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington was concerned that
the asylum-seeking community was poor and that many would be
unable to turn to it. We have found in practice the
asylum-seeking community can be well able to accommodate other
people and may even wish to do so. Many asylum seekers coming to
this country do not seek state-provided accommodation but would
rather live with relatives or friends living here. If that sort
of accommodation is available, the person seeking accommodation
should give first consideration to it and not rely on the state.
<P>
That is a perfectly reasonable view and we are not seeking
to put upon those who are unable to accommodate others. If the
asylum-seeking community is clearly unable to accommodate an
individual, the state will need to step in and provide adequate
accommodation. We must be careful, however, not to apply tests
of suitability that are not applied to our own constituents.
<P>
All possible varieties of needs seem to have been lifted by
the hon. Member for Hallam in terms of what should be considered
in the allocation of accommodation. Many of those needs represent
circumstances that we will be able to take into consideration.
He mentioned the proximity of an appropriate mosque&#151;no
doubt of an appropriate tradition. That might be important to an
individual, but we cannot proceed on the basis of a long check
list that would enable any asylum seeker to say, ``You have not
attempted to provide me with No. 37 on the check list and there
is nothing on that list that accords with the accommodation that
I need.''
<P>
We cannot approach the matter in that way. We are talking
about providing temporary accommodation for people seeking
temporary protection here. We can provide such people with
refuge, shelter and food, but we are not in the business of
providing them with the most desirable made-to-measure
accommodation. The wish of the hon. Member for Hallam to include
a series of tests in the Bill would entail the problems that I
have already identified. Everything would be subject to judicial
review. The state would have to be far more careful about
decisions to offer accommodation and take much greater care in
its analysis of circumstances. That would take longer, which
would not be an advantage to an asylum seeker. It could be a
recipe for complete chaos. If each test was open to judicial
review, we would leave ourselves open to difficulties.
<P>
However, I want to reassure the hon. Gentleman who makes a
serious point. He over-emphasises it, but it is, non the less,
serious. When we accommodate people, we should ensure that we
take account of the circumstances that affect them, such as their
religious and accommodation needs, as well as the need for
support from their communities and the need to be located in
clusters. As the hon. Gentleman knows from reading the documents
that we have already published, we are determined to operate a
cluster policy. However, we shall not tie ourselves down by
setting out tightly drawn rules in the Bill and applying them
rigidly.
<P>
Amendment No. 354 would allow the Secretary of State to take
account of asylum seekers' preferences for the location of
accommodation. The Bill will not take account of such individual
preferences. The test in homelessness legislation of reasonable
and suitable accommodation that is suitable for long-term tenants
is not appropriate for asylum seekers.
<P>
It is not necessary to include in the Bill all the matters
that amendments Nos. 849 and 855 mention. In determining whether
accommodation is adequate, the asylum support directorate will
take into account the safety and special needs of asylum seekers.
We hope that we shall develop good working relationships with
local authorities and other agencies, which will help us to
satisfy ourselves about such matters. A key requirement of our
dispersal policy is that those who are recognised as refugees or
granted exceptional leave to remain should want and be able to
stay in the area to which they have been dispersed.
<P>
We do not want to locate asylum seekers on some sink estate
in an out-of-the-way place. That would be counterproductive and
would not fit our long-term aim of ensuring that those who are
granted refugee status&#151;approximately 17 per cent.&#151;can
stay in the area to which they have been dispersed so that
communities can develop there. That would be beneficial. We do
not support secondary migration, especially back to London and
the south-east. Asylum seekers whose applications are successful
should feel sufficiently secure to wish to remain in the area to
which they have been dispersed.
<P>
The criteria for choice of areas is that asylum seekers
should be safe and that support is appropriate and adequate. We
do not want to increase social exclusion through insensitive
placement in the wrong sort of area. That would be counter to our
policies for asylum seekers who are granted refugee status, and
to our policy of tackling social exclusion.
<P>
I do not believe that it is necessary to impose the stringent
test that amendment No. 863 proposes. It states that, in
providing accommodation, the Secretary of State should take
account of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the welfare of any child dependent on the asylum
seeker.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The new asylum support directorate will acquire accommodation
and ensure that it is adequate for its purpose. We will acquire
family accommodation for various size families. The Bill already
requires that the accommodation should be adequate for a
short-term, basic safety-net support system. We think that that
is sufficient. The whole issue about the welfare of children
turns again on the definition of the word ``adequate''. Clearly
accommodation that would be harmful to children would not be
adequate.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam also asked how the subsection
(3)(a) test would be applied. That is set out in the process
manual. We would expect asylum seekers to look to their own
community, as I have already said, and to see what help is
available to them. Our arrangements are in effect not quite a
last resort but are there only if they are genuinely needed.
<P>
It is right that the Bill is only a framework. We shall build
on it in providing the details of the regulations. The place for
the detail is in the subordinate legislation where it can be
modified in the light of experience. The subordinate legislation
is subject to parliamentary scrutiny through the negative
process. We have put important issues of principle in the Bill
as in clause 74(6). Clause 76(6)(d) does not prevent the
Secretary of State from taking into account the particular needs
of children, only location is excluded.
<P>
There was a reference to the Vietnamese boat people. In our
view their experience is not relevant because they were very
widely dispersed. We do not propose to disperse in that rather
scattered way. Our objective is to cluster. Recent research,
particularly by Oxford Brookes university, suggests that asylum
seekers are often content to remain in the area in which they are
first placed provided that there is proper support and
assistance.
<P>
Our aim is therefore to ensure that asylum seekers are
clustered in areas where there is sufficient support for their
children and the opportunity of adequate long-term accommodation.
We will locate them there in temporary accommodation while their
case is being considered. If they are granted asylum status, they
will be able to accommodate themselves in proper long-term
accommodation. If they are not granted asylum status they will
be removed from the UK. That is the approach we will take.
Obviously, various compassionate and human rights circumstances
will be taken into account.

<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): The asylum seekers support
document says that the accommodation provided must be up to
certain standards. Will there be a baseline to the accommodation
provided? That would surely alleviate the concerns of some of my
hon. Friends about the accommodation that the providers would
deliver. I find it hard to see the hon. Member for Hertsmere
being concerned about overcrowding and the poor type of housing
currently available when in my constituency there was 18 years
of poor housing and overcrowding which has&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is too long for an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. Is it
not a fact that there is not a single constituency in the country
in which housing got worse over the past 18 years?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That has nothing to do with the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for
Harwich (Mr. Henderson). My hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow already indicated that we have set out in the
document the sort of accommodation that we are looking at. We
certainly will not engage in contracts with providers who do not
provide adequate accommodation. Hon. Members can be reassured
that we will provide regulations and set out the sort of
accommodation in which we will expect asylum seekers to live. It
will be of a temporary nature but it will be entirely adequate
to their needs.
<P>
Finally, Government amendment No. 756 is a drafting
amendment, which I ask the Committee to support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have had another important and useful
debate. I do not oppose the policy in principle but I must tell
the Minister that I am increasingly concerned by its details and
workability. I may be able to help the Minister with a suggestion
as to how to move forward, but he has posed more questions about
the policy than I was previously aware of.
<P>
On the issue of time, the Minister will correct me if I am
wrong but I understand that there are currently 17 months to an
initial determination followed by another five months to
appeal&#151;a total of 22 months, or nearly two years. That is
my mathematics, but the Minister looks puzzled. Seventeen and
five make 22, but the Minister may have another answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Anything is possible under new Labour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Well, there we are. Let us say for the sake
of argument that the Government hit their targets and the
six-month maximum is achieved. When it comes to the adequacy of
accommodation, if some asylum seekers&#151;particularly those
with children&#151;have to live for six weeks or even six days
in the sort of conditions that I described, it would be far too
long. I mean the sort of accommodation that was referred to by
Shelter in its submission. The Minister will not get himself off
the hook on that matter.
<P>
I broadly share the Minister's view that a more robust
attitude can be justified towards young, single and male
individuals than to others. Yet on that very point, the ILPA said
in its submission:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``These prohibitions are unmitigated by any allowance for
the particular circumstances of a case. So the Secretary of State
is apparently forbidden even to consider the appropriateness of
a vulnerable young person sharing accommodation with older
adults, or with those of the opposite sex.''&#151;[Official
Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 243.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some asylum seekers are likely to have greater cultural
sensitivity about sharing accommodation than is generally the
case in British society today.
<P>
Even if most asylum seekers are young, single and male there
will still be single mothers or others looking after young
children or babies. As the Bill stands, their sharing of
accommodation cannot be taken into account.
<P>
Not for the first time while listening to the Minister's
speech, I noticed a divergence between what he was telling us
that the Government wanted to achieve and what is contained in
the Bill. Our concern is less with the accommodation to which
people are going than with the accommodation from which they are
coming. Will that be regarded as adequate for the purpose of
deciding whether the Government are going to provide
accommodation under this scheme? The accommodation that they are
coming from is the problem.
<P>
Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In determining, for the purposes of this section, whether
a person's accommodation is adequate, the Secretary of State .
. . may not have regard to any of the matters mentioned in
subsection (6).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of those matters, under paragraph (b), is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the fact that he shares the accommodation, or any part of
the accommodation, with one or more other persons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So the Secretary of State&#151;or, effectively, the
immigration officer responsible&#151;is forbidden to take that
into account.
<P>
In response to a question about overcrowding, the Minister
introduced for the first time a distinction between sharing and
overcrowding. That distinction certainly escaped Shelter when it
prepared its submission. Its evidence focused on shared
accommodation. It mentioned a case in Bedfordshire in which four
people were sharing one bedsit.
<P>
The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I believe that
the Minister's comment was the first time that the distinction
between sharing and overcrowding was introduced. I am unaware
that it appears in the process manual, the asylum support
information document or indeed any other document. I shall have
to take the idea away for further reflection, but I am not
convinced that it deals with the problem. As drafted, the Bill
does not allow sharing to be taken into account as a factor
determining adequacy. The Government are tying themselves too
tightly with this proposal. I suggest a way of finding common
ground and getting round the problem&#151;the Minister looks
perplexed, but many of those who commented think that it is a
problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> May I make my suggestion before the Minister
intervenes? Would not one way to deal with the matter be to
substitute the word ``need'' for ``may'', so that the Secretary
of State does not have to take it into account but may if he
wishes to do so. That would allow him to discriminate between
cases as the Minister said, because in the Bill as drafted, the
Secretary of State may not take into account the fact that
accommodation is shared. A simple amendment like that might leave
some people displeased, because they will say that such facts
should always be taken into account, but at least it would
introduce some flexibility and the Government would not be tying
themselves so tightly. I make that suggestion to be helpful; I
hope that the Minister is not too hung up on a particular form
of words and will give a constructive response.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not prepared to accept the hon. Gentleman's
amendment. I was perplexed because he thought that there was a
serious difficulty. The distinction between overcrowding and
sharing is plain as a pikestaff and I cannot understand why he
finds it puzzling that we should make such a distinction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> What may appear as shared accommodation to one
person is overcrowded accommodation to someone else. Shelter
envisaged problems as a result of the provision; the Minister
could get himself off the hook if he were prepared to show a
little flexibility. At present, there appears to be no movement,
and experts in housing, such as Shelter and others, who have
looked at the matter express anxieties about shared
accommodation. Will the Minister make a concession? I hope that
I am not asking for too much, as I am trying to be helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman accept that Buckingham
Palace is shared accommodation, but it is not overcrowded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is getting into the realms of
fantasy. He should read the Shelter submission carefully, because
there are people who will say that their accommodation is not
adequate because it is shared with others. They will be told,
``Sorry, we cannot take that into account because we are
statutorily forbidden to do so.'' The Minister may find that
amusing, but those with shared, overcrowded accommodation would
not. I do not want to be too discordant, but I do not find it a
funny subject. Houses in multiple occupation are not a laughing
matter as they can be a health hazard. Both political parties
have grappled with difficulties to try to resolve the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If the Minister wants to make a flippant
remark I shall not give way, but if he wants to agree to
compromise, to give a concession or to think about the evidence
that we received, I shall happily give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am asking the hon. Gentleman to give way
because he put on the record that I was amused by a comment that
he made. I was not amused by shared accommodation and
overcrowding, which are serious matters and it was wrong of him
to suggest that I was. I take those issues seriously. I was,
however, amused by the hon. Gentleman's wriggling on the hook of
definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That takes us no further. I want to think
about the matter as some important points have been raised. We
are discussing a serious subject and I may want to consult those
who have given evidence to the Committee. I may wish to return
to the issue later because, as I said in my opening remarks, I
am trying to be helpful and to find common ground on this serious
subject.
