<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/036/1999036.htm">Employment Relations Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce  </B>(South Dorset): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I wonder whether you, or the Committee, has yet been given a copy of draft regulations on the matters covered by the Bill.
<P>
Many members, on both sides of the Committee, were members of the Committee that considered the National Minimum Wage Bill, which also relied on much regulation. That Committee was given many assurances by Ministers that we would have the regulations in good time, that we would be consulted on them, and that people would be able to see them. I have today been called to sit on the Committee that will consider those minimum wage regulations. I have them here, Mr. Atkinson, and I am sure that you can see that they are about half an inch thick. They are to be debated on 3 March and will come into force on 1 April, less than a month afterwards. Is that how Parliament is to be dealt with?
<P>
Before we go any further with this Bill, should we not have a copy of the regulations?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that that is not a matter for the Chair. The documents produced for a Committee are the responsibility of the Government. No doubt the Minister has heard the hon. Gentleman's comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I seek your guidance. Although, in the light of what the Minister of State so helpfully said the other day, I am less worried about the likely timetable for consultation on the regulations, I am concerned to discover whether we shall see the regulations soon, or get a hint of them.
<P>
I wonder whether you have been given any indication by the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, whom we are delighted to see in his place, that he intends to say anything about those matters during our proceedings on the Bill?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Again, that is not a matter for the Chair.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Leave for Family and Domestic Reasons</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [23 February]: No. 60, in page 51, line 5, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.&#151;[Mr. Chidgey.]
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 61, in page 51, line 14, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
No. 62, in page 1, line 21, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
No. 63, in page 51 line 22, leave out first `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
No. 65, in page 51, line 23, at end insert&#151;
<P>
`, such consent not being unreasonably withheld.'.
<P>
No. 64, in page 51, line 24, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
No. 41, in page 51, leave out lines 25 to 27.
<P>
No. 42,in page 51, line 30, after first `leave', insert `(excluding additional maternity leave)'.
<P>
I call the Minister of State.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. May I tell the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) that the regulations make excellent reading; they are not half as thick as some of the questions that he asks me.
<P>
I fulfilled the commitments and promises that I gave to the Committee when it was considering the National Minimum Wage Bill, including, when I thought it appropriate, calling in the lead spokespersons from the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties to consider amendments to the Bill. I made no promises to that Committee that I have not fulfilled. I look forwrd to debating the regulations in Committee with the hon. Member for South Dorset.
<P>
The amendments have, I believe, been tabled for two reasons&#151;first, to ensure that I give as much explanation as I can; and , secondly, in respect of the decisions that may be taken during or after a pregnancy if maternity leave has been taken.
<P>
I hope to be able, not in a leisurely way, to give the Committee some helpful information, after which I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment No. 60 was moved by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey). I wish to reassure the hon. Gentleman that dismissal, including selection for redundancy, for reasons connected with parental leave will automatically be unfair under the Bill. However, we recognise that clarification may be required in relation to redundancies or dismissals that occur during a period of parental leave, but that are not connected to parental leave.
<P>
Provided that they act fairly, employers will be free to dismiss employees, for example for reasons of misconduct, or because they are redundant, while they are on parental leave, just as they would be free to do so in appropriate circumstances at any other time. We shall make that clear in the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall go against my better judgment and sit down for a few moments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister has, rightly, said that those matters will be made clear in the regulations, but will he assure us that we shall have proper sight of them? More important, will the poor employers and employees see them in good time, so that they will know what they are supposed to do?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is becoming tedious. How can I provide draft regulations when the Bill has not yet passed through the House? The House has a responsibility to pass the Bill; the regulations will then be drafted in the context of the Bill. From the beginning of our proceedings in Committee, I have gone out of my way to set out my intended time scale and processes. If he does not interrupt me too many times, later today I shall move amendments to ensure that those matters are dealt with through positive, rather than negative, resolution. I am meeting all hon. Members' anxieties to ensure that the process of developing the regulations will be open and transparent, involving social partners and hon. Members. All comments made in Committee will form part of that consultation process. The Government will produce the regulations so as to allow ample opportunity for consideration and a preparation period in which to implement them.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): As the proposer of most of the amendments, I should like to ask a question, although I do not do so provocatively. One of our root anxieties relates to the idea that the regulations may contain a list&#151;and, by definition, may not. We are worried that the Secretary of State may over time introduce additional regulations. Will the Minister assure us that the regulations will be complete and will not be expected to change over time, which would confuse employers? That is the crux of the issue. We need a watertight set of principles to which employers can safely work.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman has put up an Aunt Sally, only to knock it down. It is silly beyond belief to suggest that we would produce a confusing regulatory regime that does not comply with the Bill. He makes heavy weather of the matter. If all parties in the House agree about the benefits of parental and maternity leave, we have a common purpose in our job of proceeding with the Bill and establishing a regulatory regime that will empower the principles set out in it. When discussing the first group of amendments, I stressed that we shall make that clear in relation to redundancies and dismissals&#151;not we may, we shall. That is five times that I have told him in the past five minutes. I hope that it has sunk in.
<P>
In front of me is a phrase that now seems silly to read, after what I have said. Nevertheless, as my brief says, I am aware of the anxiety of the hon. Member for Eastleigh that the regulations should provide the option for parental leave to be taken on a part-time basis over a period of time, and that such an arrangement should be workable and beneficial to both employers and employees. We have already agreed that the Government would like the parental leave scheme to be flexible enough to meet the needs of individuals and their employers. We shall encourage such an approach through the code of practice on part-time work, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will issue under the powers in clause 19. Should the hon. Member for Eastleigh want to return to that when we discuss clause 19, he will have an opportunity to do so.
<P>
We need to consult on whether the benefits of providing for parental leave to be taken on a part-time basis in a statutory scheme outweigh the complexity, given the opportunity to reach a different agreement in the workplace. We are clear that, whatever the statutory arrangements, employers and employees will be able to agree on more flexible arrangements such as part-time working through collective or work-force agreements.
<P>
We are agreed that business needs must be balanced against the needs of the employee. The consultation process on the draft regulations will ensure as much consensus as possible on how to achieve that.
<P>
I appreciate what is behind amendment No. 41, but I shall explain why the Bill contains the provision that would be removed if it were accepted. The parental leave directive states that, to promote equal opportunities, the parental leave entitlement should, in principle, be granted on a non-transferable basis. The Government fully endorse that approach. If we provided for leave to be transferred at will, it would be likely that women would take it, but that men would not.
<P>
We want to encourage equal opportunities and a culture in the workplace in which it is normal and acceptable for men to take leave to care for their children. We have included the provision because under the parental leave directive, it is clearly envisaged that that is right in exceptional circumstances; otherwise it would simply have been banned.
<P>
I am not sure what would happen if one parent were chronically sick and could not take advantage of parental leave, or whether the ability to transfer entitlement would be in the best interests of children with disabilities. However, under the provision, we can consult on whether certain cases merit its use. Therefore, social partners will have an opportunity during the consultation process to tell the Government whether they think it worthwhile to introduce such a measure.
<P>
If I were to agree with the hon. Member for Eastleigh neither I nor the social partners would have such an opportunity. If, during our extensive consultation on the draft regulations, we were told of an especially hard case where, in limited circumstances, it was plainly right for the leave entitlement to be transferred, we could do nothing about it under the amendment. That door would have been shut.
<P>
I suggest, in a spirit of conciliation, that we must consult on such matters to ensure that we can improve the lot of someone who is in especially difficult circumstances. Therefore, amendment No. 41 should not be accepted.
<P>
I cannot accept amendment No. 42, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). It would affect women who wanted to add their parental leave entitlement to the end of the longer period of additional maternity leave, giving them a total of about nine months at home after the birth. It would mean that they had no right to return to their jobs.
<P>
I believe that the amendment is misconceived, but I understand the reason why it was tabled. I realise that the hon. Gentleman is probing. He should not take what I say as a personal criticism. The assumption in the amendment is that employers would prefer women to take their leave later rather than sooner. I am not sure that generalisation can be justified. Some employers would prefer all the leave to be taken in one go, so that they can hire a single replacement for the whole period. In practice, employers are likely to have made arrangements to cope with a six month absence, and they can often cover for an additional three months if necessary.
<P>
There is a misunderstanding about what women are likely to do. In practice, most women will not choose to take parental leave directly after additional maternity leave. The amendment would breach the requirements of the parental leave directive that safeguard employees' jobs. I hope that I have convinced the Committee of my and the Government's good intentions and that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Who could ever doubt the Minister's good intentions? It would be churlish to suggest such a thing. I welcome the Minister's comments and his commitment to hold further consultations on the regulations. For those reasons, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 51, line 31, leave out from `76' to end of line 49 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall&#151;
<P>
(a) make provision about notices to be given and evidence to be produced by employees to employers, by employers to employees, and by employers to other employers;
<P>
(b) make provision for different cases or circumstances, which may include special provision (which shall not amount to an exemption) for circumstances where work is of a seasonal nature, where a replacement cannot be found within the notice period, where a significant proportion of the work force applies for parental leave at the same time, or where a specific function is of huge importance.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 43, in page 51, line 35, at end insert

<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I welcome the Minister's statement and the Government's good intentions. We also have good intentions.
<P>
The amendments are intended to bring firmly to the Minister's attention the difficulties that implementing parental leave will cause small firms. He said this afternoon, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh in our sitting last Tuesday, that he is prepared to address such problems. I am sure that the Minister will have seen and taken to heart the responses to the White Paper, but I should like to refresh his memory on a few points, on parental leave. The Institute of Directors claimed that the impact on small firms ``could be devastating''. One of its members said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an unpaid leave right creates great management problems as it is totally unpredictable and adds great additional costs''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members support the concept of the measure, but we believe that the detail should be addressed. The DTI's assessment estimates the cost of arranging cover for a full-time male worker over a period of leave at &#163;934.96, a figure that is nicely tucked away in a series of calculations that create an average figure of &#163;140. That figure disguises the fact that an employer with one full-time male worker who goes on leave will have to bear a cost of nearly &#163;1,000. As I am sure the Minister will agree, that is quite a burden in terms of a small company's turnover.
<P>
I support the concept of parental leave and I do not accept that anyone should be obliged to waive or lose their employment rights simply by virtue of the nature of his employer. I have taken care to ensure that the amendment cannot be construed as permitting exemptions. However, it is necessary&#151;I think that this is the Minister's intention&#151;to arrive at a reasonable pay-off between the legitimate needs of the employer and those of the employee. I am concerned that the Bill does not do enough to protect the needs of employers&#151;especially those with small firms&#151;in regard to parental leave.
<P>
Many of those who responded to the White Paper felt the same. Even the TUC said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the flexibility built in to the Directive will protect small employers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am concerned that the flexibility in the directive has not been adequately inserted into the legislation. The explanatory notes refer to proposed new subsection 76(5), which covers several eventualities, in that connection; however, I am not convinced that that subsection, which sets out specific axes by which parental leave can be changed, will leave the Secretary of State enough options to deal with the unforeseen eventualities that are likely to arise. It would be preferable if the Secretary of State were, as a minimum, obliged to implement a period of notice before parental leave is taken.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh has discussed the need for such provision; I agree with his arguments and shall not repeat them in detail. Proposed new subsection (a) of my amendment would make it compulsory for the Secretary of State to specify the period of notice that an employee is to give an employer, thereby making obligatory a measure that is optional under the Bill. That is a minimum requirement to which employers should be entitled, to aid them in their planning. To use an example from my constituency of Weston-super-Mare, where a problem may well arise in relation to seasonal work, I will speak about ice cream sales representatives. It would be unreasonable for employees in that business to take leave out of the blue during the peak months of June to August. I am sure that Committee members can think of other examples that would affect their areas or business generally.
<P>
Amendment No. 50 is purely technical, and seeks to reinstate the measure's original wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): I seek clarification. There seems to be a suggestion that employees in the holiday industry should not commit themselves to having babies in summer. Is that the intention behind the hon. Gentleman's comments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I was using that as an example of parental leave that might be taken in my constituency.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will, as he suggested, take note of our concerns. Having some form of notice is especially relevant to small firms. I hope that the Secretary of State will consider such matters in making his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): It is a pleasure to see many Government Back Benchers in Committee. Lessons may have been learnt: it is most important that those Back Benchers contribute to the debate, should they wish to. Perhaps they are being kept here as a penance, in which case, I shall not prolong their discomfort.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify that point? Is penance paid when he is speaking or when I am on my feet?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is perhaps for history to judge: it will depend very much on the Minister's response.
<P>
We are having an interesting, complex debate on the regulations. Provided that we are not unduly discursive, I hope that we will be able to sum up the main points in a schedule stand part debate. I do not appear to have outstayed my welcome, and I will not do so.
<P>
Inevitably, the draftsman's skills, the timing of amendments and how they interlink, puts us in the position of north African armies in the desert war, when different units were brigaded alongside one another. I hope that hon. Members will not be offended, as I am thinking of the German and Italian troops who fought together on the axis side. The grouping of Conservative and Liberal Democrat amendments suggests a similar arrangement.
<P>
In the interests of good will, Conservative Members accept the points made by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter). Furthermore, a most interesting exchange took place when the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) momentarily confused the parental issue with the maternity issue. It is an easy, but revealing, mistake to make.
<P>
We are anxious that effects on business should be confined to the minimum. It is inevitable that rights will be claimed. As the hon. Member for Croydon, Central rightly said, people do not necessarily plan the moment of giving birth. However, creating a situation which leads to difficulties for employers when doing so is not strictly necessary, is another matter altogether. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind in framing the regulations.
<P>
We have tabled two amendments, each of which has a different meaning. Amendment No. 43 addresses the need for practical record-keeping. We debated that earlier in relation to records that would be required when paternity leave was taken. We discussed what would happen when employees transferred between employers and during periods of overlapping employment at any one time. That is important, as employers often make clear to us in their representations. The Secretary of State himself made great play of the fact earlier today that he was going to save &#163;200 million by simplifying the reporting requirements of the minimum wage regulations. That is a welcome change, but he created those regulations in the first place. As I said, we want the Minister to be responsive to the importance of practical record keeping and, above all, the need not to have separate records.
<P>
My second amendment is intended to deal with gold-plating. It would omit ``or expedient'' from the directive on parental leave&#151;in other words it should be confined to what is necessary to implement the directive. That leads to the important subject of gold-plating.
<P>
When I was a Minister&#151;I shall not talk about my experience at any length now&#151;I was at great pains with officials to create a framework within which the provisions of a directive could be reported. They were tabulated on the left side of the paper; and the relationship between that and the implementing words was set out on the right side of the paper. A commentary could be added, if necessary, saying, ``This is more than you are required to do in law, Minister. This is exactly what you are required to do.'' Or, perhaps in square brackets&#151;but not, dare I say it, for the Commission's eyes&#151;``This is rather less than we think, but you might be able to get away with it, Minister.''
<P>
Without necessarily going into that fine philosophy, we need a simple provision&#151;especially for domestic emergencies&#151;in the directive, but it seems to have been over-expanded in the event.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I would not wish the Minister to think that any partisan axis stands before him. I have never seen the hon. Member for Daventry as General Rommel&#151;though things can change with time&#151;but he made a telling point. Does he agree that the key test for the Minister is to explain why it is necessary to develop the Bill beyond the provisions of the directive? There is a chance of gold-plating, which I imagine all members of the Committee would be against. We seek the Minister's reassurance and ask him to justify the extension of the Bill beyond the directive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As I suspected, there is not a cigarette paper&#151;metaphorically speaking&#151;between the hon. Gentleman and myself on this matter. We are anxious for the provisions to be implemented&#151;a legal requirement&#151;but they should not be over-implemented without good reason. I know that concern has been expressed in several quarters, especially by employers, about the over-expansion of these provisions. If there is a good reason for that, the Minister should tell the Committee what it is. If his case is cogent and justified, we may accept it.
<P>
However, the provisions should not be nodded or smuggled through on the back of a directive whose terms may not strictly be required. The Minister may say, quite rightly, that the directive permits action over and beyond its powers, and we are not saying that it is impossible for him to do that&#151;particularly if the Bill is passed, but we must test what is happening. I say that advisedly because I would not want the Minister, who sometimes gets the wrong end of the stick, to escalate this probing interest into some sort of disguised agenda for destroying the spirit of the parental leave directive or some other agenda. This is simply about what measure is required, why it needs to be taken and, if the Minister so explains, why we are going beyond the terms of the directive. Irrespective of people's views on Europe, such matters are entirely appropriate for public debate, and are being raised by employers.
<P>
To summarise, we are concerned about the regulations, and we have specific worries about record-keeping and gold-plating. We look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I apologise to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, as in our previous sitting I referred to him as the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Out of politeness, he did not correct me. Eastbourne is a very nice place, and I am sure that Weston-super-Mare is just as nice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> As the Minister has conceded that Weston-super-Mare is just as nice as Eastbourne, I have to say that it is rather nicer.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I once spent an interesting weekend there, but this is not the time or place to discuss it, although I hear that the directives are in place as a consequence.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry must not be too edgy about how I interpret what he and his hon. Friends say in Committee. In most cases, I accept it, but sometimes the hon. Gentleman gold-plates his argument and I respond in kind. I accept that these are probing amendments and I shall respond to them. I never saw the hon. Gentleman as Rommel, but more as a Captain Mainwaring type of figure. There was not a cigarette paper between the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Eastleigh, although I never saw the hon. Gentleman as a fag.
<P>
The amendments take us back to territory that we have already explored. I agree that employers want notice of parental leave so that they can plan for absence, but other issues are involved. Legislation should not disrupt good planning and good practice, but engender in the employee a sense of responsibility towards the employer. I am acutely aware that any provisions made should at least take a sympathetic view of those needs and also create good practice. The proposal will benefit employers and employees.
<P>
Under the regulations, the amount of notice required will depend on how much leave is taken in any one spell and we shall consult about the issues. We shall ensure that employers who have a good reason for postponing leave can do so when their interests outweigh those of the employee&#151;that is important and I give that commitment. Those reasons may include covering a rush order, for example, or when several key staff want to take parental leave at the same time. It is good practice for the employer to have the capacity to maintain the company's commitment to supply goods and services to its customers and to take into account the interests of remaining members of staff. That is the non-destructive element of the matter.
<P>
On the subject of the impact assessment, paragraph 86 of the annexe states that many small firms will be altogether unaffected by the provision since their employees are not likely to take advantage of the proposals. The larger the firm, the more likely it is that employees will wish to take parental leave. Most small firms are well organised, but they have to make arrangements for cover, and that can be more difficult for them than for larger companies because of the nature of the available options and the size of the work force and their mixture of skills and commitment. We fully understand that and have to take account of it. That is why we ensure that the regulations will recognise the needs of firms in those circumstances. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare mentioned the provision for notice requirements in section 79(1)(a). Notice requirements are discretionary&#151;``regulations may'' is how it is put. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that our regulations will include such arrangements.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry made a number of points about record-keeping. The Government agree wholeheartedly with him that the burden of record-keeping should be minimised. There is no need to maintain more records than are sufficient for the company's need to plan and take account of when leave has been taken. That is why we think that the amendment is unnecessary. We give an absolute assurance that we have no intention of requiring employers to keep new records where their existing records serve the purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I rise only to put a thought about record keeping into the Minister's mind for future reflection. A company may have created a record system and recorded parental leave for its employees. There might then be a dispute about whether the leave had been taken. Will he consider having in the regulations a matching obligation on the employee to keep some record of the parental leave that he has taken? Otherwise, at a tribunal, an employee could claim a certain right which the employer was unable to rebut, possibly because the records had been accidentally destroyed. That absence of records should not by itself create an automatic presumption of non-compliance with the leave requirements.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I cannot envisage that happening in practice. The employer is responsible for records. People come in and out of the enterprise and that is recorded in ways ranging from new technology to punching a card or signing in. The employer keeps records for calculating pay. Such records tell when a person is available for work, is in work, is paid for work or is not in work and is not being paid. In practice, the overwhelming majority of employers maintain sufficiently good records on this. That is why we are confident that we can produce regulations that maintain that minimum requirement but satisfy both the employer and the employee that it will be possible to tell when and how much leave was taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Minister may recall that, earlier, I asked whether the regulations record the system of certification by the employer of parental leave taken, and suggested that if the employee changed employers, he would be obliged to show what leave had been taken. Is that part of the Minister's thinking or can he offer an alternative route?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> In that scenario he would not have to maintain any additional records. We all agree that record-keeping should be kept to a minimum. Secondly, we agree that the records that companies currently use should be sufficient. Thirdly, where no records are kept, the regulations will indicate what is required of an employer.
<P>
That brings us to the flexibility of the scheme. This goes back to our earlier discussion about having a more rigid scheme. When it comes to the balance of these matters, a very flexibile scheme can allow a wide range of options which has a potential impact on complex record-keeping. I am acutely aware that, in our enthusiasm to consider every circumstance, we might, by default, end up with complexity that no one envisaged being required. The advantages and disadvantages should be weighed up on the basis that the measure will not have a negative impact on record-keeping requirements.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry referred to amendment No. 44, which would restrict subsection (3) of proposed new section 79. That provision is a necessary part of our strategy to produce a coherent set of regulations that incorporates all the main provisions on maternity and parental leave. I hope that I can persuade him not to undermine that strategy, although I accept that the amendment was tabled in a probing spirit.
<P>
Some Opposition Members do not like the idea of United Kingdom legislation going beyond the requirements of Europe. I am not saying that to provoke the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), who is almost licking his lips with anticipation. I should like him to put his tongue back in his mouth for a few more seconds. Several provisions in United Kingdom law that go back over many years are not required directly under European law. Additional maternity leave, which was introduced nearly a quarter of a century ago, is one of those requirements.
<P>
People, including Maternity Alliance, the Confederation of British Industry and judges and members of employment tribunals, agree that the current maternity provisions are hopelessly complex. Practitioners who work the rules have a common feeling that they are too complex. The provisions are in such a state because of the previous Administration's minimalist implementation of the European law. That has resulted in the bare minimum of European requirements being bolted on to existing provisions, sometimes without much thought being given to how they would fit together or whether the resulting machinery would run smoothly. This is why we have struggled for the past few years with 14 weeks' leave and 18 weeks' maternity pay. We are trying to smooth down the jagged edges to provide a more comfortable fit and achieve a simpler scheme, an objective that has overwhelming support.
<P>
Employers as well as employees welcomed our plans, although they understood that the levelling process would bring more rights for women&#151;18 weeks' leave and 18 weeks' pay. The Government cannot be accused of gold-plating; it is a consequence of the agreement to ensure a better fit, which would result in a simpler set of proposals. It is interesting that there was little or no objection across the board for the knitting-together process being carried out as has been suggested. A single coherent set of regulations is the best way forward. It is important, therefore, for members of the Committee to accept that the schedule will enable us to move in that direction.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I thank the Minister for his instructive and helpful comments. I wish also to express my appreciation for his kind words about Weston-super-Mare. It is, indeed, a bracing seaside resort. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want a debate on the merits of Weston-super-Mare, although I recall earning a living there for a few weeks singling turnips; I think that the cider killed the pain.
<P>
Amendments, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 52, line 9, after `unreasonably,' insert `withheld or'.
<P>
The amendment is simple; it is intended to probe further the Minister's thinking and relates to the unreasonable withholding of parental leave. There may be arguments within the workplace about an employee's entitlement to parental leave. Obstacles might deliberately be put in the way by, let us say, selfish employers who wished to delay an employee gaining specific rights to parental leave. That is quite different from postponing them. No doubt the Minister will accept that. We need to know whether the Bill, as drafted, will cover an attempt of that sort by an employer to act unscrupulously for selfish reasons. We could think of any number of instances. It is quite likely that an employer of that ilk and bent of mind would use the resources of the personnel dept deliberately to put up spurious arguments so as to withhold an entitlement for the purpose of delaying&#151;
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> May I continue a little further, then give way? I am worried that an employer would effectively use his own skills or assets to attempt to withhold a person's rights rather than postpont them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. He may have been using language loosely; perhaps he will clarify that. He refered to a scenario in which an employer behaved unscrupulously for selfish reasons&#151;and that should not be allowed. Does not he also agree that unscrupulous conduct in this context, even for reasons that the employer claimed were entirely unselfish, should be entirely unacceptable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am not sure that I follow the hon. Gentleman's thinking. We recognised earlier that the scale of people's personalities&#151;be they employer or employee&#151;extends to both plus and minus limits, and I readily accept that. But my amendment attempts to probe whether an employer deliberately delays recognition of an employee's rights to parental leave rather than to initiate a debate about postponing them. One can easily think of many reasons why an employer might do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Collins </B>(Westmorland and Lonsdale): Will the hon. Gentleman explain what part of his extremely reasonable case is not covered by section 80(1)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I shall be delighted to do so.
<P>
I will not delay the Committee by mentioning specific cases because I think that the Minister understands the point. This is really a question of an employer having his own agenda that is crucial to him or her in the meeting of deadlines and of customers' requirements putting the employee's rights to parental leave on the back burner, so to speak, and of the employer using the technique of questioning whether the employee is entitled to the right as a means of postponing it, instead of trying to reach agreement before postponement. I think that I have made my point clearly. I should like the Minister to respond to the points that I have raised, and to confirm that the Bill will block an avenue such as that for a selfish employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> This is a question about Bercow Enterprises, or some such company that has huge resources behind it. I remember the Prozac. In fact, where is Linda? Can anyone remember what happened to the famous Linda, whom the hon. Member for Buckingham employed for &#163;7 an hour as the national minimum wage when he tried to convince us that we should remove the minimum wage entitlement, or increase it to &#163;7 an hour to bring it within the law? We have seen nothing of Linda in the past few months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Perhaps she is on maternity leave.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman has taken my punch line from me. I was just working up to it.
<P>
I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson). In my enthusiasm to begin, I forgot him. I now owe him two interventions. I do not want hon. Members to think that I am trying to silence my hon. Friends on the Benches behind me and those to the right of me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> That is the Whip's job.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Yes, it is the Whip's job.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there will be occasions when employees ought to be able to present a complaint to an employment tribunal on the ground that the employer has unreasonably withheld the period of parental leave.
<P>
We would always encourage the parties to settle their workplace differences as far as possible through discussions, local procedures and dispute resolution procedures. Employment tribunals should be a final safeguard if these methods cannot achieve agreement. The Employment Rights (Disputes Resolution) Act 1998 provides another option for resolving disputes about dismissals, such as arbitration. That Act had all-party support, and was very much supported by the business community. My hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey) was responsible for the legislation, so I can claim no credit for it. From now on, many thousands of cases, which would usually end up in tribunals, will be dealt with far more effectively outside the system. That will benefit both employers and employees. I hope that the Act will help a substantial number of small employers who sometimes find themselves in situations that are not of their own making. We should, therefore, consider using that legislation if local dispute resolution processes have not worked.
<P>
The same principle applies to disputes about parental leave. We would encourage people to resolve them at the workplace, but even when that cannot be achieved, we do not need the amendment to protect an employee's rights. The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) kindly helped me out in my job, for which I thank him. Being a casual worker, I do not know whether he will be covered by the minimum wage provisions.
<P>
Section 80(1)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides that an employee can make a complaint if the employer has prevented, or attempted to prevent, that employee from taking parental leave. Such action is clearly against the provisions in the directive. In some cases, an employer may be justified in postponing the taking of parental leave, which is why we have specified that the postponement must be unreasonable in order for the employee to make the complaint.
<P>
The choice is clear. Either the employer postpones the leave or, he prevents, or attempts to prevent, the employee from taking leave altogether. Therefore, I see little benefit in amending the current text.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> That is precisely the point that I wanted to tease out. The Minister has answered my questions, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 48, in

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>page 53, line 6, leave out from first `to' to end of line 35 and insert `leave from his or her employment for urgent family reasons, owing to the injury or illness of any of the persons listed in subsection 3 below, or other grave incidents, provided that entitlement to time off for such domestic incidents is limited to such circumstances where the immediate presence of the employee, at the place where the ill or injured person is situated, or the grave incident occurred, is indispensable.<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> As we said earlier in our proceedings, this part of the regulations&#151;the triplets, as the hon. Member for Daventry referred to them&#151;causes us most difficulty. I readily accept that there needs to be a safety net and a minimum standard of working conditions across the board. Just one of the conditions that I would wish to see is the right for employees to take time off from the workplace in an emergency.
<P>
There is no question about that, but I have difficulty with how the provision is dealt with in the Bill. There is greater emphasis on the emergency incident than on the individual who is affected by it. The reaction from people in industry and commerce shows that there is deep concern about the Bill's wording.
<P>
The Minister will be aware of the Engineering Employers Federation, given that it is vociferous in telling him about things that it is anxious about. It is concerned that the person who requries the attention of a worker who has to take emergency leave does not have to be related to that person. There is also some concern that the definitions in the Bill are far broader than the principles set out in the European directive from which they come.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Or, indeed, in the equivalent Irish legislation, to which the hon. Gentleman referred on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. The amendment does indeed derive from Irish legislation, which is far clearer than the Bill. The Bill seems to go far further than the intent of the directive and, in doing so, it has become over-complicated. The emphasis should be on the individual rather than the circumstance. That is why I propose that the Bill should specify the people who might be the cause of an employee needing to leave the workplace in an emergency, and why much less emphasis should be placed on what he emergency might be. During the civilised discussions that take place between employer and employee, it can be quite clear whether an incident is or is not an emergency. The argument might rather be on whether it was necessary for the employee to go to the aid of that person; that is why the amendment specifies family members and, most important, people for whom the employee has primary care.
<P>
I suggest that the Bill should limit the amout of emergency leave to three days in any one year, with a maximum of five days in three years. The reasons for that are fairly straightforward. In some circumstances, there could be an unending feast of emergency leave. It is only fair to employers, who are rightly expected to recognise the genuine personal difficulties and family responsibilities of their employees, that they should have the protection of reasonableness, and that it should not become an open-ended arrangement.
<P>
I imagine that working conditions have changed, so what I say casts no reflection on the staff of the House who work so hard today, but I recall that, some years ago, civil servants were entitled to 13 days per year uncertificated paid sick leave. I was working with civil servants at the time, so I know that it was considered legal to take those days in any case. They were taken for all sorts of reasons; I am sure that attending Lords on a Thursday was a beneficial way to spend one's time. One could argue that there was a need to address the malaise of working in a particular Department by spending a day at Lords.
<P>
We may joke about it now, but that tale underlines my concern that putting rights into the Bill without corresponding checks and balances will make them a statutory right. They will become an expectation and part of leave, and I certainly would not want that. That is one of the reasons why I am glad that the Bill makes no reference to emergency leave being paid. That would be wrong in principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman have any statistical verification of his assertion that civil servants used on average to take 13 days sick leave a year? I do not believe it, and it is a smear on the service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has such a belief in the capacity of human nature always to be concentrated on the demands of one's employer rather than on one's own preferences. The world is not like that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Pearson </B>(Dudley, South): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman will add anything to the discussion. What I said was based on my experience of working in the civil service. I did not go to Lords; I was far too busy trying to complete my work&#151;which allowed me to go on to other things.
<P>
I am concerned that the Bill tries to cover all manner of incidents rather than concentrating on individuals. My amendment is drawn from legislation passed in the Republic of Ireland, which has responded to the requirements of the directive. I cannot see why we need to go into such detail on incidents when other countries have devised a much clearer and simpler method of addressing the problem.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I largely echo the sentiments that have been expressed. A member of my family works as a civil servant&#151;although she has not had the privilege of working on a Bill, which might alter her perspective&#151;and I know that civil servants have good conditions of employment, which they work very hard to earn. However, we have a general concern about what might be termed creep of entitlement. Something is provided for the best reasons and reflects the best practice of good employers but then escalates into being a right and eventually an expectation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend says that the sort of conditions and entitlement that the Bill would confer are the best practice to be found in the private and public sectors. Does he agree that it not only represents the best practice, but on the whole the usual practice across the country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I readily concur with that. I also think that it is true of small employers. It is certainly something that I have always sought to practise with my employees; one expects to provide such leave. There are differences between the lines of communication and formal procedures in large and smaller firms, but that is the norm.
<P>
On the remarks of the hon. Member for Eastleigh, I am concerned that anything that is specified, even as a maximum limit, may become the norm. We need a faily narrow gateway for the definition of an emergency, but not necessarily for the specification of the period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the important factor of the parental leave directive, from which the legislation emanates, is that it concentrates on stipulating emergency leave for urgent family reasons&#151;taking the focus back to the individual&#151;rather than setting out a broader definition of domestic incidents, which we believe is much more difficult to push through that narrow gateway?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Yes, I agree that the provision is faulty, both in terms of defining people for whom one has a natural care and concern and of producing some filter&#151;if I may change the image of a gateway&#151;to restrict what people may do. Clearly, if one has a sick grandparent living at home who does not need constant attention, and one's partner or spouse is out at work during the day, there could be a spell of illness or a series of occasions of slight illness which it would be only humane to categorise as a domestic emergency and make appropriate provision. Equally, there is the situation of a boiler blowing up&#151;an example that was used on Second Reading. However, if someone's boiler blows up every month, it would suggest that the supplier, or the plumber, needed to be changed. I could tell members of the Committee some entertaining stories along those lines, but that would delay us too much.
<P>
To take up the point made by the hon. Member for Eastleigh, I became concerned on reading the report of that debate that the provision might not preclude incidents connected with work carried out from the home, possibly even remunerative work that employees normally do at home in the evening, perhaps using a PC. They could use that as an excuse to go home and make more money out of their second employer by taking domestic incidents leave from their first. Perhaps the Minister will ponder that awkward moral hazard.
<P>
The three amendments in my name and that of my hon. Friends march to many of the concerns that have already been mentioned. Amendment No. 45 is an attempt to confine the provision to those who are normally looked after by the employee. Under amendment No. 46, an incident would have to be of sufficient gravity to require the employee to leave work. Employees could not leave work because something slightly upsetting had happened at home; they could do so only if it was necessary to go home to deal with the incident.
<P>
In its notes to members of the Committee, the CBI refers to and commends amendment No. 47, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in all circumstances where the right is claimed, the employee shall use his best endeavours to inform the employer as soon as practicable of the circumstances of the emergency and the likely duration of his absence from work.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That amendment is designed to meet two concerns. First, it would act as a filter to prevent people from taking a day off without specifying what emergency had arisen. Secondly, it would ensure that, as soon as possible, the employee told the employer exactly what had happened and how long the emergency could last. An employer would understand the incident better if such matters were specified.
<P>
I realise that it is not always easy to say when a plumber will arrive to fix an exploded boiler or a major leak, but within reason, the employee should make an effort to do so. Just as most employers would resolve such matters as a matter of good practice, most decent employees would do their level best to say, ``Look, something frightful has happened, but I will be in as soon as I can. I think I'll be a couple of hours.'' That is what I want to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is developing a powerful case. Does he agree that amendment No. 46 is especially important because it would enable a distinction to be drawn between problems that are inconvenient and those that are hazardous? Some people might wish to take time off work immediately to deal with an incident that might damage their homes because it is convenient to do so. The fact that they simply prefer not to deal with it at the weekend does not justify taking leave. However, if an incident were hazardous and therefore an emergency, it would be of a qualitatively different character altogether.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is drawing a helpful distinction, but the difficulty is to write it into law&#151;let alone regulations&#151;and make it the practice, partly because people take different subjective views of what is a catastrophe. Some people may be able to cope with a burst boiler; they may ask their neighbour to turn off the mains. Other people, who are not well versed in such matters, may think that they must go home, perhaps even watching the water gush out until someone comes to put things right. I know why my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham is laughing, but such problems can be serious. Frankly, there can be interspousal dissent about whether they are emergencies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): That interesting line should be pursued. As we are talking about central heating boilers and the plumbing profession&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not talking about central heating boilers; we are debating the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. Of course, I intend my remarks to be germane to the amendment. A boiler may fail on a Sunday, and the differences between its being attended to on the Sunday rather than the Monday may be financial but have no other implication for the employee. Should we not presume that the employee will take reasonable steps to deal with the matter in his own time, rather than in that of the employer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is perhaps a reasonable contribution to the argument. It is a complex area. Different, subjective views can be taken. As my hon. Friend said, cost penalties may arise from having the matter dealt with as an emergency, to which we must be sensitive.
<P>
Through the amendment, we are trying to tie the provision to the need to be absent. That does not preclude someone from asserting the right to tell his or her employer, ``I'm off''. Ultimately, that would have to be determined by a tribunal. We must understand that. We are trying to ensure a reasonably objective and watertight test for when a case reaches the tribunal, and that, before it reaches the tribunal&#151;we hope that such matters will not be taken to the extreme of litigation&#151;custom and practice for employers and employees in dealing with contingencies that arise is fairly clear.
<P>
We are dealing with several complex issues. First, the amendment is understandable and welcome because it enshrines good practice on both sides. Secondly, a fairly robust test is necessary in the event of serious disagreement about the seriousness of the situation. Thirdly, regardless of any signals sent by different provisions in the past to different employees, no hon. Member would want to send the signal to employees that the provision constitutes an invitation to go home, albeit without pay, and stay away for as long as they want. We must have a reasonably workable definition. The Minister must reflect on how to include that in the regulations. We are feeling after that, and trying to confine it, but, judging from some responsible employers' opinions, we are not there yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the amendment would affect people who were invariably low paid, who will not want to take time off without pay?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I fully understand that point. He and I are at one. We would like such people to be able to continue to work, to earn and to improve their situation. However, some people in such circumstances, just like some people on higher remuneration, are less responsible and find it easy to find an excuse to take time off. We are trying to separate out people deliberately taking time off under some pretext from people who have a genuine reason for being absent, regardless of income, and whom all of us would instinctively like to help. That balance is difficult to find. Unfortunately, we are not in the business of expressing opinions, or even of general statements of objective characterised by European documents. Hon. Members who have read the directive will know that it contains only two paragraphs about the matter, which we must make into a viable set of regulations, which ultimately someone must take to court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is developing the argument effectively. Does he agree that the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) makes a mistaken assumption in suggesting that time off for domestic incident will, to use his words, invariably apply to low-paid people? It is precisely because the provision has broad application to people of all strata of society and income groups that it is especially important to get the regulations right, so that they are equitable and effective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed. I shall make that point clear, in case I had not done so. Anyone might have a domestic emergency. We need to set the conditions sensibly, so that people who need to avail themselves of the provision can do so, but those who use it as an excuse for further absences in a way that is not intended and which will embarrass their employers and, as the Minister said, their fellow employees, should be shown the yellow&#151;if not the red&#151;card. So there is no dissent on the question of objectives, but we await the Minister's response on how the provision is to be framed.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> I strongly support part II of the schedule, but I have some concerns about provisions for domestic incidents. When I first read the schedule&#151;I do not know whether it was my imagination running away with me&#151;I thought that we were taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Those of us who are employers try hard to act reasonably when domestic incidents and emergencies arise. At the same time, we do not expect our good intentions to be abused. When I was an employee I had a colleague who took time off for a death in the family&#151;which turned out to be the passing of his pet goldfish. No one would approve of such behaviour, but it goes on.
<P>
Responsible employers take great pains to deal sensibly and sensitively with their employees' problems. My heart sank when I read page 53 of the Bill and saw the nine areas on which regulations could be specified. I would like to think that the provision could be written on one side of a piece of paper, If it could be&#151;the hon. Member for Eastleigh has made a good attempt in his amendment to achieve that&#151;the obvious question is why it is not put into legislation rather than regulation.
<P>
I have a great deal of sympathy for the spirit of amendment No. 48. It is a brave attempt, even ultimately though it fails. In particular, I cannot support the imposition of time limits on time off for domestic incidents. That would be a bad route to go down. If employees have a domestic crisis that requires them to have time off&#151;they have a domestic crisis that requires them to have time off. It is as simple as that. One should not specify that someone can have, for example, only three domestic crises in any 12-month-period. That is not realistic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes some interesting comments. He partly anticipates the point that I was going to make. The fact that someone has reached the limit, for genuine reasons, of such leave does not guarantee that the following day a completely new and equally genuine domestic crisis that requires his or her absence might not occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> I agree. That is why specifying, say, three days in any 12-month period or five years in any three-year period is fundamentally wrong. I should like to tease out the Minister's thinking. Is he planning to include time limitations in the regulations or does he agree that the provision should be open-ended?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way; I apologise for not having done so to him earlier&#151;which make his courtesy all the more generous.
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman accept that when I was framing the amendment and considering the question of time limits, it occurred to me that most domestic emergencies tend to be short-lived? In the case of a very serious domestic problem, there may be a need to discuss with the employer an extended period of absence. In normal circumstances, that already occurs. The employer will say to the employee, ``You have had a day off and sorted out the immediate problem, but it is going to be a long-term problem. We have overcome the immediate emergency; now we can work out a leave arrangement for you.'' Does the hon. Gentleman accept that that is a valid point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> I accept that the hon. Gentleman has thought about the matter a great deal, but I do not think that he has reached the right conclusion. I wonder whether the Minister would accept the principle involved, or, like me, would consider it dangerous territory. I cannot accept amendment No. 48. However, I must admit that I am minded to support amendment No. 47, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry and seems entirely reasonable.
<P>
As an employer, when domestic incidents arose, I invariably insisted that the employees concerned should take more time off than perhaps they would have wished, but equally I expected them to inform me when they were likely to return to work. I know that there is a case for dealing with this matter in regulations, or for treating it just as a matter of politeness, but an employer who acts in good faith has a right to expect employees to act in good faith too. There is a case for enshrining that in primary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman supports the amendment. I wonder whether he noticed, while he was developing his argument, that as soon as he mentioned that support, the Whip and the Minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary became engaged in anxious consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> I cannot say that I am unduly bothered about that. I said that I was minded to support the amendment. I would be interested in the Minister's comments on the issue. It has been raised by the CBI, as the hon. Member for Daventry mentioned, and by several small businesses in my constituency. I consider it a real issue. We seem at this point to be struggling with the legislation. There are nine categories of regulations. I have nightmares at the idea of small businesses receiving a thick pack of regulations about parental leave. When I wanted to intervene on my hon. Friend the Minister earlier, it was to support his remarks about the need to keep regulations to a minimum. Surely in the context that we are considering, they should be a bare minimum. I should like reassurance that that is what will happen. Perhaps they cannot be kept to one side of paper, as I would like, but I hope that they can be kept to two sides.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not be concerend, unduly or otherwises, at the consulation with the Whip. He should be encouraged, because it is a sign that his words have had an effect. He makes an important and intelligent point and should be congratulated. It is nice to see the Committee working in this way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> I am not sure whether I should accept the hon. Gentleman's comments. I shall not be baited or get uptight about the issue. My point is that a matter of principle is involved in such measures, which is that we should make good law and keep regulations to a minimum, because in the United Kingdom we implement our law and regulations. Our Anglo-Saxon model is strong in that respect. We should be certain, when the time comes to consider the regulations in detail, that they are the minimum necessary to achieve the required objectives. I am concerned that that might not be true in the present instance. I do not want hon. Members to pass bad legislation. No one disagrees with the principle behind the measure, but we should not go over the top in implementing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I was rather surprised that, in a previous life, the hon. Member for Eastleigh was a goody-two-shoes, who ran around the office sneaking on his fellow workers. I can just imagine it. When I was a shop steward, I used to deal with that sort of employee, who was always going to the manager to report someone for popping out for a quick fag. I would not do that. Civil servants are often up all night because a Minister cannot cope with his red boxes. They ensure that the Minister is supplied with good information and advice. If one of them took five minutes out of the office to get a breath of fresh air, the hon. Gentleman would be on the phone to the Permanent Secretary. That is a sneaky Liberal tactic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Minister cannot expect me to take that sitting down. I referred to the working practices of 20 or 30 years ago. It was clear from research that I carried out in the previous Session that absenteeism in the civil service was a significant problem. The Cabinet has set targets for each Department to reduce absenteeism. How is the Minister progressing with that?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not debating civil service hours or pay and conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> My officials do not come to work, they come on a crusade. They are so happy to be working with me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Crusades are not a happy precedent.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It depends which side one supported in the crusades.
<P>
I want to deal with the point about transposing a directive in the way that the Irish Government have done. They have acted in a specific way for a specific reason, which relates to paid leave. They have estalished a regime that is narrowly defined and focused for that purpose. In regulating such matters, it is important to ensure that there is genuine potential for social partners&#151;employee representatives and employers' organisations&#151;to participate fully in the drafting and the consultation.
<P>
The amendment would tie our hands. It asks us to set out a range of specific options now, without consulting the business community or workers' representatives. That is not a sensible way to proceed. As I have said in debates on every amendment to the schedule, my job is to ensure an effective means of providing minimal regulation, which is written formally, to protect employees' rights and set out clear objectives for employers.
<P>
Nothing that I have said could lead my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South to believe that I would use a nutcracker in any circumstances. However, I am not sure whether his comments will go unheeded by the Whips, who might want to wield a nutcracker. My hon. Friend may want to take emergency leave in the interests of his political health.
<P>
I am sure that I shall persuade not only my hon. Friend but other hon. Members of my arguments. I shall consider the amendments in detail, and I hope that that will help hon. Members.
<P>
Most employers already allow time off for emergencies. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South made that point. That is borne out by statistics. A recent survey shows that only 3 per cent. of employees say that they cannot get time off if they need it. It is extraordinary that employers should have such sensitivity towards their employees.
<P>
We must remember that employers understand what they are doing and have a good relationship with their employees; in return, employees usually act responsibly towards their employer. However, the employer can always discipline those who tell lies to take time off. None of us wants to turn a blind eye to absenteeism or to people being absent for reasons that turns out not to be genuine.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have dealt with a number of such cases. In one, a couple who worked for the same employer took time off on sick leave and were seen on GMTV sitting on the beach in Spain watching a TV programme. Despite my capacity to persuade people to go in certain directions, no one could have defended such a case, and the couple lost their jobs. Emergency leave is not a charter that would open a huge door and allow people not to turn up for work; it is not the principle behind the directive, nor is it the Government's perception of how the regulatory regime should deal with the relationship between employer and employee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am encouraged by the Minister's remarks. I ask him to pay heed also to the fact that not only are most employers prepared to give such leave, but many, possibly the majority, frequently pay for such leave for short periods. In framing the regulations, he should bear in mind the effect that introducing an element of compulsion may have when overlaid on the existing procedures that many employers have, particularly if they offer paid leave.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall come to that later, but the point is well made. It is also true, given that there should not be a culture of taking leave with no responsibility, that, because of an employer's failure to follow good practice or his unwillingness to work sensitively, employees are sometimes forced to take time off and give other reasons, and to do it in a sneaky way. That is not acceptable either. We want to ensure good practice; we want employers and employees to have good working relationships, an understanding of their responsibilities towards each other. That is what the Government are working for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> May I make a comment about my hon. Friend's last statement? Are not some employers&#151;we all accept that it is a small number&#151;so severe that they do not act reasonably in emergency circumstances? Employees may be forced into taking leave for other reasons because they are worried that they will not be given emergency leave. Will not the Bill help to alleviate that circumstance?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The Bill will also develop good practice and change the culture that he mentions. It will assist the company in planning, which will promote flexibility and allow it to gain a competitive edge.
<P>
I think that we are all agreed that employers should not have to bear the costs of lengthy absences taken for no good reason. I cannot think of anyone who would logically argue such a perverse case; I certainly would not. Absence control is fundamentally a management issue, and poor management will give rise to problems. The Government want to ensure good management in both the public and private sectors. If management does not handle such absences effectively, the Bill will give them the opportunity to do so. I will give them the opportunity to deal with bad practice in their workplace. We want people to have the chance to take leave, but we want also to minimise abuses. That is critical, and I do not intend to move from that position.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 draws upon the words of the framework agreement and the Irish implementing legislation. However, in legal terms, we believe that it would make the right too narrowly drawn. We believe that this could be a valuable right, reassuring carers that they would not be victimised if they occasionally needed to take an hour or two off because of a crisis at home. That is important. More people are being invited to do so and it should be encouraged, and we must take that into account when drafting the regulations.
<P>
Time off must, of course, be reasonable. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South, what ``reasonable''means will be fully spelled out in the regulations. Regulations are not always a burden; they are an assistance to good business management practice. We want to ensure that they will not be a burden on business but reflect accurately what businesses need to do to maintain a good relationship with their employees.
<P>
For example, we shall need to consider the effect of the regulations on an employer's business, the amount of time already taken off by employees and the urgency of the need to take time off, a subject that was raised by several of my hon. Friends. Such issues could be dealt with on the basis of whether a request was reasonable. We shall consult fully on the regulations. We need to have flexibility to ensure that employees are not penalised in cases not identified in the Bill if they clearly need the time off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> On the matter of urgency, does the Minister agree that there should be a presumption that an employee who is able reasonably to attend to an emergency in his own time should do so rather than the first port of call being recourse to emergency leave in the event of an incident?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> My point was about people being reasonable. It is about good relationships and employees and employers having an effective responsibility towards each other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> It should be a presumption.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It is not a presumption. The presumption is that the Bill and the regulations will set out good practice and the requirement&#151;indeed, the right and the obligation&#151;to act effectively and not to misuse the opportunity for that time off. That will be clearly set out in the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is the Minister really saying&#151;I hope that he is&#151;that if a complaint were made to an employment tribunal because a worker had behaved in a way that was not reasonable&#151;perhaps he had invented an emergency or failed to act in a responsible way&#151;it would count against him?

<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It is an issue of trust. No tribunal would allow a vexatious claim or one that blatantly and patently said that someone had acted unreasonably because they expected the employer to take a particular course of action. Employment tribunals deal with such matters very effectively and there is a significant body of case law on whether an employer's actions would be considered reasonable. I have no worry about tribunals or other ways of resolving disputes.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 would prevent any flexibility. It seeks to allow time off only to certain family members; notably, it excludes grandparents and those for whom an employee could act as primary carer. That is a debilitating way to deal with carers. What about the employee's father-in-law, or a disabled aunt who lived with the employee? What about an employee who was not the primary carer&#151;perhaps a neighbour&#151;who needed occasionally to act in that capacity? It is important in such circumstances that employees and employers can be certain of a little flexibility. We need to include such matters when consulting on the regulations.
<P>
What if a child gets into trouble on a school trip, and the parent or carer is at risk of dismissal or discipline if time off is needed to talk with the teacher about the child? In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South, we are after some form of flexiblity, which is what the regulations are about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Minister, who is is making a persuasive case. I made it clear that I do not support amendment No. 48. I want an assurance that regulations will be kept to a minimum. Some of the circumstances that he mentioned require flexibility, and I do not believe that they can be adequately encompassed in regulations. I am sure that he is about to answer my question about why his hands are tied on amendment No. 47. It seems a rather sensible proposal that still retains flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I said that I would deal with each amendment in turn, giving an effective and detailed reply. I gave way to my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South because he asked me to. I think that I have now given him the two interventions that I promised.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 would insert the condition that time off was permitted only for grave incidents. That would mean, for example, that an employee could not come to work an hour or so late to arrange for a childminder if child care arrangements had unexpectedly broken down. No one could consider leaving a child if that condition had not been met.
<P>
We have already made our intention clear: employees will be allowed to take time off to make arrangements to cope with emergencies. I set out the types of incidents that should be covered, but I doubt whether legislation can specify all the circumstances in which it would be reasonable for an employee to take time off. Like an elephant, the sort of incident for which time off would be appropriate is easy to recognise when one sees it, but describing it is likely to give a misleading and unintended picture. I doubt whether we want to lay down rights to deal with one's mother-in-law, but not one's cousin&#151;even a cousin who has lived with the employee for many years.
<P>
I have doubts, too, about whether it is sensible to specify the number of days. That was raised by several hon. Members on Second Reading, including the hon. Member for Buckingham, who feared that it might be used as an entitlement. The amendment refers to that type of arrangement and could lead to problems, and is therefore not a sensible way to proceed.
<P>
What would happen if an emergency arose when employees had used up their entitlement? Should they be penalised for matters that are beyond their control? I seriously doubt whether we should encourage those who need only an hour or two to cope with a sudden disaster to take the whole day off. The amendment seems to suggest doing that, which is not how to foster openness and trust in the workplace. That will not encourage people concerned about their responsibilities at home to enter or stay in the labour market, or to have sensible working relationships with their employers. It will not encourage them to ask for an hour off, rather than pretending that they are sick. The amendment is a negative and somewhat grudging approach to a matter that is almost universal good practice.
<P>
We should be positive about the implementation of our proposals and helping to develop morale and commitment in the work force between employers and employees.
<P>
I have already said that we are concerned about trying to set in stone the circumstances that would be covered. Amendment No. 45 would limit coverage to someone who ``normally'' relies on the employee. The very nature of the sort of incident for which we are seeking to provide involves normality breaking down. I am sure that members of the Committee will agree that the provisions should cover emergencies involving an employee being called upon because someone's usual carer is ill. The employee may well be the next best person on whom the individual concerned can rely. Perhaps only an hour or two's help will be required for sorting out the longer-term solution. The amendment would stop an employee from being entitled to take time off in those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): May I ask a direct question? There are many Muslims in my constituency, and a problem often brought to my surgeries involves their moral and religious obligation to bury the dead within a very short time. I have often been asked to intervene with an employer to ensure that time off can be given straight away. There can be no greater emergency than the funeral of a member of one's family. Would I be right in assuming that amendment No. 45 would make the situation difficult for my constituents?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> My hon. Friend is right. That is why we have to be sensitive to the circumstances. Being sensitive does not add an additional burden because we have already agreed that 97 per cent. of the employees are now treated sensitively. We are trying to encourage best practice within the context of the directive, and to ensure that all employees have the opportunity to comply.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 46 takes us back to the issue of defining when a situation is grave enough to merit time off. The Bill already entitles us to make regulations, setting out the factors and circumstances that will help to determine whether time off is reasonable. When appropriate, those powers will be used to set out meaningful guidelines and we shall be consulting further.
<P>
Amendment No. 47, like the others in this group, would place more prescriptive provisions in the Bill. It would require employees to inform employers as soon as practicable about the nature of the emergency and the likely length of absence. I am all for good and open communications between employer and employee. I made it clear from the outset that I always have, and always will, expect employees to have a sense of obligation towards their employers. That is fundamental to their relationship. Everything that we are saying and doing is about encouraging that open and frank relationship.
<P>
I am satisfied that the Bill already contains provisions for regulations to be made about notice to be given and other procedures to be followed. The points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South and the hon. Member for Daventry have been taken into account in the Bill. We shall be considering how best to frame sensible requirements and will consult on them. Hon. Members and employers' organisations will have the opportunity to say what, in their view, is a sensible way of ensuring that there is communication between employees and employers. Having given those assurances, I hope that Opposition Members will withdraw their amendments and take the opportunity to proceed with the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> We have had an interesting debate on this part of the Bill, and have drawn the Minister out satisfactorily. He has made it clear that he understands the principles involved and that he wishes to satisfy them in due course. That leaves us with the problem that what is currently in the Bill causes some concern. We may wish to return to the matter at a later date, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
</UL></UL></UL><B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have spent nearly seven hours on schedule 3. I did not think that we would have a stand part debate. The hon. Gentleman must be brief.
<P>
Question proposed. That this schedule, as amended, be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr Bruce:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Atkinson. I shall be brief. Following on from the remarks of the hon. Member for Dudley, South, I simply wanted to say that schedule 3 is far too complicated. When I was about 22 years old, I managed a factory. It scares me to death to think of anyone trying to manage a factory and having to know all the different regulations. Whenever managing people, I have taken the commonsense view&#151;be reasonable with them, and they will be reasonable back. We are going down a route where absolute crimes will be encountered.
<P>
If the Minister had simply introduced a clause that stated that an employee may take reasonable unpaid leave without being subject to dismissal or disciplinary action by his employer, he could have covered schedule 3, and clauses 8, 9 and 10, without creating problems that I predict we will encounter by going down this over-regulatory, over-legislative route. It would be better to take the reasonable approach that I have suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> For the record, the hon. Member for South Dorset was, no doubt, one of those Arthur Daley employers.
<P>
Our family-friendly proposals received the overwhelming support of business during the consultation process. We have been very sensitive during these seven hours of debate. The Committee has worked well in debating these matters. The regulations that we put before the House will reflect the practical comments that hon. Members have made. The hon. Member for South Dorset has not yet made a single, sensible point. However, other hon. Members have done so, and they will be taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. [Interruption.] It is no good the hon. Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett) or others chuntering from a sedentary position. Is it in order for a Minister to impute dishonesty to a member of the Committee, as the Minister has just done?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> Sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I will sit down when I am ready, not when the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) wants me to.
<P>
There was a clear imputation of dishonesty to my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset, which the Minister should now have the good grace to withdraw.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I heard no imputation of dishonesty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I was described as an Arthur Daley employer. I have been an employer, both in my own right and as a manager of people, since the age of about 22.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. The Minister made the remark in the normal rough and tumble of debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. That is an insult to Arthur Daley.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To modify the French phrase, an explication de non-vote, we have had a good debate. We have just had a Division; we are not happy about the schedule, long as it is, but we shall allow the Minister to get on with the debate on the rest of the Bill.

<P>
No. 80, in page 5, line 38, after `requests', insert `in writing'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Amendment No. 78, which is tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, and those with which it is grouped, are designed to make the provision more precise and certain for business, and to remove some of its vagueness about what constitutes a relevant instance for the disciplinary and grievance procedures.
<P>
The amendment would remove from the provision interviews with an employer that take place merely by invitation rather than requirement to attend. It is designed to ensure that the right to be accompanied applies only in especially serious circmstances, when the employee may have legitimate and reasonable need to have a colleague or representative with him to support him, as serious implications may arise from that interview.
<P>
According to the Bill, even when an interview takes place merely by invitation, an employee can require the employer to accept a representative to accompany him, or may subsequently make a complaint that that was not allowed. That will apply to a broad range of circumstances. The Bill does not define when an employee can be considered to have a grievance. That is especially important in the events of individual grievances that might be held to apply collectively. It is therefore important to ensure that the provisions are not used to circumvent provisions elsewhere in the Bill that deal with trade union recognition.
<P>
The amendment is designed to exclude ordinary negotiations or informal contact that may take place to discuss matters such as pay, when the employee may consider that he has a grievance merely because he is not paid as well as he would like, the food in the staff canteen is not as good as he wants, he has not been allocated a car parking space although one of his colleagues has, or he does not like the colour of work clothes prescribed by the employer. According to the Bill, a grievance could be held to exist in any number of circumstances in which the employee requests an interview and the employer then invites him to attend one because he is entitled to accompaniment by a colleague or trade union representative. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will agree that it is in the interests of the successful operation of the provision that vexatious instances be precluded through the drafting of the Bill and regulations. The amendment is designed to preclude some instances involving less serious matters in which the employee may want to cause trouble or difficulties and bring in an outside party when it is not necessary. It does not seek to prevent that right if it is a serious disciplinary matter and the employee is required to attend an interview with the employer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> There is a fundamental distinction between a requirement and an invitation. It is upon that distinction that my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West and I rest our case.
<P>
When an employee is required to attend a disciplinary or grievance hearing on a substantial matter, the consequences of which could be serious, it would be reasonable for that employee to be accompanied. Certainly, as far as the Government are concerned, it is reasonable for such an employee to have the right to be accompanied either by a union official or by a named individual of the employee's choice. I do not cavil at that.
<P>
The situation is very different, however, if an invitation is issued but there is no obligation on the employee to attend, and I cannot see why there should be a statutory entitlement for the employee to be accompanied by a union official or anyone else. Necessarily, the circumstance is not as serious; no grave consequence can flow from it, and it is unimaginable that serious damage will be done to the employee's rights. I believe that we should distinguish between serious cases, where accompaniment is required and when it could have desirable consequences, and cases where accompaniment is not needed and when it could be unhelpful.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West wants to avoid a situation in which, perhaps unwittingly, the legislation provides a charter for campaigning. To say that a person should have the right in certain circumstances to be accompanied when making representations to an employer is one thing. It is quite different to tell an employee that he has the right to instigate a campaign, and to be accompanied, because, if the employer does not agree with the campaign there will be no adverse consequence or disciplinary outcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that these things are never as straightforward as we imagine? For example, if an employer has to inform an employee that he is being invited to a disciplinary hearing, he has say to what level of discipline is involved, and he must make it the lowest sanction&#151;a verbal warning. If the employee had had previous warnings for other matters, even though the employer was going for what would appear to be a low-sanction disciplinary hearing, it could have more serious consequences. In those circumstances, the employee may wish to be accompanied by the trade union officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sorry, but I do not accept the validity of the hon. Gentleman's argument. I accept that such situations are complex, and that the legislation cannot take account of every conceivable situation. In such circumstances, we must exercise our judgment.
<P>
There seems to be a fundamental distinction between situations in which employees can suffer disciplinary consequences and ones in which they cannot. If the individual is liable to disciplinary action, attendance at the interview should be obligatory; it should be a requirement, not a matter of invitation. In those circumstances, I understand the reasonableness of the Government's suggestion&#151;although I do not necessarily agree with it&#151;that the person could be accompanied by a union official or another. If attendance is simply a matter of invitation, it must logically follow that non-attendance has no disciplinary consequence. If attendance is purely voluntary, there is no reason why the employee should be accompanied.
<P>
This is a case of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object. There is no failure on my part to understand the opinion of the hon. Member for Eccles, nor even a failure on his to understand mine. We must simply accept that we disagree. The amendment is sound; the thinking and motivation behind it are reasonable, and I hope that the Minister will consider it sympathetically.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I rise to speak to amendments Nos. 77 and 80, which I tabled. I am saddened that, in losing his bonhomie and deciding that insults are a better way to proceed, the Minister has been deserted by his crusaders. They left when he mentioned what a wonderful crusade they were on. Other crusaders have been rushed in&#151;somewhat belatedly&#151;to support him. That shows what a wonderful employer he must be. People think so highly of him that, if he praises them, they will work for him for love.
<P>
I wrote amendments Nos. 77 and 80 before reading their full context. I suspect that the Minister will be only too pleased to jump to his feet and tell me that they are out of context. Most sensible people would think that they could find out what clause 11 means by reading it, but clause 14 and the explanatory notes must also be read to understand all this nonsense. That goes to the heart of the matter. The Bill is so extraordinarily badly drafted and complex that it will be difficult for people to find out what they are entitled to.
<P>
The amendments stand on their own. If the amendments were accepted, clause 11(1) would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This section applies where a worker| is required or is invited by his employer to attend a formal disciplinary or grievance hearing, and...the worker reasonably requests in writing to be accompanied at the hearing.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> This is complicated and, if the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall finish my train of thought. If he then wants me to give way, I shall be happy to do so.
<P>
Under clause 14(4), which explains what clause 11 means, the disciplinary grievance hearings referred to in clause 11 will be set up by companies themselves, but the provision will not apply to companies that do not have formal grievance procedures. That is chopped logic.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister wants people to have the right to be accompanied at disciplinary proceedings. In some ways, it is reasonably sensible that those who want to be accompanied should have that right, but the Bill complicates matters.
<P>
It appears that the individual whose employer has never adopted a grievance procedure will not have a right to be accompanied. If that person were subsequently sacked, the employment tribunal might say that the employer should have used a grievance procedure, during which he should have allowed the employee to be accompanied. However, the Bill does not require them to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> I am sure that the Committee would like clarification about the different procedures. Disciplinary procedures and disciplinary appeals procedures should not be confused with grievance procedures. A grievance procedure takes place when the employee wants to pursue a grievance. Such an employee, under this very welcome Bill, will have the right to be represented. In a disciplinary appeals procedure, in the event of a serious and important matter, an employee will have the right to be represented by a trade union officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, because he has explained to the Committee something of which I was not aware&#151;that a grievance procedure is different from a disciplinary procedure. He has explained the difference between them, as in one case it is the employee who comes forward. The terminology used is important. However, in his interpretation of what he thinks that the Bill says, the hon. Gentleman should examine clause 14(4), which does not say that everyone will be represented. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``For the purposes of section 11 a disciplinary or grievance hearing''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is the only hearing for which someone is entitled to be accompanied by a representative&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is a hearing which is held in the course of a disciplinary or grievance procedure established or adopted by an employer and which&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) in the case of a disciplinary hearing, could result directly in the employer administering a formal warning to a worker or taking some other action.''
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Stewart:</B> We are achieving the clarity that I wanted. Throughout my entire working life, in all procedures, the onus has been placed on the employer to hold the hearing. It is not for the employee to hold the hearing. That is why the clause is worded as it is. It is for the employer to call and hold the hearing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The complication with which I am dealing is not the same as that with which the hon. Gentleman is dealing. As he obviously has a great deal of knowledge about the matter, I hope that he will also speak to the amendments. It is an interesting and important point, and he is right about grievance procedures.
<P>
It is implied in the clause that the provision comes into effect only when a procedure has been established, and not when someone acts on impulse. The wording has resulted in complication. Anyone reading the Bill must read two different clauses to understand the interpretation. It should be made clear that it refers to a formal disciplinary or grievance hearing that has been set up and about which people are aware.
<P>
The request should be made in writing. The clause deals with what constitutes normal practice and with possible contingencies. An employee could ultimately receive two weeks' pay because his employer did not allow someone else to accompany him or her during a grievance procedure. The request should be made in writing so that some evidence exists that the employee asked to be accompanied. Let us consider the case of an employee who attends a hearing but never thought to ask that someone accompany him. After having been properly disciplined, that employee might be approached by a trade union official who tells him that he had a right to do so, which the employee says that he did not appreciate. The official asks whether the employee asked for someone to accompany him, to which the employee responds that he is not sure, but that he must have done. Before we know where we are, people will be going to industrial tribunals to claim several weeks' pay as a penalty against the employer, without evidence of a request to be accompanied. Many people would prefer in many circumstances not to be accompanied. A request to be accompanied should therefore be submitted in writing to the employer in the event of an employee being required to attend a disciplinary procedure or approaching the employer with a grievance.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall deal quickly with the amendments, but it might help the Committee if I first set out briefly the thinking behind the likely content of the code.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our proposals build on existing good practices in grievance and disciplinary procedures. Good employers avoid imposing unnecessary requirements and restricting access to their procedures. They recognise that accompaniment should apply equally in grievance and disciplinary cases. We have drafted the Bill in accordance with such good employment practices. The code will complement the Bill's provision, describing what constitutes good practice.
<P>
The new code, which might replace the existing ACAS disciplinary code, might set out the advantages of clear, fair, well-publicised disciplinary and grievance procedures&#151;procedures that help management as well as workers; there is evidence that firms that operate such procedures lose fewer tribunal cases than firms that do not. The procedures are as much about protecting the employer as the employee. It might also set out the main elements of reasonable disciplinary and grievance procedures and any appeal mechanisms, including timetables, notice arrangements, provision of documents and arrangements for accompaniment. It might include a description of the relevant existing law, including the principles of natural justice, as well as the right to be accompanied. It could give advice on the conduct of procedures and the recording of outcomes.
<P>
The code might give examples of where the right to accompaniment would apply, for example, in grievances concerning alleged breaches of statutory or contractual duties owed by the employer to the worker, and of matters that would not be covered: for example, an employee's request for a pay increase to which there is no statutory or legal entitlement. It might give advice on special circumstances, for example, where a worker has particular difficulties because of disability, because English is not his or her first language, or in regard to nightshift workers or those in isolated locations. It might give examples of model forms to be used as part of the disciplinary and grievance procedures.
<P>
Explaining the code shows that it will be an effective management tool and highlights the clarity of the objectives for both employer and employee, whether in regard to a disciplinary procedure invoked by an employer or a grievance procedure invoked by an employee.
<P>
All three amendments flout common sense and good practice&#151;and, from the comments of the hon. Member for South Dorset, I suspect that their intention is to restrict workers' entitlement. At least the hon. Members for Altrincham and Sale, West and for Buckingham raised issues in a probing way; the hon. Member for South Dorset said, incredibly, that the Bill was nonsense&#151;why on earth is having good procedures in the workplace nonsense?
<P>
Employers generally require the attendance of workers at hearings when disciplinary matters are discussed, but they do not usually insist that workers attend meetings if grievances are under discussion. The effect and purpose of amendment No. 78 would be to limit workers' ability to invoke the right when they want to raise grievances and is counter-productive. It would increase the sense of grievance and would be seen as biasing the law in favour of employers.
<P>
Amendment No. 77 is doubly flawed. First, it is unnecessary. Clause 14 limits the right to cases where hearings form part of agreed procedures; if that is what the hon. Member for South Dorset means by ``formal'', the issue is already covered by that clause. Secondly, the amendment is unclear. What is meant by a ``formal'' hearing? The hon. Gentleman gave no definition and the amendment would create uncertainty in interpretation, leading to unnecessary dispute about what the right entails. Clause 14 already gives a clarity to the process.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No, not for a second.
<P>
Amendment No. 80&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Will the Minister give way on the logic of that amendment?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I have made it clear to the hon. Gentleman that I wanted to move on. I think that all members of the Committee want that. I am giving some clarity to the matters under discussion, although we will return to them. I have made a cast iron case against the amendments and nothing that the hon. Member for South Dorset could say would influence me to change my mind.
<P>
Amendment No. 80 imposes an unnecessary bureaucratic requirement: everything must be done in writing. That would tie the worker down to communicating with his employer in only one way. The hon. Gentleman would heavily criticise us for imposing such burdens on employers,&#151;but he would gladly impose them on workers.
<P>
None the less, the amendment would cause problems for employers and impose costs on them. Most voluntary procedures do not include such a bureaucratic requirement. If we accepted the amendment, tens of thousands of employers would probably feel that it was incumbent on them to amend their procedures to ensure that they corresponded with the law. No benefit would ensure from that.
<P>
Tribunals need proof that a worker reasonably requested a meeting. Simply to assert that such a request had been made would be insufficient. If the case went to a tribunal, evidence would be sought from the worker to ascertain whether a reasonable request for a meeting had been made. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West will withdraw the amendment on the basis of the information and explanation of the code that I provided. We expect the code to assist employers to ensure that grievance and disciplinary procedures are effective, and to protect employees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I have to make another speech because the Minister would not give way. He spoke about the formal procedure. Does he claim that if there is no formal procedure, an individual has no right to accompaniment? I agree with him that I tabled amendment No. 77, which would insert the word ``formal'' into subsection (1) (a), before I had read the subsequent clause. However, does the clause give special rights to those whose employers have established a formal procedure? We need clarification about that.
<P>
The Minister gave a good example of someone who did not speak English as a first language. Later clauses provide that if no one in the company or trade union was sufficiently good at that employee's first language to act as an interpreter, the company or trade union could not request help. I hope that the Minister will reconsider that when he examines the amendments that I tabled to later clauses.
<P>
The Opposition are not trying to tell the Minister that he cannot fulfil his promises to people. We are trying to improve the Bill. We do not support introducing regulations that we shall discuss less than 30 days before the poor employer and employee are required to interpret them.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can provide some clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Is it for me to withdraw the amendment?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are debating amendment No. 78. The hon. Gentleman can press the amendment or ask the Committee's leave to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> On amendment No. 78, I thank the Minister for his comments about the code. The Opposition are unhappy about legislation that provides for action to be taken through codes or regulations that we cannot consider today. However, in the light of some of the assurances that the Minister gave, I hope that he is acting in good faith and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I have not received an answer from the Minister. I may wish to press my amendments if the Minister refuses to deal with the simple points that I made. I would be grateful if the Minister would reply to the debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 78 has been withdrawn. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to press his amendments, he must do so formally. There is no provision for the Minister to speak on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. It is extraordinary that the Minister would not give way on a simple point of clarification&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. What the Minister said, or did not say, is nothing to do with the Chair, it is up to the Minister.
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 77, in page 5, line 36, after `a', insert `formal'.&#151;[Mr. Ian Bruce.]
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 5, line 36, leave out `or grievance'.

No. 96, in clause 14, page 8, line 22, leave out `or grievance'.
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in connection with his employment rights, or an alleged breach of his current terms or conditions of employment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> With uncharacteristic self-restraint I kept myself out of the debate on grievances. I was largely satisfied with the Minister's clarification of matters relating to the lead amendment. If they did not before, members of the Committee now appreciate the distinction between a disciplinary and a grievance hearing.
<P>
As far as an employee is concerned, a disciplinary hearing within agreed procedure is always serious; the underlying concern which prompted amendment No. 79 is that a grievance procedure might or might not be a serious matter or be felt by the employee to be serious, but it might be trivial or vexatious. To some extent, that is covered by the Minister's clarification in respect of the formal procedures under clause 14; I envisage that the code will say, for example, ``In the first instance if you have a grievance you should raise it informally and it should be resolved if possible informally without recourse to a formal hearing.'' That would not be self-evidently absurd or improper, but perhaps the Minister will say more about it. If a worker feels strongly that something is wrong and he has gone through the first phase of the procedure in accordance with the code and the local agreement and he then wants to take it to a formal level, that is a serious matter. It would not be unreasonable, subject to later discussions, for him to have some help in doing that.
<P>
I am more concerned about the matter to which amendment No. 101 relates. I shall speak to that amendment and let the Minister reply. As my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, said, the grievance should be about something connected with employment, not the fact that the home team lost at the weekend, or something equally unrelated. Although I make the point in a jocular way, it is relevant. An employer could have other duties in relation to his employee. He could, for example, be in a family relationship, still employing the person and have parental duties, for example. The amendment would not prevent the airing of a legitimate grievance but would make it clear that the grievance should arise out of work, specifically in relation either to employment rights or to a breach of the terms and conditions of employment. That seems to me&#151;it is my formulation&#151;to cover the kinds of things that are the proper subject of a grievance procedure. I look forward to the Minister's response to my points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. I say at the outset that I set the framework in the last debate and I do not want to rehearse the arguments. People know where we are coming from and why. I will deal specifically with the issues surrounding amendments Nos. 99 and 101 although the hon. Gentleman had tabled other amendments which seek to remove the entitlement for workers to be accompanied at the grievance hearing. I assume that he was using the proverbial big hammer to crack the nut only to prompt a debate and that he does not intend to leave people without the ability to be accompanied at a grievenace hearing, so I do not need to respond to him.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 99 attempts to define what disciplinary matters should be covered by the right. We consider the right should apply wherever the hearing could lead directly to an action taken against the worker. That seems sensible. The right should not apply where employers hold counselling or exploratory meetings with a worker to discuss disciplinary or performance issues without the immediate threat of disciplinary action being taken. These meetings are commonplace in the work place; it is the way sensible managers, following ACAS advice, can effectively deal with problems at an early stage.
<P>
Employers can take many forms of disciplinary action. They can suspend, dismiss, demote, relocate or fine. They can also issue a formal warning or simply put a note on the worker's file. All these matters are important to the worker concerned. None is too small as to be classified as insignificant. A note in a file might sound innocuous but it could block any chance of a worker gaining promotion.
<P>
I am dealing with a constituent who went from one employer to another. Some months later, in the normal course of events, a note was sent to the first employer saying that he had finished his initial period of employment satisfactorily and asking for any comments. The comment was a note on his file from 10 years previously and he was summarily dismissed. There is no case for a tribunal as he has only worked for the second employer for a short period. A note on file can have a significant impact on employees and so we believe that the right to be accompanied should be available.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister has saved me the need to speak to amendment No. 99. I hear what he says but simply ask him to take care and to consider whether it might not be better to tighten up the wording so that instead of saying
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``taking some other action in respect of him''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it referred to some other action that may be deleterious to him or something that brought it down to the disciplinary level.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman's proposal restricts the right to those meetings where potential or formal warnings could be issued. I have set out the other measures that an employer can take which have a tremendous impact on the employee. The amendment is far too narrow. In some cases the issue might be such that a formal warning is not an option. The matter could be so serious that dismissal or demotion are the only options that the employer wishes to take. In those circumstances, it is entirely sensible that the employee should have the access we are suggesting.
<P>
Amendment No. 101, which relates to clause 14(4), would restrict grievance as to the performance of a duty by an employer in relation to the worker. Opposition Members are concerned that the wording might seem too wide or vague.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I hope that I can set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. The form of words in the Bill ensures that the definition of a grievance applies only to legal duties owed by an employer to his or her worker. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. Its effect is already achieved. I hope that that explanation will persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdrawn the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdrawn the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 5, line 38, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) This section shall not apply to an employer who shows that to comply with it would conflict with this religious beliefs'.<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 90 in clause 12, page 6, line 34, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>but such a complaint shall not succeed if the employer can show that he was unable to comply as a consequence of his religious conscience.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I understand that the usual channels are drawing close to the conclusion of their 48-hour week so I shall try to be brief. However, I would not wish anyone to deduce from that that any less seriousness attaches to these amendments. They are important amendments, especially to a group of Plymouth Brethren in my constituency who, as a result of their religious beliefs, are seriously concerned about parts of the Bill. By way of brief explanation, the Plymouth Brethren have been in the United Kingdom for around 150 years, during which time they have been able to take advantage of the religious freedoms that are traditional and important in our culture. They operate 1,200 mainly small businesses, employing around 6,500 employees&#151;all but 2,000 being Brethren themselves.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 81 and 90 deal with matters of Christian conscience that are important to the Brethren. They aim to live their lives strictly according to scripture and thus view the relationship between master and servant as a holy relationship. They regard trade associations or trade unions as inconsistent with that relationship in that they intervene between the direct relationship between master and servant. Their Christian scruple prevents them from recognising trade unions and from allowing trade union representation in their businesses.
<P>
It is important to stress that their practice as employers is almost invariably very good. They are not bad employers seeking to exploit their employees. However, they wish to live their lives in accordance with their beliefs, which are a matter of tradition and culture and have generally been tolerated in this country. Employment legislation in the past has generally protected their right to Christian conscience. My amendments would protect that right for the Brethren, who are resident in different parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>
I might add&#151;I am sure that the Committee knows that I am speaking seriously&#151;that the Brethren do not participate in the normal political process. I am speaking on their behalf, but not in anticipation of any worldly support from them. I seek to defend a right to freedom and tolerance for the Brethren, who should be allowed to practise their religion in their way in our country as they have for 150 years.
<P>
I have already said that I take this matter very seriously and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham does too. I hope that the Minister can tell us how the Bill can be amended in such a way as to protect the Brethren's rights to religious freedom. If he does not, I shall be obliged to press the amendment to a Division. Is so, I hope that I will enjoy the support of the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas), who spoke earlier about religious freedom for his constituents. The issue has no party political significance, but it goes to the core of the freedom and tolerance of which our country is so proud.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am delighted to second the amendments on behalf of the Brethren, sometimes known as the Plymouth Brethren. More than 50 of them live in my Buckingham constituency and some live in the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Altrincham and Sale, West and in other parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>
I ought to say at the outset that, over the past few months, I have had a number of discussions with members of the Brethren, who are listening attentively to our proceedings. I have never been a member of the Brethren, and I have no wish to become a member, but I have every respect of their integrity. I underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West said; there is no evidence or other reason to suppose that they behave improperly or inequitably towards their employees in the conduct of their businesses.
<P>
The Minister might not be familiar with their practices, and I do not claim to be, but the Brethren have the utmost integrity. I might also add&#151;I hope that I command the general assent of the Committee&#151;that it is important that we parliamentarians should respect religious freedom and the exercise of religious conviction, even if we do not subscribe to that conviction ourselves. The Brethren are decent people who live God-fearing lives, based upon the primacy of adherence to the holy scriptures. That commitment renders it impossible for them to engage in any activity that would undermine the sanctity of the Lord's supper. They are required to maintain an absolute separation from any activity that would cause them to violate the Lord's supper.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West has said that the nature of the Brethren's religious conviction is such that they can have no involvement in trade unions. However, it is important to emphasise that they are not hostile to members of trade unions. Indeed, they wrote to the Minister of State on 22 February, saying that they had no desire to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``undermine or negate any part of the Employment Relations Bill''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They are concerned to ensure exemption from those parts of the Bill that would do violence to their beliefs and that would undermine their practical right to exercise their religious freedom.
<P>
The issue arises in two contexts. The first is the right of an employee to be accompanied by a union official at a disciplinary or grievance hearing. The second is the entitlement under the Bill to complain to an employment tribunal in circumstances in which those rights had been denied. The Brethren are a minority; they will not be offended when I say&#151;this is not a qualitative judgment, but a statement of fact&#151;that they are a very small minority.
<P>
Parliament has little meaning unless it recognises that minorities matter. Majorities are important and, to a large extent, democracy is about respecting the wishes of the majority. However, we should seek to respect the wishes of the majority in such a way that we do not show contempt for or do violence to the wishes to the minority. We are not talking about an enormous number of people; if the Brethren were exempted from parts of the Bill or were afforded an amendment, they would not wish to undermine the law for the rest of the country.
<P>
I appeal to the Minister of State to acknowledge that our amendments are not wrecking amendments. I confess that I did not devise them myself but in consultation with the Brethren because they are my constituents. They are honourable people who approached me courteously. We discussed the amendments and I decided to put them forward in consort with my hon. Friends, so I beg the Minister not to suggest that they are designed to drive a coach and horses through the Bill because they are assuredly not.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I also emphasise that the House attaches great importance to the principle&#151;and, I hope, to the practice&#151;of human rights. Hon. Members of all parties are concerned about human rights. They will recall that not so long ago the House of Commons debated the Human Rights Bill. During the excellent debates on it, the Home Secretary stressed the importance of religious freedom. In doing so, he poignantly referred to an eminent textbook entitled ``The Law of the European Convention on Human Rights'', a work by Harris, O'Boyle and Warbrick. He quoted from page 359 of that important tome:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The authors conclude:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `This is a strong affirmation of the power and even the duty'&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
they were referring to the European convention&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`of states to protect manifestations of religious belief.'''&#151;[Official Report, 21 October 1998; Vol. 317, c. 1342.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I appeal to the Minister, consistent with that thinking, to reflect upon and accept the amendment. If he is unwilling to do so, he will no doubt explain why, but in that scenario I make a special plea. If he judges that he cannot accept it, will he tell us what action he intends to take to reassure this fine body of people that they can continue to live their lives in accordance with their religious principles? I make that plea without wishing in any way to prevent the passage of these important legislative proposals.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> Last Friday, members of the Brethren took the time and trouble to visit me at my advice surgery to explain their problems with certain parts of the Bill. The people whom I met are well respected in their communities and I recognise fully the sincerity of their views. I do not hold those views: indeed, I spend a lot of my time encouraging people to join trade unions because I believe that they are the best way of protecting the rights of individuals in the workplace. Nevertheless, I have great respect for the views of these people, who will without doubt be affected by the Bill. I understand that they employ 12,500 people. I need not add to the comments of hon. Members. However, this is an issue of balancing religious rights and employment rights. I hope that the Minister, who I understand has had talks with the Brethren, can offer us some kind and useful words on the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is important that the Committee knows where I am coming from. As my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham said, we share a constituency boundary and I suspect that I also have some members of the same congregation of the Brethren on my side of the line, although they have not yet been to see me about this matter.
<P>
I should also say that there have been members of the Brethren on my mother's side of my family, although, to the best of my knowledge, none of my family is currently a member of that organisation, and nor am I. However, I am conscious of some of the difficulties surrounding this issue. There is in a sense a clash of principle, which will inevitably go a little wider than has been suggested&#151;this applies to the statutory recognition procedures as well&#151;because we could not rule out the possibility of a firm that employed members of the Brethren falling within that procedure and accordingly being subjected to difficulties.
<P>
From one of the former members of my family in a distant country, I know of the difficulties that have occasionally arisen with employee relations there. Hon. Members have participated in this debate with characteristic sensitivity. It is entirely for my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West to decide, but it might be best if we listen to the Minister's reply and reflect on it rather than pressing the amendment to a Division. Indeed, the House might wish to take a view collectively on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I thank hon. Members for the way in which they have presented their case in this debate. The Department of Trade and Industry has already had numerous contacts with the Brethren. Indeed, my officials spent nearly two hours in a meeting with four of their representatives last week.
<P>
The Brethren refuse to have any dealings with trade unions because they believe the Bible says that there should be no intermediary in relations between master and servant.
<P>
We all accept that the Brethren are industrious people, both individually and collectively. Their religious community is beyond reproach. Indeed, members of the Brethren live in my constituency and have businesses just outside it. I have met members of the Brethren on several occasions during the past 12 years. They are always polite, and I have often wished that other constituents would put their case in the same way.
<P>
Many of their employees are also Brethren and, therefore, will have nothing to do with trade unions&#151;but some are not. The Brethren fear that some employees could insist on being accompanied at disciplinary or grievance hearings by trade union officials.
<P>
Naturally I respect people's religious beliefs, but I have difficulty understanding their position on the clause. I understand that they have no objection to an employee being accompanied by a fellow employee, nor even, as they told officials at the Department, by a third party such as a lawyer, but they object to the accompanying person being a trade union official. I cannot understand why it is acceptable for a lawyer, but not a trade union official, to accompany an employee. That shows that the objection is not to the accompanying, but to the person who accompanies.
<P>
We have made it clear that the accompanying person cannot represent the worker&#151;cannot answer questions on his or her behalf. The accompanying person is there to advise and support, not to intervene between employer and worker.
<P>
I cannot accept the amendment; I cannot agree that workers should be deprived of their statutory rights because of the religious beliefs of their employers. It is one thing for someone to be excused jury service, for example, on the grounds of his or her beliefs, but quite another for one person's beliefs to result in others being deprived of their rights.
<P>
I am aware of no exemption to employment legislation on the grounds of religious conscience. Closed-shop legislation provided such an exemption, but that measure has been repealed.
<P>
There are no such exemptions relating to individual rights to belong to a trade union, nor should there be. We shall maintain that right, which was afforded by the previous Administration.
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckingham and other hon. Members referred to the European convention on human rights. I have based my decision to resist the amendments on two articles of that convention. Article 9 provides the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It states that the freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs my be subject to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society . . . for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Article 11 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Everyone has . . . the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the Human Rights Act 1998, which covers the European convention on human rights, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had to state that, in his view,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the provisions of the Employment Relations Bill are compatible with the Convention rights.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement appears on the front of the Bill. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw the amendment in the sure and certain knowledge that because of his performance and the activities of my officials, the matter has been dealt with very sensitively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I listened attentively to the Minister, and he has given a rationale for rejecting the amendments. It is not one that I accept, although I am grateful to him for offering us a view. I asked him specifically by what means the Government propose that the practical right to exercise religious freedom of the Brethren should be protected if the Minister cannot accept the amendments. I should be grateful if he would try to answer my question.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I thought that I already had. Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights offers protection. But, there is a caveat that such rights do not impinge on the rights of others or the rights contained in the convention itself, such as in article 11. I could not have been more explicit. I thought that I had explained myself to the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West in a sympathetic and sensitive way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister, and note that he responded in a considered and thoughtful manner.
<P>
I do not accept the validity of his argument&#151;notably his reference to the Human Rights Act 1998 and article 11 of the European convention, which provides the right to join a trade union but offers no obligation to recognise one. In this instance, the fundamental human right to freedom to practise one's religion comes not against a counterbalancing human right but rather a mere element of the proposed legislation.
<P>
This is a sad moment because the religious freedom of minorities is important. I had hoped that the Minister could give more encouragement to hon. Members who have spoken in support of the freedom of the Brethren to continue living according to the scriptures. He has not done that. As in so many matters, I am grateful for the wise counsel of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, and I shall listen to his advice. In so doing, I implore the Minister to think again more carefully, and to recognise that he and his right hon. and hon. Friends have a further opportunity to consider the right way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes his case with sensitivity, as did the Minister. We simply have a democratic disagreement. Does my hon. Friend accept that in taking his stance, the Minister is defending and promoting the rights within Brethren-owned businesses of very small minorities of employees? We are arguing for a slightly more substantial minority and the Minister seems to be resting his case on a small minority of a minority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> My hon. Friend may have a valid point, but I would not wish to be diverted in that direction.
<P>
The fundamental principle of religious freedom is such that all other arguments that have been adduced must pale into insignificance. I do not wish to live in a country that does not afford religious freedom to minorities. I am sad that the Minister has not given us more reassurance. Nonetheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I would like to speak to my amendment No. 82 and the consequential amendment No. 85. I hope that the Minister will genuinely understand that I am trying to simplify and improve the Bill. The Minister has his clause to ensure that people have a right to be accompanied when they meet employers in grievance or disciplinary procedures. My amendment would simply strike out any conditions relating to the person who should accompany an individual.
<P>
In many circumstances&#151;an endless list, I am sure, could be drawn&#151;people do not have access to a trade union official, especially if the workplace is not a trade union shop. When people face disciplinary problems, they might well be at odds with the union in the workplace. The reference to other workers is also inappropriate. Again, people being disciplined may be in trouble because all the other workers are upset about them. Other workers may even be pressing for disciplinary action and may want an individual to get the sack.
<P>
Removing the conditions as to who accompanies an individual would simplify the Bill and make it easier for that individual to exercise his rights. An individual should be able to decide that he wants to be accompanied by X, Y or Z. That would even deal with the points raised earlier about trade unions and the Brethren. It should not have to be a trade unionist who accompanies an individual, and that might well help the Brethren with their problem.
<P>
We should also consider the de minimis issue. If my secretary had a problem, the only person by whom she could be accompanied under the clause would be the other worker&#151;my wife. That is ridiculous. In a very small company, there might only be the boss and one employee. Is the boss to accompany the employee? Having provided a right to be accompanied, why should it be restricted only to people who have access to a trade unionist or who want a co-worker to go into a disciplinary hearing with them? As I said, people often do not want co-workers&#151;much as they love them dearly&#151;with them because they do not want them to hear what goes on in the disciplinary proceedings. I hope that the Minister will accept that the amendments are intended to improve the Bill and that he will accept them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I shall be brief in speaking to amendments Nos. 86 and 94. I was concerned at first that it could be held that there was some division between my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset and myself because amendment No. 86 states that only a representative of a recognised trade union should be acceptable, whereas my hon. Friend suggested that anyone should be acceptable. Having heard his speech, I am greatly reassured that there is no necessary conflict between the two positions in so far as anyone other than a member of a recognised trade union would be permissible under my hon. Friend's logic.
<P>
I tabled amendment No. 86 simply to avoid the possibility of clause 11 being used to circumvent provisions elsewhere in the Bill concerning trade union recognition. Where a vote in a company goes against recognition of a trade union, it is inappropriate for an employee to bring a trade union representative with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way; it saves me from making a speech. Does he agree that in the particular case mentioned when I proposed amendment No. 88, a group of workers could be involved in a grievance and could invite a trade union official to represent them, notwithstanding the fact that a recognition ballot had been unsuccessful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Indeed. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention. It brings me back to a point I made earlier about the potential to build a general collective grievance from a personal or individual grievance. This is a matter to which the Minister should pay attention. He should consider whether there may not be a way to tighten the Bill to avoid such possibilities.
<P>
Amendment No. 94 deals with the appropriateness of an employee of another employer being called to represent or accompany an employee of the first employer. Clearly, there is potential for abuse. An employee who has to travel a long distance may be given a right of absence from his employer. It may require an absence of a day or conceivably more to attend a disciplinary or grievance hearing with a friend or other associate. It is infinitely more sensible to extend the right only to an employee of the same company, where there may be a closer relationship and some better understanding. It also keeps the matter within the confines of the employment relationship in that business. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I could deal with this in two ways and I shall take the judgement of hon. Members. I can give a commitment to turn my extensive speaking notes into a detailed note to every member of the Committee. Hon. Members could then consider, given that we have discussed the principles of the clause, whether they want to reserve their position to table amendments on Report. If that is not acceptable I will go through it all in detail. Is it acceptable to write to hon. Members?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am happy with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will ensure that that happens.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Accept the amendment, that is quicker.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is out of luck once again. If a detailed note is acceptable, I give the commitment to write to hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I see that my colleagures are looking at the clock. On the understanding that the Minister, seeing the logic of our proposal, might like to table his own amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 72, in page 6, line 22, leave out `within' and insert `before the end of'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 73.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The Government have looked at the wording of subsection 5, which permits a worker to propose an alternative to the hearing if his chosen companion is unavailable at the date or time initially suggested by the employer. As drafted, the provision provides an unnecessarily narrow range of dates from which the employer can select an alternative.
<P>
The amendments provide greater flexibility in setting the date for the hearing. They should go a long way to ensuring that the employer, the worker and the accompanying person are available and have time to prepare for the hearing. Their effect is to tie the date for the alternative hearing that may be proposed by the worker to the date proposed by the employer instead of the date on which he is informed by the employer of the hearing.
<P>
To illustrate that point, let me take an example. The worker is informed on Monday 1 March that the hearing will take place on Friday 5 March. Under the existing clause, the worker has to suggest as an alternative date any working day before and including the Monday of the next week, 8 March. The amendment widens this and allows the worker to suggest as a date any working day before and including Friday 12 March.
<P>
The amendment is a sensible change and it should help to deal with some of the practical problems on notice and availability faced by both sides which may arise if the scope to propose an alternative date is too narrow. It will avoid the kind of undesirable situation in which a worker is forced to nominate an alternative date for a hearing that is much earlier than the one originally proposed by the employer, thus creating a problem for the employer in meeting that request. I can go into greater detail if hon. Members wish, but I hope that they will accept the amendments as an aid to both employer and employee in coming to a sensible arrangement between themselves.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government amendment No. 75.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Amendments Nos. 74 and 75 are technical drafting amendments which tidy up the wording in subsections (2) and (3). Those subsections specify the way in which the right to accompaniment applies to home-workers and agency workers. The amendments should make it simpler for all parties to understand how that right applies to those groups of workers. If unamended, the closing words of subsections (2) and (3), which refer to employers of such workers, might lead to uncertainty.
<P>
It is sometimes difficult to determine in law who, if anyone, is the employer of an agency or home worker. In the case of agency workers, the agent and the principal may legitimately argue that they are not the employers. The current drafting is ambiguous, and a principal or an agent might try to exploit that ambiguity to argue that, to be entitled to his rights, a worker must prove that one or other is the employer. That is not the clause's intention.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 74 and 75 would solve the problem by adding express provision to the closing words of subsections (2) and (3).
<P>
Amendment No. 74 would deem either the agent or the principal to be the employer of an agency worker for the purpose of the right that we are considering. The right would apply when either or them asked a worker to attend a disciplinary or grievance hearing. The worker might have a grievance against the agency if he felt that he was being underpaid, and he might have a grievance against the principal if he felt that he was being racially abused at the temporary workplace.
<P>
Amendment No. 75 would deem a person who contracted work from a home worker to be that worker's employer. It is a sensible clarification that removes any room for doubt and unnecessary legal dispute.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
