Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing amendments Nos. 458, in page 107, line 9, after `(b)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`following paragraph (d) there shall be inserted—
<P>
``(e) that, in respect of information concerning persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom, a prescribed intermediary acting on behalf of such persons may submit an aggregate return as to the amounts of interest received by or on behalf of all such persons for whom he acts, without disclosing the identities of each individual person;''.'.<P>

<P>
No. 460, in page 108, line 17, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(10A) Information obtained by the Board of Inland Revenue pursuant to sections 17 and 18 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 as amended by this section may be passed by them only to tax authorities outside the United Kingdom if those authorities are—
<P>
(a) located in a Member State of the European Union; or
<P>
(b) located in a territory with which the United Kingdom has entered into arrangements for the mutual exchange of such information.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I spoke at some length before lunch, answering the points of principle raised by the amendment. Given my assurances, I conclude by asking the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) to consider withdrawing the amendment,
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): Despite the good will engendered by your presence, Dr. Clark, and despite the fact that we have enjoyed a pleasant lunch break, I am bound to say that the Paymaster General has not answered the major point of principle, although she has answered some of the minor ones—those that are less important in my mind than the great overwhelming issue.
<P>
I restate that point of principle. We fear that when it comes to it, the European Union may be preparing itself—and Ministers may be preparing themselves to allow the EU—to implement the provisions on exchange of information within the EU, notwithstanding the fact that other jurisdictions, may not wish to sign up to the exchange of information provisions. Within those jurisdictions, major issuing houses operate that could be the centres for issuing such things as eurobonds.
<P>
If the EU were to go forward with its provision for exchange of information, which is reflected in the Bill's provisions, without bringing in at least the United States and perhaps dependent territories and other places, business would remove itself from London on a large scale, exactly as would have occurred, albeit at a slightly lower rate, under the withholding tax provisions that Chancellor has so valiantly fought to remove. It would be a hollow victory.
<P>
The Paymaster General adverted for a moment to that line of reasoning when she drew the Committee's attention to the sequence of events that is meant to occur before the EU's exchange of information provisions are fully implemented. I am bound to say that the hon. Lady did not tell us whether she could guarantee, by whatever means are necessary, including the use of the veto, that the Government would prevent the adoption by the EU of the exchange of information arrangements unless and until other countries outside the EU that are major issuing jurisdictions had also signed on.
<P>
If we can be clear on that, we shall be perfectly willing to let go of an amendment that, as I said this morning, is neither sufficient nor necessary; and we would not then have a major problem with the way in which the Government are proceeding with the banks and the City. We accept what she said in her rejoinder. We accept that much discussion is going on in good faith between the Government, the British Bankers Association and others. The problem is not about domestic implementation but about whether our financial services industry will be irreparably harmed or, as we hope, protected by implementation as a whole.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> To be kind to the hon. Gentleman—without endangering his political career, I hope—his amendments do not deal with the issue. I have dealt with the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I think that I delicately accepted that point when I said that the amendments were neither sufficient nor necessary. They are a vehicle for raising a critical issue of national importance.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman is attempting to use the amendments as a vehicle for a discussion on the European Council's conclusions on tax matters, but the Committee is not the place in which to have such a discussion. The Prime Minister made a statement on the issue to the House. The measures on exchange of information, to which the clause and the hon. Gentleman's amendments refer, are intended specifically to enable the Government to advance their strategy for tackling tax evasion and, in particular, cross-border tax evasion. As I have said on several occasions, the Government wish to be able to do that. However, that wish must be balanced by consideration of the international competitiveness of the City of London. The question certainly does not refer simply to competitiveness in the European Union; one must consider logically where substantial amounts of financial services are provided.
<P>
If I may beg your indulgence, Dr. Clark, I will try to answer the question put by the hon. Member for West Dorset. The conclusions of the European Council were that member states would decide by unanimity whether to adopt the draft directive on exchange of information only when sufficient reassurances were received from third countries, including Switzerland. A parallel process was started. The Prime Minister said to the House on 21 June:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the most important aspects of the agreement that was secured is that we are pursuing, in parallel, exchange of information at an international level with countries such as the United States and Switzerland.—[Official Report, 21 June 2000; Vol. 352, c. 344.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have also spelt out to the hon. Gentleman the importance of reciprocity, of confidentiality for taxpayers and of the administrative arrangements negotiated between the Government and the City for the regulations. I gave the hon. Gentleman a clear answer on the issues that he raised. Given that discussions continue, that is a clear indication of the Government's intention. I hope that that response satisfies him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As usual, the Paymaster General puts her points beautifully, but I am afraid that the evasion here is not tax evasion but the evasion of a simple question. [Laughter.] I have to say that the joke was not as funny as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) imagined.
<P>
We can handle this in 30 seconds. I repeat the question, to which I hope that the answer is yes. That one crystalline term is all that the Paymaster General needs to say. If the other member states want to implement the EU-wide exchange of information provisions without first obtaining an agreement to sign up from at least the United States and Switzerland, will the Government resist that intention by any means necessary, including use of the veto, or by voting against the proposal if unanimity is required to carry it?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It seems that Opposition Members have only one deployment for what I was about to call negotiation, but which for them is not that; their approach is always to say no and demand that we play the veto. Had we pursued that line, as they pressured and encouraged us to do in the past two years, we would not have achieved our current success; the withholding tax has not merely been defeated once but is off the agenda. The hon. Gentleman knows that the question of the withholding tax was discussed before and that the Conservative Government did not veto its introduction. They voted for it.
<P>
I have explained the clear principles on which the Government will judge the outcome of negotiations: sufficient reassurances, reciprocity, exchange of information and its provision under clear principles, and the requirement for unanimity in any vote on the directive that subsequently comes before the Finance Ministers. At that stage, the Chancellor would decide how to vote to achieve the twin objectives of tackling tax evasion but preserving and protecting the competitiveness of the City of London.
<P>
In all honesty, that is the only rational answer to this complex problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I agree with the Paymaster General that you have been very indulgent, Dr. Clark. I do not intend to prolong the proceedings other than to say that that was a splendid example of not quite answering the question. We shall pursue the matter, which is of central importance. I am as yet unpersuaded about the Government's intentions and those of the European Union and I suspect that the Government are unpersuaded, too. The beginnings of a major problem can be seen.
<P>
The clause is merely a tiny piece in a jigsaw, however, and we do not want to press the amendments to a vote. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 461, in page 108, line 19, after `received', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`under arrangements first entered into'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with an issue that the Government may already have taken on board. I recollect that the Paymaster General's comments in our debate on amendment No. 110 dealt with related territory. The amendment is intended to allow for the grandfathering of existing arrangements covered by ``not ordinarily resident'' declarations, which exempt the relevant individuals and institutions from the reporting requirements that apply to United Kingdom residents.
<P>
As the Paymaster General will know, there would be a large regulatory burden, which it would not always be possible to discharge, on stockbrokers, banks and similar entities, in reorganising their client portfolios to comply with the changes without the exemption that I have referred to. Surely that would be at odds with the Revenue press release of 21 March, which stated that the package of measures met deregulatory benefits for the businesses affected. I hope that this morning's discussion was not too extensive, because, in the stand part debate, I would like to discuss the wider issue of the situations in which the clause will apply.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amendment would prevent the provisions from applying to interest on existing accounts and investments as well as on any accounts opened, or investments made, between now and 5 April 2001. To exclude them would be contrary to the policy that the Government have successfully launched for the exchange of information, and undermine our ability to continue to play a leading role.
<P>
In our debate on clause 110, in response to amendment No. 368 tabled by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, I spelled out the agreement that we had reached about ``not ordinarily resident'' declarations, and how that would operate before and after 6 April 2001. The amendment is unnecessary because my previous response dealt with the point that the hon. Gentleman has raised, and we have debated and agreed on the issue. We do not need to make further changes to avoid the problems that might have occurred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for her response. I thought that the matter might have been dealt with, but the amendment was tabled before the discussion on clause 110. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I want to raise what might be called a macro point. Broadly speaking, the exchange of information and the policing of citizens paying tax on their interest in their own countries are not an issue in the United Kingdom, continental Europe, north America and Canada. The problem areas are Asia, parts of Africa and many countries in which there are oppressive regimes and it is still a crude necessity to have a nest egg tucked away. Furthermore, in the middle east there are, broadly speaking, no taxes, and individuals from that region would not keep their money in the United Kingdom, owing to their desire for confidentiality about the size of their assets.
<P>
As measures such this are debated, the Government will have to distinguish between those different regions, although I do not know how they will do that. I am afraid that, if the end result is a blanket arrangement that applies everywhere, the £1,000 billion or so deposited in London will be vulnerable. That money may move to poorly regulated locations, in which business is conducted in a less proper manner.
<P>
I cannot resist making the point that one of the major problems in continental Europe has been the blurring of the distinction between tax evasion and tax avoidance. Anyone who has had a commercial career will know that there are billions of pounds-worth of German personal and corporate money sloshing around undeclared. I welcome arrangements to tighten up on that situation.
<P>
The Revenue will be given wide powers to make regulations via statutory instruments that cover the information in the returns, and also cover the rules that it will seek to impose on banks about the inspection of books, documents and records. It would be better if those were handled by primary legislation, so that there was no risk of the Department circumventing other statutory provisions that require it to obtain a commissioner's permission before sending a notice to a bank demanding documentation in respect of its customers.
<P>
The Government may have considered the worries about how the Revenue will be enabled to inspect books, documents and other records beyond checking the returns of interest paid and received. Concern was expressed that the formalities of section 20 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 may be circumvented, and that the Revenue will have automatic access to records without checks and balances. The main protection against that seems to be for the measures to be dealt with by primary rather than secondary legislation.
<P>
There are five key issues in the territory covered by clause 140. The first is the concept of establishing the white list of countries to be excluded from the new regime.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sorry, but I did not catch what the hon. Gentleman said. What list of countries did he mention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> A white list—call it what one likes. The countries excluded would be those with political issues that made it extremely difficult for the regime to apply, or those with no clear taxation. Secondly, the exchange of information should in the first instance take place only within the EU and other countries with which the UK has double taxation treaties. Thirdly, we discussed that there should be grandfathering of all current ``not ordinarily resident'' declarations, and the Paymaster General has confirmed that. Fourthly, consideration should be given to a system of aggregated reporting based on US withholding tax changes. Fifthly, the Government should clearly demonstrate that the proposals are deregulatory, which I am not convinced is the case at present.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised several matters, including the white list, specifying the countries that are to be exchanged with, which assumes that those not listed would not collect information. He also considered the need for two lists, the exchange of information, reciprocity, evasion and audit arrangements, and made a general point about what I shall politely describe as the nervousness of investors.
<P>
We covered some of those points this morning, as it was important to air them, so I shall shorten my remarks. The hon. Gentleman will be able to check the report of the proceedings of our previous sitting. I said that I fully appreciated that there were several reasons, including some unrelated to tax, why investors require confidentiality. I packaged them in terms of how we ensured the confidential nature of the returns that we hold.
<P>
I made it clear that we would not exchange until we were satisfied that the country with which we were seeking an agreement respected the confidentiality of taxpayers to the same extent as the UK, and that the information was specifically sought for tax-related purposes. I am trying delicately to sweep over several issues that are perhaps best not spelt out in Committee. Investors concerns about confidentiality are an important element in their choice of investment location, so we must be careful about that. That is why we are still in consultation and negotiation, which has been productive, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged when we discussed clause 110.
<P>
As I said this morning, I want to reassure the Committee that, like all information held by the Inland Revenue, the information obtained as a result of clause 140 will be subject to strict safeguards. In no circumstances will information be passed on unless we are satisfied that the other country respects confidentiality to the same extent as the UK or without the condition that the information will be used only for tax purposes.
<P>
Quite apart from the question of confidentiality, I recognise that the banks are concerned to keep reporting obligations to manageable proportions. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs put forward a suggestion which he called the white list. Our discussion this morning focused on ensuring that administrative requirements are kept to an absolute minimum, otherwise the measures could be counter-productive in terms of reducing the burdens on the City of London. The proposition centres on how we manage the administrative arrangements, which is already the subject of discussions with representatives in the City, but it is possible that the hon. Gentleman's suggestion of a white list could put more administrative burdens on the City because people would need to know what was on the list, determine where the person was and carry out several cross checks before releasing the information. The Revenue must pass on the crucial information, but we also recognise that there is an issue about the collection of information for which we do not have a requirement at the time. We want to have an agreed procedure with the City about the collection of information, but we need to discuss what information we shall require at any time to fulfil international obligations that have been negotiated on exchange of information. That relates to the proposals for a white list raised by the hon. Gentleman. In fact, one of the amendments that we discussed this morning suggested that we should get around that by an aggregate. As I explained, that would completely defeat our objectives. I took that amendment to be a probing amendment designed to elicit assurances from the Government that we are pursing a course that will keep administrative burdens to a minimum.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about primary versus secondary legislation. The reason why the procedure is contained in regulations is because that enables us to consult more fully with the City on all the details to ensure that we have a workable set of proposals. That is working well because it has enabled us to respond. As the hon. Gentleman saw in relation to clause 110, it makes the Finance Bill messy and is undesirable for those who must try to make sense of our proceedings if we constantly amend measures that were discussed in April. Therefore, it is desirable for the measures to be contained in regulations, and it also provides safeguards for the City and the Government.
<P>
I think that I have probably answered the final point. The Government rejected the arguments for the withholding tax in order to tackle tax evasion and to ensure that the right tax was paid at the right time and in the right place. The Helsinki convention has established that principle, but there is still a long way to go. As I said, the international trend is clearly to tackle cross-border tax evasion. The Government agree with that and are at the forefront in the discussions on how to do it sensibly while preserving the competitiveness of financial markets.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We recognise the need to ensure that the information is verified as legitimate, and that it is not used for other purposes. Discussions with the City of London are going well, and we hope that the regulations will be concluded soon. I would not want the Committee to close our options in those discussions, because we and the financial markets are at one in wanting to tackle tax evasion and to ensure the competitiveness of the financial markets. That is a good partnership, and the clause offers a good formula for delivering what we seek to achieve.
<P>
It was right for the Opposition to air those points; I have no objections. It is also right for Ministers to put such assurances on the record. I hope that I have covered the matters raised by the hon. Gentleman, some of which still have to be concluded.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for her response. Differentiating between countries will be a problem. The practical reality is that we shall end up saying that some countries are properly run and some are not. It will be difficult to craft regulations and arrangements to deal with that—the key point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset—as we move down the path represented by the proposals.
<P>
The Paymaster General knows of the concerns expressed by the British Bankers Association. I am pleased to hear about the sensitivity with which the Government are negotiating, and I hope that they manage to craft arrangements that, in terms of our economic interests, will prevent us from shooting ourselves through the foot or having to put up with an additional burden of regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): I must respond to some of the arguments developed by Opposition Members, particularly the hon. Member for West Dorset, who elaborated the extraordinary argument that, because some countries outside the EU do not want to exchange information, we should therefore not have a system of information exchange within the EU.
<P>
If one applied that principle to criminal activities, one would have to ask whether we should exchange information within the EU about criminal activities and the whereabouts of criminals if Switzerland would not collaborate in a reciprocal manner. If the Opposition seek to make a point of principle in relation to the fight against those who seek to avoid taxes, they need to explain the difference.
<P>
What point of principle do they seek to defend? It would have been much more principled for the Opposition to have admitted that they have got it wrong. They said that the Government would have to bow under pressure from other European countries to introduce a withholding tax and so on, and that we would not be able to prevail with the information exchange arrangements that the clause seeks to incorporate. It would have been more principled to admit that they had got it wrong, and congratulate the Government on preventing the imposition of a withholding tax an having in its stead an information exchange system.
<P>
We have succeeded by not having to play the veto. Again and again, the hon. Member for West Dorset said that we should play the veto. The Opposition seem to regard playing the veto as the measure of one's success in Europe, when, in fact, success is convincing other European Union member states of one's point of view. That is exactly what has happened in the case of the information exchange system. We have not had to play the veto because we have built up alliances, because of our constructive engagement and because our arguments have prevailed. It is incumbent on the hon. Member for West Dorset at least to recognise that.
<P>
It is time for the Opposition to say that they are wrong and that the information exchange system is the right one. It is good that the clause will give the system to Britain; and excellent that, because of our constructive engagement with the EU, information exchange will be extended to the rest Europe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The debate is going a little wide of the clause. The hon. Member may respond, but I should be grateful if his response was brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is very generous of you, Dr. Clark. I quite agree with your observation that we are going wide of the clause, and I shall be brief.
<P>
It is ironic that the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale) should make such remarks, because many people in his constituency will be directly affected adversely by the provision. He does not understand something that the Paymaster General understands perfectly well. The hon. Lady evaded the direct question, but she at least displayed in her quasi-answer a full understanding of the issue. I shall briefly explain it to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The provision is not analogous to criminal proceedings. We are not talking about whether Switzerland needs to be part of the gang in order to make it right to prevent people engaging nefarious activities. We are talking about whether we export a large number of depositors and investors to Switzerland—and prospective depositors and investors—so that they can carry on doing there later whatever they do here now. That will be of no advantage to anyone in this country, and to the great advantage of certain gnomes in Zurich and their analogues in Geneva. The reason is straightforward; if they do not sign up to the same provisions that we sign up to, it becomes much more onerous for certain investors and depositors to invest or deposit here and to do so in Switzerland.
<P>
That is common ground between the Paymaster General, the Government and the Opposition. We are talking about whether we can be assured that the EU's provisions will not proceed until what the EU has signalled it would like to achieve has been achieved—namely the signing up of Switzerland and the United States. Again, that is common ground between the Government and the Opposition—and, indeed, between the Government and the rest of Europe.
<P>
It is no part of our argument that things ought to be vetoed for the fun of it. We are talking about whether the Government should veto the provision if it is not achievable because they cannot get the others in on the act. That was the point at which the Paymaster General moved from a clear-minded answer to a clear-minded refusal to answer directly. That is regrettable, but at least she and I understand each other. The hon. Member for Wimbledon needs to read the record of our proceedings and apologise to his constituents for trying to take up a cause that is wholly adverse to their interests.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 141 deals with territory that I alluded to in the stand part debate on clause 140. We are concerned that the arrangements for the exchange of information with other countries may include countries with a poor human rights record, whose rules of confidentiality in respect of such information may not be as strict as those that apply in the United Kingdom.
<P>
It may not be a suitable example, but China comes to mind as being a difficult case. It is a dictatorial country, and many individuals may have undisclosed savings tucked away overseas in case they have to flee. Equally, we may wish to do a lot more business with China and real commercial pressures may come to bear for making a reciprocal arrangement with China.
<P>
The explanatory notes make it clear that the intention is that the exchanges will be for tax purpose only and that they will be bound by the rules of confidentiality. Our two amendments clarify and magnify that point and make it clear that there must be a good reason to suppose that a tax liability exists to stop potential fishing expeditions and respect individuals' privacy. Amendments Nos. 462 and 463 are in essence the same amendment to different parts of the clause.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I hope to answer the questions raised by the hon. Gentleman and show him that his amendments are not necessary. I accept the points on which he seeks clarification.
<P>
Clauses 141 and 142 allow the United Kingdom to make new tax information exchange agreements with other countries to exchange information for the purposes of income tax, capital gains tax, corporation tax and inheritance tax. They also allow the Inland Revenue to disclose information under the terms of those agreements—a point on which the hon. Gentleman seeks clarification. The agreements are part of a package of measures designed to enhance international exchange of information which, as I said, the Government believe is the best way to tackle cross-border evasion and avoidance of tax. The agreements contain safeguards to protect the use and disclosure of information; they will improve the current arrangements and help ensure that taxpayers pay the right amount of tax at the right time in the right country.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 462 and 463 seek to limit the scope of the new tax information exchange agreements by requiring them to contain certain express safeguards to limit the use of information, protect taxpayer confidentiality and prevent the use of tax information exchange agreements in trivial cases. The amendments are not necessary because the safeguards that are already applied to information exchanged under the UK's existing arrangements will also be applied in due course to the new tax information exchange agreements.
<P>
We regard the proper protection of taxpayer confidentiality as essential in maintaining the integrity of the tax system. That principle applies in our dealings with other countries, which is why stringent safeguards are built into our current legislation and practice to protect taxpayer confidentiality. As I said in the previous debate, we focus only on information that is relevant to tax purposes. For example, all Inland Revenue officials are subject to strict statutory and common law duties of confidentiality. That duty is such that they are permitted to supply information to other tax authorities only when obliged to do so under the terms of a treaty or the EU mutual assistance directive. Before passing information to another country under the mutual assistance directive, the Inland Revenue must be satisfied that the other country is bound by rules of confidentiality no less strict than those that apply in the UK. For all our existing exchange of information arrangements, the receiving country is required to use the information only for tax purposes.
<P>
The need to protect taxpayer confidentiality and to ensure that information is used only for tax purposes is firmly embodied in clauses 141 and 142. In particular, proposed new subsection (2ZA) in clause 141 and proposed new subsection 220A(5) in clause 142 provide expressly that information will not be disclosed unless the Inland Revenue is satisfied that the confidentiality rules applied by the other country are no less strict than those applying in the UK. The Government will ensure that the agreements contain safeguards to guarantee that information can be used only for tax purposes. It is important that the new tax information exchange agreements will come into force only once approved by resolution of the House, in the same way in which we approve double taxation agreements.
<P>
As there is an opportunity for scrutiny, the amendments are unnecessary. They would require that information received by the UK authorities be treated as confidential, but that would add nothing to the common law and statutory principles of taxpayer confidentiality, which prohibit disclosure of taxpayer information received other than in tightly drawn circumstances. In some cases, disclosure is subject to criminal sanction.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are sympathetic to the thought behind the amendments, as the provisions in proposed new section (lA)(iii) and (iv) of amendment No. 462 are aimed at preventing exchange of information in trivial or speculative cases. I think that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs used the term ``fishing expeditions'' to describe such cases. On that subject too, the legislation already contains safeguards to ensure that persons in the UK required to provide information on third parties do not have to do so without the approval of a commissioner. Those safeguards will be applied to the new tax information exchange agreements as a result of clause 141(3) and clause 142(2). As with all existing exchange of information arrangements, all exchanges will be channelled through a competent authority in each state, which will ensure that the terms and conditions of the agreements are properly observed.
<P>
In the UK, the competent authority is the Board of Inland Revenue, which delegates its exchange of information function to only a small number of senior Inland Revenue officials. In practice, that means that all information received from and sent to other countries is strictly controlled and subject to procedures that ensure that information is exchanged only if the terms of the relevant agreement are met.
<P>
We take the concerns that underlie the amendments seriously, as they are important. However, we believe that the agreements for confidentiality are already adequately covered in UK law and by the proposals in the clauses. Proper safeguards on the use and disclosure of information are a feature of our current exchange of information agreements and will be included in the new tax information agreements. They will come into force only after being approved by resolution of the House.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the Government have paid due regard to the important issues, and will consider withdrawing his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for her helpful response. Before I seek leave to withdraw the amendment, I want to ask her what the Government's policy is on the human rights issue. Appropriate confidentiality arrangements may be in place, but a country may have a poor human rights record, as well as other matters to which I alluded. There is an issue on both counts as to whether Her Majesty's Government would think it appropriate to enter into specific information exchange arrangements with countries that have poor human rights records.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): I listened with care to the sensitive way in which the Paymaster General dealt with the matter. Notwithstanding taxpayer confidentiality, in the light of the growing use of the procedures that she described, do Treasury Ministers intend to seek reports from time to time from the chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue as to the degree to which the facilities are being put to use? I do not suggest that the Paymaster General, or any Treasury Minister, should make inquiries about who has been investigated. However, Ministers should keep an eye on the degree to which the facilities are used, and satisfy themselves that the powers are being properly and appropriately applied.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> There are two issues that I must address in response to the comments made. First, there is the issue of how and when we enter into international agreements with another country and what safeguards we seek in those negotiations. As regards human rights, the legislation is pertinent only to tax and to information about a resident of another country who may receive payments in the United Kingdom. In our negotiations, we will ensure that all the points about confidentiality and use of material are covered. It is difficult, in a Committee, to talk about the complex discussions that are held about double tax agreements and other such issues. The United Kingdom will not enter into an agreement with any country unless we are satisfied that it has provisions to safeguard the confidentiality of taxpayer information to a standard that is no less strict than ours. We are operating with a tight series of conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I understand the point that the Paymaster General is making. However, China, for example, has a death penalty for corruption. Perfectly good arrangements may be in place, but evidence from the United Kingdom could easily lead to someone's execution in China, if we had an agreement with that country. With our human rights standards, we would not regard that as acceptable. The exchange of information could lead to a knock-on effect on a separate territory.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It is difficult and perhaps unwise to discuss individual countries. However, I take the hon. Gentleman's point; we should all bear it in mind when we consider the agreements, which will be subject to the resolution of the House. That follows on the point made by the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) about monitoring procedures as they develop, which is what we will do with double taxation. I know that, when the right hon. Gentleman was Financial Secretary, he took an active interest in how the double taxation treaties developed, and in the countries involved. He appreciated that those agreements came under the care and management category for the Inland Revenue, but that they were of political interest to Treasury Ministers and the Government as a whole. Given the Government's objective of developing exchange of information as a way to tackle tax evasion, I imagine that Ministers will want to follow the matter closely. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs also made a valid point about with whom we make such agreements, and on what basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My interest was aroused by the fact that, in a parallel situation such as extradition proceedings between countries, we would not allow someone to be extradited to face a greater punishment than they would face in the United Kingdom. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs might have been tiptoeing round that point with regard to the disclosure of information about the tax affairs in the United Kingdom of a third-party national that might lead to that person receiving a penalty in their country greater than would be the case here. Such matters are delicate, which was why I was grateful for the assurance of the Paymaster General that Ministers would remain vigilant about the way in which the powers operated. Exchanges of information for proper and understandable reasons are traditional in tax regimes. However, one wants to make certain that exchanges of information are used for proper purposes, especially by those making inquiries of our tax authorities.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> These are delicate matters. They crop up with regard to issues in the tax system and we have procedures for dealing with such situations. I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs have put it on the record that they acknowledge the importance of being vigilant on those issues. I agree that these are complex areas of policy—let me not make it sound like a geographical issue, lest I am misinterpreted—but other, wider considerations must be considered. We are trying to develop and advance general principles with the City of London. There will of course be greyer, more difficult areas to which we should pay clear attention. I am seeking not to mislead the Committee but to acknowledge that sensitivity without making a commitment, which would be unhelpful to all concerned. The most important thing is that we continue to say that we will respect confidentiality and that we will expect people with whom we exchange information to have the same standards of confidentiality that we apply, as is the case now. That there are other considerations follows naturally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am comfortable with the Paymaster General's reply. The amendments have raised the issue and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The three amendments make the same point. The important issue that I wish to clarify relates to accepted human rights of privacy of the citizen and of his protection against the state. The National Minimum Wage Act 1998, the principle of which we have conceded, will be enforced by the Inland Revenue. That will probably be more practical than inventing another cadre of officials to deal with it. The Act permits officers to use information held by the Inland Revenue. The Revenue will probably have relevant details about pay and salaries, which it will have obtained under the accepted procedures. However, we question the use of the national minimum wage procedures as a possible front for allowing the Inland Revenue to raid employers to dig up information that it cannot find under its existing powers. Therefore, the amendment is designed to ring fence the information that officers may pass on under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I am astonished to hear that. Is the hon. Gentleman really suggesting that, if an employer is sufficiently penny pinching to try to weasel out of paying the national minimum wage, and is found out by an Inland Revenue officer who then discovers a host of other tax avoidance offences, the officer should turn a blind eye and not pursue the matter any further?
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> What an extraordinary intervention. I am not discussing what else may be found. My point is that if such an investigation were to take place, the hon. Gentleman's salary—should he work for such an organisation—would be a private matter.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Sometimes the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs has a lovely turn of phrase. He said something like, ``National minimum wage—now that we have conceded it''. I thought that the shadow Chancellor had tried to make it sound more positive than that, but apparently there has been an acceptance of the national minimum wage. However, the hon. Gentleman raised questions about the information available to the Inland Revenue, so it is important to say what the clause will do.
<P>
Clause 143 allows information obtained by the Revenue's national minimum wage officers in carrying out their duties to be used by the Revenue for any of its functions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) said, it would be wholly inappropriate for our national minimum wage enforcement officers to discover cases of PAYE or national insurance avoidance or a cash-in-hand transaction and walk away from it on the basis that the information is irrelevant to the tax authorities.
<P>
The clause also enables agricultural wages information obtained by the Department of Trade and Industry for national minimum wage purposes to be disclosed to the Revenue and used for any of its functions. As hon. Members will know, the Revenue has responsibility for enforcement of the national minimum wage. For example, at present, if a national minimum wage officer discovers information about tax irregularities while carrying out his duties, he cannot pass on the information to his tax colleagues. That is bizarre. Why should those officers not share that information with the Revenue?
<P>
Clause 143 tidies up that position. I am sure that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is not suggesting that, if a national minimum wage officer discovers that someone is paid part of his wages cash in hand, the Revenue officers should just walk away. However, he seemed to imply that there was an all-encompassing requirement. If an officer notices the evasion or non-declaration of tax, that information should be available to the Revenue.
<P>
The three amendments would restrict the information that may be disclosed under the clause, so that it would relate only to salary or pay. As I said, that would not give the full picture because someone could be paid a combination of declared salary and cash in hand—money that does not go through the books. A company that tries to conceal the situation by keeping more cash in the company and paying cash in hand may also manipulate national insurance. It is unacceptable that a national minimum wage officer should not be able to do anything if he should discover such a situation during the course of a visit. That information should be passed on to the relevant part of the Inland Revenue. The clause provides that information that is relevant to the powers of the Inland Revenue to ensure the proper payment of tax by a company will be pursued.
<P>
Nothing untoward is taking place in the overwhelming majority of cases, but we must ensure that the relevant authorities can act where something untoward is occurring. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the clause does not infringe people's rights—quite the reverse; the clause provides a way of ensuring that people's rights are upheld. Non-payment of national insurance contributions or payment cash in hand has dramatic and possibly, drastic implications for that individual's further entitlement to any contributory benefits or to his pension entitlement. We cannot tolerate that. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied that this is a limited measure to give the Revenue powers that it should logically have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Just to dot the i, will the Minister confirm that national minimum wage officers will be bound by the same terms of confidentiality as normal Inland Revenue officers?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Absolutely. The same terms bind Inland Revenue officers. If the hon. Gentleman has any fears that the confidentiality of taxpayers will be broken, I can assure him that that will not be the case.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`20BA.—(1) An authorised officer of the Board, or in Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal, may for the purpose of an investigation of an offence involving serious fraud in connection with, or in relation to, tax apply to the appropriate judicial authority for an order under sub-section (2) below in relation to particular material or material of a particular description.

(i) to the benefit likely to accrue to the investigation if the material is obtained; and
<P>
(ii) to the circumstances under which the person in possession of the material holds it, that the material should be produced or that access to it should be given.
<P>
(5) Where the appropriate judicial authority makes an order under subsection (2)(b) above in relation to material on any premises he may, on the application of the authorised officer of the Board, or in Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal, order any person who appears to him to be entitled to grant entry to the premises to allow a constable or person commissioned by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to enter the premises to obtain access to the material.

<P>
(c) may be made in relation to material in the possession of an authorised Government department.
<P>
(9) An authorised officer of the Board shall not make an application under subsection (1) unless he has first obtained the approval of the Board of the Inland Revenue to proceed with that application.
<P>
(10) For the purposes of this section—
<P>
(a) ``the appropriate judicial authority'' is—
<P>
(i) in England and Wales, a circuit judge;
<P>
(ii) in Scotland, a sheriff and
<P>
(iii) in Northern Ireland, a county court judge;
<P>
(b) any reference in this section to an offence involving serious fraud in connection with or in relation to tax is a reference to an offence or offences involving fraud in connection with or in relation to tax for which a person who has attained the age of 21 and has no previous convictions could reasonably be expected to be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 3 years or more.

<P>
No. 452, in clause 145, page 112, line 43, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Dr. Clark, as you, the Committee and the Paymaster General assume, the amendments have arisen from briefings that we have received from the Law Society of Scotland. I cannot claim to be a specialist in Scottish law myself. The first, main and lengthy amendment, No. 441, takes cognisance of the role of the procurator fiscal in criminal proceedings in Scotland, and provides criteria on which such orders may be granted. The criteria specified are analogous to those in comparable legislative provisions, such as section 18 of the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act 1995 and section 31 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995.
<P>
The amendment provides a definition of the term ``serious fraud'' and would ensure that the authorised officer of the board would not make an application under the clause until he had obtained the approval of the Board of Inland Revenue. The amendment is also designed to probe the extent of the sheriff's powers to grant such orders.
<P>
The clause appears to take little account of the Scottish dimension. It envisages that an application will be made ``by an authorised officer'', but no reference is made to the procurator fiscal's role in Scotland in obtaining such orders. In Scotland, inspection or production orders under the 1995 Acts are sought on the application of the officer. In the interests of consistency, it appears to the Law Society of Scotland that similar orders should be made through that channel and process.
<P>
There is no apparent definition of the term ``serious fraud'' in the clause. It ought to be included, as its interpretation will necessarily be central to the granting of such orders. Given the extent of the powers proposed and the possibility of criminal sanction, it is surely necessary that there be clarity in the interpretation of the phrase, and that it is not left to individuals to make subjective decisions about it.
<P>
If such orders are to be granted, they should be clearly specific in their terms. Subsection (1) of proposed new section 20BA of the Taxes Management Act 1970 purports to lay down conditions that must be fulfilled before the judicial authority can make an order under the provision. Subsection (l)(b) states that judicial authority must be satisfied that the documents sought are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>evidence for the purposes of any proceedings in respect of such an offence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That safeguard falls substantially short of those referred to in comparable provisions.
<P>
Section 18 of the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) 1995 and section 31 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 state that a production order can be granted only if the sheriff is satisfied that the material to which the application relates is likely to be of substantial value, by itself or with other material, to the investigation for which the application was made. There must also be reasonable grounds for believing that it is in the public interest, having regard to the benefit likely to accrue from the investigation.
<P>
The existing statutory requirements ensure that the procurator fiscal should not request an order unless the material sought is likely to be of substantial value to the investigation. Our Scottish colleagues do not see any justification for imposing less onerous considerations on the Inland Revenue when seeking an order under the Taxes Management Act 1970.
<P>
Clause 144 seeks to extend the jurisdiction of a sheriff beyond his or her sheriffdom. The sheriff court is a court of universal jurisdiction, but only within its area. A sheriff has limited jurisdiction, in that his or her powers extend only throughout the sheriffdom of the court to which he or she is appointed. Accordingly, the amendment seeks to ensure that the sheriff will grant orders only when the relevant items can be found in his or her sheriffdom.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 442 and 443 are consequential. Amendment No. 444 seeks to ensure that the relevant procedure is in relation to notice of application for an order provided by rule of court, not by the Board of Inland Revenue. It may not be appropriate for the Board of Inland Revenue, which might have an interest in proceedings, to make provisions in relation to the contents of the notice and the manner in which it will be given. It should be better made by the rule of court.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 448, concerns have been expressed about the drafting of paragraph 9. It might be contempt of court to fail to obtain an order of court, but the conduct described in the paragraph is more akin to an offence against the administration of justice. If a person refuses to produce the relevant material, he or she might be liable to prosecution for attempting to defeat the ends of justice. That is already a crime in common law in Scotland. There would be little justification for the creation of a separate statutory offence. If the Government intend to make provision in statute for such an offence, both the manner of prosecution and level of penalty available on conviction should be specified.
<P>
Consideration must also be given to the mental element necessary to be convicted of such a crime. From the drafting of paragraph 9, it would seem that the offence would be one of strict liability. That would mean that no account could be taken of any reasonable excuse that a third party might have for non-compliance with such an order. It has been argued that only wilful failure to comply should constitute an offence punishable by the criminal law in such circumstances.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 449 would authorise the making of regulations that would deem that service of an order had taken place. There is a question of whether there is justification for such a deeming provision given that failure to obtemper an order might result in criminal sanctions.
<P>
Amendment No. 452 would affect clause 145(5), which seeks to extend the jurisdiction of a sheriff beyond his or her sheriffdom. As has been noted, the sheriff court is a court of universal jurisdiction but only within its area. The amendment would ensure that the sheriff granted warrants only when the relevant items could be found in his or her sheriffdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I wish to put on record that we believe that the Inland Revenue should have adequate powers to combat fraud and that we recognise that it might have to move swiftly in some circumstances, no more so than in serious fraud cases. The clause contains powers to enable an order to be made against individuals, referred to in the explanatory notes as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>unsuspected third parties who have evidence of . . . fraud,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to give up documents to the Inland Revenue. The usual targets for such an order will be lawyers, accountants and bankers. Clause 144(l) should be invoked only with the approval of the Board of Inland Revenue. Under existing law, the board must give approval in applications for obtaining search warrants.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the reason for having the lesser power is to stop the need for a search warrant in the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman describes, which would be more of a problem and more embarrassing for unconnected holders of information, and would be a heavy-handed measure. The proposal is an attempt to alleviate and to prevent situations in which search warrants for premises become necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Paymaster General makes a reasonably good point. She says that obtaining search warrants is a draconian power. I disagree with her because, as the Inland Revenue makes clear in its explanatory notes, the documents in question will be taken from unsuspected third parties. Those parties are likely to have extreme difficulties with those documents, which may be subject to legal professional privilege. I understand that further provisions in the Bill refer to professional privilege and contractual duties of confidentiality—for instance between a client and his banker. We submit that those are extremely tough powers and that the Inland Revenue and the Government should therefore ensure that they are invoked only with the approval and under the supervision of the Board of Inland Revenue.
<P>
Subsection (1) of clause 144 would insert a new section 20BA in the Taxes Management Act 1970. Under subsection (1)(b) of that new section, the judicial authority must be satisfied that the documents sought
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>are or may be m the power or possession<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the relevant person. That provision contemplates that an order may be sought against an individual who does not have the document. A breach of the order will be a contempt of court. We therefore suggest that it should not place an individual in breach of court for not producing a document that he or she does not possess. Proposed new section 20BA should be amended to provide that an individual must deliver up such of the documents as are in his or her power or possession.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I must admit to being a little perplexed about why the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs was such a keen follower of the Scottish legal system. I was relieved to hear him say that he is not an expert. As someone who is not legally qualified, I confess that I am pleased that he does not want to discuss the finer details of the law. That, however, explains amendment No. 441, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not be embarrassed when I tell the Committee why it will not work.
<P>
The clause is an attempt to improve the Inland Revenue's ability to carry out criminal investigations into suspected serious fraud. It enables Revenue investigators to apply for judicial orders requiring people to produce documents that may be needed as evidence of serious tax fraud. The order will need to be made by a circuit judge in England and Wales, by a sheriff in Scotland and by a county court judge in Northern Ireland. That is necessary because it will greatly reduce the need for Inland Revenue investigators to enter and search premises in order to seize documents from people who are not themselves suspected of fraud but who are constrained by law from handing over the documents voluntarily—for instance, banks, accountants and legal advisers.
<P>
The use of the search warrant, as I said in an intervention on the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), may cause considerable commercial embarrassment to the company involved. Therefore, it is incumbent on the Revenue to ensure that the system is smoother and more easily run. To that end, we published early drafts of the clause as a technical note in November 1999, and invited comments on it. I will now hear some more of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> People in private practice have been appreciative of the consultation to which she refers. A dog's breakfast of a series of clauses has been significantly improved as a result.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Good. That is excellent news. Those who responded generally felt that the principle was reasonable. Many thought that the proposed safeguards and limits should be stronger and clearer. We listened carefully to those concerns and altered the clause accordingly. I had long discussions with my officials, believing that people needed to be reassured by the safeguards built into the clause, and that we were using it for the purpose that we claimed for it.
<P>
The consultation included the Justice Department of the Scottish Executive, which was why I was a little perplexed about the introduction of the Scottish dimension. We took careful note of the points made by the Department with regard to Scottish law. I cannot understand where the proposals contained in the amendment come from, given that we have consulted the Department and squared the matter.
<P>
The amendment would replace the text of the clause with a completely redrafted alternative; I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs appreciated that when he moved the amendment. The redraft has some interesting outcomes, and appears to have borrowed heavily from existing legislation, which as the hon. Gentleman himself said, is not related to tax—namely, section 18 of the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act 1995 and section 31 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995. The amendment replaces a measure that was carefully thought out and tailored to the requirements of tax fraud investigations, with an off-the-peg model, roughly altered here and there, which would not operate effectively in the same area.
<P>
The amendment seems to be a cherry-picking of different aspects of the legislation. The amendment does not respect the balance achieved in the precedents on which the measure is based. It merely picks something that it likes from one piece of legislation and something else from another, and puts them together in a draft which, as a result, contains contradictory arrangements. For example, Scottish legislation would allow only seven days as a normal period in which to comply with an order, whereas the published clause allows 10 working days. The amendment follows the published clause at that point, the Scottish precedent. Scottish legislation provides for an application to be made ex parte in Chambers, but the clause provides for hearings to be inter parte, with the intended recipient having the right to attend and make representations. The amendment omits the ex parte provisions found in its model, but fails to provide an explicit statement of the rights that were specifically requested by several respondents during the consultation. The detailed provision of an investigating power of this sort needs to strike a balance—as we have sought to do—between providing the powers that are necessary for the Revenue to pursue and investigate information on serious tax fraud and protecting the individual.
<P>
<H5>6pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred specifically to several amendments and I shall respond briefly to his points. Amendment No. 448 provides for penalties of up to five years in prison for failing to comply with an order, in distinction to schedule 39, which treats such a failure as a contempt of court. Contempt proceedings are the normal sanction for failing to comply with a judge's order; the alternatives suggested by amendment No. 448 are much more severe. It does not seek the necessary balance.
<P>
Amendment No. 452 would prevent a change to the existing search powers, with the intention of improving the efficiency of investigating and duplicating the work of sheriffs. Where several premises in Scotland have to be searched as part of the same investigation, the investigator can go straight to a single sheriff for all the warrants if the place of the suspected crime is in Scotland. However, if the place of the suspected crime is in England, investigators must go separately to the local sheriff for each of the premises in Scotland. Clause 145(5) would enable those investigating a tax crime taking place in England to obtain warrants for premises in Scotland from a single sheriff with territorial jurisdiction over at least one of the premises.
<P>
Amendment No. 441 would also delete a similar provision relating to the production power in clause 144. On the procedural rules, amendment No. 441 would mean that the procedural details of giving a notice about an application hearing would be determined by court rules, not Inland Revenue regulations. Making the procedural rules through regulations would help ensure that they were consistent throughout the United Kingdom, more easily available to tax practitioners and tailored to particular circumstances. The amendment makes one final extraordinary contribution in terms of the bodies to whom it gives powers in Scotland: a customs official or a police officer of a lower status than the Inland Revenue officer provide for under the legislation. The hon. Gentleman is right to seek to ensure that the legislation is proportionate and has the necessary safeguards, that there is no contradiction with Scottish law and that the procedures will be used only in circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to use the stronger search powers.
<P>
I hope that, with that clarification, the additional undertakings on legal privilege and the recognition of the difficulties that may arise in regard to the questions of privilege, the clause and schedule 39 provide a dedicated procedure for resolving such matters, so that professional firms will not be put in jeopardy of contempt. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a Division. If he does, I shall have to ask the Committee to resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Minister reply to my question about subsection (2)? It clearly needs to be amended to provide that a person served must deliver such of the documents as are in his or her possession or power.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not believe that such an amendment is necessary, because the safeguards in the clause give access to such information without needing to use the greater powers of search a warrant. However, I shall look at it again. I paid a lot of attention to the debate on this clause—as one would expect to be paid to all clauses, I should add—particularly because of the sensitivities that surround the Inland Revenue's powers. We must ensure that they are appropriate to deal with the issues that it wishes to investigate but that they are correctly balanced against people's rights. I am satisfied that the clause does that, but I shall consider careful what the hon. Gentleman said and, if there is a problem, I shall return to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I make a brief intervention in order to put something on the record that I have been itching to say since the start of the debate.
<P>
The dialogue aptly illustrates why, with a Bill such as this, the standard Standing Committee procedure is woefully inadequate. The Law Society of Scotland says one thing—I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs will forgive me to saying that he read the brief eloquently—and the Minister then stands up and reads another brief I suspect that I speak for the great majority of members of the Committee, when I say that I have not the slightest idea whether the Law Society or the Minister's officials are right. We have no way of finding out.
<P>
If we were formed as a Select Committee, we could interrogate the Law Society of Scotland to discover the truth. That would advance our view of the legislation and we could act upon that information properly. Alas, in the present format, we shall never know—although someone may write a learned academic treatise in five or 10 years' time that explains the matter. In the meantime, it is as clear as mud. Let us hope that the Minister is right, because she has the votes to carry it off whether she is right or wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset makes a key point. The Paymaster General told the Committee that there had been full consultation with the authorities in Scotland, but that does not seem to have satisfied the Law Society. Perhaps before Report, the Treasury team might consult a little further in Scotland and either put people's minds at rest or take heed that whatever is said to persuade the Treasury is correct. Subject to those comments, I accept the Minister's response.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 451, in page 112, leave out lines 41 and 42.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments have different histories. Some are about further issues raised by the Law Society of Scotland, and some are about issues on which our own team has focused. Amendment No. 445 would adopt the definition of legal professional privilege contained in section 33 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation)(Scotland) Act 1995. It would be less than helpful to have two definitions of the concept of legal privilege contained in statute.
<P>
Amendment No. 467 is on different territory. It seeks to raise an important practical question, which is whether the Inland Revenue can seize tax advice. Given the complexity of our tax law, it is common for tax advisers to set out the pros and cons of courses of action for their clients. In the nature of things, such advice often errs on the side of caution and thoroughness, and may go much further than the Revenue would in practice.
<P>
There is currently animated debate between the Inland Revenue and the tax advisory profession as to precisely what the Inland Revenue is entitled to see in the course of investigations. For example, there are questions about preliminary briefings on transactions. Surely it can be argued that it is not in the public interest for the Revenue to allege fraud and then take a general pop at someone's tax affairs on other, non-fraudulent matters using whatever it may have turned up in the course of its inquiries The amendment seeks to ensure that solicitors undertaking tax advice would be covered and that, when covered, they would not have a commercial advantage over accountants giving equivalent advice.
<P>
The overriding point is that the amendment could not be used to further fraud. That is a large territory, and we could spend a long time debating it. Now is perhaps the right time to resolve that important issue, which has been the result of complicated tax legislation.
<P>
The Law Society of Scotland suggested amendment No. 466. There has been considerable debate about situations in which information will be considered to have been obtained in privileged circumstances. In that sense, the amendment relates to amendment No. 467. The clause provides for an exception to the rule when information comes to the adviser with a view to furthering a criminal purpose. The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Items held with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
has been the subject of consideration by the courts, although it is unclear who must have knowledge of the criminal purpose.
<P>
The amendment reflects the view that legal professional privilege could not be claimed when the adviser was in possession of the information with the intention of furthering the criminal purpose. If the adviser had no knowledge of the criminal purpose, the doctrine could still apply. English law, through the case of Francis and Francis v. Central Criminal Court, has taken a different approach from Sottish law and noted that the exception to the privilege will apply even when the adviser is the innocent dupe of a third party who intends to further a criminal purpose. The case has not been approved of in Scots law, although reference has been made to it. Clarification is required as to the interpretation to be placed on the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Items held with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That will have implications for the legal profession, so the provision must be clear on when information can or cannot be disclosed.
<P>
Amendment No. 447 reflects the view that it would not be appropriate for the Board of Inland Revenue to determine disputes as to legal privilege. The board is an investigating authority and could be said to have an interest in the determination of such orders, so it might not be considered fully independent in assessing whether a particular document or part of a document should be subject to legal privilege. The amendment is intended to make it clear that such matters should be dealt with in the independent forum of the court.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 450 proposes the adoption of the definition of legal professional privilege contained in section 33 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act l995. That definition is applicable for the purposes of that Act in Scotland. Again, it would not be helpful to have two competing definitions.
<P>
Amendment No. 453 raises the same central point as amendment No. 467. Amendment No. 451 touches on the same territory as amendment No. 446.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I want to speak to amendment No. 447 and to paragraph 6, which is deeply objectionable. The usual convention compatibility statement is given on the front of the Bill and states that the view of the Chancellor is that the Bill's provisions are compatible with the European convention on human rights. I have my doubts about the paragraph. It is so objectionable because it is entirely wrong that the jurisdiction of the courts to decide on what the status of a document should or might be could be ousted by regulations made by the Board of Inland Revenue. Any person affected should be entitled to require that the court determines the matter.
<P>
The provisions are objectionable. I hope to hear what the Paymaster General has to say about the matter. I might have to return to the matter once I have heard her comments.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> All the amendments refer to the question of legal privilege. I will deal first with a point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs at the beginning of his remarks, when he said that the extent to which privileged documents were protected from disclosure under the Inland Revenue's powers was the subject of hot debate. That is not quite the case; I do not agree with him. That hot debate is about the interpretation of the Revenue's civil powers. The issue will be considered soon by the High Court. We are considering the powers involved in criminal cases. The provisions in the new measure merely follow established practice in search operations by allowing legally privileged documents to be exempt, regardless of who holds them. It is hard to envisage how greater protection could be given to legally privileged documents.
<P>
I want to deal briefly with the point of legal privilege in each amendment. In respect of amendment No. 447, it is right that the resolution of disputes over legal privilege should be resolved independently and impartially.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would allow me to make my point. The debate becomes difficult when he begins to comment on points that I have not yet made.
<P>
The clause provides for the Inland Revenue to make provisions through regulations to resolve such disputes. The provisions that the amendment would in part remove do not threaten the impartiality of that process. Paragraph 6(2)(b) provides for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the appointment of an independent, legally qualified person to<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
resolve those disputes. As is shown in the draft regulations published in the past week, that person will be a circuit judge or the equivalent—the same level of judicial authority that issues the order and presides at the trial. I hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs agrees that the point of substance is covered in the regulations; they provide for the protection of legal privilege when that is challenged.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 453 and 467 deal with the protection of legal privilege material. The protection is intended to give suspects confidence that they may consult their lawyer freely. Tax advice is not in the same category in criminal investigations, when the question is not, ``What is the effect of the Taxes Act on the transactions?'' but, ``Has a crime been committed?'' Tax advice, given in connection with legal proceedings, is protected anyway under the clause. Any other tax advice that may be evidence of serious fraud should be available to the investigators, but should not jeopardise a fair trial.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 450, 451, 445 and 446 cover similar areas. Clauses 144 and 145 exempt items subject to legal privilege from the production and the search powers respectively. The clauses define legal privilege in identical terms, copied from the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. That is a well-established and generally understood definition for criminal proceedings in the circumstances that we are discussing. Of course, there are other ways to define legal privilege, such as the one put forward in the amendments, as an alternative, provided by the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 445 and 450 also draw on that wording and seek to substitute it for part of the provisions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. The explanations given in the clause and schedule of the protection of legal privilege are clear and well understood. The amendments are unnecessary because protection exists. The person against whom an order has been made may apply to the appropriate judicial authority to resolve the dispute. Therefore, every qualification is in place to protect legal privilege to use well-known descriptions and to ensure that the individual's rights are protected while criminal investigations are being pursued. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Neither my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs nor I are entirely clear about what the Paymaster General is saying. I think that she is saying that if a piece of tax advice is provided to an individual by a solicitor or by counsel, that advice would constitute a legally privileged document and could not be used, but if an identical piece of tax advice is provided to an individual by an accountant, that would not constitute a legally privileged document and could be used. I find that proposition so irrational that it occurs to me that I might have misunderstood the Paymaster General, but if that is what she is saying, we shall want to press the amendment to a vote, so it is important to know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the Paymaster General agree that, in the final analysis of this difficult matter of legal privilege, the determination of a document's status should be determined by a court, and the Inland Revenue should not have the power to oust the jurisdiction of a court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Paymaster General said that evidence of fraud should not be privileged. No one could disagree with that, but it misses the whole point that, whether it is provided by a lawyer or an accountant, in today's world of complex tax law it would be perfectly natural for companies or individuals to receive advice along the lines of, ``The Revenue could argue this or that. The law says this or that''. It is wrong in principle that it should be possible to seize such advice, which has nothing to do with aiding and abetting fraud. I grant that, in drafting law, it could be difficult to distinguish between the two, but to be able to seize such documents would be an infringement of liberty. Moreover, we all know that, if the law provides that, people will get around the problem by giving advice verbally.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon said that the Inland Revenue should not have the power to oust the jurisdiction of the court. I agree with him, and it will not. His second point relates to when tax advice may be seized. Tax advice given by a lawyer would not be privileged in a criminal investigation any more than tax advice given by an accountant. The exception is that tax advice given in connection with legal proceedings will be privileged under the clause, whether it comes from a lawyer or an accountant. It distinguishes when the material is seized for the investigation of serious fraud. I hope that clarifies the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I think that we have the bones of a solution, but I want to be sure that I properly understand the Paymaster General. She is saying, for example, that it will not be possible in a civil pursuit to obtain tax advice in discovery.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Not civil.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We are therefore talking exclusively about criminal cases. I think that she is saying that in a serious fraud investigation the advice received would not be privileged were it to come from a solicitor or a tax adviser. Under what circumstances in a criminal investigation would a document be privileged?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The advice would not be privileged in a criminal investigation. The confusion arises because civil and criminal have both been mentioned. Such advice is no more privileged than tax advice from an accountant. We are talking about evidence that could demonstrate, at the start of an investigation, that a serious fraud had been committed. The exception is the advice given in connection with those legal proceedings. We are talking about obtaining the information to pursue a case, but the exception comes in once the legal proceedings have been started and people start to receive advice, because that advice would be privileged. First comes the commencement and initiation of the legal proceedings; that is followed by the legal advice given during those proceedings, when legal privilege clearly applies. That covers the point, but by a slightly different route.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I understand that the Paymaster General is interpreting paragraph 5(2)(b) of schedule 39 to mean that the privilege relates to advice given in connection with proceedings. I cannot understand how that interpretation applies to paragraph 5(2)(a), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>communications between a professional legal adviser and his client or any person representing his client made in connection with the giving of legal advice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is different from what follows, which is the giving of legal advice
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in contemplation of legal proceedings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If I am wrong, and the proper construction of paragraph 5(2)(a) is that it is restricted to cases in which the advice is given in connection with the legal proceedings themselves—that is, in connection with the advising of clients who face prosecution, and after the fact—then all is well because that would be given by a lawyer. If that can be cleared up, we can decide whether to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that I am not trying the Committee's patience too much, but I would like some clarification of amendment No. 449. Paragraph 10 appears to authorise the making of regulations that would permit deemed as opposed to actual service of an order. I would be grateful if the Paymaster General would give us her view on that, as it appears unacceptable and contrary to the convention.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No convention has been broken. We have been careful to ensure that there is protection.
<P>
I shall deal with the comments made by the hon. Member for West Dorset. If someone were alleged to have deliberately set out to evade a tax liability, any advice that he had received about its true extent could be evidence that evasion was his motive and that he understood what he did. The advice would not have been provided for a criminal purpose, but it would be relevant as evidence for such a purpose if there were an investigation. The hon. Gentleman's other point related to paragraph 5(2)(a), which is on page 543. It is about legal advice. Paragraph 5(2)(b) is about any advice, including tax advice, in contemplation of proceedings.
<P>
I shall return to the points made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. There is no question of punishing people for not complying with an order that they are deemed to have received, but that they never received. Deemed service is displaced by proof of the actual fact. Having a rule for deemed service gives useful and practical assistance to the operation of such powers. A deemed service would not be carried in the face of facts that showed that it was not received.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The debate has been a fairly full airing of an important issue, although I do not think that I am 100 per cent. clear about it. The wording is extremely obscure, but it might be better to take up the issues outside the Committee, so, having raised our concerns, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Search Warrants: miscellaneous amendments</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I want to raise a somewhat obscure issue for clarification in relation to section 20C of the Taxes Management Act 1970. Should a judge to whom a section 20C application is made not be able to review the Board of Inland Revenue's decision as to whether use of the section 20BA route would seriously prejudice the investigation? If the judge is not satisfied that the decision is reasonable, he should surely not grant the order. Is that the situation? If not, the clause needs some changing.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The judge has unfettered discretion as to whether to issue a warrant. It is inconceivable that a judge would not take into account whether the board ought to have approved the application for the warrant in the first place. The provisions already ensure that he would do so.
<P>
