<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
107</b><a name="09030387000371"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Maria Miller</b> (Basingstoke) (Con): I would like to start
the session by turning the attention of the witnesses to some of the
practical applications of the Bill, particularly with regard to
academies in the first instance. Perhaps I should direct my question
first to Dr.
Moynihan.</div><a name="09030387000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Independent Academies Association wrote to the Minister, Jim Knight, on
23 February. In that letter, the IAA wrote that the Bill was
&#147;deeply disturbing&#148; and cited its concern about the role
of the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and of performing
assessments and the duty to co-operate with children&#146;s trusts,
which is also an element within the Bill. What effect will those
measures have on the running of the academies in the Harris
Federation?</div><a name="09030387000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> I am honestly not here to represent the
IAA, but we support the establishment of the agency. It makes sense for
the Department to have an agency to take care of academies. Clearly the
Department was never meant to be a local authority, so we are perfectly
happy with that and we think it will work well.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="09030387000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key issues
for us will lie in the detail of commissioning and how that will
affects academies&#146; freedoms to establish sixth forms, what they
can offer and how that freedom will compare to the existing
situation.</div>
<a name="09030387000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We broadly
support behaviour partnerships. The issue with them is who decides who
is in the partnerships and what form they take. In some local
authorities we have very effective partnerships. In others we have
produced outstanding schools initially by working alone, because local
provision has been so poor that we would not want to be locked into
that on a compulsory
basis.</div><a name="09030387000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Co-operating
with children&#146;s trusts is a very good principle, as long as
children&#146;s trusts focus on integrating services and making them
available, in an easy way, to individual students. If it takes away the
freedom of head teachers to be responsible and accountable for running
their schools, that would not be such a good
thing.</div><a name="09030387000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
108</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000372"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> You talk about potentially taking away some of the
control and freedom of head teachers. Do you feel that there are
elements in the Bill that may erode academies&#146; independent
status?</div><a name="09030387000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> There are issues that need clarification.
The whole issue of the commissioning of provision and the types of
rights of appeal that academies will have is important to us. In one
local authority, we were told by a different body from the Learning and
Skills Council that we could not open sixth forms in two of our
academies. It was a particularly poor part of London in terms of the
staying-on rate, and the reason why we were told that was that it did
not fit with the plan. Four years later we have 400 sixth-formers and
an outstanding sixth form, but nothing else has changed in the area. As
in that case, we would want to be sure that we had a right of appeal to
the Secretary of State, and that it was clear that we could not
necessarily be blocked by whatever the local plan was if it was not an
entirely sensible and objective
one.</div><a name="09030387000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have experienced difficulties on other occasions when local authorities
have not wanted an academy to open for political reasons and in order
to protect underperforming local provision. We would want a right of
appeal so that someone could look at that, and if we lost it, we lost
it. But it is important that it
exists.</div><a name="09030387000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000373"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> May I ask Liz Reid a question? Independent schools
in the Independent Schools Council are administered directly from the
Department for Children, Schools and Families by a unit of about 12
civil servants. Are you happy that academies will be administered by
the YPLA at a regional
level?</div><a name="09030387000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Elizabeth
Reid:</b></i> It makes absolute sense and, as the academies
programme continues to grow, it would be anomalous and unusual for a
Department of State to take direct responsibility for a very large
number of schools when there are other models, both past and present,
available to look at. The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust views
that as a sensible
provision.</div><a name="09030387000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000374"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Dr. Moynihan, do you agree with
that?</div><a name="09030387000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> Yes, it seems sensible to
me.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="09030387000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030387000375"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Are there any other members of the Committee who
want to ask about academies? I know that Jim Knight
does.</div><a name="09030387000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
111</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000376"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):</b> Thank you.
I accept, Dan, that you are speaking on behalf of the Harris
Federation, but the SSAT has a membership across the range of
academies, so do you detect, Liz, any widespread concern from the
sponsors or principals of academies about the move to
YPLA?</div><a name="09030387000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Elizabeth
Reid:</b></i> No. In fact, I was under the impression that
the Independent Academies Association had initially welcomed the
proposition. As I said, there is a widespread view that it would be
increasingly anomalous for a Department to take direct responsibility
for a large number of publicly funded
schools.</div><a name="09030387000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
112</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000377"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Dan, from your point of view directly running
accounts, how much contact do your principals and sponsors have with
officials from the DCSF at present, and how much of that contact would
transfer as part of the functions relating to open
academies?</div><a name="09030387000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> We have fairly regular contact with
different officials on different issues, so there is a fair amount of
traffic.</div><a name="09030387000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
113</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000378"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> What sort of
issues?</div><a name="09030387000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> Admissions, funding and clarification on
funding models, legal issues relating to academies, local discussions
with local authorities and the DCSF&#146;s role in arbitrating those
discussions, so a very wide range of different
issues.</div><a name="09030387000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
114</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000379"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Without wanting to labour the point, in terms of
the need for some kind of resource between a Secretary of State
agreeing a funding agreement and the independent academies acting as
operating organisations, some kind of organisation is needed, either in
or outside the Department, to provide that kind of
support.</div><a name="09030387000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> I have no problem with that. The point is
the detail of how it would
operate.</div><a name="09030387000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
115</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000380"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Fine. My other questions are on the move to
behaviour partnerships and on the duty to co-operate. Liz, do you know
how many academies are already in behaviour
partnerships?</div><a name="09030387000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Elizabeth
Reid:</b></i> It is the vast majority&#151;94 per cent. is
normally quoted. That tells you a good deal about academies&#146;
desire to be part of those local arrangements. There is no evidence
that academies find this a particularly irksome or onerous way to
safeguard the interests of young people in their communities. Academies
have a large proportion of vulnerable and disadvantaged children on
their rolls. It is in their interests as well as everybody
else&#146;s to be part of those
partnerships.</div><a name="09030387000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
116</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000381"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Accepting what you have said, Dan, about not
wanting to be forced into partnership with particular
people&#151;perhaps by a local authority&#151;and your experience
that they may be mixed in how effective and helpful they are, why do
academies want to be in behaviour partnerships? What do they
offer?</div><a name="09030387000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> All academies should be part of a
hard-to-place protocol whereby students who are difficult to place are
shared around. Academies are academies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>because they need rapidly to improve attendance, behaviour and a range
of things to do with student welfare. The question is how to do it. In
many local authorities it is possible and desirable to partner with
other local authority schools and the local authority and use their
services rapidly to drive up standards in attendance and behaviour. You
can take on professionals between you and share that. In other places,
however, local schools have often been in extreme difficulty and the
local authority has had no capacity. If we had partnered in those
cases, it would have been a ball and chain around our necks. The issue
for us is that we are happy to partner, we want to partner, but if the
brief for an academy is to improve very rapidly, as some of our schools
have done, we need the discretion to determine the
partner.</div><a name="09030387000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
117</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000382"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Fine. Finally, what are the attractions of the
duty to co-operate with children&#146;s trusts? Where there has been
that sort of co-operation, is it about the relationship with the local
authority or is it something
wider?</div><a name="09030387000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> For us it has been about relationships with
local authorities. Clearly, in future it will and should be wider than
that. Our concern is the detail of how this operates and to what extent
the children&#146;s trust or the head teacher determines how services
are provided and what happens. We want to be fully accountable and
fully in the daylight for our performance, and for that we need to be
responsible for decisions about services and how they are used, and not
have them forced on
us.</div><a name="09030387000045"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000383"></a>Jim

the guidance that will attach to this duty and how it is
implemented.</div><a name="09030387000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel

true.</div><a name="09030387000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
119</b><a name="09030387000384"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I would like to
look at the other side of the coin of the questions that have been
asked. Frankie, why is it important, if it is, that academies should
have the duty to co-operate and promote
well-being?</div><a name="09030387000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frankie
Sulke:</b></i> A vast number of local authorities are huge
supporters of academies. The majority of academies probably exist
because local authorities have sought them out as the best way to
improve outcomes for young people in their area. Therefore, local
authorities are champions of academies and are as passionate about
their performance as that of any other provider. It is critical that
academies&#151;which have responsibility for so many children in the
area, for which the local authority is ultimately
accountable&#151;are part of the conversations that create the
services around that area, that create the teams around the child, to
ensure that all children, particularly the most vulnerable, have the
support that they need. It is critical, particularly in areas that have
a lot of academies, to have the academy principals and sponsors around
the
table.</div><a name="09030387000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030387000385"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Les, can I ask you to comment on
that?</div><a name="09030387000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> I do not disagree with what Frankie has
said. We see academies as being part of the diversity of schools within
a local authority. In that way, we are far better able to meet the
needs of young people and the parents. Because different types of
schools suit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>different types of young people, we often find that academies, like
other schools, are equipped to enable youngsters to fulfil their
potential. Different types of youngster going to different types of
school facilitate that to a far greater
extent.</div>
<a name="09030387000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think also
that most academies are more than happy to be part of the family of
schools within a local authority, engaging significantly in all sorts
of partnerships&#151;from 14 to 19, behaviour and sharing panels.
Yes, we are keen to ensure that the degree of autonomy that they have
is maintained. As a result of that grown-up relationship, they always
want to be part of and not separate from the arrangements made by the
local authority. Many academies are keen not only to follow the code of
admissions practice but to have admission arrangements that fit in and
are not in competition with other local
schools.</div>
<a name="09030387000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000386"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> There are tensions in some parts of the country.
Do you think that those tensions can be resolved, given the obvious
good
will?</div><a name="09030387000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> The tensions certainly can be resolved. Our
perspective is that the academies were built on the city technology
college movement; the 15 CTCs became outstanding schools primarily
because of their freedom to make decisions quickly and autonomously. It
is important that that is protected in academies, but it does not mean
that academies cannot work well with local authorities. It is important
that academies have the freedom to manoeuvre and make their own
decisions about which services they wish to
use.</div><a name="09030387000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><a name="09030387000387"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I once heard Lord Adonis say,
when he was working in education, that his long-term vision for the
strategic oversight of the academies was that, once the programme had
expanded and been accepted warmly by local authorities, it might come
under the strategic oversight of local authorities rather than some
sort of Young People&#146;s Learning Agency, although the YPLA had
not been envisaged when he made those comments. May I hear the views of
Les, Elizabeth and Daniel&#151;and possibly Frankie if she wants to
add something?</div>
<a name="09030387000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> There is no doubt that local authorities
have welcomed the responsibility and duty to take the strategic view in
terms of overall planning and of ensuring the right level of provision
within each local authority. That is not going to change as a result of
the way in which the Bill is structured. What I think is important in
the context of the Bill is that the YPLA will take on a responsibility
from the Department for those academies that are open, and also an
element of performance money. I suggest that that will enable it to
relate to the local authority in terms of school plans and
commissioning arrangements in a far more effective and efficient
way&#151;and also in a more transparent way than if it had been left
within the Department, which was trying to create as well as manage by
separating those that were already in
place.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000388"></a>Mr.

previous one but strategic oversight by local authorities rather than
the YPLA, what would be the advantages or
disadvantages?</div><a name="09030387000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> This type of arrangement enables some of
those potential tensions to be managed in a fair and equitable way, and
in a transparent way. It does not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>infringe the strategic lead that the local authority has for 16-to-19
learning and the commissioning that will take over from the Learning
and Skills Council in about 13 months. It is also a way of more closely
knitting the academies into the family of schools that I was talking
about
earlier.</div>
<a name="09030387000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Elizabeth
Reid:</b></i> I think you have heard an exposition as to why
this is a confidence-building move&#151;it builds the confidence of
all parties. Academies are part of our national system of education,
which is diverse. Academies are a relatively new part of the system,
and it makes sense for there to be oversight of the whole academies
initiative in one place. That is what the YPLA will continue to
provide, in the way that the Department has until
now.</div>
<a name="09030387000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000389"></a>Mr.

dissolved once the process bedded in and if the LAs themselves did the
job?</div>
<a name="09030387000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Elizabeth
Reid:</b></i> From a number of points of view, I might not be
too relaxed about that. The whole history of planning and providing for
the education of 16 to 19-year-olds is quite vexed. Over the last three
or four decades, there have been many difficulties. As with other parts
of the Bill, the YPLA proposition provides some focus on an area in
which there are many interested parties&#151;namely, the 16-to-19
arena, where there are many providers.</div>

academy managed under the YPLA rather than a specialist school, for
example?</div><a name="09030387000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Elizabeth

structured to be independent and to have a high degree of
autonomy.</div>

not good at being diplomatic. My answer would be that local authorities
have called in academy sponsors because the various mechanisms that
they have deployed in the past to improve the schools that they offer
us as academies have not worked. The key mechanism that they have
deployed is their own management of those schools. It does not make
sense to return those schools to local authorities. We can work in

DCSF&#151;a single unit such as the YPLA&#151;will be a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000396"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> But I think that you are also saying that they do
not do it well now. Most of our secondary schools are still under the
strategic oversight of local authorities. If you are right that many of
them are not doing their job effectively, we ought perhaps to be
thinking of even more schools going under the YPLA, not LAs. Is that
not the logic of what you are saying?</div>
<a name="09030387000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> No, I do not think it is. What I am saying
is that academies are schools in extreme circumstances, which are often
subject to extreme socio-economic conditions and in real conditions of
failure. In those situations, you need a fresh start&#151;you need
something different. You need to be able to galvanise community
teachers and everybody to say, &#147;There are new expectations.
Something new is going to happen. There&#146;s a real expectation
that there&#146;s going to be rapid improvement. We&#146;re going
to do it. No excuses.&#148; That is what an academy sponsor
brings.</div>
<a name="09030387000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
131</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000397"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> But are there not loads of other schools that are in
very similar circumstances, but which are not academies and do not plan
to be academies? There are lots of schools with very deprived
catchments which are not academies and which rely on their own
leadership, governing bodies and the LA&#146;s oversight to perform.
We should be very worried if you thought that the LA&#146;s were not
doing that.</div>
<a name="09030387000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> The academies, in terms of the exam result
improvements, are above the national average. Although more time is
needed to prove the model fully, the average return in terms of results
is good&#151;it is above the national average. So it is working for
those schools. That is why I would be reluctant to see them ever
returned to local
authorities.</div><a name="09030387000077"></a>

132</b><a name="09030387000398"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): Is
there a risk that including academies in the list of statutory partners
in children&#146;s trust boards undermines the advantage of the
academies&#146; independent status? I am mindful that Dr. Moynihan
said earlier that academies needed freedom to make decisions
autonomously. How do you reconcile that necessary freedom with this
statutory
change?</div><a name="09030387000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> There are clear advantages in having
joined-up services locally. There are clear advantages in having
coherence between services and there being children&#146;s trusts.
That is definitely in everybody&#146;s interests. The crux of the
matter is to what extent the children&#146;s trust dictates what
happens in an academy or to what extent the head has autonomy and is
then accountable through its exam results and its Ofsted inspection for
its performance. We would not want a situation in which
children&#146;s trusts were able to dictate in detail what the school
should do.</div>

even howls, of protest from some associated with the academies movement
that there has already been substantial erosion of their independence
and freedom. I am thinking of the letter from the Independent Academies

forcefully than I have made it
here.</div><a name="09030387000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel

134</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000400"></a>Mr.

from Mike Butler
states:</div><a name="09030387000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
appears that with every consultation, each missive and even new

invention?</div><a name="09030387000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> I am not here to represent the Academies
Association, but my view is that it is in everybody&#146;s interest
that we have effective children&#146;s trusts that join up services.
It is difficult for schools to deal with multiple agencies on their
own. If children&#146;s trusts integrate services so that they
provide the best services for the particular needs of children at the
point of use, then that is a good thing. But I would not want academies
to be compelled to use them in a particular way. I do not know enough
about the detail of this Bill to know whether that is a possibility,
but we would want to resist it if it
is.</div><a name="09030387000084"></a>

Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab):Local authorities have
expressed concerns that the YPLA will increase the performance
assessment burdens placed on local authorities. Will you elaborate on
that, Councillor Lawrence, because there does not seem to be anything
in the Bill which suggests that burdens are significantly
different?</div><a name="09030387000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> If the YPLA is a local authority sector-led
body, that concern would disappear. If it is constructed in any other
way, there would be some concern. We have used the phrase
&#147;mission creep&#148; in the sense that the agency&#146;s
duties are not wholly prescribed. There is a degree of open-endedness.
For example, through performance management options, it could
micro-manage services more widely. With micro-management&#151;here I
have some sympathy with a strand of Dan&#146;s point&#151;you get a
degree of control which removes local flexibility and the ability to
vary the nature and delivery of services to suit a locality. You might
not want to apply the same type of service in the same way right across
a whole local authority because of the different nature of the
communities and the locales you are serving.</div>
<a name="09030387000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
element is a concern about how we start off&#151;quite rightly; it is
supported by local government&#151;a national funding formula from 16
to 19. The YPLA could be a mechanism to extend a national formula down
to 14 to 19 education, which could be very detrimental on school
funding because each local authority, in conjunction with its schools
forum, has determined a formula funding arrangement that best suits the
local authority and its school. If you then begin to apply that between
14 and 16 you could have a detrimental and disproportionate effect on
the funding available to schools

Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): I did not take part in
the debate on Second Reading, but due to the vagaries of parliamentary
procedure, I find myself serving on this Committee, so I hope that you
will forgive me if I am slightly behind the curve. Dr. Moynihan, you
say that where there is a failing secondary school, an academy will
come in and improve the education being provided. Will the head teacher
of that academy be required to take on the teaching staff of the
failing secondary school, or will he be allowed to start afresh,
picking his own team from the
outset?</div><a name="09030387000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> The law is that every member of the
teaching staff&#151;in fact, every member of staff&#151;is entitled
to transfer across, so what happens is that existing staff transfer
across to the academy. They might not transfer into the same roles,
because you put in a new structure to suit your purposes best. People
will transfer, but not necessarily into the same
roles.</div><a name="09030387000091"></a>

<a name="09030387000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> The reality is that in schools that become
academies, management of performance has usually been weak. When they
become an academy, a new management team comes in. If the team does its
job properly, it is rigorous about performance management, and you get
staff turnover and a change in staff in the first couple of years. That
is how it is
done.</div><a name="09030387000095"></a>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b> I want to move on to
children&#146;s trusts, particularly with Frankie and Les; perhaps
you can both answer this. Do you think that a greater consistency of
approach to children&#146;s trusts across the country will be an
improvement? How do you think that children&#146;s trusts are working
at the
moment?</div><a name="09030387000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frankie
Sulke:</b></i> I do think that greater consistency is
welcome, due to the fact that we have had a good few years of
experience now and therefore know a lot more about what works.
Therefore, we can learn from each other about how to make things
happen, but I would still say that there are real differences between
areas. Therefore, we should avoid at all costs a one-size-fits-all
approach. The way partnerships work, the sizes of localities, the
levels of problems in localities, the vulnerability of children in
terms of the numbers who are looked after and the challenges in local
authorities are all very different, so the way in which we go about
business is very different. However, there are some absolute core
principles for how we go about commissioning across partners, joint
commissioning and working in partnership. I think that the provisions
in the Bill will considerably strengthen what is happening on the
ground.</div><a name="09030387000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> I would like to add to what Frankie has
said about the growing confidence that you now begin to find in many
areas as children&#146;s trusts begin to bed down. It is a matter of
both confidence within partnering arrangements and a greater
understanding of some of the practical difficulties that each agency
faces. Equally, practical benefits come from the different agencies
working together on the integration of services. One of the most
difficult areas to overcome has been what I call the cultural effect.
In the health service, the police, local authorities and the voluntary
communities sector, different cultures underpin the methods of
operating in different environments. As that understanding comes and as
aspects of the work force strategy become embedded in those cultures,
consistency will develop. Equally important is the role of the lead
member and the director of children&#146;s services in statutory
accountability. Local government has welcomed aspects of the Bill: the
ownership of the children and young people&#146;s plan by all those
with a duty to co-operate and the membership of the children&#146;s
trust. That will do more to bring about a step change in service
delivery than anything
else.</div><a name="09030387000102"></a>

LGA expressed concern about the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to
add functions to the children&#146;s trust board. However, they are
constrained by needing the consent of Parliament. Do you think it is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
145</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000411"></a>Mrs.

children&#146;s trust boards, local safeguarding boards and
children&#146;s centres advisory boards, and where will the
responsibility lie? How do you see that network of organisations
working practically and how will responsibility rest with elected
members?</div><a name="09030387000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> When an organisation such as a
children&#146;s trust has grown up, you will see a significant amount
of what I call devolved accountability and devolved responsibility down
to as local a level as possible. That will ensure that communities and
organisations can get on day-to-day with delivering services of a high
quality and meeting the needs of citizens and the wider population.
When needs arise, there will be one point of contact. Within the
structure, there must be an escalation procedure for reporting issues
and difficulties that arise. In that way, the lead member can be held
accountable. Trend analysis and information flows are important in
ensuring that there is oversight at one step
removed.</div><a name="09030387000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a lot of confusion about the relationship between local safeguarding
boards and children&#146;s trusts. It is essential that we retain the
freedom of the local safeguarding board to fulfil its statutory duty in
serious case reviews and over the quality and nature of the social care
work force. That is its responsibility at the moment. However, there
must be a reporting line for oversight by the children&#146;s trust.
That must not infringe on the autonomy of the children&#146;s trust,
but must enable clear accountability. The local authority is
responsible for the outcomes of serious case reviews, such as service
delivery, improvements and the resulting actions. We must make it very
clear what the link is. At the moment it is confused and clarity is
needed. The Bill could be an opportunity to put that in
place.</div><a name="09030387000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
146</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000412"></a>Mrs.

Bill and hope that further provisions will come forward to clarify
it.</div><a name="09030387000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> Yes, for example, there is a lack of
clarity over the extent to which serious case reviews should be
published and over the fullness of the publicity of the action plans
that should follow every
review.</div><a name="09030387000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
147</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000413"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> May I return to an earlier question on which I did
not get a clear answer because of the way in which I asked it? I
specifically wanted to ask whether making the children&#146;s trust
board statutory was necessary, desirable or undesirable. I hope that in
this series of questions I can bring in Kieran, because he will have
some input into the children&#146;s
trusts.</div><a name="09030387000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frankie
Sulke:</b></i> It is probably true to say that there is
something everywhere that could be seen as a children&#146;s trust
board, so I understand your question&#151;if the boards exist why
make them statutory? But making them statutory will help to emphasise
the importance of having&#151;as Les has said in answer to a few
questions&#151;that partnership embedded, and of being very clear
about the accountability and role of the boards. Having them as part of
the statutory furniture will, I think, be helpful in that
respect.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="09030387000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Linking into
the previous question, most children&#146;s trust boards sit
underneath the local strategic partnerships and are not the only
partnership board that functions within local authorities. They link in
with other partnership boards on adults, economic development and
regeneration, and often safer local authority partnerships. They are
part of that architecture, which secures more tightly the well-being of
children and young
people.</div><a name="09030387000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> One danger though, is that you could go a
step too far in the Bill and over-prescribe the creation of the
children&#146;s trust board. That is something to be wary of.
Creating a statutory body is absolutely essential, as Frankie has said,
but if you go too far you might complicate the governance arrangements,
which would then have difficulty being married up with the sovereignty
of a local authority and equally with the roles of PCT boards, which
themselves have a statutory basis. The statutory framework that you set
around the children&#146;s trust board should be as loose as possible
and very simple in terms of the children&#146;s plan, the membership
and those who have a duty to co-operate with it. Go beyond that, and I
think that you will create a governance complexity that will be a
disbenefit not intended by  the
Bill.</div><a name="09030387000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
148</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000414"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Can I just ask Kieran for his perspective? Would
making the board statutory make things work better for
you?</div><a name="09030387000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kieran
Gordon:</b></i> I think that it would. I attend a number of
children&#146;s trust boards in their various current guises because
my service covers more than one local authority area. The Bill would be
useful if it gave a greater sense of purpose, outline and focus to the
business of children&#146;s trust boards. In my experience, they can
cover a wide range of issues, but not to great effect, very often not
making the most efficient use of people&#146;s time. There is a
greater focus now, particularly since the &#147;Are we there
yet?&#148; publication, and such focus is helpful. Clearer terms of
reference and a clear indication of what business the board can conduct
and of what responsibility each board member has to the board and not
just to their own organisations would be very
helpful.</div><a name="09030387000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
concern I have is that, in my experience, GPs have never attended any
of the boards and head teachers are largely missing as well. The Bill
seems to increase the range of partners that will be called to the
board, including for example Jobcentre Plus, and there is a lot of
sense in that. The worry though is that we create an even bigger board
and it gets strangled by its own size. We need some way of having an
efficient board that can operate with an optimum number of members,
which can pull in the various range of interests from around the wider
partnership body, but without making it too
large.</div>
<a name="09030387000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
149</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000415"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> It sounds as if you are moving beyond a talking
shop and getting down to business now, since the Audit Commission
report.</div><a name="09030387000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I go back to the children and young person&#146;s plan? Again, it is
really right across the board. If this plan has been created by a
statutory children&#146;s trust board, why should the local authority
have full ownership for it, as you described?</div>
<a name="09030387000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> As I understand the Bill, it would not. The
ownership is shared, on a collective basis, across all the public
agencies, with a defined duty to co-operate, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>although you would still have the statutory duty that is specific and
singular on the director of children&#146;s services and the lead
member of the board, which would not change. I firmly believe, on
behalf of local government, that if you have that plan owned by all the
agencies, there is a desire, a wish and an intent to achieve the
outcomes that are enshrined in it, because they have all been though
the sovereign decision-making arrangements in each of the organisations
that have a duty to co-operate and which formulated the
plan.</div><a name="09030387000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
150</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000416"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> But if you had one vote on the board, as the lead
member, why would you be fully
accountable?</div><a name="09030387000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> I will go back to a point that I made in
answer to Maria Miller. I am the elected member in the locality with a
statutory duty; that is enshrined in the Children Act 2004. I have no
problem in accepting that responsibility on behalf of all the bodies on
the children&#146;s trust. It is my duty to provide the strategic
leadership, along with the director of children&#146;s services. If I
have neither the capability nor the capacity to do that, I should not
be undertaking the role.</div>
<a name="09030387000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
151</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000417"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Can I draw views from the panel on the school
behaviour partnerships? How do you see your role within them and what
are the positives and negatives from your perspective? That is probably
a question for Elizabeth, Daniel and Frankie; although Les may have a
view, those three should
start.</div><a name="09030387000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Elizabeth
Reid:</b></i> I am happy to start. I think that we have
already had a good discussion about behaviour partnerships, because
they are about schools coming together to take shared responsibility.
There are a number of ways of looking at this issue. It is often said,
for example, that there are difficulties about the exclusion of
children from schools. Most head teachers do not want to exclude
children, but sometimes it appears that it is right both for the
individual young person and the wider school community. If you are part
of a school behaviour partnership, that is not an easier decision to
make but it is a decision that can be made in a much more planned way,
with some certainty that there will be proper arrangements for
continuing the young person&#146;s education.</div>
<a name="09030387000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is very
clearly a benefit, both for the school and the individual youngster.
That is why I believe that schools have voluntarily entered into
behaviour partnerships in the very large numbers that they have done.
There are only a handful of schools that are not part of the behaviour
partnerships. So I think that the benefit of those partnerships is on
the way to being proven. On that basis, I think that there is no
difficulty with the proposed legislation.</div>
<a name="09030387000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, as
with a great deal of the discussion this afternoon, there is some devil
in the detail and that is about understanding, in all cases, what are
the sensible parameters of partnership, which can vary from locality to
locality because there are different kinds of issues that schools and
their communities are
facing.</div><a name="09030387000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frankie
Sulke:</b></i> I will build on that by referring back to
something that Dan said very articulately earlier, which is that it is
everybody&#146;s responsibility; all those children are
everybody&#146;s responsibility. All schools share the responsibility
to ensure that more vulnerable young 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>people and hard-to-place young people are shared and looked at
collectively across an area. It is often the case that a young person
who is finding it particularly difficult and being incredibly
disruptive in one school will often thrive when given a fresh start in
another. There is now lots of evidence to show that, when schools work
together and manage moves in that way, young people really succeed very
well, particularly when they go into a culture of high performance. I
am with Liz in that respect and think that that has been
proven.</div>
<a name="09030387000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do think,
however, that Liz is absolutely right to say again that what you
legislate for and what is in the detail is incredibly important,
because you need to allow local areas flexibility to do what is right
for them. What is right for a London borough in which schools are
located close together is very different from what is right for a big
shire authority in which schools are far apart, so you cannot legislate
for all the details and have to leave that to the professionals to sort
out.</div>

Sulke:</b></i> And to local
discretion.</div><a name="09030387000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> For me the issue of school behaviour
partnerships remains about voluntarism for academies. It is true that
most schools are part of behaviour partnerships, but the kind they are
in are quite different to the kind Sir Alan Steer mentions in his
report. The behaviour partnerships that most schools are in are about
sharing out hard to place pupils and managing moves for
exclusions.</div>
<a name="09030387000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this case,
however, we are talking about much broader partnerships in which groups
have the power to employ specialist staff together, have common
behaviour management training, take on services in managing attendance,
offer staff training and work with primary schools, so we could be
looking at a bigger and potentially more bureaucratic process. That is
fine for academies because we go in and make a rapid assessment: what
is the situation? Attendance is 70 per cent; what is the local
authority doing? It has good services and we want to work in
partnership with it. In other cases we have had 70 per cent. attendance
while the local authority was deploying its support services, so we
would not want to get into a hard partnership in such cases. We really
feel that it is important that we have the choice of which schools we
partner with, because partnerships per say will not improve anything:
quality improves
things.</div><a name="09030387000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
153</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000419"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Are you suggesting that academies should be able
to pick and choose whether they opt in or out of
partnerships?</div><a name="09030387000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> Yes, I am, but if we do not get that,
academies and other schools should at least be able to determine who
they partner with. I do not think that central or local government
should say, &#147;Here is your partnership and this is how you should
partner.&#148; I do not think that they are in the best position to
do that. Schools need to determine their partnerships because they are
at the point of
use.</div><a name="09030387000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
154</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000420"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Are there any other views on
that?</div><a name="09030387000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> I will have to disagree slightly with that
because he is implying that he wants one rule for academies and another
for everyone else, which is in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>interests of neither partnerships nor, dare I say it, young people. Many
local authorities not only have behaviour partnerships and sharing
panels as embedded arrangements, including those with academies and
grammar schools, but are developing pupil referral units and links with
colleges, because for many youngsters, especially around the age of 14
and 15, a school is not the right environment emotionally. They often
find that a college placement offers a far better environment, given
the nature of their individual development. The partnership is
therefore flexible, depending on the individual needs of the young
person.</div>
<a name="09030387000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, you are
able on a collective basis to provide a range of support services to
assist young people and their families to address many of the problems
that might not necessarily be school-based and that originate outside
the school. That might be the most successful way of addressing the
needs and encouraging the young person to develop. On a slightly wider
basis, sometimes it is a locality&#146;s whole set of aspirations
that needs to be addressed, and that needs to be understood, and often
a behaviour partnership can begin to address that on a wider
basis.</div><a name="09030387000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> May I clarify a point that I made? I do not
think I am saying one rule for academies and one rule for everybody
else. I am saying schools should determine what their partnerships are
and should not have that determined for them, because they are
accountable for what they
deliver.</div><a name="09030387000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
155</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000421"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> On the issue of support services and moving to
advice and guidance, clause 35 relates directly to careers advice and
suggests that apprenticeships should be offered to young people if the
provider thinks that is appropriate. Has the Bill gone far enough on
strengthening the mechanism by which quality independent advice can be
offered to young
people?</div><a name="09030387000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kieran
Gordon:</b></i> I do not think it has. It rightly indicates
that schools, which currently have a statutory responsibility to
provide careers education, should reference the provision of
apprenticeships in the careers education programmes and advice offered
through the school and its partners. It refers to a situation where the
school believes it would be in the &#147;best interests&#148; of
pupils. My concern with that is there are schools, particularly schools
with sixth forms, that might consider the best interests of the pupil
to be in returning to the sixth form, for the purposes of the
school&#146;s particular interest, rather than the individual young
person&#146;s. The Bill goes some way in recognising that schools
have responsibility to promote and make young people aware of
apprenticeships. It does not go far enough in giving that clause teeth,
although I think statutory guidance will be coming as a consequence of
the Education and Skills Act. That might make it more
assertive.</div><a name="09030387000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
156</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000422"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Indeed. The explanatory note to clause 35 says
that</div><a name="09030387000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
governing body of a secondary school, or its proprietor...or the
local education
authority&#148;</div><a name="09030387000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
to ensure what careers advice is to be given to a student. Would not a
better system, based on your last answer, be to have some independent
careers service, perhaps located in the school but separate from the
school to avoid the conflict of interest that you describe?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div><a name="09030387000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kieran
Gordon:</b></i> The whole process of making career decisions
has to be a fusion of different processes, starting with the careers
education in the school. It is rightly and properly the responsibility
of the school to make sure there is a careers education programme in
place and that careers education programme covers a range of issues in
terms of young people&#146;s awareness of themselves, the world of
work and their awareness of their own skill needs and skill
development, but yes, you are right that there needs to be independence
and impartial expert advice provided by a body&#151;Connexions
currently does it&#151;where there are trained career guidance
experts working in partnership in the school as part of a school team,
providing that impartial advice and
guidance.</div><a name="09030387000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue we might have with apprenticeships&#151;referencing back to
those schools with sixth forms&#151;is that the young people entering
apprenticeships tend to be the same cadre of young people that the
school wants to attract back in to do A-levels or the 16-to-19 elements
of the diploma. It is where there is a conflict of interest if the
school tries to confuse that choice for the young person. It may
believe that it is in the best interests of the young person to go back
to school, but if it does not present, and allow young people to
explore, the range of other options, including apprenticeships, it may
well stifle that choice for young
people.</div><a name="09030387000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
157</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000423"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> From what I hear from careers advisers, the system
described would have the added benefit of re-professionalising careers
advice as a separate professional discipline, would it
not?</div><a name="09030387000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kieran
Gordon:</b></i> It would. We need greater emphasis on the
provision of careers information, advice and guidance as part of the
wider information, advice and guidance offered to young people. There
are signs that that is starting to happen, but there was a feeling that
the careers profession had been overlooked and the word
&#147;career&#148; seemed to disappear from the curriculum and the
agenda.</div><a name="09030387000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
158</b><a name="09030387000424"></a><b class="B">Liz
Blackman</b> (Erewash) (Lab): Frankie, is transferring
responsibility back to the local authorities potentially a better model
for delivering RPA&#151;raising the participation
age?</div><a name="09030387000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frankie
Sulke:</b></i> The commissioning&#151;I presume that is
what you are talking about&#151;is relevant to the discussion we have
just had on information, advice and guidance. The local authority
having the role of looking strategically at its provision to make sure
that progression routes  are in place and that there is a
coherent offer, including  all the diversity we have talked
about, is absolutely key to delivering RPA. To be honest, I am not sure
how we would do it without that. There is the knowledge that we have
built up of those young people between nought and 16, but also the
local authority&#146;s strategic  leadership role post-19 on
the economic agenda and the worklessness agenda, which they can plan
coherently&#151;not on their own, but in conjunction with other local
authorities, including neighbouring local authorities. That
is absolutely key.</div>
<a name="09030387000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I can
be a bit cheeky and come in on the information, advice and guidance
debate. We have strived for and talked about having provider-neutral
information, advice and guidance for as long as I can remember and
probably for as long as anybody in this room can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>remember. It is very difficult to legislate for that. The new climate,
in which local authorities have a strategic leadership role in terms of
commissioning 16 to 19 provision, gives us an opportunity that we have
not had before to get all the providers around the table and to get an
agreement about what is on offer in a locality and across localities.
That might help to get the commitment to getting provider-neutral
information, advice and guidance in schools. Even if you have the
strongest careers professionals, what an individual teacher says in the
classroom will have an enormous impact on what a young person does. We
need to build a consensus around the shape of that provision in
localities.</div>
<a name="09030387000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
159</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000425"></a>Liz

integrated services right across the piece from nought to 19?</div>
<a name="09030387000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frankie
Sulke:</b></i> Yes. If we do not achieve that, there will
have been no point in introducing the reforms. But that is not a role
that local authorities can or would want to play on their own; they
have to do that in conjunction with their providers and they have to
recognise all the things that have been said today about cherishing and
protecting the autonomy of providers. It is not a matter just of the
autonomy of academies, but of all schools, as well as general FE
colleges and sixth-form colleges. This is not about local authorities
controlling matters; it is about planning together the diversity that
will lead to stronger learner choice, as well as meeting employer need,
which will be critical as we positively go into an upturn coming out of
the recession.</div>
<a name="09030387000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kieran
Gordon:</b></i> I want to make a comment on Frankie&#146;s
earlier point about neutral information, advice and guidance. Impartial
does not mean neutral. Neutral would suggest to me some form of passive
guidance. Actually, if it is done well, impartial information, advice
and guidance should be a challenging process; it should be about
encouraging young people to raise their aspirations and to look at the
range of options, and it should sometimes be about putting them in
uncomfortable positions by looking at the range of things that they
could do. Impartiality is not, therefore, neutral, but very much about
playing an active and challenging support role for young
people.</div>
<a name="09030387000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frankie

160</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000427"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I have a supplementary point to what Liz was
asking Frankie, and I would like to bring Les in as well. This morning,
we heard that there were concerns from sixth-form colleges and, to some
extent, from FE colleges about independence and the extent to which
commissioning would be impartial. I want to probe that to see whether
that is the progressive view coming from the leadership of the ADCS or
whether it is a universal view across the local government
sector.</div>
<a name="09030387000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frankie
Sulke:</b></i> I can use the word &#147;neutral&#148;
here, I think, but I am worried about it now. On provider-neutral
commissioning, the principle that we are looking at the best-quality
provision whoever provides it&#151;obviously, it will provided in the
place that it is best able to provide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>it&#151;must be fundamental as we go into this new world. Keeping
focused on the learner and on making sure that what we commission is
learner led, while taking account of employer need, is also critical.
However, it is fundamental that we look at this across providers. The
provision in the Bill to require local authorities to, one, secure
learner choice and diversity and, two, work across local authorities,
ought to give some measure of reassurance to providers. I agree that
they are understandably nervous and those of us who are engaged in what
we are rather pompously calling &#147;dry runs&#148;, sitting with
the Learning and Skills Council going forward, are learning a
considerable amount about how we build trust. Relationships between
local authorities and providers are generally very strong&#151;we
have talked about academies, but also for general FE
colleges&#151;but there is still
nervousness.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
161</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000428"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> That is the professional view. Are there not
circumstances in which politicians will, perhaps understandably, worry
about the fragility of a school or college in their patch and will,
therefore, look to channel commissioning locally, rather than follow
the learners needs?</div>
<a name="09030387000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> If elected Members began to influence
things to that extent, the whole veracity of the commissioning process
would be seriously undermined and would not allow for planning, in the
sense of concentrating on the learner. That becomes particularly
important with vulnerable young people and at what I call the
&#147;age of transfer&#148;, which is now 19, in terms of the
support that a young person has up to that age. In the adult arena that
support is a lot less, therefore, we need to have a very strong
commissioning framework that allows all partners to join with the local
authorities to ensure that there is a consistency in transfer and
support such that learners can continue, especially if we are talking
about apprenticeships. They do not suddenly stop at 18 or 19, they go
on into adult learning arrangements. With our responsibilities to those
with learning difficulties up to 25, it is absolutely important that we
have the depth of those relationships right and have the right
commission framework, based around quality and meeting the needs of the
young person first and foremost.</div>
<a name="09030387000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
162</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000429"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Can I check that Kieran has the same confidence
that that will happen on impartial commissioning?</div>
<a name="09030387000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kieran
Gordon:</b></i> I think that it will happen where local
authorities are encouraged to work actively in a collegiate way with
the local authorities covering a travel-to-work or travel-to-learn area
and where providers within a local authority patch are not protected
out of loyalty or whatever. It is very important that we understand
that when we talk about commissioning, we are not just talking about
procurement. Very often, people actually mean procurement.
Commissioning must start with the learners&#146; needs. It must be
based on a robust assessment of learner need, which is informed by what
young people themselves and advocates, such as guidance workers, say.
Understand that, look at the trend analysis, and look at the
performance of providers in situ and of those that could be brought in,
because good commissioning, at times, involves decommissioning
provision. It is a big task for local authorities to undertake and they
cannot do it in isolation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030387000430"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think that we need to move on because there
are a lot of people who still want to ask questions and we have finite
time.</div>
<a name="09030387000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
163</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000431"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Part 10 of the Bill deals with schools causing
concern but seems to cover local authorities causing concern as well.
Liz, do you think that there is a problem with quite a few local
authorities not challenging school failure enough in their
area?</div>
<a name="09030387000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Elizabeth
Reid:</b></i> I would probably phrase it slightly
differently: are there schools that have underperformed for a long
time, both in the relative and absolute sense? Yes, there are a number.
As we all know, action was taken recently under the national challenge,
so it is undeniable that there are schools that have not made progress
as fast as we now know is possible. An awful lot has been learned about
how to improve schools and how to do it quickly, so those are not
situations that should be allowed to
persist.</div><a name="09030387000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
164</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000432"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Do you think that the Government are seeking to
tackle that in the Bill in broadly the right way? Or do you think that
it is either defective or that there is something else the Government
could be doing which would be
better?</div><a name="09030387000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Elizabeth
Reid:</b></i> I think that it is entirely reasonable. As I
understand the Bill, the onus is first on the local authority and it is
only if the local authority fails to take or secure adequate action
that the Secretary of State would seek to intervene, and the
proposition is that a power should be given to a Secretary of State for
that
purpose.</div><a name="09030387000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that if people do not wish to see interventions of whatever
sort&#151;whether in a school or a local authority&#151;then the
answer may be to speed up the efforts to move out of the zone in which
that is likely. It seems to me that that is actually what is happening
up and down the country and it is right and proper that that should be
so. It would be desirable if there were no circumstances in which
powers of intervention were
necessary.</div><a name="09030387000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
165</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000433"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Thank you very much. Can I ask Les and Frankie about
that? What is significant about those powers, as I understand it, is
that there are already powers of intervention in this
respect&#151;from the Secretary of State to a local
authority&#151;but that they are based on schools that have already
been categorised as requiring special measures or significant
improvement.</div>
<a name="09030387000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 192
gives much more sweeping powers, as I understand it, for the Secretary
of State to make judgments about schools that he or she thinks should
be doing better on various measures, and then allows intervention
against the local authority in the first respect to deal with that.
That brings us to the point of whether the Government are able to
effectively assess schools not already picked up by Ofsted, or some
other body independent of the Government, that are not performing well.
Are you two happy with the powers in clause 192, or do you think that
you are going to end up with unreasonable decisions for interventions
being
made?</div><a name="09030387000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> It is an interesting arena, because on the
one hand we have been accused by the Association of School and College
Leaders of interfering too much to try and up the performance of
schools. On the other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>hand, there is an implication here that we have not done enough
intervention to bring up school performance. The extent to which local
authorities in the main have challenged schools has been variable, to
be fair. To an extent, it has also been governed by the fact that the
current process can be long-winded with warning notices; the extent to
which you can assist through the SIP process; a warning notice plus
getting the inspectors in; the extent to which there is a period for a
degree of improvement; and also the power, I have to say, to be able to
both remove governing bodies and/or the leadership in a school to
affect
change.</div><a name="09030387000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
166</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000434"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is a slightly different point, because what you
are potentially arguing is that local government might need more powers
to intervene to drive up standards. This is slightly different because
it is giving the Secretary of State the power to intervene against you
when he thinks that you are not identifying schools which have
deficiencies.</div><a name="09030387000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Les
Lawrence:</b></i> The role of the Secretary of State,
irrespective of which Government they are in should always be the final
recourse of sanction. If the local authority is not exercising those
powers, which it has been given, in a way that brings about
improvement, then I think the Secretary of State should intervene to
draw the attention of the local authority to its failings. But I would
go back to say that a lot of local authorities would like to exercise
their powers more effectively and quicker than to remove some of the
bureaucracy in exercise of those existing
powers.</div><a name="09030387000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
167</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000435"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> If you have any suggestions to make on that in the
context of this Bill we would be very interested to see them. Can I ask
Frankie, not only for her comment, but particularly to comment on what
was implicit in Les&#146;s observations? The existing classification
of schools that are not doing well may not be thorough or broad enough
to capture schools that should be doing a lot better which is why the
Secretary of State is giving himself these more discretionary powers,
essentially to decide on skills which Ofsted is saying are okay but the
Secretary of State thinks should be a lot
better.</div><a name="09030387000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frankie
Sulke:</b></i> The devil will always be in the detail. The
Bill talks about standards the pupils might reasonably be expected to
attain and about standards previously attained by them. It depends on
the definitions attached at any time for any reason to the words. They
seem completely reasonable words and it is completely reasonable to
expect intervention if a local authority is not being creative,
proactive and quick about turning schools around. There can be no
excuse for local authorities not to be vigorous. We have sufficient
powers at the moment to intervene at those schools. If you ask the
Department, of course it will say that it wants the bureaucracy reduced
even further, certainly where schools might not be in the local
authority&#146;s bottom category but where you would still want to
have powers to federate them, to remove the governing body, and you are
not able to. There is a balance for when that happens. What a lot of
local authorities do, in terms of school improvement, is through
persuasion and
negotiation.</div><a name="09030387000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
168</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000436"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Do you trust the Government in practice? Do you
think the Government can do the job in practice that they have
determined, that is to decide where local authorities should be driving
schools that have not appeared in these official categories?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div><a name="09030387000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Frankie
Sulke:</b></i> Of all the questions I thought I might be
asked, whether I trusted the Government did not come up in my
preparation. There is nothing wrong with the words in the Bill. It is
always possible, though obviously not for current incumbents, to
imagine that the words might be used unreasonably in future. How they
are interpreted in terms of what reasonably might be expected from
pupils could be argued. The main principle is perfectly
reasonable&#151;that local authorities ought to be doing their job in
quickly turning round schools and ought to be held accountable and that
the Government can intervene if that is not
happening.</div><a name="09030387000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
169</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000437"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I have a final question for Les and Frankie but
first can I ask for clarification from Dr. Moynihan? I have
been reflecting on what he said about behaviour partnerships, that
schools should determine what partnerships there are. If that is the
case in terms of behaviour partnerships, if academies were in any way
concerned about the objectives or did not share the objectives of
children&#146;s trust boards are you implying that they should also
be able to choose whether to be part of that? If they were being asked,
for example, to pool funds, which was felt not to be helpful for that
academy.</div><a name="09030387000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> I agree with that.
Yes.</div><a name="09030387000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
170</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000438"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Thank you. My final question for Les and Frankie
is about the LGA briefing that expressed concerns about the
complexities of some of the aspects of the Bill, with the demise of the
Learning and Skills Council and the establishment of a raft of new
quangos&#151;the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency, the Skills
Funding Agency, the National Apprenticeship Service, sub-regional
groupings of local authorities, as well as local authorities being
required to have statutory children&#146;s trust boards and advisory
boards for children&#146;s centres to ensure they comply with these
new statutory regulations. What impact do you think that is going to
have on local authorities and, in particular, are there any funding
implications that we should be aware of, given the difficult and tight
funding regimes under which local authorities
operate?</div><a name="09030387000180"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
171</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000441"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I want to open this part of our proceedings with a
question to Kathleen Tattershall. Your memorandum to the Committee
particularly draws attention to the importance of Ofqual&#146;s
independence from Government. I think you say that being a
non-ministerial Government Department will help to promote public
confidence. I am sure that the Minister will not take that in anything
other than a positive way. Ofqual clearly wants to actively guard its
independence. What will you do to prevent other challenges to your
independence from arising, particularly from things like the make-up of
your board? Clearly individuals who write or mark exam papers, or
teachers or head teachers may be seen to have vested interests or
perhaps even conflicts of interests. Perhaps those who are interested
in making sure that exam standards have not been seen to have fallen
may not be the most impartial people to involve in the organisation.
Nothing in the Bill prevents those with such conflicts from being board
members of Ofqual. Do you think that Ofqual needs to look at this to
make sure that the Bill is more robust in this area so that people
cannot think that it is anything other than independent in all aspects
of its
work?</div><a name="09030387000189"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> First, as you say, independence is
critical to the role of the regulator. It is very important that the
Bill is seen to give us the independence that we need to carry out our
functions, independent of Government as a non-ministerial Department
reporting to Parliament. On appointments, there will be a very clear
and public process of advertising for the individuals who are
interested in our committee and ensuring, through a proper process
involving the Committee on Standards in Public Life, that they make
clear any interest that they might have in this area, and secondly
demonstrate their willingness to manage any conflicts of interests.
What we are looking for on the Ofqual board is a range of expertise,
not just in education but in other areas. In populating the Ofqual
board we will look for people both within and outside education, but
wherever there are conflicts of interest we will also look for ways in
which they will be
managed.</div><a name="09030387000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
172</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000442"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b><b class="B"> </b>Do you see people like employers and
university tutors, who have an important and vested interest in
maintaining standards, as having an important role in that
board?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div><a name="09030387000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> I think individuals such as those you
mention would bring skills, experience and qualities to the
organisation from which it would benefit. But we have a very small
number of places on the board. It is between seven and 12. Clearly, not
every interest, as it were, can find a seat on the Ofqual board.
Indeed, having said what I have just said about interest, we will be
looking for individuals who bring expertise and experience to the
board, not representative individuals in that
sense.</div><a name="09030387000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09030387000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
173</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000443"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Mr. Watson, you brought that up as well
in your submission from OCR, in terms of the importance of autonomy
from Government. What drove that from your angle? Since QCA was set up,
have Ministers sought to interfere in the independence of that
body&#146;s regulatory arm? Is there a reason why you think that it
is so important, or other examples that you can
give?</div><a name="09030387000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> The Secretary of State was very clear in
initiating the drive for an independent regulator. That was in response
to comments that we and others made over a prolonged period. The
intention was to put standards above suspicion. There is something that
dogs the public debate every summer about a perceived involvement in
how standards are set, and I think that that is exacerbated by the rate
of change, potentially. We changed the qualifications system faster
than we have ever done in this country, and the ever-shortening cycle
and ever more frequent iterations of some of the qualifications that we
trust most highly seems in itself to destabilise trust in some
way.</div>
<a name="09030387000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the clear intent in the Bill is to try to address those two issues,
first by putting some clearer blue water between Ministers and decision
making about standards, so there can be absolutely no allegation of any
involvement of one in the other, and secondly by also being a check and
balance on the tendency to change the system too often in destabilising
ways. If you like, the intent is to act as a sane, slightly cautious,
evidence-based evaluator of the case for change, always wondering what
the risks might be as well as what the benefits might be, so that when
we do change the qualifications system, we do so knowingly,
understanding what risks we might be taking and taking the actions
needed in order to make sure that those risks are not
realised.</div><a name="09030387000196"></a>

174</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000444"></a>Mrs.

about the importance of having more than just independence from
Government?</div>
<a name="09030387000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> Yes, absolutely. It is important, equally,
that Ofqual is independent from those it regulates. I think that it is
important that Ofqual should be seen to be a strong, independent voice,
not simply a sort of super-exam board, if I can characterise it that
way. We would very much like to see&#151;we very much advocated
it&#151;a strong, vocal, visible, publicly authoritative
organisation. That said, we have some concerns as to whether the Bill,
as drafted, entirely delivers on that intention. It is clearly in the
direction that we had hoped and there are some clear principles set out
that drive for independence, but there are particular features that
seem still to leave residual opportunities for a Secretary of State,
now or in the future, to intervene on a rainy day. Of course, it is on
a rainy day that suspicions arise about political
involvement.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
175</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000445"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Kathleen, thank you for your note. You have
highlighted areas where Ofqual might have concerns about existing
legislation and the need for us to have a look at your independence. I
wanted to start with a bigger-picture question rather than asking about
individual powers. The Government clearly have great hopes that the new
body will end the annual dumbing-down debate to which Greg just
referred.</div>
<a name="09030387000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, you
will be aware that the Select Committee said in the conclusion to its
report on testing last year that although it welcomed the establishment
of your organisation,</div>
<a name="09030387000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Government
has failed to address the issue of the standards themselves. In the
context of the current testing system, with its ever-changing
curriculum and endless test reforms, no regulator, however independent,
can assure assessment standards as they are not capable of accurate
measurement using the data available. Until the Government allows for
standardised sample testing for monitoring
purposes&#148;,</div><a name="09030387000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">whether
by you or another regulator, there would be no resolution of the
dumbing-down debate. Do you have any sympathy with those points? Would
you like to have the power to carry out standardised sample testing in
order to have some measure of standards that is separate from changes
in the qualification regime?</div>
<a name="09030387000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> First, as far as the annual dumbing-down
debate is concerned, I think that it would be foolish to expect it to
end overnight because of the creation of an independent regulator.
Clearly, we will do all that we can to address all the issues and bring
the debate into the public arena in a very transparent and open way in
order to get a better understanding of what actually goes into creating
the standards of public
qualifications.</div><a name="09030387000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether
we need an explicit power to introduce other forms of sampling is more
debatable. On a particular occasion down the line, we may well think
that we need to look at other means to get a better view, but I am very
conscious that, once you begin to think that way, you must also think
of the technicalities involved in setting up a sampling process. It is
not as easy as choosing the sampler and then developing a test; you
have to think very carefully about how that impinges on the
curriculum.</div><a name="09030387000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding of the legislation is that we are not precluded from such
thoughts down the line, and I do not think it particularly necessary
for the Bill to give us the powers explicitly. I do not think that
there is anything in it that precludes us from saying, at some point in
time, that we need to look at standards in a slightly different

176</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000446"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Are you concerned that the Government&#146;s
response to the Select Committee&#146;s report stated that
Ofqual&#146;s role&#151;we clearly see this in the
legislation&#151;is</div><a name="09030387000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not
to monitor education standards as a whole; it is to regulate the
qualifications and assessments which are one of the means by which
those standards are
measured.&#148;</div><a name="09030387000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is obviously a concern in the public&#146;s mind, not necessarily
that there has been a deliberate attempt to undermine and cheat on
standards, but that, over time, arguably because of teaching to the
test, the way qualifications have changed, more or less coursework, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>or modular GCSEs, exam results do not necessarily reflect the change in
educational levels among the
population.</div><a name="09030387000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> I think that, if we are talking about
Ofqual being a regulator of the educational standard system, that is a
very different beast from that in the legislation, which presents
Ofqual as a regulator of qualifications and national curriculum
assessments. That in itself is a very broad brief; there are thousands
of qualifications that come under the regulator&#146;s system. If
Ofqual looked more broadly at educational standards per se, as opposed
to using some sort of standardised test to inform what the
qualifications framework might be, it would be a very different
organisation from the one in the legislation. I am not certain whether
that would give the organisation too broad a brief and get in the way
of doing a good job on the qualifications front, as well as
elsewhere.</div><a name="09030387000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are other organisations that look at educational issues; Ofsted, for
example, looks at the quality of teaching and what actually goes on in
schools. If you go down the line of Ofqual being an educational body,
as you describe, you have to look very carefully at the demarcation
lines between organisations such as Ofsted and organisations such as
Ofqual. Furthermore, you have to be very careful regarding the burden
that you might place on schools in terms of them being answerable to
more than one
body.</div><a name="09030387000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
177</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000447"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> For my last question, may I ask Mike and Greg
whether they share any of my scepticism that the Bill&#146;s changes
and the Ofqual that we are creating are actually going to end the
annual dumbing-down debate? I say that not simply because it will take
time for Ofqual to establish credibility, which is inevitable, but
because of the fundamental job that it has been asked to do and the
powers that it
has.</div><a name="09030387000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Creswell:</b></i> The critical contribution that Ofqual could
make to begin to end that debate, which will plainly take time, would
be to provide much greater clarity than it has in the past about the
precise meaning of the standards of qualifications. In the distinction
that you draw between educational standards and monitoring
students&#146; general progress on the one hand, and examination
standards on the other, it is important to distinguish between the two
functions that qualifications currently fulfil. One is to qualify
learners, mainly young people, for progression&#151;to go on in
education or employment in a way that fits their talents and abilities.
For that purpose, it is reasonable that students should essentially get
a grade that reflects the performance that they give when they are
assessed. However, performance will vary with the context, so a
performance achieved in modular examinations will be different from a
performance indicated in a final exam, and performance for course work
will be different from performances in exams. For the moment, the
definition of standards that I believe we all hold dear is about
performance during the assessment process. The job that you are asking
for, that of assessing the underlying education achievements of
students, is grafted on to the qualifications results, and it requires
a different methodology to the sort that you outline.</div>
<a name="09030387000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
Kathleen. To give Ofqual both these jobs would be to give it some
enormously difficult work, but it can really make a difference to the
qualifications 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>debate if it is much clearer than anyone has been in the past about how
it conceives standards, how it would measure the standards set by the
awarding bodies and how it would evaluate what the awarding bodies are
doing on standards. That is the critical contribution that it could
make.</div><a name="09030387000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> The answer to your question is yes; I believe
that Ofqual will in time make a difference, but it will not happen
overnight. It will do so in three important ways. First, if it can
achieve the unequivocal independence that we have talked
about&#151;there is some way yet to go to make it certain&#151;so
that its voice will resound differently in public and the statements
that it makes will seen to be objective, considered and free of any
other consideration than making a fair judgment on whether the
qualifications hold water. That is the first
thing.</div><a name="09030387000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second thing is that Ofqual can play a role in opening up the
qualifications system and making it more transparent. I think that the
burden of your question was about benchmarking qualification results to
other tests in order to provide some kind of external confirmation. In
reality, in the examination system today we do a lot of unseen
statistical work to correlate the achievements of the same learner in
different subjects, the same learning across different exam boards and
similar learners at different times taking the same qualification. We
use a series of different measures in order to triangulate&#151;to
ensure that we keep the standards in the same place. However, little of
that is open to public view. An authoritative and informed regulator
can play a role in making that more visible, making public the
assurance that qualifications are sound.</div>
<a name="09030387000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
thing is that I would expect Ofqual, as compared to its predecessor, to
devote more of its efforts to scrutinising what bodies like the OCR do
at the point when we are developing qualifications. As a result, we
would be grilled more than we might have been in the past about how we
put a qualification together, how we propose that the assessment
arrangements will work, how we will set standards and what some of the
challenges might be in setting that standard&#151;if, for instance,
we had a change in the structure of a qualification. The very process
of being challenged by a regulator at that all-important point when the
qualification is created would put us on our mettle. That, too, will
add to the public&#146;s confidence that it is all the more visible
and accountable.</div>
<a name="09030387000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
178</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000448"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> We heard from Kathleen Tattershall&#146;s
comments in response to the questions of the hon. Member for Yeovil
that we do not necessarily need a tranche of new powers to deal with
the matters that he raised. Does Ofqual need additional powers in other
areas that at present are not included in the Bill, and if so what are
they?</div>
<a name="09030387000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a slightly
different topic, are you confident that Ofqual can balance its
regulatory role with ensuring efficiency and value for money in the
qualifications system? Some might perceive a conflict of
interest.</div>
<a name="09030387000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> First, our powers and responsibilities
are wrapped up in three elements of the Bill. One is the objectives;
you referred to those partly in terms of the efficiency objective, but
there are also the standards objectives in relation to qualifications
and the national curriculum assessments. Secondly, there are the
conditions that we can lay down. I would expect those conditions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>to be very much linked to those objectives. Some of the general
conditions that we would stipulate are all conditions about how we
ensure that standards are maintained throughout the process. Greg made
a reference to the very beginning of the process, about how people will
set the requirements and the tests, and it seems that that is all part
of the standard setting. So, the conditions will address the objectives
of the
standards.</div><a name="09030387000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
there are the powers that we have, particularly the powers of direction
for when the awarding body falls short. Those are powerful powers, but
I stress that we want to ensure, through working with them, that the
awarding bodies can begin to address thorny issues and come up with
solutions that are acceptable to the regulator. So, I think that that
is right. We also have powers to cap fees, but one power that we do not
have, and which I discussed with the Secretary of State via an exchange
of letters on 10 February, is the power to fine. The power to fine
should be in the armoury of any regulator because it is an intermediate
sanctioning step before the ultimate nuclear step of not recognising or
taking away the recognition of an awarding body. That power is open to
debate, and the Secretary of State has said that he is very open-minded
about it. We argue that it would be a very useful power, if only as a
deterrent, and it would prevent the use of that nuclear power at the
end. The powers in this legislation, all linked as I see them to the
objectives and conditions that we would lay down, help towards Ofqual
being a very authoritative independent regulator. There is that power
to fine, and there are arguments about whether it is explicit enough
that we are talking about standards. For me that is explicit, but if
others feel that it is not the Bill has to be very clear about where
Ofqual stands in respect of directing
standards.</div><a name="09030387000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
179</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000449"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Coming back to you Greg, you have talked about
wanting greater autonomy for the regulator and about further
parliamentary accountability. How would you see that happening? What
would you expect Parliament to do that it cannot do
already?</div><a name="09030387000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> There are two important areas in which
Parliament could usefully play a role in increasing the transparency
and accountability of Ofqual. The first is key appointments. Above and
beyond what is eventually in a Bill, significance is likely to be
attached to the individuals who come to occupy the senior roles, and I
think that there will be a lot to be said for some scrutiny of those
roles. The subject of potential conflicts of interest has come up and
there will be some scope to explore what those might be. That is all
part of building public
confidence.</div><a name="09030387000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second dimension that could be developed in more detail in the Bill is
what Ofqual might report on annually. Rather than there being an
open-ended obligation to produce a report, perhaps it should be
required to report under a series of defined headings and on particular
types of issues or concerns that might have arisen during the year.
Perhaps, if there remains any provision for the Secretary of State to
intervene in certain situations, it should report on each occasion on
which the Secretary of State has used that power and for what
reason.</div><a name="09030387000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
180</b><a name="09030387000450"></a><b class="B">Jeff
Ennis</b> (Barnsley, East and Mexborough) (Lab): I guess that
I would say this as a former member of the Education and Skills
Committee: I would draw an analogy between the new Ofqual and Ofsted,
which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>reports directly to what was the Education and Skills Committee but is
now the Children, Schools and Families Committee. Do you see a direct
comparison there? Should Ofqual&#146;s accountability to Parliament
be channelled through the Select
Committee?</div><a name="09030387000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> That would be potentially helpful. The report
is one element; what follows from the report is another. It seems to me
that the opportunity for a Select Committee exploration of that report
each year could be quite instructive and could help to tease out the
underlying issues that might lie behind the
report.</div><a name="09030387000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
181</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000451"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> As you know, there are presentations of Ofsted
reports to the Select Committee twice a year&#151;every six months.
Do you see that sort of formula working
here?</div><a name="09030387000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> The other benefit that we might derive from
that is that there would be some sort of continuity in the public
debate. Issues that emerged in one year might become part of
Ofqual&#146;s published plan for the following year and the following
year&#146;s discussion would reflect back on whether or not the right
actions had been taken, to determine if progress had been made or if
further action needed to be carried forward to the year after
that.</div>

has and that comes to its attention to make any pronouncement, one way
or the other, on issues of that kind. That is something that we have
not particularly explored and I do not think that it would be
appropriate for me to come to a view without full consideration of the

looking at the evidence, particularly where there are any issues of

will be seeking evidence on it, but there are a range of other issues
where our starting point would always be to look at the evidence and to
come to a considered judgment on the

there has been a problem with grade inflation, why are we setting up
Ofqual?</div><a name="09030387000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> Ofqual has been set up to regulate the
system, to get better public accountability for the system, to ensure
that there is a better public understanding of the issues and to assure
public confidence. That is what regulators do. I do not think that it
has been set up to address any specific concerns, such as the one that
was just mentioned. However, where there are other concerns, a body
such as Ofqual will be better placed, because of its independence,
particularly from Government, and its accountability to Parliament, to
look at any particular issue, come to a view on it and make a
report.</div><a name="09030387000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
185</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000455"></a>Mr.

was not necessarily related to a specific concern. It was to do with
public confidence in the qualification systems as a whole. What you

concern.</div><a name="09030387000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
186</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000456"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> You know full well that we have just been talking
about the annual grade inflation debate that is centred on A-levels and

did not think that you had been primarily set up to deal with that set
of
concerns.</div><a name="09030387000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> We have been set up to address issues of
public confidence in the qualification system. Where there are specific
concerns, clearly we have the powers under this Bill to look at them
and to come to a considered view, based on the evidence. I will take a
different sort of issue, because there were concerns last year about
the national curriculum test and Ofqual took action on that by setting
up a public inquiry. So it would be precipitate of me to draw any sort
of conclusion at this particular time without having considered the
evidence in the manner that Ofqual says it will consider the evidence
before it makes any public announcements.</div>

regulate?</div><a name="09030387000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> We are regulating a system that
comprises the general qualifications awarding bodies, which are
represented here by Greg and Mike. There is a third awarding body,
Edexcel, which is not represented here today. We have fellow regulators
regulating similar bodies in Wales and in Northern Ireland. There are a
host of vocational qualifications bodies. In fact, I have just had a
note passed to me to say that there are 150 awarding bodies in all that
come within the regulator&#146;s system. Most of those are in the
vocational field; some of them are newly admitted employers, who also
have the responsibility to make
awards.</div><a name="09030387000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
188</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000458"></a>Mr.

vocational qualifications that you are aware of?</div>
<a name="09030387000238"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> Vocational qualifications need to be
seen to represent the standards of the particular industries in which
they operate. There are sector skills councils, which act as a filter
for employers, to ensure that the skills and qualities which employers
are looking for are well represented in the vocational field. It is
important that the vocational examinations which are provided actually
fulfil a purpose which
employers&#151;</div><a name="09030387000239"></a>

have through this Bill.</div>

190</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000460"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I want to give Andrew an opportunity to
contribute. Everybody has been mainly focusing on Ofqual so far. What
do you think these changes mean for QCDA? Is it good news for you and
are there going to be big differences?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div><a name="09030387000242"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">And</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">r</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">ew
Hall:</b></i> I think it is fundamentally very good news for
QCDA. It removes some of the potential internal mental blockages that
perhaps prevented us in the past from being as rigorous as we could be
in doing our delivery jobs. I remember that when I joined the
organisation over two years ago, we would sit there and say we designed
things for the Government, we worked closely with the
Government&#151;that was part of our remit&#151;we reformed
qualifications, we delivered assessments. Then in the same legal
organisation, we had a potential regulator sitting there. We know from
the way we operate that there was no interference, that there was
independence. But the public perception was quite hard to see in that
position. So I think, truthfully, it was very clear and very good news.
It was my first comment when I walked through the door: why do we do
this? So actually, it lets us do that. It lets us focus very clearly on
perhaps adding more value to the development chain. We are clear that
we can challenge the awarding bodies in another type of independent way
that says we are here to provide advice and support and some creative
challenge around the process, and do not have to worry about being seen
to regulate ourselves.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
191</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000461"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> How are you going to work with Ofqual to
make sure that the transition is, to use the old-fashioned term, a
seamless transition?</div>
<a name="09030387000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">And</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">r</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">ew
Hall:</b></i> Seamless transitions, I think, are sometimes a
dream. The reality is that there is a lot of work that has had to go
into planning how we do this. As accounting officer, I am, as of today,
still responsible for many of the aspects of Ofqual&#146;s
accountabilities, and that is a fact of life. You cannot walk away from
that. The way we dealt with that was to set up a number of internal
processes that very clearly segregate what is the regulatory activity
that is a process and an output and a product, and we have helped
Ofqual build the capacity to do that. We have provided the legal
support, the financial support and the system support to deliver what
they needed to do.</div>
<a name="09030387000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Probably the
most challenging area is around qualification development, where
historically there is someone who develops the criteria that go into
the qualifications that awarding bodies produce, and then regulates
those criteria as they are delivered. It is in that process that we
have put a considerable amount of work into developing two teams that
have worked together for about six months to really tease out the
nuances in there. I think we just need to continue to drive that
process for however long it is until vesting day, and make sure we
support the operational transfer, the systems transfer that leaves
Ofqual properly resourced to go forward and do its
job.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
193</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000463"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> It seems from what you said today, from the earlier
submissions, that there are three big issues: autonomy, consistency and
credibility. So in turn, does the Bill, in its current form, offer
sufficient 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>autonomy? Some of your earlier remarks suggest that it should offer
greater autonomy through the different forms of parliamentary scrutiny
you described, as well as by other means. Secondly, on
consistency&#151;again judging from what you have said here and
elsewhere&#151;there are real issues about maintaining consistency
across qualifications. One thinks of modular and non-modular
qualifications, for example. How do you see that working?</div>
<a name="09030387000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, in
terms of credibility, is there not a poacher and game-keeper issue?
What if you have people on the board that might be setting or marking,
or have set or marked, exams? There is nothing to stop professors of
education in educational faculties, or academics who write exam papers,
from being on the board, is there? How are you going to guarantee real
independence, which provides credibility, unless you sort out that
potential for conflicts of
interest?</div><a name="09030387000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> I think the question was probably
addressed to me. May I take the last point, because I think that it has
been covered to some extent in the earlier answers? The whole process
of appointments to the Ofqual board has to be a very open, public
process and one involving the Public Standards Board. Greg also
helpfully mentioned that Parliament itself will have an opportunity to
scrutinise the process. I think that conflicts of interest have to be
addressed at that particular stage, it has to be clear that whoever is
appointed, whatever their interests might be&#151;whether they come
from an employment or an educational background&#151;that those
conflicts of interest are going to be managed. In public life, people
do manage conflicts of interest in a very open way. The worst conflicts
of interest are those that you do not know about. What we need is a
very open process whereby everyone will understand the background of
the person concerned. I think that that is a manageable
process.</div><a name="09030387000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
when we come to consistency, the regulator will require awarding bodies
that offer the same qualification to act in a consistent manner,
particularly with regard to the setting of standards. We can do that
through working with the awarding bodies&#151;it is important that we
start with the premise that we do work with them because they have a
lot of expertise, great professionalism and a commitment to ensuring
that standards are maintained from year to year and are appropriate to
the qualification concerned. It is appropriate that our starting point
will always be working with the awarding bodies to ensure that we have
an agreement about how we are going to address issues where
inconsistent behaviour could lead to different standards. If we cannot
achieve that through consensus, then the Bill gives us the power of
direction and that is what we would have to rely
on.</div><a name="09030387000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry, I have forgotten your first
point.</div><a name="09030387000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
194</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000464"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> My first point was about autonomy. It seems that by
looking at OCR and others, for example, you have said today and
previously that there are other means by which autonomy could be
demonstrated, other lines of accountability. In Parliament, we have
heard some debate about whether Select Committees should be involved in
that. Is autonomy not implicitly, intrinsically linked to
credibility?</div><a name="09030387000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> Indeed it is. That is why I believe it
is very important that the Bill not only gives us the independence and
the autonomy, but that it is also seen to do so. Perception is a very
important element of how 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>people understand autonomy and independence. It is not just the words on
the page, it is actually how it is all
enacted.</div><a name="09030387000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
to appointments, the Secretary of State will approve appointments to
the board. I do not think that it is explicit in the Bill, but it would
certainly be my expectation that the Ofqual chair would be involved in
that appointment process. It may be that there needs to be some thought
given as to whether that should be explicit in the Bill, as I believe
it is in the case of the UK Statistics Authority. There is also a
little bit in the Bill about the Secretary of State approving the
numbers of Ofqual staff, terms and conditions of service and so on. I
understand that that is all part of the accountability of Ofqual on
matters that have an effect on the spending of Ofqual. It may be that
there are other ways of looking at that, rather than giving an
impression that the Secretary of State is, as it were, in control of
Ofqual. Of course, again, that would undermine the perception, even
though the reality behind the perception might be somewhat different.
There are ways in which the Committee&#146;s scrutiny of the Bill
might address some of the concerns that you have expressed here, and
might demonstrate more clearly that Ofqual is a body that is truly
independent of
Government.</div><a name="09030387000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
195</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000465"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> However, when the structure of qualifications
changes, it is hard to have a clear idea of how you can regulate to
ensure consistent standards, is it not? They were your words, not
mine.</div>
<a name="09030387000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> That is always the point, of course, at
which the issue of standards comes very much to the fore, and setting a
standard for a new qualification is a difficult challenge for all
concerned. It is a challenge for the awarding bodies and it will be a
challenge for the regulator. That is why it is so important that we
have a means of talking with the awarding bodies at an early stage
about how those standards should be set and how a continuity with
previous standards must be established. The Bill gives Ofqual the
authority to take the lead on that, and to ensure that we all have a
clear understanding of how we will go about setting standards for any
new qualifications that come
along.</div><a name="09030387000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
196</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000466"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> My first question is specifically to Mr.
Watson about a memorandum that was submitted on behalf of the OCR. In
particular, I refer to the issue of independence and what you perceive
to be certain powers that the Secretary of State will retain in terms
of not having sufficient independence in respect of Ofqual. Will you
enlarge on the main concerns that you
have?</div><a name="09030387000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> There is one particularly important area that
the Committee might find useful to explore during the Bill. That is the
process by which qualifications are developed. To clarify, in the
qualifications system, bodies like OCR, AQA and others develop
qualifications. We write the syllabuses and, from the syllabuses, we
write exams and other kinds of assessments. From those, we set
standards and award qualifications. The regulator is established to
oversee that and&#151;if I can use an aviation analogy&#151;make
sure that those planes are fit to fly.</div>
<a name="09030387000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">As in the
aviation or food industry, the crucial job of a regulator is at the
start of that process. It must make sure that only planes that are fit
to fly are allowed to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>take to the air and only food that is fit to eat is put on supermarket
shelves. That is important because it might be tempting to think that
the regulator needs lots of powers only at the end of the process to
beat up awarding bodies when the standards do not add up. However, most
of the risk in the qualifications arena is when qualifications are
created, and we would like to see Ofqual able to assert its
independence powerfully at that point.</div>
<a name="09030387000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one reads
only the Ofqual chapter in the Bill, it would seem that that is the
model we are moving towards. However, an alternative route through this
process is suggested if one reads the Ofqual chapter and the
Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency together, along with
the accompanying notes. That process would begin with Ministers, and
pass through QCDA, which might be heavily involved in developing the
criteria against which qualifications are licensed. Only then would
Ofqual have the opportunity to either say yes or no,
often&#151;presumably&#151;under some pressure to say yes.
Ofqual&#146;s role is then simply reduced to monitoring the
qualification as it rolls out and trying to deal with any difficult
features of the qualifications as they
unfold.</div><a name="09030387000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that it is worth exploring whether the intent that is clear in
the Ofqual chapter of the Bill still stands up when the QCDA chapter,
schedules and explanatory notes are stacked up; that suggests more of a
subtle interplay between the bodies than we think the Secretary of
State might want to achieve.</div>

197</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000467"></a>Jeff

point?</div><a name="09030387000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Creswell:</b></i> Greg is making a good point. It is critical
that Ofqual is able to take a view about developments that come forward
from QCDA in so far as those developments affect its capacity to
regulate standards and liability and so on. This concerns the way
Ofqual is able to take a view and for that view to stick when it comes
to the finalisation of the criteria. I take some comfort from the fact
that it is Ofqual that will own those criteria and, presumably, unless
those criteria will enable it to regulate, then it will not accept
them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
198</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000468"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> I wanted to seek clarification of Kathleen&#146;s
point that she made in reply to an earlier question about having
provision in the Bill for the power to fine. Do Greg and Mike have any
views on the power to
fine?</div><a name="09030387000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> I am happy to answer that in all seriousness.
The first thing is to repeat what I said earlier: a regulator that
finds itself counting crashed planes and fining people for crashing
them is an unsuccessful regulator. The important thing is that effort,
power, authority and resource within Ofqual must be devoted to getting
qualifications that are fit for use into the system in the first place.
That is an important principle. The second thing concerns OCR, as I
mentioned earlier. It is a charity, a not-for-profit organisation
embedded in a university, part of an international group that lives on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>its reputation. The currency of the business we are in, if you want to
call it that, is reputation, integrity and trust. If you want to wound
my organisation, you wound its reputation rather than its finances.
Most of what is envisaged for Ofqual will be about a public debate. If
at any stage Kathleen and her colleagues were to feel that OCR was not
doing its job properly, the threat of being shamed is much stronger
than the threat of being fined for an organisation like mine.</div>
<a name="09030387000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Creswell:</b></i> I would add that AQA is not-for-profit but
we do a lot of examining in areas where we believe there is a social
need because we are an educational charity. It would be passing strange
to have to make provision, possibly at the expense of the examining
that we do for its social and educational good, against the possibility
of being fined. I would think it inappropriate, given the structure of
the awarding bodies and the kind of social contract that exists about
putting in effort and resources that are not profitable but are
socially desirable.</div>
<a name="09030387000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
199</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000469"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> There is one other quick point I want to raise. The
main examining boards we have in this country are global brands and do
quite a lot of business overseas. Do you see the implementation of the
Bill adding to that global brand, in terms of extra scrutiny and so on?
Will it allow you to market the brand globally even
further?</div><a name="09030387000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> We will have to wait and see what becomes of
Ofqual. I am mentally playing the 150-year-old Cambridge brand against
the one-year-old Ofqual brand. It may take some time before Ofqual has
that global
traction.</div><a name="09030387000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
200</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000470"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Mike, in your note to the Committee you tell us
about the much-publicised problems in summer 2008 when Ofqual asked
your organisation to lower the standard it was setting in GCSE science
to come into line with the other two bodies. Could you tell us a bit
about your experience and concerns, and more about any potential
solution to the
problem?</div><a name="09030387000273"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Creswell:</b></i> Yes, happily, without rehearsing the GCSE
science thing, because in a way that is done and dusted. It absolutely
highlights that I hear what Kathleen says when she talks about the
power to direct to awarding bodies how they should go about setting
standards. I am clear that in broad procedural terms, that power is
there. Indeed, I am clear that in the science incident, all the
awarding bodies had followed the procedure as laid down. However
precise that procedure was made, I am sure that we would all follow it,
but there is a distinction between following the process and what
results come out of it.</div>
<a name="09030387000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the GCSE
science incident really highlighted was that however much Ofqual may be
empowered to command a process, that does not guarantee results and
standards that are consistent at the end of the process. That is what
the science thing illustrated. That is why it is extremely important
that when events like that arise&#151;though rare, they will arise
again&#151;Ofqual has the authority in the room so that everybody
understands that though everybody will have followed the process, if
the outcomes are looking different, Ofqual has the power to compel a
standard to change. There is a key distinction between Ofqual
guaranteeing the actual standards set and Ofqual guaranteeing that the
processes are all in tune. The same processes do not, as GCSE showed,
necessarily produce identical standards.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div><a name="09030387000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
201</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000471"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b><b class="B"> </b>So you think that the powers in the Bill need
to be strengthened in that
respect?</div><a name="09030387000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Creswell:</b></i> I think that Ofqual should simply have a
power to direct, for a particular qualification, a particular standard
on a particular occasion. It would be used rarely, if ever, but it
would prevent Ofqual, at a time when urgent action might be
needed&#151;certainly for GCSEs and A-levels&#151;from finding
itself in negotiation with awarding bodies about a change in the
standards that they are proposing to set. It would ensure that Ofqual
had the authority to do that. I have to say that that requires the
clarity that I talked about earlier about precisely how we define
consistent standards. That is why part of our submission to the
Committee is about the need for Ofqual to establish clear and
measurable criteria for assessing whether our standards are
consistent.</div><a name="09030387000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
202</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000472"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I wanted to ask Kathleen about that as my last
question. Before that, can I ask Greg and Kathleen to comment on what
Mike has said? Do you think that the Bill is deficient in any sense in
relation to those powers?</div>
<a name="09030387000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> No. The Bill is very clear, actually, as I
see it. Bearing in mind what I have already said about the importance
of Ofqual applying maximum effort at the beginning of the process and
making sure that qualifications are fit for purpose when launched, I
think that there is then a sufficient backstop in the Bill in the form
of a power to direct that is open-ended enough to be used in the way
that Mike is talking about. However, I hope that the Committee
recognises that it will always be a failure of regulation for awarding
bodies and the regulator to find themselves in that
situation.</div><a name="09030387000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
203</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000473"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> You are agreeing with Mike that Ofqual should have
that power; you just think that the power is already there in the
Bill?</div><a name="09030387000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> I think that the Bill is already clear
enough. More importantly, I think that the lesson to be learned from
that situation is that by the time the technical statistical experts
from the awarding bodies were sat with Kathleen and her colleagues in
the summer, it was too late. There was a gap there. Work could have
been done three years earlier, when the structure of the qualification
was changing and the assessment arrangements were going to change, to
better understand what the features of the new qualification were
likely to throw up in the way of new
challenges.</div><a name="09030387000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
204</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000474"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Without revisiting the summer too much, Mike looks
as if he is just going to
quickly&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="09030387000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Creswell:</b></i> No, I am not going to do that at all. I
merely wanted to make the point that I agree, but that is precisely why
Ofqual, for the first time in this country&#151;the previous
regulator did not do it, and the awarding bodies have not done
it&#151;needs to establish very clear measures by which it will
evaluate whether our standards are consistent, in advance. Then we will
not be in the situation that Greg described. Those two
things&#151;the power to direct on a specific standard consistently,
and clarity about some of the key issues that underpin that unfortunate
public debate every summer&#151;are what I hope Ofqual would
have.</div>
<a name="09030387000283"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> Briefly, I want to make a connection with the
earlier discussion about accountability to Parliament and what might be
in an annual report from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>Ofqual. I imagine it would be specifically laid out in the Act that
Ofqual reports those kinds of incidents and each and every occasion on
which it directed an awarding body. That would mean that the direction
is visible, and that it could be accompanied by a commentary on why a
direction is necessary, given all the other powers that might have been
used earlier in the process to avoid it.</div>
<a name="09030387000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030387000475"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Kathleen, do you have the power, and do you want
it?</div><a name="09030387000285"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> It is good that the awarding bodies have
said so clearly that Ofqual should have the powers. I totally agree
with everything that was said on that, but I happen to believe that the
Bill already gives us the powers, as I described earlier, on conditions
and direction. That is clear. However, I reiterate what was said: there
is no point coming to a regulator two weeks before the publication of
results and saying, &#147;This is a problem that we have not been
able to solve.&#148; For the record, Ofqual asked nobody to lower
standards. There were three awarding bodies, each of which worked
professionally to maintain standards. Two weeks before exam results,
you are not in a position to perform an act of Solomon to prevent the
baby being cut in half, as it
were.</div><a name="09030387000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only way in which you can regulate qualifications is to get it right at
the beginning. You need to lay down the requirements very clearly. We
are expecting every awarding body that is offering the same
qualification to do so in order to maintain standards.</div>
<a name="09030387000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
already started that process since the summer. We looked ahead and,
given the limited powers that we have under the current legislation, we
have been working with our colleagues to ensure that there is no wide
discrepancy, as there was last summer, between the interpretation of
the evidence that you need to set grade bandings that are consistent
across the boards and over time. We have been looking at the AS units
that have been awarded. We have a system in place, and we are
monitoring it, and we do not anticipate the sort of problem that we had
in the summer.</div>
<a name="09030387000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030387000476"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is helpful. I have one final question, which
follows up something that John Hayes said earlier. He was talking about
circumstances where you have a big shift in the composition of a
qualification, such as in the modular GCSEs. Is your job in holding
standards level or consistent&#151;to end the summer
debate&#151;such that you would expect a cohort with the same
abilities that had previously gone through under the old qualification
to get the same broad distribution of grades in the new examination,
even if its composition, modules and coursework has changed? Is that a
reasonable expectation of what keeping standards consistent
means?</div><a name="09030387000289"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> It is a very big part of looking at
standard setting in the first year of a qualification. Clearly, the
nature of the cohort, their prior abilities, which you might judge from
existing
evidence&#151;</div><a name="09030387000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030387000477"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Assume they are
identical.</div><a name="09030387000291"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> Assuming that they are identical in a
very large cohort, you would expect a broadly similar pattern, even if
there are some shifts because of the nature of the curriculum change or
the accessibility of the examination, modules or whatever. However, it
is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>not so simple, in so far as you have three awarding bodies, each of
which has its share of the market. You have got to be very clear when
looking at the outcomes of the three awarding bodies that you are truly
reflecting the nature of the entry to those exams, and the nature of
the challenges that candidates have faced.</div>
<a name="09030387000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">For me, there
is a clear balance between the technical and statistical evidence of
the nature of the cohort, which is clearly a major part of standard
setting. However, bearing in mind that young people and old people are
working very hard for their qualification and looking at the evidence
that they produce&#151;their scripts and other things&#151;a
balance of professional judgment and technical expertise must be
struck, which all the awarding bodies recognise. The issue is how much
value we place on those
matters.</div>
<a name="09030387000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
205</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000478"></a>Mr.

and the ability to understand all the issues of the nature of what we
have been talking about and who has a very clear understanding of the
requirements of the outside world and its expectations of the
qualifications. We need someone who will command respect from both
yourselves, as parliamentarians, and the wider public. However, you are
asking me to write a job description for a job that currently does not
exist.</div>
<a name="09030387000299"></a>

209</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000482"></a>Mr.

be honest, I find it unbelievable that you do not have an idea of that.
Why is that?</div>
<a name="09030387000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> As Andrew has said, we currently exist
very much within QCA, so the finances come from QCA. When we come to
sit down and talk about what an Ofqual chief executive&#146;s salary
is worth, clearly one of the touchstones will be other public bodies,
such as Ofsted and the QCDA. At this point, however, when the Bill is
at an early stage in its passage through Parliament, it would be
inappropriate for us to go down that line and pre-empt your
consideration of it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
210</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000483"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Mr. Watson, you come from what is,
gosh, quite an amazing organisation with 170 years of heritage. Am I
right?</div><a name="09030387000304"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> One hundred and fifty
years.</div><a name="09030387000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
211</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000484"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I am ageing it. It has Oxford, Cambridge and all
those big names in it. How do you feel about suddenly being regulated
by this new kid on the block? Has your nose been put out of joint
slightly? You are putting on a brave face, but I am not sure that you
are entirely happy with it. Are
you?</div><a name="09030387000306"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> We have advocated for a long time the need
for a more visible and stronger regulator in that sector, hand on
heart. I have said that the value of what we do rests so much on our
public reputation, public trust and a sense of integrity in the system,
but there is clearly a persistent challenge out there, partly about
levels of political involvement, which I think is unjustified but
understand where the perception comes from.</div>
<a name="09030387000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a perception that change is too frequent, too ill-understood and that
it too often puts standards at risk without us knowing the risk we are
taking. I suffer the consequences of that gradual erosion of trust as
much as anyone, not just in the summer, but in the perpetual and
corrosive debate that runs in the media much of the time. I am looking
forward to the day when there is an independent voice that will stand
alongside me and, when I have got it right, will say so to build pubic
confidence in what I do and that is willing, when I do not get it
right, to take that into the public domain so that we can see
it.</div><a name="09030387000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
212</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000485"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> That is because you think that there are some
people in your sector and marketplace who are not as&#151;how can I
put it?&#151;revered as you might be. Is not that the truth? Do not
you want this because you want to maintain standards at a level that
not everyone currently
meets?</div><a name="09030387000309"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> No, the thing I want to address is the public
perception that we are somehow giving away a standard so that we can
demonstrate in a way that gets public confidence that we are
maintaining standards. I believe that we are maintaining standards and
think that we go to extraordinary lengths to understand changes. For
example, as the A-level is changing structure we are going to
unprecedented lengths to understand the consequences of that change and
some of the risk to which we and the people who take our qualifications
might be exposed. That is why I want it there.</div>
<a name="09030387000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will be
honest and say that, with regard to vocational qualifications, which
OCR is also involved in, I have concerns that varying degrees of rigour
are applied to some qualifications by some bodies and think that it
would be helpful to have a regulator who gave that more visibility.
There are different sorts of risks. We have talked a lot about what
might be thought of as higher profile qualifications, such as GCSEs and
A-levels. In the area of vocational qualifications, where there are
more different qualifications, where there often assessment
arrangements that are dependent on a tutor in a college or a trainer in
a training company making judgments about their own students, there are
a range of additional challenges to making sure that those
qualifications hold water. There is work to be done in that area,
particularly with the current state of the economy and the drive to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>put the right skills back into the economy, some of those qualifications
will become more important than ever. It has been an area that has been
under-regulated to date. I should like to see a stronger regulator in
that
area.</div><a name="09030387000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Creswell:</b></i> I think the straight answer to your
question is that, yes, there are unquestionably commercial issues in
competition between awarding bodies. One of the things that I think a
strong and independent regulator will provide is an answer to the
accusation that standards are dumbed down for commercial reasons. That
is one of the reasons why we welcome a regulator. The other reason is
because in the end the system that we operate is only there to provide
good, valuable qualifications for learners so that they can go on and
progress and live happy and fulfilled lives. That will not happen
without some very clear public accountability and some very clear
public assurance that those qualifications are worth the paper they are
printed on. For that reason, put together with the commercial
competition point, it is an extremely good development to have an
independent regulator for
qualifications.</div><a name="09030387000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030387000486"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have three more questions to deal with in
nine minutes.</div>
<a name="09030387000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
213</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000487"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I want to pick up on some points that Kathleen
made earlier. Ofqual is already in existence, albeit not in the same
form as it will be in the future. I find it quite surprising that you
had not already looked at some of the concerns that have been expressed
by independent academics about the rigour of current examinations, for
which the Government are responsible. Surely that should have been an
enormous priority for your organisation? A number of people and
organisations, whether it is Peter Timms, the Royal Society of
Chemistry or the British Council, have put together independent and
coherent arguments that there are problems there. When will you look at
this and when will you give us some answers on the issues that are
being raised? That is a really important role of the regulator. The
other point that I wanted you to clarify is this. Accountability is
critical in this area. To whom are you as an organisation accountable?
To put it bluntly, who can sack
you?</div><a name="09030387000314"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> At the very outset of Ofqual&#146;s
coming into existence we indicated that we would conduct studies into
the reliability of the system. We are involving people like Peter Timms
and others in a research group that we have looking at issues of that
kind. Clearly that group will be well placed to look at other concerns
which are expressed. Yes, I have seen the Royal Society of
Chemistry&#146;s concerns about that area of
science.</div><a name="09030387000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
214</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000488"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> So why do another report? Why not just listen to
what they
say?</div><a name="09030387000316"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> We do listen, but there are several
voices out there about standards. We must not react to one or other
without the clear evidence of doing so. When you asked me about looking
at grade inflation, I should have said that several studies that have
been conducted over the years involving international experts looking
at our system have concluded that there is grade inflation. We need to
bring in that sort of expertise. We will do that. I am sorry if we
appear to be slow off the mark, but there are some studies, such as the
reliabilities study, which are well down the mark.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div><a name="09030387000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
accountability issue, we are, as we established earlier, going to be
accountable to Parliament. We will present the report to Parliament and
it will make clear what work we have done, how we have gone about it,
what criteria there are to judge whether we have been successful and
whether we are doing the job that we were set up to do in a very
rigorous way. I suppose that if it came to a sacking, that would be a
loss of public confidence. I think that any chair who is in a position
where there is a loss of public confidence really has to consider his
or her position before it gets to the sacking point. But if it were to
get the sacking point, the question is whether, as indicated here, it
would be the Secretary of State for other points of reference, or
whether Parliament itself would deal with the matter. I would think
that you would want to include that in the Bill. However, sacking ought
not to be necessary. If the chief regulator&#151;that is the title
that the post carries&#151;has lost the confidence of the public and
of Parliament, that should lead the individual to question their
position.</div><a name="09030387000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
215</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000489"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> You said that that needs to be dealt with further
in the
Bill.</div><a name="09030387000319"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> I am sure that you, as the Committee,
would wish to consider whether the Bill gives sufficient answer to the
kind of question you have
raised.</div><a name="09030387000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
216</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000490"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I want to ask a question of Andrew, please. If the
new agency were to give full approval to IGCSEs, would it be plain
sailing ahead for independent schools and some of the grammar schools
that wish to use those
exams?</div><a name="09030387000321"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Hall:</b></i> Our role in giving approval to things is very
much centred around the criteria that form the basis of the
qualification. Along with the awarding bodies and other organisations
such as Ofqual, we have to make sure that we develop appropriate
criteria that provide qualifications that the nation and learners need.
If those criteria are investigated and the needs are met, it would. If
they did not meet the needs, it would not. That would be very much a
matter for Ofqual and us to
determine.</div><a name="09030387000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
217</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000491"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> May I ask a quick follow-up? Is there another
body&#151;I believe that it is the Joint Advisory Committee for
Qualifications Approval&#151;that would have an influence on the
position of IGCSEs and other qualifications that are not fully
recognised in this
country?</div><a name="09030387000323"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Hall:</b></i> JACQA is very much a funding-type organisation.
It determines and advises the Government on which qualifications should
be
funded.</div><a name="09030387000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
218</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000492"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> In other words, the Government would have the
final word, whatever you
decided.</div><a name="09030387000325"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Hall:</b></i> No, because there is the matter of
qualifications that are offered and qualifications that are funded. You
then get to the heart of how qualifications are funded in the public
and private education sectors. They are unrelated
points.</div><a name="09030387000326"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
219</b><b class="B"><a name="09030387000493"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am pleased to be able to ask these witnesses one
question&#151;there are so many. I would like to pick up on fining,
because that is where the Secretary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>of State says that he has an open mind. I listened to the responses from
the two charity people, but not all awarding bodies are charities,
particularly now that  we have the likes of McDonalds, Flybe
and so on as awarding bodies. You spoke about the importance of
regulating vocational bodies. Do you think that in the context of
commercial organisations as awarding bodies, there may be some merit in
giving Kathleen what she wants&#151;the ability to
fine?</div><a name="09030387000327"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Creswell:</b></i> My concern is with general qualifications,
the qualifications that the great majority of our 16 and 18-year-olds
do. In that setting, I think that the point I made earlier trumps the
need to control other people in other parts of the
sector.</div><a name="09030387000328"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Greg
Watson:</b></i> I would go back to my principle that the
greatest damage can be done to any qualification is to undermine public
confidence in it, and that is as true for a commercial organisation
trying to market a qualification to earn revenues as it is for my
organisation, which uses a qualification to enhance its reputation. The
damage that Ofqual can do, if that is what it seeks to do through
powers of intervention, in saying that a qualification is not fit for
purpose, that it will be de-listed or that it has a big black mark
hanging over it until somebody answers some serious questions, would
have exactly the effect that you are looking for even on a commercial
organisation. By doing it in that way, you risk all the wrong effects
on charitable organisations that Mike alluded to
earlier.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div><a name="09030387000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030387000494"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Kathleen, I might as well give you the final run
at
this.</div><a name="09030387000330"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kathleen
Tattershall:</b></i> I hear what my colleagues say, but I
think that having fines in the armoury of the regulator is an important
safeguard. Down the line, one may wish they had that power, instead of
going from a fairly moderate sanction of direction and possibly capping
fees or whatever, and leaping to taking away the accreditation of an
awarding body, which is the ultimate
sanction.</div><a name="09030387000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power to fine is, in a sense, a safeguard. It gives the regulator the
possibility to do so and could be a deterrent. I totally agree with
what has been said: at the end of the day, the awarding bodies&#146;
reputations are on the line if they are criticised by the regulator.
Nevertheless, it is something that ought to be in our range of
sanctions&#151;whether it is used often or
not.</div><a name="09030387000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chair,
I wonder if I could take the opportunity to come back on the question
that Annette
asked?</div><a name="09030387000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030387000495"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I do not think that you can because we have
reached seven o&#146;clock, but if you want to submit any
supplementary memorandums to all Members of the Committee, you are
welcome to do
so.</div><a name="09030387000334"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered,
</i>That further consideration be now adjourned. &#151;<i class="I">(Ms
Butler.)</i></div><a name="09030387000346"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="09030387000335"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Adjourned
