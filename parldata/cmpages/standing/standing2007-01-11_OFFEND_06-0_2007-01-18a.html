Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe):
						</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Atkinson. It is a delight to see you in the Chair on
this stormy day. At the beginning of the Tuesday sitting, I handed back
the disc containing evidence from the informal evidence session carried
out by the Opposition, which was given to me by the hon. Member for
Hornchurch. I gave a hard copy of the transcript to the hon. Gentleman,
so that the names of witnesses could be added and the Opposition could
submit it to you, Mr. Atkinson, as evidence to the Committee
under the new rules. I find it ironic, although the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough might not, that staff from the shadow Home
Secretary&#146;s office rang the Home Office to say that they had
lost the discs that I had given them. I am happy to supply another one,
but it may not be necessary, as I know that the hon. and learned
Gentleman has been working on the hard
copy.</div>

of order, Mr. Atkinson. From time to time, we have to
indulge the Minister, because he and his fellow Ministers are in a bit

describe as no more than a slipped disc, rather than a lost disc, all
power to his elbow.</div>
					<a name="07011873000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have gone through the transcripts and have filled in some of the names
and some of the blanks where the wording was indistinct, and my
researcher now has them. Perhaps between now and Tuesday I can work out
with the Government how to present them formally, if that is what we
do, and bring them within the confines of the Committee. That is a
matter of procedural detail, however, and we do not need to trouble
this afternoon&#146;s sitting with
it.</div>

					<a name="07011873000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">The
inspectorate</div>
					<a name="07011873000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000289"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I shall make one or two brief points in relation
to the clause. I see the need for an inspectorate of those who carry
out probation services, but I amnot sure of the point of
changing its name from the inspectorate of the national probation
service for England and Wales to the inspectorate of probation for
England and Wales. The word &#147;national&#148; will be removed,
but I think that England and Wales deserve a national
inspectorate.</div>
					<a name="07011873000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2001,
the second reform of the probation service since the Government came
into office nationalised the service, which is now to be broken down so
that it is more a creature of the National Offender Management Service.
Is there any purpose, however, in going to the huge of expense of
changing writing paper and brass plates on office doors? What is
important is that we should have an inspectorate of the probation
service, whose functions should be informed by a clear policy. I am
concerned that the Government like changing the names of things.
Another example is the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which has
apparently been changed to the Deputy Prime Minister&#146;s office,
no doubt at vast expense. Those may be minor matters but, on the other
hand, if the Government are going to introduce them, they might as well
explain them in a way that enables the public to understand how and why
that money has been
spent.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000290"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> Clause 8 makes consequential amendments to the
provisions relating to the inspectorate of the national probation
service to reflect the fact that the national probation service will
cease to exist when local probation boards are abolished and that the
inspectorate will in future need to inspect the services delivered by a
range of probation providers. The clause renames Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectorate of the national probation service for England and Wales as
Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of probation for England and Wales,
and it renames Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of the national
probation service for England and Wales as Her Majesty&#146;s chief
inspector of probation for England and Wales. It also amends section 7
of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 to include the
inspection of the provision of probation services under clause 3 of
this Bill.</div>
					<a name="07011873000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8(3)(b) allows the Secretary of State to give further directions
related to the probation purposes referred to in clause 1. It confers
further functions on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 155</div>the inspectorate to reflect any future changes in the clause 1 purposes.
The substance of the work of Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate will not
change, and it will continue to be a crucial mechanism for monitoring
and maintaining
standards.</div>
					<a name="07011873000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8
merely updates the legislative provisions to reflect the other changes
in the Bill. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough has referred to
the issues around the inspectorate and the variety of changes that the
Government have introduced. We want the inspectorates to work
effectively and efficiently, and we want to make sure that we set out
on the face of the Bill what the consequences will be for the
inspectorates in relation to the new
providers.</div>
					<a name="07011873000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
explanation, I hope that the clause can stand part of the
Bill.</div>

					<a name="07011873000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not
seen those regulations and do not know what arrangements the Secretary
of State has in mind for the carrying out of probation purposes or for
the running of approved premises, which is implied by the Bill, by
operators other than the probation
service.</div>
					<a name="07011873000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">After having
seen the &#147;Panorama&#148; programme before Christmas 2006, it
strikes me that there is a degree of public concern about the way in
which probation premises and bail hostels are managed. Substituting the
words &#147;probation and bail hostels&#148; for &#147;approved
premises&#148; in subsection (3)(a) will allow us to extract from the
Government better information about what or rather who they think will
be running these
premises.</div>
					<a name="07011873000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the face
of it, the matter should not be surrounded by controversy, but we all
know that the sort of people who are housed in bail hostels and
probation hostels are often difficult to look after. They could be
people who have been released from prison after a lengthy prison
sentence, in which case they will have come out of the secure prisoner
state and gone through the category D prisoner state&#151;in
parenthesis, the use of the expression &#147;open prison&#148; is
perhaps 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 156</div>misleading, which does not do any of us any good; as Lord Ramsbotham has
suggested, we should call them &#147;resettlement prisons&#148;.
When people come out of those prisons, they are sometimes housed in
what will be called &#147;approved premises&#148;, and probation
staff are supposed to look after them. We want to know precisely what
sort of places &#147;approved premises&#148; will be. Will they be
any different from the existing arrangements?</div>
					<a name="07011873000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The &#147;Panorama&#148;
programme highlighted controversial areas of public concern about bail
hostels. Where will bail hostels be located? Can we be assured that the
people who run them, who will be paid by the Secretary of State to
carry out those functions on the Government&#146;s behalf, will be
adequately trained, resourced and able to control and direct the people
in their care, so that those people receive the necessary treatment and
supervision, which will allow the public to feel safe in their houses,
streets and towns? It is a short point, but it is one that is worthy of
a response from the Government. I look forward to hearing what the
Minister has to
say.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000292"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful for the way in which the hon. and
learned Gentleman has raised the issue. There are 104 approved premises
in England and Wales, including 14 run by voluntary management
committees and one run by a private sector organisation. They are used
primarily to supervise high risk of harm offenders on release from
custody, and they make a crucial contribution to the protection of the
public. I pay tribute to the staff who work in them, whose job is very
demanding and
difficult.</div>
					<a name="07011873000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members have mentioned the &#147;Panorama&#148; programme, which
highlighted some of the issues relating to approved premises. Many
people are working very hard and very successfully in the management of
offenders, but stories that show problem areas always attract the
attention of the media, so we do not hear about the occasions when the
good work is carried out to a successful conclusion. Right at the start
of our proceedings, I said that we had to be truthful with the public
about what we can do in terms of the management of offenders. The
expectation that offenders can be watched 24 hours a day, seven days a
week is not realistic. However, they can be managed properly, and the
multi-agency public protection arrangements that we have in the UK are
unique and are working very well on the
whole.</div>
					<a name="07011873000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 9 of
the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 introduced the term
&#147;approved premises&#148; as the standard term to describe
those establishments. Previously there had been no standardised names,
with establishments operating as probation hostels, bail hostels or
probation and bail hostels. The 2000 Act endorsed the concept of a
single estate with a generic purpose, and it also emphasised the fact
that these establishments are approved by the Secretary of State for a
specific purpose and are therefore distinct from the other forms of
supported accommodation available to offenders&#151;the latter point
is important, because the matter is not only about
terminology.</div>
					<a name="07011873000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2000
Act reflected the changes that had occurred in the use of approved
premises over a period of years. Whereas historically hostels had often
been used to provide suitable accommodation for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 157</div>defendants who might otherwise have been remanded into
custody&#151;hence the term &#147;bail hostel&#148;&#151;they
are now targeted at high-risk offenders on release from custody on
licence. I accept that the term has not entered common parlance and
that the expression &#147;bail hostel&#148; is still more widely
used outside the probation service, but it is misleading and entirely
inappropriate for use in
legislation.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07011873000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the question
of whether the public will be adequately protected in future, public
protection is at the heart of what we want to achieve. The MAPPA
arrangements are important to us. There is no way that we would want to
diminish those responsibilities to the public. I believe that the
proposal set out in the clause is an entirely appropriate way to head
forward. There are issues about accommodation in addition to approved
premises which I am sure we will come back to when we consider the
outcome of the child sex offenders review that the Government are
currently undertaking. There are a great many issues around
resettlement. I hope that with that explanation the hon. and learned
Gentleman will be relatively happy and withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="07011873000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">This amendment
deals with the final subsectionof the clause, which removes
some people from the provisions of the Private Security Industry Act
2001. The Minister said in his response to the previous debate that, in
the main, approved premises are run by the public sector, but that a
number are run by the voluntary sector and one by a private company. I
have a feeling that that one has got into considerable difficulties in
recent weeks, although I might be wrong. I am aware that one hostel
that is not in the public sector has had
problems.</div>
					<a name="07011873000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
clause stands, it appears to open up the possibility of considerably
more approved premises being run in the private sector. Subsection (3)
states that the Secretary of State may make payments to any person in
connection with the operation of approved premises. Will the Minister
explain the reason for including subsection (7)? It appears to exclude
those who manage private sector approved premises from the scope of the
2001 Act, which regulates the private security industry and requires
people in a range of jobs to be licensed. As part of the licensing
process there are Criminal Records Bureau and identity checks, and
training and qualifications are required. I am puzzled 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 158</div>why we should remove from those safeguards people working in approved
premises, who will be dealing with fairly dangerous
people.</div>
					<a name="07011873000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2001 Act
includes among the definitions of licensable
activities</div>
					<a name="07011873000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;guarding one
or more individuals against assault or against injuries that might be
suffered in consequence of the unlawful conduct of
others.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011873000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is clearly
a possibility in any approved premises. It seems strange that somebody
working on security at my local greyhound racing track is required to
have a Security Industry Authority certificate, but somebody managing a
bail hostel is not. I would have thought that that job would be at
least as difficult and perhaps more open to
risk.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): Does my hon.
Friend agree that it is a matter not only of danger, but of vulnerable
adults who will be dealt with in approved
premises?</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000296"></a>Mr.
Gerrard:
						</b> Absolutely. One of the points about requiring an
SIA licence is that there is a requirement to go through CRB checks,
which one would expect to pick up somebody who might be a
problem.</div>
					<a name="07011873000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
might tell me that I am misinterpreting the subsection. I was puzzled
by the use of the word &#147;manager&#148;, and what it might mean.
Obviously, one would expect that in approved premises, there would be a
number of staff, not a single person. The manager might be managing
quite a small number, so perhapsI have missed something in the
drafting of this subsection. That takes us back to our discussion this
morning about training and qualifications, and ensuring that people who
are working in the probation service or with offenders have the right
training and qualifications, and that they are not people who are going
in any way to put someone at risk, such as an ex-offender or a member
of the public. It is important that we know that people who are running
approved premises are of the right quality to do so. I should like to
ask the Minister a probing question: why does there appear to be that
exclusion for the private security industry? On the face of it, it
would seem eminently suitable that it should apply to people who are
going to run a private sector hostel of that
nature.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000297"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I agree with quite a lot of what the hon.
Gentleman has just said. Although he and I disagree over the
contracting out of supervisory services to the non-state sector, it is
my view that if we are going to do it, we must do it properly. If we
are going to allow non-state officers to carry out supervisory
functions, they must be properly qualified and regulated, and must
bring with them the necessary public confidence. The hon. Gentleman has
hit upon a most important aspect of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07011873000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned that the
expression &#147;a person&#148;&#151;somebody who is acting as a
manager&#151;needs to be specified as a human being. As a matter of
law, the expression &#147;a person&#148; can mean a non-human
being; a company is a legal personality. As the hon. Gentleman
indicated, if a manager is the manager of a numberof separate
premises, he cannot be in every one atthe same time, if he is
a human being. Equally, if
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 159</div>
						the manager is a company, which carries out its
management functions through a number of individuals, we need to be
sure that not only is the company behaving itself and has set up
protocols and systems that enable it to employ people in a particular
way, but that individual employees of the corporate manager should be
properly trained and accountable, either directly or via their company,
to the public whom they are seeking to protect. That is quite apart
from the other aspect of the matter, which as the hon. Gentleman
mentioned, is to make sure that the care of the individuals in that set
of premises is being properly looked after.</div>
					<a name="07011873000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a need for clarity
here. It is often thought that the Private Security Industry Act 2001
just dealt with nightclub bouncers, but it covers a far wider area of
guarding activity. The Minister needs to explain to us how, by
excluding managers of approved premises from the ambit of the 2001 Act,
he is enhancing and not diminishing public protection and proper
supervision of those within the approved
premises.</div>

briefly on the matter. I must admit that when I saw the amendment, I
was not entirely persuaded one way or another about it, but having
listened to the hon. Member for Walthamstow and the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough, I think that there is an important issue at
stake here, which is right to be voiced in the way that it has been so
far. The Secretary of State&#151;I beg your pardon, I mean the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000301"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow for having raised the matter and other hon. Members for
their contributions. I understand why, at first glance, there might
seem to be a diminution in protection and supervision. I hope to
reassure the Committee that that is not the case. The term
&#147;manager&#148; here includes all staff working in approved
premises who are able to do the job and have had adequate training. As
the Committee has requested, I shall go into the matter in more
detail.</div>
					<a name="07011873000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 9 is
based closely on the current legislation on approved premises, namely
section 9 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000. However
subsection (7) is new. It ensures that the requirements of the Private
Security Industry Act 2001 for the licensing of individuals supplied
under contract to provide manned guarding activities do not catch those
involved in the management of approved premises. The aim is to protect
the public by driving up standards in the private security industry and
removing the criminal element. That background might help the
Committee.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 160</div>
					<a name="07011873000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Private Security Industry
Act 2001 sets out the licensing requirements for the private security
industry established by the Security Industry Authority, and requires
the authority to regulate the industry through the licensing process.
The Act works by defining for its purposes what is security activity
and the conditions under which such activity becomes licensable. One
condition is that the relevant activity is supplied as a service under
contract. Under the terms of the Bill, services in approved premises
will in future be delivered under contract, so we need to consider
whether any of the activities carried out in such premises meet the
Act&#146;s definitions of security activity. If they do, the Act
could apply to those activities unless they are exempted. Security
activity is defined in Schedule 2 to the 2001 Act and covers activities
such as manned guarding and wheel clamping.</div>
					<a name="07011873000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Manned guarding is defined
as</div>
					<a name="07011873000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) guarding
premises against unauthorised access or occupation, against outbreaks
of disorder or against damage;</div>
					<a name="07011873000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) guarding property against destruction
or damage, against being stolen or against being otherwise dishonestly
taken or obtained;</div>
					<a name="07011873000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) guarding
one or more individuals against assault or against injuries that might
be suffered in consequence of the unlawful conduct of
others.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011873000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do
not think that the work of staff in approved premises fits that
description, but we are concerned that somebody might argue that it
does and that it should, therefore, be subject to the licensing regime.
That would be inappropriate. The work of staff in approved premises
does not constitute private security work in the sense intended by the
2001 Act, nor will it in future. The fact that the services will be
delivered under contract will not change that. We think it prudent to
put the matter beyond doubt to prevent unintended consequences or
uncertainly later.</div>
					<a name="07011873000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been suggested that by not subjecting services in approved premises
to licensing, we put at risk standards in security and risk the
involvement of undesirable elements in sensitive and dangerous work.
Nothing can be further from the truth. Anybody bidding to run approved
premises will have to meet stringent tests and demonstrate an ability
to run premises to a high standard. Managers and staff of approved
premises will receive training appropriate to their work. That will
often replicate the relevant part of the wider training of probation
staff. The purpose of the training is not to enable them to carry out
guarding activities, as defined by the 2001 Act, but to equip them
better to carry out their duties in connection with assessing,
supervising and managing offenders and the risks that they pose in the
context of approved premises.</div>
					<a name="07011873000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not a blanket exemption
for approved premises. If security operatives were provided on contract
to such premises, for example to guard them, they would need to hold
licenses issued by the Security Industry Authority in the normal way.
However, for normal probation work in approved premises, the
2001 Act is entirely inappropriate and would do what my hon. Friend the
Member for Walthamstow does not want us to do, namely to dumb down the
service. I hope that with that
explanation&#151;</div>

								Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Although what the Minister says makes good sense
in theory, many of our concerns might be mitigated if the Government
were to come forward with a model contract, so that we could see what a
company bidding to manage approved premises would have to comply with,
albeit bids would differ in detail. The model contract might provide
for the way in which a company, a charity or another third sector body
carries out its functions and ensures that those who work for it
behave. Equally, the Bill provides huge opportunities for regulation to
be made. If we had even a glimpse of the ankle of the things that we
are promised, many of the fears that are justifiably held at the moment
would go away. Is there any possibility that such help is
forthcoming?</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000303"></a>
								Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I understand the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s concern, but in response to the amendment I have
explained adequately why we are not considering that in the context of
the manned guarding and wheel clamping provisions of the 2001
Act.</div>
					<a name="07011873000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that, to
work on approved premises, managers and staff will have to meet
stringent tests in the qualifications that they will have to have. I am
not against considering further provisions, but I do not want to do
that at this stage. I said this morning that we will consult on how to
take things further on the make-up of trusts, and we will also consider
the types of provision that will come out of the innovations that we
seek. However, all that will occur against the existing inspectorate
provisions and measured tests, so I see no possibility of the quality
of the service diminishing to the extent that people are put at
risk.</div>
					<a name="07011873000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have reassured my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow about the use
of the 2001 Act, and I shall go away and consider what can
bedone on the points raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman.
Public confidence in approved premises is paramount, and approved
premises have to be the way that we manage serious and dangerous
offenders. Given that I want there to be the greatest possible public
confidence in what we do, I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman is
satisfied with my assurance that I will consider how we can tighten the
rules on the use of approved premises as much as possible.</div>
					<a name="07011873000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no need for the
amendment, and I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000304"></a>Mr.
Gerrard:
						</b> I understand the points that my hon. Friend the
Minister makes. Obviously, when the 2001 Act was debated and
enacted, it was not envisaged that it would apply to bail
hostels&#151;to what we are now describing as approved premises. At
that point, nobody considered whether it should, because the matter was
not being debated in the context of more private sector involvement in
probation services and in dealing with offenders.</div>
					<a name="07011873000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is arguable that the part of
the definition in the 2001 Act that covers guarding more and more
individuals against assault or the injuries that might be suffered as a
consequence of the unlawful conduct of others could apply to such
hostels, although, clearly, other parts of the definition would be
highly unlikely to apply. The key is to ensure that people who work in
premises of that nature have the right qualifications 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 162</div>
						and the right background, and that such places do
not end up, for instance, with employees who have previous criminal
convictions.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000305"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I want to pursue the point. If the amendment
were accepted and the tests were not stringent, one might end up with
someone who was not properly qualified. If we suppose that what my hon.
Friend fears happens and the private sector runs all the approved
premises estate, somebody approved on the basis of the 2001 Act might
still not have the required skills to be able to deal with approved
premises. The provider could claim that that person was okay because
they had got through on the 2001 Act. I think that the amendment
devalues the role of the person who works in approved premises, because
it says that somebody with a lesser qualification could have that
role.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000306"></a>Mr.
Gerrard:
						</b> I understand the argument. Somehow, having the
licence under the 2001 Act might be seen as sufficient qualification
for someone employed in approved premises. I would not want to get into
such a situation. Someone with just that certification might not have
the other skills and qualifications that one would expect and want from
someone working in approved premises. The key is what the tests are
going to be. If we are not going to have someone with an SIA licence,
then the requirements for qualifications and checks ought at least to
include all similar checks, such as identity and CRB
checks.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000307"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman have any views on the
suggestion that I made to the Minister? Seeing a draft model contract
would be helpful, so that he could be assured that, if not licensed,
private providers would have strict contractual requirements, which
might be reinforced in a disciplinary way by regulations under
secondary legislation. The Minister is trying to reassure us, but
cannot do so wholly, because he does not yet know what will be the
contractual terms, which have not been written. That is not his fault.
The hon. Member for Walthamstow might be somewhat reassured to see the
sort of thing that would bind a non-state party to the Home
Secretary.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000308"></a>Mr.
Gerrard:
						</b> There is some merit in that. I am not sure that
we can expect a draft contract at this stage, but perhaps the Minister
can indicate that he will look at the issue. Before we finish with the
Bill, it would be helpful to have a clearer indication of the sorts of
checks on, and the minimum required from, someone working in or running
approved premises. Judging by the Minister&#146;s reaction, we might
be able to get to the bottom of that over the next few weeks, before
the Bill finishes its passage through the House. For now, on that
basis, I am quite happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the

clause 10, page 6, line 40, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(h)
representatives of local authorities&#146;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 163</div>
					<a name="07011873000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment seeks to ensure
that local authorities are included in the important exercise of data
sharing. I would like to explain why I think the amendment is needed
and would improve the Bill. All hon. Members would agree that sharing
data among relevant organisations is an excellent idea, not least as an
essential step towards joined-up service delivery at the local level. I
know that joined-up thinking and service delivery is an issue close to
the Government&#146;s heart. I also hope that it is not contentious
to say that local government plays a vital role in the rehabilitation
of offenders, but to perform that vital role effectively it needs to be
fully involved in the system.</div>
					<a name="07011873000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005, the Local Government
Association surveyed local authorities and discovered that
only3 per cent. of them were informed when prisoners were
released into the community, which is a very worrying statistic. Such
information on prisoner release is vital if local authorities are to
perform the effective role in offender management that I am sure we all
want to see. </div>
					<a name="07011873000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
local authorities provide excellent services that help offenders with
housing, advice on benefits, treatment for drug and alcohol addiction,
employment advice and training opportunities, and all those services
can help to reduce reoffending. The 2005 report by the LGA,
&#147;Going straight&#148;, found, not surprisingly, that being in
employment reduced the risk of reoffending by between one third and 50
per cent. Having stable accommodation also reduces the risk of
reoffending by a fifth. Once ex-prisoners are in stable accommodation,
over three times as many find employment as those without an address.
However, the report also found that only a third of offenders have
stable accommodation on release, and they canface significant
difficulties&#151;as we would all acknowledge&#151;in securing it.
That figure needs to rise and, without the integration of local
authorities into the probation system, that will not happen. I ask the
Minister to respond to the point about the value that local authorities
offer in the current probation system, and how that value will be
preserved.</div>
					<a name="07011873000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Education
and training are equally important, but half of all prisoners do not
have the skills required by 96 per cent. of all jobs. Although the
Learning and Skills Council now funds all post-16 education, except for
university education, local authorities still contribute considerable
amounts to adult education, and most of them deliver a wide spectrum of
adult education services under contract to local learning and skills
councils.</div>
					<a name="07011873000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
establish what education service provision is needed in each local
authority area, information about offenders is necessary. Again, the
importance of involving local authorities in the sharing of that
information is paramount, if rehabilitation is to happen effectively
and reoffending rates are to fall.</div>
					<a name="07011873000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The situation regarding
education is mirrored by that regarding employment. Two thirds of
people enter prison without jobs, and two in three of those with a job
lose it&#151;again, not surprisingly&#151;when they enter prison.
Local authorities need to establish what employment advice they can
offer to offenders, for whom such help is most needed. Without being
integrated into the probation system, local authorities will struggle
to provide that advice to the level thatwe would all desire.
Unless the vital sharing of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 164</div>information that is outlined in clause 10 is extended to local
authorities, their services cannot be targeted and effectively planned
to include the numbers and needs of offenders.</div>
					<a name="07011873000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local authorities also play an
important role in local strategic partnerships, often acting as the
central point for other organisations to become involved. Although
voluntary groups, where they act as probation providers, and the
police, who are often included in these strategic partnerships, are
included in the list in clause 10, local authorities are not. There
seems to be no reason for their exclusion and I would like the Minister
to address that issue, and reassure us that it is not the intention for
local councils to be
excluded.</div>
				
					<a name="07011873000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">If local authority
representatives will not included on the list of those organisations
that can share information on offenders, as outlined in clause 10, how
can the system ensure that information about offenders is passed on to
local authorities to ensure that the services that local authorities
provide are properly planned to create the provision needed in each
local
area?</div>

							<a name="07011873000310"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> Once again, I find that I have a lot of
sympathy with the hon. Gentleman. As he has said, the amendment would
add representatives of local authorities to the list of persons among
whom information can be shared for the purposes specified in the Bill.
Local authority representatives typically need information about
offenders for whom they are providing housing or to carry out social
service department responsibilities&#151;as he has said, there are
also other reasons. However, that need differs substantially in terms
of the quantity and nature of the data required from the needs of those
listed in subsection (2), whose core business is the day-to-day
management of
offenders.</div>
					<a name="07011873000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention behind clause 10 is to put beyond doubt for the main parties
involved in managing offenders with whom and for what purposes data can
be shared. The amendment raises the question whether adding
representatives of local authorities to the list would be valuable, or
whether it would confuse and distort that intention. The clause
includes provision to meet any future need by including additional
parties such as local authority officers. Subsection (2)(g) allows the
Secretary of State to lay regulations before the House specifying
additional persons to be included in the list. It would not be sensible
to include other organisations at this stage on the basis that they
might need to be included in future.</div>
					<a name="07011873000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise the unique
position of local authorities and their responsibilities in offender
management. In particular, they have the established and important role
under the multi-agency public protection arrangements of the proper
consideration of housing and the safeguarding of vulnerable groups.
That role might make it sensible to include local authorities in the
Bill. However, we are concerned that a reference to
&#147;representatives of local authorities&#148; would be too vague
and that the ambiguity would have unintended and unhelpful
consequences. I nevertheless believe that the amendment and the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s points merit further consideration. I undertake to
reconsider the

							<a name="07011873000312"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 19, in
clause 10, page 6, line 41, after
&#145;information&#146;, insert</div>
					<a name="07011873000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;of a nature that the Secretary of
State shall by regulation
define&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07011873000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
means of this amendment, I intend to extract from the Government more
clarity on the sort of information that they intend to be shared by the
persons listed in subsection (2). Subsection (3)(b) states that
disclosure of information to those listed can take place only if it
is</div>
					<a name="07011873000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;necessary or
expedient for any of the purposes mentioned in subsection
(4).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011873000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are familiar
with those purposes, except that subsection (4)(c) adds information
for</div>
					<a name="07011873000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other purposes
connected with the management of offenders (including the development
or assessment of policies relating to matters connected with the
management of
offenders).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011873000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
delightfully vague and suggests that greater explanation than can be
gained by reading the Bill is appropriate. Until we see the model
contract, which I mentioned in the previous discussion but one, and the
various as yet undrafted regulations behind the Bill, with which the
Home Secretary is going to come forward, the public and those who take
an interest in this aspect of public policy are in something of a
difficult area.</div>
					<a name="07011873000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the provision of information is, on the Minister&#146;s say-so, going
to be reasonably clear and to a purpose, what will happen with the
unlawful or unauthorised disclosure of information? Will that be a
matter of contractual discipline, administrative discipline or criminal
penalties? If, for example, a private operator or charitable body which
can hold information&#151;such a body would come under the
heading</div>
					<a name="07011873000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other
person specified or described in regulations made by the Secretary of
State&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011873000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">were
guilty of disclosing information, whether wittingly or not, to an
unauthorised person, what would happen? We are dealing with sensitive
information, which concerns not only the offenders themselves, but
possibly their
victims.</div>
					<a name="07011873000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
information about the victims of serious sexual offenders were to get
into the wrong hands&#151;I hope that the probation service rather
than a non-state operator will look after serious sexual offenders,
particularly post-custody&#151;it could have the most appalling
consequences for the victim and their family. We need to be reassured
that the Secretary of Statewill have the machinery to deter
and deal with
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 166</div>unauthorised disclosure. I do not think&#151;the National Association
of Probation Officers has made this point&#151;that the private
sector is incapable of respecting people&#146;s confidence, and I do
not think that the private sector is bound to release information
improperly to people outside the list in subsection (2). However, we
need to be reassured that in the event that something goes wrong, or is
likely to go wrong, the Government have thought through what needs to
be done.</div>
					<a name="07011873000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
strictly germane to the Bill, but over the past few days we have heard
remarks made by the Home Secretary about pulling together various
Government databases in the context of the future of the national
identity register. I will not have an argument now about whether it is
a good or bad thing to have a national identity register&#151;my
views are pretty clear&#151;but there seems to be some doubt about
how the register will be constructed. Will it involve one great
Government computer, or will it be lots of little computers with
bridges between them so that information about subject A can be moved
from computer B, and so on? I need to know whether the information that
we are talking about, which will presumably be accumulated for offender
management purposes, will go on to the national identity register,
where it will be accessible by all sorts of other people, and whether
penalties of one sort or another will be imposed if such information is
misused or improperly disclosed.</div>
					<a name="07011873000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">On subsection (3)(b), we also
need to know who will decide when and whether the disclosure of
information is &#147;necessary or expedient&#148;. Will it be the
Secretary of State, the non-state operator or a combination of their
various officers and employees, or will a decision emerge in some
haphazard way? Who will decide what &#147;any other purposes&#148;
are in relation to the disclosure of information connected with the
management of
offenders?</div>
					<a name="07011873000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that subsection (6) says that the existing restrictions on
the unlawful or improper disclosure of information are not affected by
the Bill. However, as we have seen in the case of amendment No. 34,
which was tabled by the hon. Member for Walthamstow, all sorts of
things happened which were not contemplated by the drafters of the
Private Security Industry Act 2001. Just as that Act did not
contemplate private managers of bail hostels, in constructing this
Bill, we must think forward to see whether there are areas of concern
that could slip through undiscussed or
unconsidered.</div>
					<a name="07011873000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
somewhat concerned to notice that under subsection (7)</div>
					<a name="07011873000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Secretary of State may by
order amend or repeal any provision mentioned in subsection (6)(b)
which is contained in an
enactment&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011873000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">An enactment
is a piece of secondary legislation. We are allowing an accumulation of
deeply sensitive information about individuals, be they offenders,
victims or, possibly, witnesses. Under the Bill, the information can be
disclosed to authorised recipients only, but we are providing within
that permission vague descriptions of what is necessary or expedient
and vague descriptions of &#147;any other purposes&#148;. We are
giving the Secretary of State the power to amend protective
legislation, albeit secondary legislation, without any of us at this
moment knowing what is envisaged. While I do not suggest that this
discussion 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 167</div>should lead to a vote, I am interested in achieving clarity in
legislation, particularly in a Bill of this
nature.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000313"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I do not accept the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s charge that the Government have been vague. The
situation is quite the reverse, and I shall try to reassure him,
although that is sometimes difficult. I do not dismiss what he has said
about looking at this in terms of what the future may hold. This is not
an attempt to create wide-ranging, dramatic new powers on sharing
offender information. We hope that the provision will put beyond doubt
how criminal justice organisations should share information with each
other about offenders in order to ensure their effective management and
to inform research into improving policies and outcomes for offender
management.</div>
					<a name="07011873000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of
the clause is to provide a clear structure in which effective
information sharing can take place on a flexible but principled basis,
subject to equally clear limitations on who can share the data and for
what purpose. The sort of data that we envisage will be disclosed under
this power can already legally be shared in accordance with the Data
Protection Act 1998 and other safeguards, such as article 8 of
the European convention on human rights. The clause does not disapply
or in any way modify those
safeguards.</div>
					<a name="07011873000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
precisely because of our desire to be absolutely transparent about what
data can be shared and to ensure that this information is shared as it
should be in practice that we think it desirable to create a power to
share data on the face of the Bill. By doing so, we hope to provide the
most effective service to the offender, to services to facilitate the
rehabilitation of offenders and to the public for their protection. We
hope to do so by sharing the data for both operational and research
purposes.</div>
					<a name="07011873000235"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">On an
operational level, clause 10 clarifies that different prison operators
can inform one another of the security information when a prisoner is
transferred from one company&#146;s jail to another. A provider of
probation services can pass on a risk assessment to a local authority
housing provider, where that is appropriate. The clause also enables
data to be matched for the purposes of research, thereby enabling the
Government to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions with
offenders to see whether they are successful and whether they represent
value for money for the
taxpayer.</div>
				
					<a name="07011873000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, clause 10 makes it clear that the constituent elements of NOMS
can exchange their data with other Departments, subject to the need to
comply with other statutory limitations that might apply to the
specific type of data that is proposed to be
exchanged.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000258"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
					<a name="07011873000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
the operational and research aims, the limitation in the clause on
exchanging data only for offender management purposes will operate in
practice as a limitation on the type of data that can be exchanged. If
data cannot be disclosed for an offender management purpose, they
cannot be disclosed under the clause. The amendment seeks to address
anxiety 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 168</div>about unnecessarily widespread and permissive data sharing, but that is
dealt with by the clause as drafted. Although I understand the concern
that underscores the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s amendment,
accepting it would undermine the purpose of clause 10, which is to
provide absolute clarity about the information that may be shared
within the close circle of organisations managing
offenders.</div>
					<a name="07011873000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
reasons I have given, amendment No. 19, which requires the Secretary of
State to define the nature of information to be shared in discrete
regulations, would add little, if anything, to the safeguard
established by clause 10(4), which sets out the purposes for which
information can be shared. The amendment would make the clause far less
useful than it is intended to be, and it would create unnecessary work
for Departments, the House of Commons and the other place, because it
would require potentially frequent additions to a
list.</div>
					<a name="07011873000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition
of the purpose for which information can be shared, and hence its
nature in subsection (4), is necessarily broad. It covers existing
information-sharing powers and puts beyond peradventure the ability of
criminal justice agencies to share information with each other when
appropriate and only when
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07011873000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
require the Secretary of State to include in secondary legislation
every piece of information thathe might wish to share would
mean anticipating, identifying and defining all types of information,
which is a near impossible task. It would render the clause
unnecessarily unwieldy and would create unintended new restrictions in
data sharing by failing to state every conceivable purpose and type of
information that organisations already share or that complies with
existing legal permissions. Furthermore, it would risk overlooking
unforeseen or unusual types of information that it might be necessary
to disclose in cases in which public protection might otherwise be
undermined if disclosures were not to take place. In such a case, if
the type of data in question were not included in secondary
legislation, it would not be possible to disclose it. Such
inflexibility is not acceptable and would undermine the purposes that
NOMS was established to achieve and with which the clause is intended
to assist. The hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s amendment is in
direct contrast to what we want to achieve and the purpose of the
clause and the Bill, which is to enable the more effective management
of offenders and the removal of doubt about what information can be
legally shared and with whom.</div>
					<a name="07011873000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may not have completely
satisfied the hon. and learned Gentleman, as he has asked who will be
responsible for making decisions. That responsibility rests with the
party that may want to exchange information. Obviously, if the
Secretary of State can be helpful in those circumstances, he will want
to assist, although he will not be directly involved. The remedies for
unlawful disclosure will be regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998
and the European convention on human rights, and it is not a criminal
offence.</div>
					<a name="07011873000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
safeguards are in place. We are trying to be transparent in respect of
this clause&#151;the information is there, and the provision is not
vague and sets out clearly what we want to achieve. I think that the
hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 169</div>and learned Gentleman has accepted that his amendment may not
necessarily be the route to take, although he may want to return to the
subject. I hope that he will ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">

that Ministers must have their responses written for them before

that I made were not taken on board by the anticipatory speech that was
drafted for him, which is a function of life in the Home Office. The

the other it is too prescriptive. That was clever of me.</div>
					<a name="07011873000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said in my opening
remarks, I will not press the amendment to a Division, but we should
not lightly pass over the way in which information is exchanged in such
delicate matters. If, between now and Report, the Minister and his
officials can come up with some ideas after meetings with the

							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): I do not want to detain the
Committee, but I would like some elucidation of the thinking behind
this change to the law, particularly as I have two prisons in my
constituency. From the explanatory notes, I understand the change to be
that in contracted-out institutions&#151;the prisons in my
constituency are not contracted-out&#151;prisoner custody officers
will be allowed to invite prison visitors to strip themselves of all
their clothes to see whether there is anything in the clothes or on the
body. They will not, however, be allowed to carry out an intimate
search, which is presumably a search of body
cavities.</div>
					<a name="07011873000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
grateful if the Minister were to explain the reasoning behind the
provision. Will he give us some idea of offences that have been
committed by visitors smuggling drugs and other items into prisons?
What evidence does he have of behaviour in private prisons differing
from that in Her Majesty&#146;s prisons? Is there a concern that a
lacuna exists, because he has not extended to contracted-out prisons
the right of intimate
searches?</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000316"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising those
concerns. Perhaps it will help the Committee if I give some general
background to clauses 11 to 15, which deal with related
matters.</div>
					<a name="07011873000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Criminal
Justice Act 1991 created the legislative framework that supports the
use of private providers of custodial services. It created the role of
prisoner 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 170</div>custody officer, equivalent to a prison officer, as well as the roles of
director, equivalent to a governor, and of controller&#151;a Crown
servant&#151;who was given statutory duties aimed at ensuring the
proper running ofthe establishment and the appropriate
treatment of prisoners. The 1991 Act defines the scope of the powers of
each group. Clauses 11 to 15 and clause 21 make specific amendments to
the 1991 Act, rather than seeking to introduce new legislation to
replace or supplement
it.</div>
					<a name="07011873000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first private
prison opened in 1992, and there are now 11 such prisons operating in
England and Wales holding about 10 per cent. of the prison population.
The companies that provide those services have developed a strong track
record of delivery and are driving forward the decency agenda, as well
as introducing innovation and increasing value for money in public
sector prisons. Martin Narey, the former director general of the Prison
Service, has said that if had not been for the private sector, the
decency agenda would not have moved at the pace that it has.</div>
					<a name="07011873000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to make a reality of
the recommendations in Lord Carter&#146;s report, &#147;Managing
Offenders, Reducing Crime&#148;, then we need to provide, so far as
it is practicable, a level playing field between public, private and
voluntary providers in the delivery of services to offenders. That aim
is best served by ensuring parity in the framework within which
services are provided, so as to remove barriers to the best provider
being selected.</div>
					<a name="07011873000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to Lord Carter&#146;s recommendations and the private
sector&#146;s strong record on delivery, we therefore propose to
resolve some of the historical inconsistencies in the development of
private custodial provision. We will create a level playing field for
contestability by putting directors on a similar footing to prison
governors in the public sector and expanding the powers of less senior
workers to align them with their public sector counterparts. This raft
of changes is therefore supportive of the general development of
NOMS.</div>
					<a name="07011873000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to the
substance of the clause, the 1991 Act placed limits on the power of
prisoner custody officers to search visitors which are more restrictive
than those that apply to prison officers in the public sector. Those
powers prohibit anything other than a rub-down search, and they do not
permit a visitor to be required to remove any piece of clothing other
than an outer jacket, jacket or gloves. Such a strict prohibition is
not imposed on the public sector. The smuggling of drugs and other
items of contraband is a problem in both sectors. The searching
restrictions on prisoner custody officers have unintentionally made
illegal activities on the part of visitors and prisoners potentially
easier in private prisons, which does not make sense and which may
cause a real risk to the maintenance of prison security in the
future.</div>
					<a name="07011873000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">With this in
mind, we seek through this clause to make it clear that the rub-down
search power of a prison custody officer is broadly equivalent to that
available to a public sector prison officer. The clause expands that
power by deleting from the 1991 Act the prohibition of the removal of
anything other than outer clothing. I recognise that it is important
that the power is exercised properly and with restraint, and that the
limits to the power are fully understood by those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 171</div>who use it. To reflect that desire, we have expressly included in the
clause a prohibition on the conduct of intimate searches, as defined
under section 164(5) of the Customs and Excise Management Act
1979, of visitors or prisoners by a PCO. It is our view that
such searches, if necessary, should be carried out only by a police
officer.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000317"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> Does that mean that prison officers and prison
custody officers will be on exactly the same footing, or will prison
officers still enjoy a wider right of search, such as the right to
conduct more intimate searches than prison custody
officers?</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000318"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> No; there are differences in relation to their
duties&#151;we will come on to that point in clauses relating to the
role of a constable&#151;but there will be parity in relation to
strip searches. It is important to set out the nature of those
responsibilities, which must be used in the right way in what we hope
will be very limited circumstances. However, we need to close that
gap.</div>
					<a name="07011873000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The searching
techniques employed will be exercised in line with procedures currently
used in public sector prisons and in accordance with relevant prison
rules and young offender rules. It will ensure that staff exercise
their powers appropriately by having them certificated as competent by
the controller. Furthermore, a controller will be able to observe staff
conducting such searches and report to the Secretary of State if
allegations are made that the power has been improperly exercised. They
will also be able to impose penalties under the contract. In addition,
the independent monitoring board in each establishment and the prison
and probation ombudsman will provide impartial avenues for
complaint.</div>
					<a name="07011873000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the restrictions imposed by the 1991 Act apply to young offender
institutions in the same way in which they apply to prisons, I should
point out that the expanded powers this clause provides would apply
equally in a privately operated young offender institution, although at
the moment there are no privately run YOIs. A similar amendment to the
Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 will create parity in secure
training centres by giving custody officers the same expanded power of
search. Once again, it is important to emphasize that the power relates
to searching visitors to those centres and not to searching the
residents
themselves.</div>
				
					<a name="07011873000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the changes proposed by the clause do not provide custody officers or
prisoner custody officers with constabulary powers. It is not necessary
to provide them with such powers in order to achieve the aims of the
clause. I hope that, with those assurances, the Committee will accept
the clause.</div>

						</b> I just want to develop some of the points that my
hon. Friend the Member for Reigate mentioned in the debate on clause
11. They relate to the powers of prisoner custody officers to detain
suspected offenders. I seek clarity about the geographical limits of
PCOs to detain. Under new section 86A(1) of the Criminal Justice Act
1991:</div>
					<a name="07011873000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
prisoner custody officer performing custodial duties at a contracted
out prison shall have the following
powers&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011873000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are those powers
limited to the geographical area of the contracted-out prison, or can
the PCO exercise powers of detention outside the limits of the prison
grounds? That might be relevant, because under new section 86A(3), a
person who makes off while subject to a requirement to wait can be
guilty of an offence.</div>
					<a name="07011873000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The expression &#147;makes
off&#148; might need further explanation. Does it mean get clean
away, or simply move away in a way that is contrary to the request of
the PCO? I can see that if the person gets clean away, that will
present a problem for the relevant officer, because he will not have
the power to chase after him or call for assistance. Perhaps something
needs to be done about that.</div>
					<a name="07011873000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also invite the Minister to
explain how new section 9A(2) of the Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994 bites. It
says:</div>
					<a name="07011873000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the officer has reason to believe that the person is committing or has
committed an offence...the officer
may&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011873000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						(a)
require the person to wait with him for the arrival of a constable for
such period as may be necessary (not exceeding two hours);
and</div>
					<a name="07011873000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						(b) use
reasonable force to prevent the person from making off while subject to
a requirement under paragraph (a).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011873000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that mean that the custody officer
has under that legislation the power to lock people up? Does the person
wait only in a waiting place, say a public room in which he is told,
&#147;Please don&#146;t move&#148;, or does the expression
&#147;reasonable force&#148; imply that having ordered a person to
do as he is told, the officer can physically put him in a room and lock
him up until a constable arrives? Those matters will no doubt be made
clear during the training of PCOs, and it might be that they are powers
that public service prison officers have and private service prison
officers do not. It is important that legislators, at least, should
know what the Government intend so that we can better understand the
context in which the clause operates.</div>
					<a name="07011873000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me say one more thing
before the Minister replies. One of the useful things that we gained
from the informal evidence session last week was that Mr.
Martin Narey, who had been in the Prison Service for 25 years before he
moved to NOMS and then to Barnardo&#146;s, candidly told us that he
had spent a long time in the Prison Service thinking that the use of
the private sector in the prisons world was wrong. He even used the
expression &#147;immoral&#148;. However, by the time that he had
finished, he was utterly convinced that the private sector was a useful
addendum to the prison system. It is interesting how the Government
have followed his lead and, although the Labour party used to be
vehemently opposed to private sector involvement in prisons, it now
seems to be a champion of it. Is it not interesting how these things
change?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000320"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> On that final point, what the Government are
concerned about is what works. I have a great deal of respect for
Martin Narey&#146;s work in the posts that he has held and in his
current post at Barnardo&#146;s, where he is doing some excellent
work on the provision of support for children and is involved in giving
expert advice on the sex offender review that is taking place. We
should listen to him. He has said interesting things about the respect
and decency agenda in prisons, and the cultural changes that have taken
place there. It takes somebody who is very keen and involved with the
issues to be able to change his mind in the way that Martin did. That
means that we should all show a great deal of respect to the detail of
what he has said.</div>
					<a name="07011873000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
explained to the Committee what clauses 11 to 15 set out, and we have
just had an hour&#146;s discussion on clause 11, PCOs, the criminal
offences that may be committed and the ability to carry out the
searches that are required. Clause 11 sets out how we want to extend
the effective search powers to PCOs, which is likely to increase the
detection of potential criminality via visits. Accordingly, it is
sensible that PCOs&#146; increased ability to detect potential
criminal acts is matched by provision of a specific power to detain an
offender at the point of detection until a police officer can arrive at
the prison in question and take over. The hon. and learned Gentleman
asked if that power would be extended to public places. No, it will be
confined to the grounds of the prison or secure training
centre.</div>
					<a name="07011873000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
difficulties do not exist in public sector prisons, because we know
that prison officers working there are Crown servants who have been
given constabulary powers by the Prison Act 1952. We do not consider it
necessary or desirable to give such powers to a non-Crown servant to
achieve the aim of the clause. However, we feel that this is an
appropriate time to resolve the difference in the power to detain. In
recognition of the concerns expressed over the granting of such
detention powers to employees of private companies, we have been
careful to ensure that the power does not provide more than is
necessary to achieve our desired aims. The clause does not create an
unfettered power to detain, and includes a number of important
safeguards that should ensure that it is used only when absolutely
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07011873000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
power to detain can only ever be used by a PCO in relation to a visitor
to a prison. Secondly, the detention power will be available only to a
PCO working at a contracted-out prison. Thirdly, we propose that the
PCO will have the power to require a visitor to wait with him or her
only when that officer has reason to believe that an offence against
section 39, 40 or 42 of the 1952 Act has been committed, or that the
person has attempted, incited or aided and abetted such an
offence.</div>
					<a name="07011873000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, we
propose limiting the period of detention permitted under the clause to
what is necessary to allow a police officer to attend the prison and
take over the arrest of the suspected offender. To remove any ambiguity
that that test might create, we have provided that the period of
detention should not exceed, as the hon. and learned Gentleman has
said, two hours in any event. The two-hour period was chosen to allow
reasonable time for the police to get to a remotely located prison at
peak times. Consequently, detention 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 174</div>under the two-hour power would be, we hope, very much the exception
rather than the rule.</div>
					<a name="07011873000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our view, the time
limitation and the requirement that there be reasonable suspicion that
an offence has been committed ensure that any detention under the
clause either does not engage or is entirely compatible with article 5
of the European convention on human rights. To ensure that the power to
detain is fully effective in those circumstances where it is needed,
the clause also makes it an offence to attempt to make off from such a
period of detention and allows for reasonable force to be exercised in
support of the
detention.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000321"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> Can the Minister give us any statistics about the
number of times that such powers are required and about the concomitant
burden that falls on the police force that happens to be local to the
prison? Obviously the deployable resources of the police are frequently
stretched, although perhaps not always in visiting hours. I would be
grateful for some indication from the Minister how often the powers are
required.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000322"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> As I said, I do not believe that the powers
will be used on a vast number of occasions. I do not have an exact
figure to hand. However, the police would clearly be interested in
acting if reasonable concerns had been raised by the prison custody
officer. I am not trying to deflect the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question. I am as concerned as he about the use of police resources,
but we are trying to set out a sensible opportunity for the police to
be called if there is a reason to suspect that an offence is being
committed. We think that the two-hour period is enough to ensure that
there is no impact on police resources and is appropriate in areas
where great distances need to be travelled. If we have any figures, I
will make sure that the hon. Gentleman receives them. We are talking
about prison visitors here, so any occurrence would be very
rare.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000323"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The point is about police resources and dealing
with prisoners. I understand that, on 12 January, there were
300 prisoners in custody in police station cells. I wondered whether,
when the Minister writes to my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate, he
would include an up-to-date figure on the precise number of people who
would normally be in prison but are currently in police cells. I think
that we need clarity on
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000324"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman is tempting me
down a route that I do not wish to take and which is outside the scope
of the Bill. The issue is of public interest, and the Home Secretary
and I intend to keep the House adequately informed, especially on the
progress that we have made. I think the hon. and learned Gentleman
refers to Operation Safeguard, but to give any great detail at this
point would be
wrong.</div>
					<a name="07011873000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were talking
about where we are heading with the detention powers in the clause.
Creating new detention powers raises key civil liberties and human
rights issues, which we have taken into account seriously during
drafting. I hope that we have put the right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 175</div>safeguards in place. We think that bringing the private sector into
parity with the public sector on these matters is important. I hope
that, with the explanations that I have given, clause 12 can stand part
of the

clause 13, page 10, line 13, at
end add&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) A worker at a
contracted-out prison shall be subject to qualification requirements
that the Secretary of State shall by regulation
define.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07011873000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
13 deals with the powers of authorised persons to perform custodial
duties and search prisoners. As with earlier amendments, the amendment
in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion is
probing. It addresses the issue of the qualification requirements that
the Secretary of State might choose to impose on workers, at
contracted-out prisons in particular. I seek to establish precisely
what training, qualifications and vetting process will be required of
the staff of a contracted-out prison before they are given the special
status established in the clause and allowed to perform duties
previously reserved for prisoner custody officers.</div>
					<a name="07011873000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">That information is needed for
a number of reasons. First, as with probation, the quality and
effectiveness of the Prison Service depends on the individuals working
in it. They need to know how to deal effectively with prisoners, how to
supervise them with care for the safety of the public and how to help
with the rehabilitation
process.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07011873000260"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07011873000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,
somebody wishing to become a prison officer has to undergo a vetting
process, a selection test and specific training. There is continual
assessment and support from experienced staff. The clause opens up the
profession to allow other staff members who have not undergone the
necessary training and vetting procedures to work on tasks for which
that training is considered vital. For example, supervising prisoners
and therefore protecting the public requires a thorough understanding
of security checks and searching procedures. Dealing with prisoners who
are a danger to themselves or are in danger from other prisoners
requires a level of inter-personal skills for which prison officers are
tested in the recruitment process but which other staff members do not
necessarily have.</div>
					<a name="07011873000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are anxious to gain an assurance from the Minister that those involved
in restricted activities such as searching prisoners and visitors and
other custodial tasks will have the necessary training and skills. It
is essential that training is mandatory and that the supervision of
those receiving on-the-job training is vigorous and carried out by
experienced
PCOs.</div>
					<a name="07011873000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, it
is essential that those working in private, contracted-out prisons can
exercise powers to search and detain only within a clear framework of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 176</div>accountability, as exists in the statutory sector, because of the new
powers allowing auxiliary workers to undertake previously restricted
tasks such as the searching of children. Will the Minister address that
issue?</div>
					<a name="07011873000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
nobody will mistake this for a trivial issue. The Howard League for
Penal Reform, which has expressed its concerns about the change, found
that in one secure training centre alone more than 1,500 searches were
carried out, some of which included the instruction to remove all
clothing. We must ensure that those carrying out such searches, who
will not necessarily be trained and qualified PCOs, are fit to do so.
The Children&#146;s Society and Barnardo&#146;s expressed similar
concerns in a joint document,
writing:</div>
					<a name="07011873000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are anxious to receive assurances that any powers given to authorised
persons to perform custodial duties and search prisoners will, where
relevant, be accompanied by robust training requirements, child safety
protection and welfare
safeguards.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011873000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share that
anxiety and would like an assurance from the Minister that the staff
who will perform previously restricted duties will be adequately vetted
and trained under the current Department for Education and Skills
guidelines for working with children, &#147;Common Core of Skills and
Knowledge for the Children&#146;s Workforce&#148;. Will the
Minister assure as that those safeguards of child safety will be in
place and that auxiliary staff who gain special status will be
CRB-checked, checked against the new vetting and barring system put in
place under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 and trained
according to the most recent DFES guidelines for working with
children?</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000326"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for the spirit in
which he spoke to the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07011873000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference between public sector and contracted-out prisons is
unnecessary and inefficient. There are different operating practices
between the two sectors, which is sometimes detrimental to the
operations and security of prisons. The Criminal Justice Act 1991
specifies that a custodial duty should be performed by a PCO. However,
the 1991 Act does not explicitly define the scope of a custodial duty,
which creates unhelpful potential for confusion about what staff other
than the PCOs can do in a private prison.</div>
					<a name="07011873000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of this clause,
alongside other amendments to the 1991 Act made by the Bill, is to
clear up that confusion by providing a mechanism by which those tasks
can be carried out by non-PCO staff who will be listed in a statutory
instrument. Consequently clause 13 formally recognises that a non-PCO
may, subject to the authorisation of the director, do tasks requiring
the performance of some form of custodial duty. In order for a non-PCO
to do such a task, it must be listed in a statutory instrument and the
work must have been separately authorised by the director of the prison
in which he or she
works.</div>
					<a name="07011873000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The public
sector employees operational support grades will work alongside prison
officers. Those OSGs will perform a limited range of custodial duties
in support of the prison officers. The equivalent to a OSG in a private
prison is an auxiliary officer. However, due to the restrictions of the
1991 Act, the only people who can perform custodial duties in a private
prison are PCO grades. The absence of a clear definition of a custodial
duty in the 1991 Act has created unhelpful 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 177</div>
						confusion over what operational duties non-PCO staff
can undertake. The position becomes potentially even more unclear as
the public sector, free of any such requirements, makes greater use of
OSGs to support prison officers in the course of their custodial
work.</div>
					<a name="07011873000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The result is
potential disparity between the two sectors in who is able to perform
ostensibly similar tasks. As an OSG is paid less than a prison officer
it gives the public sector a financial and competitive advantage over
private contractors. It also provides a clear operational disadvantage
by creating greater operational flexibility which it would be desirable
to extend to private prisons. We are not seeking to provide non-PCO
staff with any power beyond those held by their OSG-equivalent
colleagues in the public sector. We are merely seeking to establish
that it is sensible to allow both to have equal powers so as to ensure
effective security and operational delivery.</div>
					<a name="07011873000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">To bring them in line with the
equivalent public sector staff, staff in private prisons need to be
able to do certain tasks that may involve the performance of a
custodial duty. If we do not give them those powers, inefficiencies in
operational management will continue, and transfer from one sector to
another will be made more difficult. We are formally recognising the
professional work already undertaken over many years by staff other
than PCOs to support the effective running of a private prison. In
exactly the same way as the OSGs have become a crucial part of the
operating environment in public sector prisons, in support of prison
officers, so auxiliary officers need to carry out a similar range of
functions in private prisons.</div>
					<a name="07011873000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to remember
that nothing in this clause will extend the boundaries of flexible
staff deployment in private prisons any further than is already
operating very successfully in the public sector. Indeed, it is only by
virtue of the different employment status of staff in public sector
prisons, rather than any tension in legislation, that this clause is
needed at all. The public sector Prison Service has been able to create
grades of staff other than prison officers to suit the changing
operational environment that it faces, according to need and without
any legislative restrictions on the range of custodial duties that
those new grades will then perform.</div>
					<a name="07011873000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are serious about giving
effect to the principle of contestability across the prison estate, it
is vital that this flexibility be given to the private sector too,
subject to those safeguards which it is sensible to put
inplace to ensure effective scrutiny of the resulting
arrangements. Restrictions on who can perform custodial duties in
private prisons mean that while the public sector can regrade duties of
a supportive nature, such as gatekeeping and CCTV monitoring of prison
officers, to allow other grades of staff to perform them on the grounds
of operational expediency and cost-effectiveness, the private sector is
required to persist with rigidly imposed and unjustified requirements
to use PCO staff. Such restrictions are then passed on to the taxpayer
when savings could otherwise have been made with no more risks to order
and control than have applied in the public
sector.</div>
					<a name="07011873000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
39 seeks to require the Secretary of State to set unnecessary
qualification requirements for non-PCO staff before they could be
authorised to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 178</div>perform a custodial duty. The aim of the clause is to reduce unduly
restrictive limitation on those working in the private sector while
ensuring that appropriate safeguards are maintained. Accepting the
amendment would not only perpetuate unwanted differences in operational
practice between the public and private sectors but introduce an extra
difference: in the same way as PCOs can only formally carry out
custodial duties, in future only those who met the requirements set out
in a statutory instrument would be able to carry out duties listed
under the power given by the clause. If we were to accept the amendment
it would undermine the purpose of the clause. On the face of it, a
requirement on the Secretary of State to make non-PCO grades subject to
qualification requirements might appear to offer an assurance, but that
would not be the case.</div>

						</b> I thank the Minister for his detailed response to
the amendment. I reassure him that I do not seek in any way to
undermine what the clause is about. However, I have listened carefully
to what he has said and I am still not clear whether he is giving me
the reassurance that I seek&#151;this is the bottom line&#151;that
the safeguards for child safety will be in place. Forgive me if he was

						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The hon.
and learned Member for Harborough chided me earlier about the notes
that are prepared for Ministers, and their ability to put on the record
all that is needed and to ensure that nothing is missed. It is
important that we ensure that everything that should be on the record
is on the record for when people look back on the debates. However,
even though I feel that I am reiterating many of the points, I reassure
the hon. Member for Cheadle that this is about equalising the
relationship between private and public sector providers. We are not
giving any new powers to the private or public sector, but providing
the flexibility requirements that we need to deal with offenders
better. </div>
					<a name="07011873000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asks for assurances. Clearly, we want to ensure that all the
current protection measures will be in place and that the appropriate
checks will be made on the staff who go through the private sector.
Clearly, they will go through a thorough selection process with the
contractors prior to employment and all the employment checks that he
asked to be carried out will be, including the CRB checks. It is
important that the contractor can prove that the training will be
provided to ensure that the person who will carry out the services is
adequately trained and supported.</div>
					<a name="07011873000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The position is clear. In the
training centres in particular, we need to ensure that the public
sector provisions are in place. That includes those covering how
officers are trained, and their abilities and powers to carry out their
duties competently and appropriately and to ensure that the safeguards
and checks are met. I hope that those assurances give the hon.
Gentleman the opportunity to support the clause.</div>
					<a name="07011873000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to refer back to the CRB
checks. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough talked about what
might be on the national identity register, referring to the
announcements made by the Home Secretary the other day. A great deal of
information is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 179</div>
						kept not only in the criminal justice system but
across the Departments and elsewhere. The Secretary of State has
written to Cabinet colleagues to see whether it is time for them to
agree that we ought to consider such information, whether it is held by
the DFES, the Department of Health or whoever, to ensure that nothing
is missed. One of our great concerns about child protection and child
safety is that nothing should be missed. We have seen far too many
examples when information that could have been shared has not gone to
the appropriate person. It is in that context that my right hon. Friend
the Home Secretary made his announcement the other
day.</div>

training in working with children and young people, and that they are
subject to the relevant requirements of the Safeguarding Vulnerable
Groups Act 2006.</div>
					<a name="07011873000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
doubt the Minister will seek to reassure me about this, but clause 13
gives auxiliary staff working in privately contracted-out prisons,
including privately run young offender institutions and secure training
centres, the power to carry out tasks equivalent to those now exercised
by operational support grades in public prisons. That includes
performing custodial duties and searching prisoners, although the use
of force is not permitted in carrying out those
activities.</div>
					<a name="07011873000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
no explicit child safety protection and welfare safeguards within the
measures, and there is no mention of training that staff might receive
prior to working with children or of any vetting process that they
might undergo before they are allowed to do so. My concern is that that
might demonstrate a lack of foresight and care on the part of
Government in relation to the protection of the most vulnerable in our
society.</div>
					<a name="07011873000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point is that the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 prevents
people on the barred list&#151;including list 99 for teachers, the
Protection of Children Act 1999 list for those working in
childcare settings and a new list of people barred from
working with vulnerable adults&#151;from working in establishments in
which they would come into close 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 180</div>
						contact with children. Once again, we are seeking
reassurances that there will be an appropriate belt-and-braces approach
to the important consideration of safeguarding children and vulnerable
groups. In the spirit in which I moved the last amendment, I look
forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response on this
matter.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000331"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has lighted upon a subject
that needs greater airing. While I accept that he will not press the
amendment to a vote, there is a lacuna in the way in which we deal with
the mentally ill in prison. If they come under the definition of
vulnerable groups, this affords me a brief opportunity to say something
about that.</div>
					<a name="07011873000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister knows, or ought to know, there are far too many people in
prison who ought to be under the care of the part of the national
health service that deals with mental illnesses. I shall not go into
historical analysis, because that is not strictly germane to the Bill,
but it is important that we should understand that in our adult prison
estate, there are people with mental
illnesses&#151;</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000332"></a>The

							<a name="07011873000335"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I was hoping by that sleight of hand elegantly to
reverse in such a way that I could put my bottom back on my chair.
However, I shall have to do it rather more rudely. I fully accept what
you have said, Mr. Atkinson. I have highlighted the issue of
mentally ill prisoners, as there may be nowhere else in the Bill where
I can legitimately discuss it within the rules of the Committee. I
shall use any other opportunity that I can to highlight the
difficulties suffered by the Prison Service in looking after mentally
ill prisoners, be they youngsters or people over the age of 18. It is a
crying scandal, and we need to do something about
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000336"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. The hon. and learned Gentleman might
direct his attention to the new clauses, which will give him the
opportunity that he
seeks.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000337"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I will direct my attention to the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Cheadle. Many of the points that he
raised in the discussion on the previous amendment apply to this
proposal, too. I assure him that I want to be helpful, but amendment
No. 30 is both legislatively and operationally flawed. However, as it
is a probing amendment, I hope he will not take that criticism too much
to heart.</div>
					<a name="07011873000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the clause is to deal with issues related to the activities of
non-certificated staff in private prisons. The amendment would apply
the regulatory framework established by the 2006 Act to everyone who
works in a private prison. The 2006 Act was debated in Parliament last
year and received Royal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 181</div>
						Assent on 8 November. Consequently, all issues
relating to the safeguarding of vulnerable groups have been considered
very recently, and it was not felt necessary to include private prisons
in that measure. That is the correct approach and nothing has happened
in the interim to change
it</div>
					<a name="07011873000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
extends significantly beyond the scope of clause 13. It would cover all
staff of all grades in private prisons, whereas the clause is intended
to apply only to non-PCO grades&#151;PCOs are those officers who have
direct day-to-day contact with prisoners. Under section 85 of the
Criminal Justice Act 1991, PCO grades must be authorised to
perform their duties by the PCO certification unit. As part of that
process, PCO staff are already subject to rigorous pre-employment
checks, which include a requirement to disclose all previous
convictions.</div>
					<a name="07011873000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
non-PCO staff do not have the same contact with prisoners and are not
subject to the same certification requirements as PCOs, they are
cleared by the same unit as part of their pre-employment checks. Any
person who wants to work at a private prison receives a basic enhanced
police check. In addition, anyone who will be working in a juvenile
prison or who will come into contact with children or vulnerable adults
also undergoes that CRB check. The pre-employment checks are consistent
with those undertaken on equivalent grades in the public sector, where
the amendment would not apply. An additional bureaucratic check is not
necessary or justified, as existing safeguards on staff suitability are
adequate.</div>
					<a name="07011873000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
already limits the range of custodial duties that a non-PCO grade can
perform and submits those tests to parliamentary scrutiny. The
Secretary of State will have to specify in an order subject to the
negative procedure the activities that a worker may be authorised to
carry out. The list in the clause specifically excludes the use of
force.</div>
					<a name="07011873000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">A non-PCO has
to be separately authorised at establishment level to carry out any
task that is listed in an order. Such an authorisation can be given
only by a director, where appropriate, and can be made subject to
limitations or conditions. In determining whether an individual should
be authorised or whether an authorisation should be limited or made
subject to conditions, a director will need to satisfy himself that an
individual has an appropriate level of experience and expertise in
order to carry out the listed tasks in question, which is an inherent
requirement of any such power. When a director makes a decision on the
appropriateness of an individual for a particular task, he will have in
mind the contractual penalties, including financial penalties, and the
damage to reputation that operational failures in private prisons
incur.</div>
					<a name="07011873000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I trust that
what I have said gives the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he
requires. His amendment is unnecessary, and I hope that he will
withdraw
it.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): I waited to see whether the
Opposition spokesman would stand up, in which case I would not have
bothered. However, I am one of the members of the Committee who has
received two letters from the Prison Governors Association. I thought
that everybody had. <i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> They say that
they have not. I want to ask the Minister whether he has had
discussions with the PGA about this provision, and I want him to
explain why he is not persuaded by its argument that this is a
dangerous move.</div>
					<a name="07011873000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
remind the Minister of the argument, if we approve clause 14, section
85(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 will be repealed. Section 85(3)
was introduced to prevent private justice being dispensed in private
prisons. It was seen as a safeguard that there would be a public sector
presence in such prisons to dish out the punishments, so that if people
were subject to punishment because of breaches of prison discipline,
such as an in-sentence punishment of days to be served, loss of licence
time, segregation, confinement in their cell or the use of mechanical
restraints, such matters would be deliberated on and pronounced by a
public sector representative called the controller. If we repeal that
provision today, we will be permitting the private sector to dish out
the punishment
instead.</div>
					<a name="07011873000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The PGA,
which is not known for being a radical, publicly protesting body, has
said that it is particularly concerned, because it feels that, when
imposing a punishment in a prison, public accountability is an
important issue and that such a function should fall within the public
sector. The new provisions provide that there will be some monitoring
by a public servant, but it will be left to the prison to impose its
own punishments. I think that the PGA has introduced a good public
policy issue, and since no one else stood up to raise it, I decided to
do so.</div>
					
					<a name="07011873000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011873000340"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising
this issue, which was brought to his attention by the PGA. I have a
great deal of respect for the PGA&#151;I have met its representatives
on a number of occasions, and I spoke at its annual conference last
year&#151;and I hope that I am a friend of the PGA and in the same
way as I am a friend of the Prison Officers Association. We disagree
about things quite regularly, but we do so in a friendly
spirit.</div>
					<a name="07011873000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
subplot to the activities of the PGA. It is sad that none of the
private sector directors are eligible to become members of the PGA, and
I hope that it will remedy that. Although I have not met it about that
particular issue, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has provided
Members of Parliament with a suggested response to the
PGA.</div>

they have to make it up and say that letters from the Home Secretary

Sutcliffe:
						</b> I apologise to the Committee. I am the guilty
man in this case. To help the Committee, I will make available the
copies of the suggested response to the PGA from the Home Secretary to
MPs, which I passed on to the Home Secretary.</div>
					<a name="07011873000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me help the Committee by
setting out what we are trying to do, which is to transfer to the
directors of contracted-out prisons certain powers
concerningthe segregation, control and, where appropriate,
disciplining of prisoners that are currently exercised by controllers
under the Criminal Justice Act 1991. All the powers that we propose to
transfer are existing ones that are seen as essential tools for
governors in the public sector to maintain order, control and
discipline, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford has said. The
powers are closely regulated by secondary legislation, such as the
prison rules, and detail the instructions that private prisons are
statutorily and contractually bound to follow. The instructions closely
reflect the rules that apply in public sector
prisons.</div>
					<a name="07011873000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power to
conduct adjudications, which are internal disciplinary hearings for
prisoners alleged to have broken prison rules, is a crucial control
mechanism for governors in the public sector. The proposed changes will
enable the directors of private prisons to be more responsible for the
order and control of their establishments. In addition, they will free
up controllers, who currently undertake that task on behalf of
directors, to spend more time monitoring the quality and value of the
services provided by the contractor. The changes will ensure that the
disciplinary system in private prisons operates as speedily and
effectively as possible, which will bring benefits to prisons and
prisoners generally.</div>
					<a name="07011873000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">A disciplinary offence that may
result in the award of additional days must be dealt with by an
independent adjudicator, whether in a public or private prison, rather
than by the governor or controller, as required 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 184</div>by article 6 of the European convention on human rights. This proposal
does nothing to alter that.</div>
					<a name="07011873000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers of segregation and
control are currently available to directors in an emergency, for which
they must seek retrospective approval from the controller. The
amendment that the clause makes to the 1991 Act will enable such powers
to be exercised by the director acting alone, even when there is no
emergency. There is no evidence to suggest that directors have misused
the powers since the first private prison opened in 1992. Indeed,
private prisons have been credited with a key role in improving the
decency of prisoners&#146; treatment and conditions over the past 10
years in both sectors. I hope that with those safeguards, the
controller will have a wider role, notwithstanding my hon.
Friend&#146;s comments about the effect of the provision in the
private
sector.</div>
