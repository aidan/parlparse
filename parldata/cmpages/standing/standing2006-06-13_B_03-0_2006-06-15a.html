advice
etc.</div><a name="06061534000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061534000221"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Baron</b> (Billericay) (Con): I beg to move amendment No.
9, in clause 8, page 5, line 1, leave out paragraph
(a).</div><a name="06061534000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put it to the
Committee that subsection (1)(a) is unnecessary. We agree that legal
advice is necessary at the end of the process when advising on the
offer and any subsequent settlement or agreement, but subsection (2)
already provides for that. Accordingly, subsection (1)(a) is otiose.
Indeed, under the clause the Secretary of State could allow lawyers to
be involved in the process from the start.</div>
<a name="06061534000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lawyers should not be needed,
because assessing liability and compensation under the redress scheme
is an internal matter for the NHSLA. It is separate from the
independent investigation that we envisage. It is an executive process,
not a judicial one. Legal rights are not being asserted or defended.
Liability is internally assessed, not independently determined.
Accordingly, the question of legal representation should not
arise.</div><a name="06061534000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the shadow
Secretary of State pointed out on Second Reading, legal aid provides
the oxygen for clinical negligence litigation. It rewards lawyers for
bringing speculative claims, and for complicating them and dragging
them out. It is hardly surprising that that is reflected in publicly
funded clinical negligence litigation, when overcomplicated and
protracted cases have such a dismal success rate. The legal costs too
often exceed or are disproportionate to the compensation at
stake.</div> <a name="06061534000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fundamental weakness in making amends, as the Committee has heard, is
that people blame the law when the true culprits are the
lawyers&#151;or their abuse of the legal aid system. That raises
serious questions about the contribution of lawyers, and the value that
they add to the compensation process. Indeed, the Secretary of State
said on Second
Reading:</div><a name="06061534000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
lies absolutely at the heart of the redress scheme that we will be able
to give quicker responses and better compensation to patients, rather
than paying greater fees to lawyers. I am quite certain that lawyers
will argue, as some outside the House have already, that much more
legal advice should be made available all the way through the process.
If we do that, however, we might as well stick with the existing
situation in which people seek legal advice and go to court. Given that
the redress scheme does not rule out the possibility of court action
but will in many cases, I hope, replace it, it is right that the
independent legal advice should come at the end of the
process&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 5 June 2006; Vol. 447,
c. 33.]</div><a name="06061534000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that, the right hon.
Lady was right.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 94</div><a name="06061534000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea of
the redress scheme is to avoid replicating the problems of the
litigation system. People&#146;s legal rights will be intact under
the scheme, as the scheme does not determine rights. At the end of the
process an offer may be made, in which case we agree that legal advice
should be available on the offer or settlement. If the offer is
accepted, the legal rights are waived as part of the settlement.
However, we agree that legal advice is not necessary during redress
proceedings until an offer has been made. Accordingly, under the
amendment, subsection (2) would stand, but subsection (1)(a) would be
deleted in its entirety.</div>
<a name="06061534000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard
much during our debates about the value of so-called specialist
lawyers. Perhaps we should step back for a moment and consider some
objective measure of their performance. I refer to a letter sent by the
Legal Services Commission on 7 November 2002 to a member of the public.
It stated that, since August 1999, only specialist lawyers have been
able to start new cases on legal aid. In 2000-01, the overall success
rate in clinical negligence cases was 23 per cent. for specialist
lawyers and 24 per cent. for non-specialist lawyers. The success rate
of cases after investigation&#151;after the initial filter&#151;was
56 per cent. for specialist lawyers and 59 per cent. for non-specialist
lawyers. According to a written answer dated 17 January, the overall
success rate, in the last year for which figures are available, was
about 23 per cent in legally aided clinical negligence cases
and 56 per cent. in cases that proceeded beyond
investigation.</div> <a name="06061534000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
figures are revealing for two reasons. First, they demonstrate that the
performance of specialist lawyers about five years ago was roughly
comparable with that of non-specialist lawyers. Secondly, they show
that even though legal aid has been available only to specialist
lawyers since 1999, their performance in excluding opportunistic and
unsustainable claims has not improved at all. The Secretary of State
and the shadow Health Secretary are therefore right to be wary of
involving lawyers throughout the process, because they do not appear to
add much value, and their involvement would make the scheme more
costly.</div>
<a name="06061534000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there is another reason why we should be wary of involving lawyers,
other than to advise on the offer at the end of the scheme. Hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee want open, transparent and
non-adversarial proceedings and a fact-finding process that aims to
find out what went wrong and to learn the lessons from it. As we have
discussed, and I know that the Minister will agree, the priority for
patients is often to get an explanation and an apology, where one is
due; they want to ensure that what has happened to them does not happen
to other patients. If we include lawyers at the earlier stages of the
redress scheme, they will assert the rights of the trust or the
patient, and the process will be less open. There will be less chance
of transparent proceedings from which lessons can truly be
learned.</div>
<a name="06061534000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061534000222"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stephen O'Brien</b> (Eddisbury) (Con): As my hon. Friend has
developed his arguments, he has reminded me of a further point, so
perhaps he will forgive me for reinforcing his arguments. As those of
us who have been trained in the law know, one of the essential points
in training professional lawyers is that one must first establish the
facts, secondly establish the law and only thirdly give advice. If the
scheme is a genuine attempt to have fact finding as a priority at the
front end, those involved 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 95</div>will not need to know the law or the legal advice
until the facts have been established, and that is wholly consistent
with the way in which a professional should approach these issues. I
hope that that gives my hon. Friend&#146;s arguments some
reinforcement.</div>
<a name="06061534000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000223"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> My hon. Friend is obviously right. My worry about
getting lawyers involved at an early stage&#151;at the fact-finding
or, indeed, the fault-finding stage&#151;is that that would not
encourage the open, transparent proceedings that we probably all want.
We want to encourage a culture change in the NHS, but involving
lawyers, who will assert rights for both sides, will not make for
openness. With that in mind, I would encourage the Committee to support
the amendment, and I shall press it when the time
comes.</div><a name="06061534000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061534000224"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I shall be
brief, not simply because of events later today, but because much of
the current dispute comes down to differences of philosophy and about
the type of beast that we expect the Bill to be. The issues of detail
that have been picked up simply reflect that fundamental difference.
The Government have said, fairly expressly, that they want the Bill to
remain in its current form and to be the kind of creature that it is
now. I was a little surprised, therefore, when I saw amendment No. 9,
which would remove a paragraph that appeared to enhance the scheme as
the Government understand it. The measure would allow</div>
<a name="06061534000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the provision in connection
with proceedings...of legal advice without
charge&#148;,</div><a name="06061534000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
most people would assume to be a good thing ordinarily. The official
Opposition&#146;s position is that, through the amendments in the
Lords, they are making an enhanced offer. They are trying to offer us a
superior Bill, which will have merits that the current Bill does not.
If the Government do not accept that substantial improvement, we have
to consider whether the best, in this case, is actually the enemy of
the good. Would we prefer the Bill to proceed, amended in the way that
the Government wish, with this paragraph taken out? If we voted on this
and the paragraph were removed and the Government got their way in
every other respect, would it be a good thing? I do not think that it
would.</div> <a name="06061534000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
not about the free legal advice, but about what the advice covers.
There are certain issues, which we shall touch on when we come to
amendment No. 22, such as the instruction of medical experts, where
legal advice is a moot issue and the Government may not think that a
scheme should provide that. The question of a person&#146;s
qualification for legal aid if they decide to disown the redress system
or to participate in it also worries me a little. I understand that no
matter how one puts oneself on the redress system, one&#146;s legal
rights in court remain exactly the same. But will the entitlement to
legal aid remain the same? I cannot support the Conservatives&#146;
proposal, although I sympathise with its spirit, simply because I
suspect that at the end of the day the Government will get their way
and the Bill will be worse if this paragraph is taken
out.</div><a name="06061534000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000225"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Andy Burnham):</b>
Amendment No. 9 removes the explicit power in the Bill that allows the
Secretary of State to make such provision in the redress scheme as she
sees fit</div> <a name="06061534000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the
provision in connection with the proceedings under the scheme of legal
advice without charge&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 96</div><a name="06061534000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That provision allows legal advice to be
made available to patients at any point under the scheme in addition to
the legal advice that will be available to all patients on the offer
and settlement agreement that is secured under subsection
(2).</div>
<a name="06061534000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The published
statement of policy on the NHS redress scheme makes clear our intention
that legal advice on any offer under the scheme and the terms of any
settlement agreement is to be given without charge. Furthermore, we
have previously made it clear that we intend to work closely with
stakeholders when drafting the secondary legislation to determine the
circumstances in which it may be appropriate to offer legal advice free
of charge at other stages under the
scheme.</div><a name="06061534000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the clause is to ensure that patients&#146; rights are protected. We
want to ensure that patients are able to make a genuine, informed
choice when presented with options. This provision seeks to do just
that. Redress is about putting things right for the patient where
mistakes have been made. This has to be focused on their needs. It
means effectively that the scheme must not only provide fair and
effective redress but be seen to do so. On a practical level, patients
will continue to litigate unless they have confidence that the scheme
offers an effective and fair alternative. The clause seeks to provide
that guarantee.</div>
<a name="06061534000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
believe it appropriate in every case for legal advice to be offered
without charge throughout proceedings. To do so would not meet our aim
of reducing unnecessary legal costs. There will, however, be cases or
types of cases in which free legal advice will be warranted at an
earlier stage than when the offer is made. We will work closely with
relevant organisations when drafting the secondary legislation to
determine the circumstances in which it may be appropriate to offer
legal advice free of charge at other stages of the
scheme.</div><a name="06061534000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">One option
that will be discussed during the consultation would be for legal
advice to be provided earlier in more complex cases to enable the joint
instruction of an independent medical expert where appropriate. Access
to legal advice is essential for two reasons: first, to obtain an
independent legal opinion on the level of financial compensation
offered and secondly, because it is intended that where an offer under
the redress scheme is accepted, the recipient will waive their right to
bring civil proceedings in respect of the same matter. However, there
may be others and clause 9(1)(a) allows for
that.</div><a name="06061534000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that
if the redress scheme is to offer patients a credible alternative to
litigation it has to have their full trust. We therefore believe that
it is appropriate for the Secretary of State to be under an obligation
to provide for free legal advice in respect of offers and settlement
agreements in all cases, for the scheme to provide flexibility and for
the provision of legal advice earlier in the process where appropriate.
Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon)
pressed me on that point only the other day. As the hon. Member for
Southport(Dr. Pugh) says, most patients would consider the
provision to be a good thing. The Government are committed to
protecting patients&#146; rights and to ensuring that they are
supported effectively through
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 97</div>process of obtaining redress. This provision plays a key role in
ensuring that that objective is
met.</div><a name="06061534000194"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000226"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> May I press the Minister on his proposal that legal
assistance is moved forward in the scheme? He made the point that
protecting patients&#146; rights would help the credibility of the
system. He has used a number of arguments to challenge our position
that the investigation of the facts ought to be independent, but, if he
does not mind my saying so, he has too often skated over the
fundamental issue, so I ask him to explain exactly what his views are
on that point. He suggests that lawyers be involved earlier and that
that adds to the independence, but is independence essential in
principle or is it to be provided through the various safeguards, one
of which he has just mentioned? Or is independence all well and good in
an ideal world, but not worth the trade-off with convenience in a world
of limited
resources?</div><a name="06061534000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000227"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The amendment again brings out the essential
difference between the positions of the two main parties on the scheme.
I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman throughout and it seems
to me that, throughout, independence was the main thing that the
Opposition were seeking to enshrine in the scheme. That was the big
thing that they wanted, rather than a more technical separation of
fault finding from fact
finding.</div><a name="06061534000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the debate has progressed, however, I have begun to think that the
main, overriding objective is separating fault finding from fact
finding, because there can be no other reason not to want elements of
independence to be introduced into the scheme for the most complex
cases, in which a patient has to make important decisions such as on
the instruction of a medical expert. Although the hon. Gentleman may
not like the route by which we are doing that, I am surprised that he
is not welcoming the fact that we are building in more independent
advice earlier in the scheme in order to protect the patient. He seems
to be wedded to a technical argument about separating fault finding
from fact finding. That is a surprising position to
take.</div><a name="06061534000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000228"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> The point that one is trying to make from the
Opposition Benches is that one can have all the independent legal
advice one likes, but that does not make the process itself
independent, because the independent lawyers will be asserting the
rights of either the patient or the trust when it comes to the first
stage. The Government have admitted that there is a de facto two-stage
process. The first stage&#151;fact finding&#151;is undertaken by
the trust. The second stage is the determining or assessing of
liability and compensation by the NHS Litigation Authority. We agree
that there is a two-stage process. The question is how we import
independence. Simply bringing in independent lawyers to represent one
side or the other does not guarantee independence. There is a
fundamental difference between us, and it is on the issue of
independence. I put it to the Minister that there is no better way to
ensure independence than having someone at the top independently
overseeing the fact-finding stage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 98</div><a name="06061534000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000229"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> As I listen to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments, I think that he has betrayed his fundamental misunderstanding
of what we propose. The purpose of bringing in people to provide
independent advice is not, as he says, to represent one side or the
other. It is to do what it says on the tin&#151;to provide
independent advice and to mediate and try to find a way forward. It is
wrong to say that they represent one side or the other. As I have said
to the hon. Gentleman on a number of occasions, this is not an
independent scheme; it is the NHS redress scheme. That is the purpose
set out in the Bill. There will be an in-house process whereby the NHS
can offer redress to patients. However, throughout that we are seeking
to build in elements of independent advice to ensure that a fair and
sound conclusion is reached. The advice will not represent one side
against another, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, but will facilitate
the process of resolution and mediation. That advice may come down in
favour of one side or the other, but the point is that it is
independent.</div><a name="06061534000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000230"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> May I get the Minister&#146;s position clear in
my own mind? I think that he said that the process is not independent,
but is owned by the NHS. That is the main purpose of the scheme. It is
owned by the NHS, and therefore cannot be
independent.</div><a name="06061534000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000231"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I have said that all along. The scheme is not
independent. We had a long and detailed debate on the appointment of
independent patient redress investigators. We said that we favour a
scheme whereby the NHS itself is encouraged to open up to mistakes that
have been made in order to facilitate a culture of learning and to
place an onus on seeking resolution, rather than arguing in the courts,
because at the moment the system can close down and force the patient
down a legal route. The scheme is trying to approach the matter
differently.</div><a name="06061534000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
been pressed rightly by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Erdington, and the Liberal Democrats to build elements of independence
into the process so that there can be confidence that the judgment
reached is fair and that the advice given to both sides was
independently sourced. That is our proposed scheme. Given that I
thought that the Opposition wanted independence, I am surprised that
they want to restrict the ability, in a limited number of complex cases
in which people&#146;s rights are at stake, to provide independent
advice at a particularly important juncture of the case. I am surprised
by
that.</div><a name="06061534000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000232"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The Minister has said two things that I am unable
to reconcile. He said that the legal advice provided for in paragraph
(a) is for someone involved in a complex case, but also that that
advice would not be given to one party or the other. It is vital for
anyone legally qualified&#151;therefore part of a profession, be they
employed, as a court clerk is for example, or in private
practice&#151;that they do not give legal advice. They are prevented
from doing so unless it is quite clear to whom it is given. Who would
their client be? Would the client be the scheme, the NHS or the
patient? We need that clarified, because he seems to have described a
professional mediation service rather than a legal advice provision. We
need clarification.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 99</div><a name="06061534000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000233"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. Clause 9
lays out the broader assistance that the patients can get under the
scheme: professional mediation, help with form filling and so on. Of
course, the legal advice is given to the patient. It will consider
their position and then advise them on whether to accept an
offer.</div>
<a name="06061534000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I did
not express myself particularly well. I was just challenging the way in
which the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) put his point: that
the advice would favour one side or the other to create essentially an
element of conflict in the process. The purpose of seeking the advice
would be facilitate resolution. However, the hon. Member for Eddisbury
(Mr. O'Brien) is right to press me on the point; I should make things
clearer.</div>
<a name="06061534000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The advice to
the patient would deal with their rights with respect to their
acceptance of a certain course of action, were they to accept the
appointment of a medical expert. The terms on which that expert would
be appointed and the effect that the advice might have on future
settlements would need to be explained carefully to the individual. I
accept that point, but I was resiling from the notion that a note of
conflict would be imported into the scheme, so that the emphasis would
not be on resolution. The advice would come from independent legal
sources&#151;people with a background and experience in clinical
negligence cases.</div>
<a name="06061534000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000234"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> This is a vital point. In a vulnerable situation,
when it seems that something has gone wrong, the one thing that people
need above all else is trust and confidence that there are others on
their side. Therefore, clarity about whether a professional legal
adviser owes a duty to their identified client, the patient, or to the
scheme of redress will become vital to sustaining the credibility of
that scheme. I think that the Minister is at one with me on
that.</div>
<a name="06061534000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">What struck
me about what the Minister just said is that although there is no
question that an independent medical advisor, for instance, can help in
a mediation process&#151;it is almost part of the fact-finding
process&#151;the legal advice inevitably could, although it by no
means necessarily would, be adversarial. One party&#146;s interests
could well, at times, be contrary to those of another party. Otherwise
we should not have much law; we certainly would not have a legal
profession. I would regard that as a good thing, but it might cause
difficulties.</div>
<a name="06061534000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
clarify to whom the duty is owed, so that the clause makes sense. Even
if the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment now, and
judging by what he said he probably is not, will he reflect with his
advisers before Report on whether what is suggested would help with
understanding that the intention is to facilitate fact-finding and the
creation of a sense of fairness, rather than to set up early on,
because legal advisers will have to advise according to the law, a
system with the potential to be more adversarial, contrary to the
direction that he wants to go in? If he reflects on that, some better
wording might emerge.</div>
<a name="06061534000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">He should bear in mind, as he
reflects, a point that I shall not go into now, about the tenor of the
presentation of legal advice in the cases in question, particularly
when it is provided free of charge. He should not
forget&#151;notwithstanding any attitude of &#147;over my dead
body&#148;&#151;that lawyers are often rewarded 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 100</div>on a contingent basis. There is a danger, therefore, that they will have
an interest in finding cause, rather than in finding
result.</div>
<a name="06061534000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000235"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes some sensible points and
it is important to think the matter through carefully, which is what we
intend to do. The purpose is, of course, to facilitate consensus. The
point at which any party, under the redress scheme, felt that their
interest was no longer being represented, would be the point at which
the scheme would part company with the individual, who would go a
different way. Participation in the scheme requires the consent of both
parties. The scheme member has to accept that there is a valid
claim&#151;otherwise it will not permit matters to go forward under
the redress scheme. The patient&#146;s consent and acknowledgement
that they are not being bulldozed towards an unacceptable conclusion is
also necessary&#151;otherwise that patient will withdraw from the
scheme. The manner in which the process is carried out is
all-important.</div>
<a name="06061534000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because that is the spirit of
the scheme, flexibility will be important and, to answer the point made
by the hon. Member for Billericay, it is clearly not the intention to
have lawyers crawling all over the scheme, to use a colloquial phrase,
at every stage. The point of the scheme is partly to reduce
substantially the amount that the NHS spends on legal costs. It is
right, however, to have the flexibility at certain junctures for
independent legal advice to be given to a patient, perhaps at their
request, looking at their interests under the scheme and advising on
them in the round. That is why we are creating the power in question.
We do not intend that the scheme will open the door to all kinds of
legal intervention, and it will be at the discretion of those running
it whether to introduce legal advice at an early stage. This has been a
useful exchange, and I am glad that I have had the chance to clarify
the
matter.</div><a name="06061534000195"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="06061534000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061534000236"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): It seems unlikely
that the Government would open the door to the scheme without
undertaking scenario analysis and planning to give a sense of the
potential commitment. That leads me to ask the broad question of what
will define success under the NHS redress scheme. In particular, what
proportion of current claims&#151;there are something like 5,000 a
year&#151;should be redirected to the scheme to qualify as a minimum
level of success? What proportion of those claims does the Minister
anticipate will be eligible for early-stage legal advice? Finally, he
mentioned overall savings to the NHS on legal costs. What potential
savings does he
anticipate?</div><a name="06061534000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000237"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Help may be at hand in a moment. As I explained
to the hon. Member for Billericay, there are variables such as the
wishes of the patient and of the scheme member. At no stage is it
possible to legislate for every case and whether people will want to
take them forward, so the answer will partly be discovered through
experience.</div>
<a name="06061534000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
scheme to be a success, there should be a general presumption on both
sides that a resolution should be reached within its confines. It would
be a failure if a case were to go through the redress process, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 101</div>and then not be resolved when it reaches the important end point at
which decisions must be made and people must take on board failings and
own up to them. If the emphasis at that point were not on finding a
resolution, and if people were to dig in and part company, it would be
wasteful of public resources. The process of the scheme having been
undergone, a legal proceeding would be then likely. For a case to get
that far there must have been an assumption of potential liability, so
a patient would understandably be likely to take the case
further.</div>
<a name="06061534000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
am explaining myself well, because the hon. Member for
Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) has raised an important point. There must
be a high success rate of cases being resolved under the scheme,
although we cannot legislate for all of them. It would be wasteful to
allow the scheme to operate only up to a point. Members of the scheme
will have to accept difficult decisions rather than flinch and allow
people to take their cases into the legal system. I want to see a high
success rate of cases being settled under the
scheme.</div><a name="06061534000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000238"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> The Minister is slightly ahead of me. I am
interested in exploring what will define success in the proportion of
the 5,000 or so claims currently in the system being redirected to the
NHS redress system at its start. He is talking about the situation
further down the
track.</div><a name="06061534000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000239"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> An analysis of all clinical claims handled by the
NHS Litigation Authority since its inception in 1995 shows that 38 per
cent. were abandoned by the claimant, 43 per cent. settled out of
court, 2 per cent. settled in court in favour of the patient and 0.5
per cent. settled in court in favour of the NHS. Some 16.5 per cent.
remain outstanding. We want major improvement on those figures under
the scheme&#151;that is, fewer cases being abandoned by the patient,
which is a deeply unsatisfactory outcome. People feel bogged down in
the process and that they cannot get resolution. The fact that 43 per
cent. settled out of court again shows that the process does not work
particularly well. I do not want to give the hon. Gentleman a figure of
90 per cent. or 80 per cent., as it would be wrong to do so. However,
if there were not a high success rate, I would be concerned that the
scheme was not fulfilling its objective. The breakdown will come. As a
case moves through the system, if it has been assessed as eligible and
with a case to be answered, pulling away when it reached the business
end of the NHS redress scheme, where decisions and offers have to be
made, would not be in the spirit of the scheme and would waste public
resources. The emphasis should be on resolution within the scheme, not
on forcing more cases to the courts.</div>
<a name="06061534000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061534000240"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): One reason
for the NHS redress scheme is to reduce legal costs, but it is also
meant to provide a fairer scheme of redress for patients who have been
wronged by the health service. If the scheme is more successful along
the lines laid out by the Minister, will there not be a great increase
in the number of patients and cases coming forward? I have heard that
maybe as many as hundreds of thousands of cases a year might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 102</div>involve some form of clinical error or negligence. If the scheme is as
effective as the Minister hopes in providing swift and fair justice to
patients, is a large increase not likely? Could the Minister give us
any idea of the impact that there might
be?</div><a name="06061534000066"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000241"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Again, that is a good question. I do not have the
figures directly to hand, but maybe help will come soon. We anticipate
an increase in the number of cases, as we have clearly said. One of the
main attractions of the scheme to me is that it opens up the
possibility of redress to people who at present might not even initiate
proceedings or, were proceedings initiated, would not think that they
had the will and the wherewithal to see them through to the bitter end,
which is often a long time down the path. I have in mind those of our
constituents who are less articulate or less wealthy, and the scheme
opens up the possibility of more cases coming forward. My predecessor
said that we were relaxed about that, and that is the right way to put
it. Part of the logic is to spend less on the wasteful costs of
pursuing cases all the way when 43 per cent. are abandoned out of
court, and to channel the cost of those out-of-court settlements
earlier to provide a scheme that provides something for a lot more
people. That is the nub of the point and the hon. Gentleman is right to
raise it.</div>
<a name="06061534000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000242"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Might I press the Minister on that point? He said
that he would welcome many more cases. Can he give us some idea of the
quantum? If the number of cases increase tenfold, that would be a lot
more people whom the scheme and managers of the trusts recognise as
having a problem. Would that be a good thing? To clarify, part of the
reason for the programme is to reduce legal costs. Could he be specific
about whether he expects the costs to reduce in overall quantum or that
a lower amount of the overall amount spent on redress in the NHS will
go on them? If the Minister is right and there is, to use my
hypothetical number, a tenfold increase in the number of cases, would
he not accept that the legal costs to the NHS will rise greatly, even
if they reduce on each individual case? That has the potential to have
a serious financial impact on the NHS, so it would be appropriate if
the Minister could give us a clearer view of what the Government
expect.</div>
<a name="06061534000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000243"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Help has arrived, I am pleased to say. The
modelling of patient survey data carried out by the Department suggests
that an improved scheme of this kind might see claims rise by anything
from 2,200 to 19,500 a year. I accept that that is a broad range, but
the number could increase significantly. We expect between 5,800 and
16,600 cases to be covered by the scheme in year one. It is impossible
to say how many will come forward, and it would be wrong to say that
there will be a certain number&#151;who is to say what will be an
accurate judgment?&#151;so we have given a range of cases, and a
range of the costs that that is likely to produce.</div>
<a name="06061534000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that I was going to
make to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood was that the scheme will
be reviewed after three years, at which time we will want to see how
many extra cases have come forward and how much extra has been spent on
legal costs. If the scheme is conducted in the intended spirit, it
should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 103</div>not be necessary to incur legal costs in the early
stages of the process. It should be possible for such costs to be
seriously reduced. That is an important aspect of the
scheme.</div>
<a name="06061534000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000244"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I welcome the Minister&#146;s explanation. I
believe that he said in an earlier sitting that trusts will be expected
to initiate their own investigations in cases in which they feel that
something has gone wrong. I wonder again about the idea of a quantum if
the NHS changes, ceases to be defensive and automatically investigates
untoward incidents. Given that I have heard from other sources that
there is the potential for hundreds of thousands of such cases to
happen in a year&#151;something might go wrong at some level in one
in 20 of all operations in hospitals&#151;that could be an enormous
open-ended commitment. Can the Minister comment on that? How often does
he anticipate trusts triggering investigations in cases that, at the
moment, they would tend to close down unless the patient were
particularly insistent?</div>
<a name="06061534000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000245"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> In response to a parliamentary question, I made
available the numbers of clinical negligence cases trust by trust. I
shall make sure that the hon. Gentleman has that information, because
it will probably answer his question. To answer the broader point, we
are attempting to make a serious culture change. I shall not name them,
but I have seen instances in the public sector in which, because of a
culture of inability to own up to mistakes, cases have been put into
the legal process&#151;letting them grind, grind away and
elongate&#151;as a way of putting off an uncomfortable situation.
That has often been used as a way of managing problems but it can,
clearly, be very wasteful of public resources; authorities can end up
paying more than they would have done otherwise. As I said to the hon.
Member for Billericay, I do not think that most people are motivated by
a desire to take the system to the cleaners. However, because they do
not get a proper response when they initiate something, they might take
the process to the end point because they think, &#147;They may learn
the lesson if I win my case; then they won&#146;t do it to somebody
else.&#148; They have been pushed into a very adversarial process. We
are trying to do something different.</div>
<a name="06061534000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that there will
be hundreds of thousands of new cases. The Department&#146;s
estimates suggest that we will make a saving on legal costs of up to
&#163;7.6 million a year. Bear in mind that we are talking about
cases in which the claims are for less than &#163;20,000, so we
expect there to be a saving. However, the hon. Member for Beverley and
Holderness (Mr. Stuart) is right that more cases could come forward.
The Department&#146;s modelling suggests that the NHS overall could
go from a &#163;7 million saving to a &#163;48 million cost because
of the scheme. It is likely that there will be a cost, given that we
expect the scheme to work in the way that we want it to. I just do not
know whether that cost will be as high as has been
suggested.</div>
<a name="06061534000196"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000246"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. He is being very
generous about interventions. He kindly said that he would reflect on
some of the points that I raised earlier and consider whether some more
felicitous wording might be thought about before Report stage. It is a
staggering statistic that 43 per cent. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 104</div>of cases settle out of court. When he is considering
this issue with advisers, and perhaps taking advice from others who are
not in the legal profession, he should perhaps consider how much that
is driven by contingent fees. It is quite satisfactory, from a
lawyer&#146;s point of view, to advise a client that their case is
worth a go because there is a settlement value, when they know full
well that it will not sustain all the way to court. In order to make
sure that the process is both cost-effective and rights-effective, the
Minister might want to reflect how much is possibly falsely directed
because it is worth while to have a go for a
settlement.</div><a name="06061534000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000247"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point,
which has been raised with me by a constituent who is pursuing a
long-running case in which his son died while under the care of a
mental health trust. He explained to me that the case had been going
for a long time, but might never get to court. What he said was new to
me. He explained that often, at the end-point, there is a greater
incentive to settle out of court than to take the case to court.
Perhaps that is good in some ways, in that it saves the cost of court
proceedings, so there will be some savings. However, it leaves the
patient in an unsatisfactory position in that there are interests
working against their interests at that point. Having reached that
point, people want their day in court&#151;or some do. They want to
give voice to and vent the frustrations that they have felt during the
process. When the case finally gets to court and they are told,
&#147;I think you should really settle out of court&#148;, it is
deeply unsatisfactory for patients all round. The hon. Gentleman is
right to raise this point. If what my constituent has told me is the
case, and there is good reason to think that it is, that is another
unsatisfactory facet of the system. I would welcome political agreement
that that should not be the
case.</div><a name="06061534000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to pick
up on an important point made by the hon. Member for Southport about
legal aid. Obviously, if redress is not possible under the scheme,
people will retain their rights to go through the courts. It will be
possible for some patients in that position to apply for legal aid in
the same way as now&#151;the Legal Services Commission makes
decisions on a case-by-case basis on whether to award funding, as not
everyone is
eligible.</div><a name="06061534000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
&#147;Making Amends&#148;, the chief medical officer recommended
that the LSC should be able to take into account whether someone had
used the NHS redress scheme when making a decision on an application
for legal aid. We support that recommendation, as do the Department for
Constitutional Affairs and the LSC, because it supports the overall
aims of legal aid by ensuring that funding is awarded in the right
cases and that people are expected to explore other ways of getting
redress before turning to the courts. There will be no blanket ban on
legal aid for clinical negligence cases, and decisions will continue to
be made on a case-by-case basis. It is reasonable for the guardians of
the funds to consider whether the redress scheme was used and what
conclusion it
reached.</div><a name="06061534000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000248"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> The Minister is confirming what I thought. If
somebody has no confidence in the NHS redress scheme and decides that
they wish to go to court because of what they have heard about the
scheme, and they require legal aid, their situation is technically
worse, in legal terms, is it not?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 105</div><a name="06061534000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000249"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I do not believe so, because they will have gone
through the NHS redress process and benefited considerably from doing
so, through the disclosure of information and the investigation of the
facts. If there is a genuine grievance, the process will apply as it
does now. Deserving cases will be taken forward, and there is no bar to
that happening. However, given that we want a test of whether a case is
meritorious or has potential to go forward, it is entirely reasonable
for those making the decisions to consider what happened under the NHS
redress scheme.</div>
<a name="06061534000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000250"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> If there were a complaints procedure, as there
currently is in most hospitals, but somebody decided to sidestep it in
order to take a case to court and then sought legal aid, would those
considering the case for legal aid ask them to go back and consider the
hospital&#146;s complaints procedure first, before moving
forward?</div><a name="06061534000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000251"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I might have to write to the hon. Gentleman on
some of the details, but I understand that, under the principles of the
current system, people will want to see evidence that attempts have
been made at resolution before an application for legal aid is made. It
is for the applicant to explain how they felt the system either did not
represent their interests or was not fair to their case, which would
then be relevant information for the awarders of legal aid to consider.
I will come back with more detail for the hon. Gentleman on that, but
the point of principle is that there should be no blanket ban on people
applying for legal aid; indeed, quite the
opposite.</div><a name="06061534000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000252"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> Before the Minister concludes his remarks, may I
return to an earlier exchange with my hon. Friend the Member for
Eddisbury? The more we involve lawyers in the scheme, the more we
replicate the court system, which the redress system is designed to
replace. The Minister has agreed that the redress scheme does not
determine rights, so why does he think that those rights need to be
protected by
lawyers?</div><a name="06061534000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000253"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> As the hon. Gentleman has heard me say, we do not
intend to replicate the current process via a Government scheme. It
would be very odd to enshrine what is bad about the current system in a
formal scheme. The purpose of the clause is to give the scheme member
and the Litigation Authority the flexibility to move the scheme on in a
particular case, and a mechanism that allows them to do
that.</div><a name="06061534000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point about
rights is that the scheme is not judge and jury. A judge deals with
somebody&#146;s rights and dispenses with them, in the sense that he
decides whether those rights are invoked and whether people can claim
them. That is what happens in a legal process. However, we are saying
that if the offer of redress is not accepted at the end of the NHS
redress scheme, the legal right is not dispensed with. Making the
scheme judge and jury would mean that the wall would come down and
people would be left with nowhere else to go. However, they do have
somewhere else to go.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 106</div><a name="06061534000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000254"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I take that point, but if the redress scheme does
not determine rights&#151;the Minister has just agreed with
that&#151;why do they need to be protected by
lawyers?</div><a name="06061534000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000255"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> The scheme is an attempt to make a reasonable
offer. It is an out-of-court, fast-track settlement system, not a legal
process. We considered whether to apply a different test for
eligibility, but to give clarity it was felt that the test in the end
should be liability in tort. Therefore, to give clarity at the end of
the scheme&#151;whether or not the offer being made is comparable
with what would have been achieved in the courts&#151;there is a need
to offer independent legal advice. As I said earlier, the aim is to
import into the scheme an element of independent authority, so that
people can move forward with confidence. The scheme is not designed to
replicate the unfairnesses and weaknesses of the current system. It is
to provide greater flexibility and confidence that the result that the
scheme comes up with is a good one and one that people should accept.
If the scheme did not have certainty at the end point, it might be
doomed to failure, in that word would get out that people should not go
down the NHS redress scheme route, because they would not get full
redress under it. A guarantee of proper redress is needed, and this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000270"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in clause 8, page 5,
line 9, at end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c)
the joint instruction by those seeking redress and the scheme
authorities of medical
experts.'.</div><a name="06061534000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
would be a fairly innocuous change. Clause 8(1) already provides for
the possibility of legal advice 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 107</div>being provided during the proceedings and a medical
expert&#146;s services being commissioned. The Minister has confirmed
that medical experts, where instructed, would be jointly instructed. It
is imperative for any meaningful joint instruction of a medical expert
that the patient has specialist legal representation. It would not be
reasonable to expect a lay person to instruct a medical expert on such
complex issues.</div><a name="06061534000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal is in line with the general cultural tone that the Government
have tried to set. I am referring to allowing the NHS to own the scheme
and to make whatever changes it sees fit to instil confidence in the
scheme. The mechanism as envisaged would apply only to cases that had
not already been resolved proactively by the scheme and cases in which
patients felt that redress should be offered but the scheme authority
did not agree.</div><a name="06061534000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based
on information provided by the NHS and by the patient&#146;s adviser,
the medical expert would assess eligibility for redress, and the scheme
authority would follow the findings of the medical expert. This would
introduce an element of independence into the scheme and, more
important, independence over the issue of eligibility. Without the
availability of this mechanism, dissatisfied patients are more likely
to go to the courts and the resulting costs are more likely to be a
great deal higher.&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I do not know what
electronic gadgets hon. Members have on them that make strange noises
unexpectedly. Normally, when one proposes amendments such as these, the
Government suggest that, as they would be very
expensive&#151;</div><a name="06061534000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000271"></a>The

find out what is making the
noise.</div><a name="06061534000197"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000272"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Normally, the Government say that such amendments
would be horrendously expensive to implement, and they do the exotic
modelling that they seem so good at, which adds appreciable cost to
it.</div>
<a name="06061534000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is nice
that in this case it is not a purely hypothetical amendment. What is
being proposed reflects very much the resolve schemes that are
currently being piloted and the speedy resolution scheme in Wales. It
is perfectly possible to quantify their effects and to see that in many
cases they save litigation costs.</div>
<a name="06061534000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if
the empirical argument for the pilots was not good enough, there does
not seem a great deal that the NHS can lose if the amendment is
accepted. If the Government are correct, the NHS will recognise its own
errors and offer suitable redress anyway. Unmeritorious cases are
likely to be screened out first by the specialist advice and certainly
by the lawyers, because under the resolve schemes, they are paid a
relatively modest fee only if they are successful. If the medical
report is not favourable, there is no compensation to the patient or
fee for the solicitor.</div>
<a name="06061534000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that background of
experience and the fact that the proposal is not out of kilter with the
thrust of the Government&#146;s suggestions, there should be no
principal objection to the amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 108</div><a name="06061534000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061534000273"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Si&#244;n Simon</b> (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab): I
understand that the Bill already includes Government amendments made in
the other place which are similar to those we are discussing, which
provide for the possibility of making the suggested type of
arrangement. I am not sure whether this amendment is the best way of
introducing what I would like to see, which is a slight strengthening
of the Bill, so that if this stage of the proceedings is reached
without the mainstream scheme having produced a resolution, the
presumption would be to proceed to a resolve or speedy resolution-type
joint instruction. I have spoken to the Minister about the matter
outside the Committee and I hope that between now and Report some
wording can be found for an amendment that will give the Bill slightly
more strength.</div>
<a name="06061534000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000274"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I can see exactly where the amendment is coming
from and I have some sympathy with it, but it would expand the role of
lawyers by involving them in the instruction of medical experts. I have
a problem with that, because it brings us back to the involvement of
lawyers. I would argue that the amendment is inappropriate as the
intention of the Bill, in essence, is that there should be an internal
offer-making process. Its purpose is to avoid legal costs rather than
attract them. The amendment would add to the complication and replicate
the court system, which was referred to in a debate on an earlier
clause, again raising the general issue of involving lawyers. I suggest
to the hon. Gentleman that if we truly want an open, transparent and
non-adversarial system, the best way of accomplishing that is by
keeping the lawyers out of the scheme until we get to the end, when the
offer of compensation is made.</div>
<a name="06061534000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also not clear from the
amendment whether such experts are to consider issues such as
liability, causation, condition and prognosis. We shall therefore not
support it.</div>
<a name="06061534000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000275"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> To use the words of the hon. Member for
Southport, the amendment is not necessarily out of kilter with the
Bill, but nor is it necessary, because the Bill as drafted achieves
precisely the aim that I believe he seeks. The amendment would insert a
new subsection (2)(c), to provide that individuals must have legal
advice when seeking jointly to instruct a medical expert in conjunction
with the scheme
authority.</div><a name="06061534000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
amendment is not appropriate, as the clause is concerned only with the
provision of legal advice to individuals to whom an offer under the
scheme is made. That is, the clause covers what must be provided to
patients to whom offers are made. The joint instruction of a medical
expert would usually be undertaken to inform decisions on eligibility
or quantum, and would thus naturally occur before the making of an
offer. The amendment is concerned with the provision of legal advice at
an earlier stage, referring specifically to &#147;those seeking
redress&#148;. An offer will not have been made to people seeking
redress. The amendment therefore confuses the existing provisions and
the important requirement for legal advice contained in subsection
(2).</div><a name="06061534000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
amendment is unnecessary because there is an existing power in
subsection (2)(a) to enable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 109</div>legal advice to be made available to people where there is a need for it
at an earlier stage, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Erdington said, such as where there is the joint instruction of medical
experts. We have stated our intention with regard to independent
medical experts in paragraphs 60 and 61 of our statement of policy on
the NHS redress scheme for the Bill to provide flexibility for the
provision of services that may help to reach an agreement to settle. It
is intended that further consultation with stakeholders will take place
to identify which services might be appropriate and effective for such
cases. Options might include mediation services or the services of a
jointly instructed independent medical expert. If in determining the
facts of a case, the scheme member or the scheme authority considers
that evidence from an independent medical expert is necessary, it is
intended that they will also seek to ascertain the wishes of the
patient to reach agreement on an acceptable
person.</div><a name="06061534000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept the
principle, which will be appropriate in some cases, for a jointly
instructed medical expert to be engaged and that legal advice early in
the process might be appropriate, as we discussed previously. That
would enable the patient to be fully informed and involved in the joint
instruction of such an expert. We will consult further following the
passage of the Bill to determine the detail of when and how such
services should be engaged. However, the Bill as drafted already allows
for that to happen, and the amendment confuses the advice given at the
point at which an offer is made with advice provided earlier in the
scheme in perhaps more complex cases.</div>
<a name="06061534000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Southport
is not out of kilter with our intentions. In fact, he is very much in
step with what we seek to do. I hope to assure him that there is enough
in the Bill to give him confidence that legal advice will be made
available where appropriate to those who need that help. However, it
would not be right to accept the amendment, as it confuses the two
issues. With those assurances, and having said that I accept the spirit
of what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve, I hope that he will
see fit to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06061534000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000276"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> The official Opposition&#146;s position appears to
be that they have a clear idea of how the process should take place and
that, until a certain stage, lawyers are simply not in the frame at
all. The Minister&#146;s view is that lawyers might or might not be
in the frame at various points, but that the Bill already caters for
the kind of contingencies that are visualised. He has not resolved the
fundamental problem of what will be done, when there is joint
instruction of medical experts, to guide somebody who has no experience
of the process and is working with an NHS organisation that has every
experience of it. There is a problem to be solved, and we shall find
out whether the Bill will eventually succeed in doing so.</div>
<a name="06061534000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to ask leave to withdraw

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000277"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 22, in clause 9, page 5,
line 27, at end
add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5)
In making arrangements under this section, the Secretary of State must
have regard to the principle that the persons providing services under
subsection (1) should be able to demonstrate an appropriate level of
expertise and experience in the provision of medico-legal advice in
clinical negligence
matters.'.</div><a name="06061534000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment along the same lines as amendment No. 23. We are
assuming that patients will be adequately, thoroughly and effectively
advised so that the system can work as well as possible. The amendment
would ensure that a provider of assistance and advice has expertise and
experience.</div><a name="06061534000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
statement of policy, assistance for those seeking redress is described
as being provided
through</div><a name="06061534000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Patient Advice
and Liaison Services (PALS) and Independent Complaints Advocacy Service
(ICAS) type
arrangements.&#148;</div><a name="06061534000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
of those organisations are commendable, and the people involved with
them are doing worthwhile work, but neither is appropriate for
empowering a patient to influence the outcome of an investigation that
has to pass something legalistic such as the Bolam test. Patient advice
and liaison services are not genuinely independent, being part of the
customer care arrangements in the NHS, and ICAS is designed to help
patients navigate the complaints procedure. Neither seems to fit the
bill for the provision of complex advice in difficult circumstances,
and they could not do so without changing radically their purpose,
nature and set-up. That would be true even if the Government were to
leave them alone for any length of time, which they rarely do, often
being minded to abolish or change them or create different
organisations in their place. The amendment would ensure that the
advice available to individuals was appropriate and came from qualified
people. I cannot see any fundamental objection to that, but other hon.
Members
might.</div><a name="06061534000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000278"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made clear the aims behind
the amendment. I have some problem with it, because our view of the
McKenzie-type friend is that it should be an informed lay person, able
to provide support and guidance on procedures and ensure that a patient
does not feel at a loss within the system. The clause enables the
provision of that sort of person. The amendment would introduce
substantive legal and perhaps medical advice at all stages of the
process, rather than at the end as is currently envisaged. I therefore
return to points made on preceding clauses, upon which I shall not
expand. The amendment would add complexity and potential expense and go
some way towards replicating the courts
system.</div><a name="06061534000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000279"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I think I said that this was a probing amendment,
and I primarily intend to find out what arrangements the Government
intend to provide to support patients. I have no fixed idea of what
they might
be.</div><a name="06061534000134"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000280"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s perfectly
reasonable point. However, it is worth pointing out that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 111</div>the clause makes provision for a McKenzie-type lay person. I reiterate
the view that if we start to import more legal advice along the lines
suggested in comments on previous clauses, we will add complexity and
potential expense and in effect replicate the court system. We cannot
support the
amendment.</div><a name="06061534000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000281"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> Clause 9 is important because it provides for a
broad range of support to be offered to individuals seeking redress
under the scheme. Judging by the tenor of comments throughout our
proceedings, there is no will to limit that range of support. I find
myself agreeing with the hon. Member for Billericay. It is right for us
to allow a broad range of lay and other support to be provided; to
restrict that to medico-legal advice would be a
mistake.</div><a name="06061534000199"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06061534000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
9 imposes on the Secretary of State a duty to provide assistance for
people to meet &#147;all reasonable requirements&#148;. It is
intended to require the provision of support to patients whose cases
are being considered, and is a wide duty, as I said. Our intention is
that that service be based on those currently provided by PALS and ICAS
to support patients through the complaints
process.</div><a name="06061534000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, we
intend to discuss and consult further on what type of services might
best be provided, but we want the broad power to provide a range of
support. On a number of occasions, Conservative Members have rightly
drawn attention to the role of McKenzie friends. That would be a type
of support with which people might wish to
engage.</div><a name="06061534000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to say,
I am not entirely clear on what is meant by</div>
<a name="06061534000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;expertise and experience

advice&#148;,</div><a name="06061534000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">but it suggests
only someone with legal qualifications or experience. That, too, could
bring unnecessary cost and resource implications to the scheme. Again,
for the avoidance of doubt, our intention is not to import lots of
legal advice into the scheme, but in many ways to limit such advice. So
we hope that the broad support that people could get from other sources
would limit the need for independent legal advice. I urge the Committee
to resist narrowing the Bill in such a
way.</div><a name="06061534000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I understood
the hon. Member for Southport correctly, he simply wanted advice of the
highest possible quality to be available to people. That is a perfectly
legitimate aim, and I believe that our provisions and the range of
measures for legal advice, as we discussed earlier, are complemented
and supported by clause 9. We would lose that if we amended the clause
in the way that he suggested. The provisions will offer a broad range
of support as somebody goes on the journey of seeking redress under the
scheme. I do not blame him for tabling the amendment. It has allowed me
to explain to him our intention behind the clause. As I said, it is an
important clause, and I ask him to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06061534000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000282"></a>Dr.

progress. There is one point that we have not dealt with, and which he
has not answered. The organisations nominated as potential advisers
would

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000285"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I shall conclude with just a few remarks.
Opposition Members welcome the Bill and support the Government in their
attempts to address the problems of clinical negligence litigation. I
hope that we have made that clear. However, the NHS redress scheme must
not be a missed opportunity to create a mechanism that has the full
confidence of patients and provides a meaningful alternative to going
to the court. Again, that is something that we share on both sides of
this room.</div><a name="06061534000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as I
can see, only one key issue divides us. We on the Opposition
Benches&#151;I believe I speak for the Conservatives and the Liberal
Democrats&#151;believe that a fact finding stage of the investigation
ought to be independent. The Government do not, as the Minister has
made reasonably clear in the exchanges this morning. As far as we are
concerned, this is a matter of natural justice based on the principle
that no man should be judged in his own cause. It is also a pragmatic
necessity, in the sense that an investigation without the badge of
independence would lack credibility and fail to inspire the confidence
of patients.</div><a name="06061534000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
heard what members of this Committee have said, and I listened very
carefully to the comments made by the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington. He declared an interest with Action for Victims of Medical
Accidents and has raised concerns about the lack of independence in the
Government&#146;s proposals. That is the position taken by Action for
Victims of Medical Accidents as well. If he believes that the
fact-finding stage of the investigation under the redress scheme should
be overseen by a person independent of the health care trust, where
does he stand on this whole issue? The central issue of how one imports
independence into the scheme if someone independent is not overseeing
the health care trust has not been addressed. If Members do not agree
with the simple proposition that it would be a good idea to have
someone independent overseeing that fact-finding stage, I would welcome
any suggestion, particularly from the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington, as to how he and his associates believe that independence
ought to be
introduced.</div><a name="06061534000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000286"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b><b class="B"> </b>Quite simply, the independence as envisioned
by me and by AvMA does not come from the kind of arrangements that the
hon. Gentleman describes and which were envisaged in clause 12. The
independence comes through some version of the joint instruction by the
trust and the claimant of independent medical experts. That is the
independence that we are talking about and that, briefly, is the answer
to his question.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 114</div><a name="06061534000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000287"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b><b class="B"> </b>I thank the hon. Gentleman for answering
that point, but introducing lawyers&#151;at the end of the day, they
have to represent one side or the other&#151;regardless of how
independent they may be and whatever independent expertise they may
have, does not make the process independent. If we are to ensure that
this process has credibility in the eyes of patients, that issue of
independence is terribly
important.</div><a name="06061534000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both the
Minister and the Secretary of State have conceded that there is a
practical and logical distinction between fact-finding and
fault-finding for the purposes of the scheme. First, the facts must be
investigated at trust level. Secondly, the case must be passed to the
NHSLA for consideration of liability and compensation. Therefore, there
is bound to be a two-stage process&#151;the Minister has acknowledged
that that exists; whether it be the redress scheme, as envisaged by the
Bill as amended or the redress scheme as we proposed
initially&#151;as we have consistently argued. The only issue is
whether the investigation of facts ought to be independent.</div>
<a name="06061534000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has deployed a number of arguments against our simple proposal. He has
stated that independence is imported simply by involving free legal
advice in relation to an offer or settlement, but as I suggested to the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington, that is not the same thing as an
independent scheme. Participation of independent lawyers in a process
does not transform a non-independent process into an independent
one&#151;no matter how much one argues that.</div>
<a name="06061534000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has also suggested
that free, independent medical advice imports some element of
independence. That is an empty assurance, because expert advice should
in any case be independent or it is not worth the paper that it is
written on. If it is not independent, it is not expert opinion but
advocacy, and that cannot be
right.</div><a name="06061534000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has suggested that independence is imported through access to the
courts. The Government are defining the merit of the redress scheme by
the occasion of its failure&#151;when people resort to court
action&#151;even though the scheme is supposed to provide a genuine
alternative to litigation. As for complaints to the health service
ombudsman and review by the Healthcare Commission, the availability of
such remedies to maladministration and procedural matters is not a
substitute for re-examining substantive
matters.</div><a name="06061534000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has suggested that an independent fact-finding process would be
adversarial, accusatory or finger-pointing. He has consistently made
the point that an independent fact-finding stage somehow imports an
adversarial review of the facts, but that makes no sense at all. There
is a basic legal distinction between an adversarial process and an
inquisitorial one. We have referred to the Inquiries Act 2005 and to
the coroners system, not because we view the redress scheme working in
exactly the same way, but rather because they provide a conceptual
model for what we propose. Fundamentally, they are independent
inquisitorial processes which are concerned with the establishment of
fact rather than fault. There is no sense at all in which such
investigation would reinforce a blame culture in the NHS.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000288"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are now beyond the time when the
Committee was due to rise, and it is time for questions in the House,
so I would be very grateful if the hon. Gentleman brought his remarks
to a close. We are debating the final question to dispose of the Bill.
The main debate has obviously taken place, and there are still the
Report and Third Reading
stages.</div><a name="06061534000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000289"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> Thank you, Miss Begg, for that guidance.
</div><a name="06061534000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister talked about promoting the culture of openness and honesty and
the NHS taking responsibility for its own mistakes. He implied time and
again that because our proposal would require an independent outsider
to come in and consider what went wrong, it would argue against a
culture of openness in the NHS and would encourage the NHS to close
ranks. That is absurd. If he is talking about openness only as long as
it is in-house and not exposed to outside scrutiny, it will not be
openness at all. There is a fundamental contradiction between the
Minister&#146;s desire to promote openness and his reluctance to
allow independent advisors to investigate the
facts.</div><a name="06061534000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
discussions will no doubt continue at Report stage and on Third
Reading, and I very much look forward to that. However it would be
remiss of me if I did not thank you for chairing the Committee, Miss
Begg, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers, and all who assisted with
proceedings, including Dr. John Benger for his advice on amendments. I
thank the Minister for his efforts. The fact that he has been unable,
in my view, to answer our concerns about independence and the lack of
openness built into the Bill at present, should not detract from the
fact that he has been genuine in his attempts to improve
matters.</div> <a name="06061534000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, I
thank my colleagues, my hon. Friends the Members for Ruislip-Northwood,
for Beverley and Holderness and for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) for their
valuable contributions&#151;a fine body of men&#151;and last but
certainly not least, my Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury
for stepping in at the last minute and doing such a fine
job.</div><a name="06061534000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We said at the
beginning that we would be keeping an eye on the World cup when it came
to the programming, and that, whether by luck or design, we would
achieve our goal. When I said &#147;by design&#148;, that would be
on our part; the luck would have been on the Government&#146;s. I
encourage everybody to enjoy the football.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000290"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I am going to put away my 20-page speech, breaking
the habit of a lifetime and going for cheap popularity by deferring my
remarks until Report. I thank hon. Members for creating a reasoned and
relaxed environment, to which I think the Minister has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 116</div>made a substantial contribution, and I thank you,Miss Begg, for
having chaired proceedings in a similar relaxed and rational
way.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061534000291"></a>Andy
Burnham:</b> I am grateful for those general statements of
support for the Bill. There is obviously a difference of opinion as to
the means by which we get to the goal that I think we share. The
argument is on the means and the hon. Member for Billericay is
absolutely right to say the scheme must have the confidence of
patients. Let me just say quickly two things to
him.</div><a name="06061534000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be a
three-year review, and that is the point at which we will test some of
these matters. The process has to be conducted fairly and properly or
it will not have the confidence of patients. There will be an in-built
presumption that the process will be done in the right way, or else the
scheme will not work and patients will not have confidence in it. They
will walk away and go to the courts. In-built in the scheme is the
presumption that people will conduct the inquiry fairly and properly
and try to work towards resolution, which in the end is what we all
want. There is an element of a two-stage process, but we do not have
the two schemes we would have had under the measures put forward by the
hon. Member for Billericay. Let us return to those matters on Report,
because there is clearly still some mileage in them.</div>
<a name="06061534000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me, too, now thank you,
Miss Begg, for chairing our proceedings so well. The hon. Member for
Congleton (Ann Winterton) has good reason to be grateful to you,
because you have spared her the joys of this Committee.</div>
<a name="06061534000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the Clerk, Dr. John
Benger, who is used to my rambling in the Health Committee, and who has
had more of it here. I also thank the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers, the
attendants and, of course, the police, for dealing with annoying
electrical noises this morning.</div>
<a name="06061534000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my colleagues on the
Committee, who have contributed well, and I think that there is no
difference between us. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Erdington has been pressing me for a little more on Report, and we will
think about that; we will carry on discussions with him and see where
they lead us. My hon. Friend has contributed extremely well to our
proceedings, representing the organisation with which he is involved
properly and in a fine way, and I pay tribute to him.</div>
<a name="06061534000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I, too, thank the Whip, my
hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)? We have two
Welsh firsts in the Committee: we have the framework power, and this is
my hon. Friend&#146;s first Committee. So we have two firsts for the
Welsh, although they are not enjoying such prominence in Germany, but
never mind&#151;perhaps another time.</div>
<a name="06061534000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, I thank the hon. Member
for Billericay for the way in which he and his hon. Friends have
conducted the proceedings. This has been an amiable Committee, and I
look forward to continuing our discussions on Report.</div>
