Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We now embark upon part II of the Bill, which deals with local transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): On a point of order, Mr. Gale. You will recall that the Ministers generously agreed to make available to members of the Committee at the earliest opportunity information relating to the Bill. That clearly is important to enable us to discuss the relevant parts. It is also important because it enables those who wish to do so to draft appropriate amendments.
<P>
In The Sunday Telegraph and other papers at the weekend, it was reported that the Secretary of State is to shelve plans to strip Railtrack of its responsibility for safety on the railways. That important issue relates to part IV of the Bill and it would be helpful to both sides of the Committee to know whether it is likely to be the case. Can you advise me, Mr. Gale, of ways in which I might obtain that information to help me to prepare appropriate amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. I understand that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has commissioned the Roland report on safety and standards, which is directed at Railtrack. I am sure it will be an easy matter for the Minister simply to say that that report will be made available to the Committee in advance of our discussion on that part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee will understand that neither of those issues is directly a matter for the Chair. Nevertheless, the Ministers present will have heard what both hon. Gentlemen have said and I am sure that they will respond as helpfully as they have done in the past.
<P>
We now move to chapter II of the Bill, which deals with local transport. Under Gale's rules for the good conduct of business, which may or may not be convergent with anyone else's, I am prepared to allow a reasonably wide debate on the first group of amendments to allow both Ministers and others to set out the stall. This will be applied with the usual and now, I believe, by all members of the Committee well understood ground rules that we will only cover the ground once.
<H4><center>Clause 92</center></H4>
<H4><center>Local transport plans</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 55, line 4, leave out 'must' and insert 'may'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 13, in page 55, line 12, leave out 'must' and insert 'may'.
<P>
No. 14, in Clause 93, page 55, line 21, leave out 'must' and insert 'may'.
<P>
No. 15, in Clause 93, page 55, line 23, leave out 'must' and insert 'may'.
<P>
No. 16, in Clause 93, page 55, line 28, leave out 'must' and insert 'may'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This morning is a time for refreshment and reinvigoration of our enthusiasm for the Bill. If our delight in air traffic control matters had been flagging a little, the Bill provides us with endless changes of scenery as we traverse it. We now move on to what local authorities may do to promote public transport and transport in general in their areas.
<P>
Clause 92 sets out what is required of a local authority in drafting a local transport plan. We have a fundamental objection to the principle behind the clause in that it provides yet another imposition on local authorities. I sense that hon. Members on the Government Front Bench have not yet settled down to this morning's meeting. They are beginning to cough and splutter up their sleeves--if that is an expression one may use. When I talk about an additional imposition on local authorities I am, of course, talking about extra expense and bureaucracy--things beloved of new Labour. They have added £1 billion to the cost of running Whitehall with extra civil servants, political advisers, spin doctors and endless streams of paper in reports. They believe that reports and studies are a substitute for action and they want to impose that philosophy on local authorities. One would think that local authorities had never thought about transport before in their lives, such is the arrogance contained in the clause.
<P>
Local authorities spend considerable time considering transport, but now they will have to put such issues within a framework that is laid down by the Government and dictated by statute--a framework to which all local authorities will have to conform. Our objective is to make those plans voluntary, however laudable and constructive they may be. They should be not an obligation on local authorities, but rather an option for them to pursue. We believe in decentralising powers to local authorities, not centralising them on Westminster.
<P>
Since the election, all the legislation dealing with local authorities--in particular the Local Government Act 1999--and best value, has increased the controls on authorities. The Government say that they are sweeping away controls and getting rid of competitive tendering. In fact, whereas a limited number of services were involved in competitive tendering, now every service in local government is involved with best value and is subject ultimately to direction by the Secretary of State. The clause is about subjecting local transport plans to the direction of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The integrated transport White Paper made it clear that local transport plans must support the objectives of Government policy and that grants must be distributed to authorities on the basis of how well their plans conform to the Government's idea of a local transport plan. If policies that the Government do not like would be pursued under a plan, they would clearly not support it with the funding required. No doubt we shall return to the funding of local transport. By replacing "must" with "may" at appropriate points in the clause and elsewhere in this part of the Bill, the arrangements will be made voluntary instead of compulsory, which will be a victory for local democracy.
<P>
Let me explain what the provision would mean in cash terms for council tax payers. The Government will not be paying for local transport plans; local council tax payers will be paying. We have heard a good deal from the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) about how much things cost. I will give way to the hon. Gentleman if he will tell me how much he believes that the local transport plan in his constituency is likely to cost his local transport authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I will. I believe that the cost would be the same as it always has been because my local authority plan is very successful. Is it true that in the 1980s the Conservative Government said that all local authorities must produce economic development plans every year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We are talking about local transport plans. Typically, the hon. Gentleman did not answer my question. I asked whether he knew how much it would cost to produce a local transport plan. Local authorities have felt obliged to produce such plans to conform to the White Paper. I have here a letter addressed to my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) from the leader of the Conservative group of Buckinghamshire county council enclosing a document from the chairman of the environmental services committee, which explains the cost of compiling a local transport plan. It adds up to £112,000, not including publication and other expenditure, and the final sum is £151,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): My hon. Friend was about to express incredulity at that sum. At the weekend I saw the Oswestry borough council submission for best value--an astonishing document, not much thinner than the Greater London Authority Act 1999, which is well known in the House for its size, depth and weight. That is where the money will go. Resources will be devoted to a huge amount of internal work that will not benefit the travelling public.
<P>
<B> Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend is right. There has long been a trend towards taking more powers into central Government. If local government is to play its proper role in transport, it must be able to determine the use to which it puts resources raised from local taxpayers. Local government has become more dependent on central Government finance, and central Government have increasingly taken it upon themselves to direct not only on what will be done, but how it will be done. The trend has gone too far.
<P>
It is an irony that the party now in government fought so hard against much of our centralising legislation during the 1980s when we were trying to get a grip on loony left councils such as Camden, led by the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), who now, stunningly, is one of the Labour party's leading candidates for Mayor of London, having invented the term "loony left".
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford) indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Was it the Minister for Housing and Planning?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No, I did not think that the hon. Gentleman would want to lay claim to that. He is happier that the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras should keep that accolade.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am willing to permit a wide-ranging debate, but I would prefer that it be confined to the context of part II.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Part II is about the true role of local authorities and we start our debate with clause 92, which at the outset puts in train a chain of events that finish with the transport policy of local authorities being determined by the Secretary of State. The fundamental flaw in the Government's policy is that they believe that one man--the Deputy Prime Minister of all people--is capable of making decisions about transport up and down the land that will meet the demands of millions and millions of people who make separate decisions every day.
<P>
It is our contention that unless the plans are voluntary, we shall still be dragged in the wrong direction. The integrated transport policy is a sort of Gosplan. It is a pyramidal command structure that is bound to fail in the year 2000 and beyond, as it did in the 1960s.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): Will my hon. Friend speculate further on what will happen to these large bulky documents? Are they to be sent to the local government office or to the Secretary of State? Who will pore over a plan that says, "Bus No. 26 goes from A to B via C"? Will the Secretary of State be involved in that sort of detail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I can tell the hon. Gentleman that a local transport plan is a voluminous document. There is nothing that officials feel happier doing than writing reports. It is harder to make decisions than to prepare information on which other people make decisions. By preparing voluminous volumes of material--if that is not tautology--millions and millions of pounds are going to be wasted throughout the country. We will be hacking down forests to print all these reports. That is hardly a sustainable transport policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> For an area such as mine, where 97 per cent. of goods are moved by road, a kaleidoscopic number of decisions about freight are taken every day by small businesses and individuals. It is ludicrous and unimaginable that a plan can comprehensively take in line 10, which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"those required for the transportation of freight".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Local authorities should certainly think about the needs of transporters of freight in their area. [Hon. Members: "Ah!"] I do not think that we need to set that in statute to encourage intelligent people to make such decisions. The millions of decisions that are made by millions of ordinary people every day will largely be provided for by markets. I am happy to give way to the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr Snape), who is expert in satisfying companies--he sits on the board of a company and does exactly that in a totally unregulated framework, without any public support. It is a great testament to him that he is such an example of the success of Conservative policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): I thank the hon. Gentleman for his praise, which I can well do without. Returning to local transport plans for the movement of freight, does he not think his constituents might have some sharp words for him if, perhaps, his local authority were not concerned about heavy goods vehicles using their roads and about the widening of those roads for their use? Does he not think that the local authority has a role there?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Of course the authority has a role, but it does not need to be told in a statute that it must think about the matter in a particular way. Constituents may have sharp words, however, about the fact that 550 communities in this country would like a bypass to take the heavy traffic out of their villages. The hon. Member for Shipley has been campaigning for a new road in his constituency and he got it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> And I got it from a Labour Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> He would have got it from us as well. Are we seriously to believe that this Labour Government are going to be better and bigger road builders than their predecessors? The hon. Gentleman is a road builder out of convenience and political expediency--not because of that the fact that 80 per cent. of freight goes by road and 94 per cent. of passenger journeys are made by road in this country. He does not philosophically believe that roads are important, otherwise he would not be sitting on the side of the House that presided over a massive cut in the trunk road and motorway building programme. That cut left those 550 communities stranded without the necessary bypasses and relief roads.
<P>
There will be sharp words too for the Labour party, when people find that this Government are going to give up the veto on the 44-tonne lorries that the European Union wants to send over here. Those are the issues that are exercising my constituents and his--not whether some wretched Government puts in a statute that it should be a statutory plan. What sort of idiots does he think local councillors are? This provision is simply paying lip-service to a failed ideology in transport which this Government were elected to implement--the so-called "integrated transport policy". I would ask Labour Committee members, what is the difference between a transport policy and an integrated transport policy? [Interruption.] Would the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) like to explain the difference? He will not get to his feet.
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward (Watford) rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I will give way to the hon. Lady if she will answer my question.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> The hon. Gentleman appears to be saying, in a message that I can take back to my constituency, that the Conservatives in this House are urging more road-building across green belt land. Is that what he is saying?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If the hon. Lady will look at her own Government's policy, she will see that it includes the Birmingham northern relief road. That is a road scheme that goes through sites of special scientific interest. The Labour party manifesto pledged that a Labour Government would not build roads through sites of special scientific interest and now they are doing just that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Not a lot of green belt in Croydon, but I give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I make this intervention as the former leader of the largest local authority in London, which was the most successful in terms of transport. The difference between a transport policy and an integrated transport policy is that whereas one is the free market, the other is a plan for the most effective network for people. The Coulsden bypass was granted by the Government after Croydon council had been asking for it for 18 years. The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) told my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley that the Conservative Government would have given him his bypass. They would not. The difference here is strategic investment in network efficiency with an overview for integration, not the simple building of lots of motorways in a chaotic market-driven mess.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If the hon. Gentleman believes his own propaganda, I cannot help it. We invested £26 billion over 18 years in the trunk roads and motorway system in this country. The hon. Gentleman believes that that was a market-driven exercise, but it was all done by the state. We had a transport policy. The only difference between an integrated transport policy and a transport policy is that the former is a slogan of little meaning. It is designed to sound good, but it has little effect. This Government's policy has meant massive cuts in the road programme, increases in congestion, increases in delays and costs for business and increases in pollution. The policy has generally failed. The integrated transport policy is now regarded as one of the Government's failures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): Will the hon. Gentleman help the Committee by outlining whether his party still believes in predict and provide as an important tool for transport policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I never understand what is meant by the term "predict and provide". [Hon. Members: "Ah!"] I will answer the hon. Gentleman's question. If it means, as the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East says, that he has to look at his customer's demand and see if he can satisfy it, I am in favour of that. If it means that, where there are bottlenecks in the trunk road system or in the railway network, it is necessary to predict how much traffic there will be and what capacity expansion will be needed to meet that demand, then again I am in favour of predict and provide. What does the hon. Gentleman the Member for Scarborough and Whitby mean by predict and provide?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> I listened very carefully to the hon. Gentleman's introductory remarks about this part of the Bill. I worked in transport for many years before coming to this House. The Bill appears to contain an option whereby local authorities are encouraged to engage with the customers--the users of transport.
<P>
Many pensioners in my constituency who do not benefit from policies expounded by the Government recall that in 1983 a Tory council in Scarborough removed concessionary transport. My pensioners would want to see this--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to make a speech, he must catch my eye. I remind all members of the Committee that interventions must be short. They are interventions, not speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale. You will be delighted to know that we shall come to concessionary transport schemes later in the Bill. I understand the enthusiasm of the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby for changing the subject, but the customers of local government are the people who elect councils. The clause makes the Government the customer of local authorities. It is the Government who demand that a transport plan be constructed. It is the Government who pay the local authority, whether they like that plan or not. There was a problem in railways because the British Railways Board had one customer--the Government--and spent most of its time working out how to get its subsidy out of them. It hardly talked about the passengers, but today that has been transformed.
<P>
The same has happened in the bus industry, which the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East represents. He spends time in board meetings trying to satisfy the demands of passengers, not working out how to get greater subsidy. The process of drawing up local transport plans will direct the attention of councillors and council chief executives to the Government instead of to their electors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): I shall be able to make my points quickly because the hon. Gentleman knows the area I shall be talking about. Under his policy, my constituents could not get from Harwich to Clacton--a distance of about 15 miles, which should take about 30 minutes. They would have to go by train to Colchester and then to Clacton, which would take them two hours. Under this Government, we can travel from one end of the constituency to the other by a service that covers seven villages. Will he note that improvement for my constituents and also for his, since there are now services from Manningtree through to Clacton?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is referring to the Harwich to Clacton bus, a scheme that has been promoted by the rural bus partnership. He is nodding with pride.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> Yes--80,000 passengers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The figures that I have were given to me by Essex county council recently, although they date back to August. I do not have any more recent figures, but if the hon. Gentleman has, I shall be delighted to look at them. The grant spent on the service was £297,000; the number of passengers was 23,500; the grant per passenger was £12.61. I question whether that amount, which would probably have paid for a taxi for each passenger, is efficient use of transport money. The grant is not available for keeping open existing bus services, or for community transport schemes. The hon. Gentleman will know that in Clacton the extremely good Tendring community transport scheme is crying out for additional grant from the local authority. It has a tiny amount of money; think what it could deliver for the local community if only it had £297,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> I can tell the hon. Gentleman what the figures were because the county council and some of the constituents wrote congratulating the Government on the initiative. There were 86,000 passengers from the time we set the service going and before that people in those villages had no service. Would the hon. Gentleman cut a service that we waited 10 years to put in place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I would not dream of dictating to Essex county council how to spend its money. The hon. Gentleman knows about Tendring community transport and how desperate it is for money. It does not get the bus fuel duty rebate; it does not receive a fraction of the £1.1 million that has been allocated to new bus services in the area. The hon. Gentleman should ask those involved in the project what they think about the money that is being spent on community bus services. The Harwich to Clacton bus service receives the smallest subsidy of all the services promoted by the scheme in Essex. The subsidies range from £11.44 per passenger up to--wait for it--the Dengie village link at £146 per passenger journey. Is that really an efficient use of resources? It is the result of the restrictions that the Government attach to the money. They believe that when they give money to local authorities they--the Government--should determine how and where it is to be spent, instead of allowing local councils to decide. That is the process in the Bill.
<P>
We all know that the rural bus partnership fund has been a propaganda exercise, but I obtained these figures from the county council. Unless the hon. Gentleman can provide chapter and verse from the county council, I  shall not take his figures seriously. He needs to justify why £11.44 per passenger is good value. When it comes to the best value assessment of the bus services, I wonder what the district auditor will have to say.
<P>
The fundamental point is whether we can expect Ministers and bureaucrats to organise the daily transport of millions of people throughout the country, or is that to be dealt with by businesses responding to customers in a liberalising framework?
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If I may first deal with this point. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Geraint Davies) tried to distinguish an integrated transport policy from a transport policy. A Government transport policy is about providing a framework, not trying to allocate pound after pound through local authorities to specific tasks. It is about letting people make their own decisions and creating a framework in which business and local authorities can make those decisions, giving local authorities that freedom, with the Government ultimately providing for the investment. We all know that the Government are putting less into local transport plans than at any time since local transport grants were invented. We need a commitment from them that they will provide the resources in a liberalising framework, not set out in statute what should be compulsorily included in a ridiculous document, which any decent local authority would be minded to produce anyway. The amendment makes local transport plans voluntary. I give way to the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman had forgotten about me. I should have been most hurt had he done so. He appears to be saying that the transport plans should be handed over to businesses, which would be interested in creaming off the profitable routes within an area, not in providing the necessary services, particularly in rural communities that do not necessarily provide high profits for those bus companies. Is that what the hon. Gentleman means when he says that it is a matter for businesses and a liberalising market?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady was not listening. I said that it was a matter for businesses and for councils. In the present framework for bus transport, councils play a significant role. They can subsidise and contract services that are not viable. However, councils--particularly those in rural areas--are learning that they can transport far more people far more flexibly through non-scheduled services and special services such as dial-a-ride and community transport schemes. Scheduled services are appropriate where there are large numbers of people to move around. I hand it to the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Ivan Henderson). The Clacton to Harwich bus may reach that viability. However, bus services in rural areas are targeted at people who do not have access to cars--people whom we describe as mobility impaired. They are not disabled or infirm--they may be single mums without cars or married couples with only one car, which is taken away during the day by the person doing a job, thus leaving mum at home with the children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Where the market does not supply a solution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right--where the market does not supply. I take great comfort from the speech given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer earlier this week in which he implied that the Government are trying to do too much and that the voluntary services should be encouraged to do more. That is what community transport and dial-a-ride services are about.
<P>
Let us have a mature debate. We want to enable local authorities to get maximum bangs for their bucks and that will not be achieved. The hon. Member for Watford (Ms Ward) does not appear to understand my metaphor. I mean that we want them to get best value for money--it is a new Labour expression. A framework laid down by the Secretary of State will not be the best way to enable local authorities to achieve best value for money. They need the freedom to spend the money how they best think fit for their area. The amendments will change those impositions into voluntary options.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) asked on several occasions what was the difference between an integrated transport policy and a transport policy. The answer lies within the very question of "may" or "must". An integrated transport policy is one that is joint between authorities--it is co-ordinated and shared between authorities. The hon. Gentleman's opt-in, opt-out philosophy could only lead to chaos. There would be no co-ordination between local authorities to enable people to move from A to B between them, for example in Aylesbury and within Buckinghamshire, which the hon. Gentleman gave as an example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I should imagine that Stalin used exactly the same logic to collectivise the farms in the Soviet Union in the 1920s. The hon. Gentleman's philosophy is based on the idea that people are incapable of making rational decisions unless they are instructed to do so by the Secretary of State. He is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Absolutely not. It is not about people being capable. It is about whether they see that they have responsibility outside their own environment for the movement of traffic within their area. The world does not end at the border of anyone's local authority; there has to be a joint and co-ordinated approach between authorities.
<P>
In speaking against the amendment, I ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to go even further than the Bill. There are gaps and discrepancies in lines 14 to 20 of clause 92. The clause outlines those authorities that would be asked to make a contribution and put forward transport plans. Northampton, Oxford and Norwich, are large cities with no unitary authority. Northampton is a city with a population of 200,000. If Northamptonshire county council, under the amendment, decided not to put forward a plan, where would that leave the people in Northampton who are crying out for a co-ordinated transport policy for the town? Where would the people of Norwich be if Norfolk county council decided to do the same, or the people of Oxford if they were left with no co-ordinated transport plan?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> A great many of the people in Norfolk want to travel into Norwich, and therefore Norfolk would not be serving its own population if it did not provide a co-ordinated transport plan. [Hon. Members: "No."] That happens because electors want it. They do not need to be told to do it by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that the authority would not be serving its constituents. If it is not serving them, the Government have a role to say that a duty must be imposed in statute to provide that service. Or, is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that local authorities should decide whether they do or do not want to do it, and if they do not that is fine--then, they can just reject that duty?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being extraordinarily obtuse. Local authorities are elected to serve their local populations, who want co-ordinated transport policies. Unless local authorities produce reasonably co-ordinated transport policies, which they can easily do by co-operating with one another, the system will break down and they will be unpopular. That is how local politics works. The Labour party is doing away with local democracy in transport. Decisions will be imposed by the Secretary of State. If the Conservative Government had introduced this plan--they never did--the Labour party would have been up in arms about taking powers away from passenger transport authorities and local authorities controlled by it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The opportunity for a co-ordinated transport policy in the city of Northampton is an imposition with which I can live. Even in clause 92, the Bill does not go far enough. It says only that county councils, where they are the transport authority area, must co-ordinate with district councils. Where the district councils are major areas of traffic movement within a county, the Bill ought to enable them to introduce their own transport plans, rather than rely on a secondary local authority, which, under the amendment, may or may not choose to put a plan together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> Was not the reason why we need the policy demonstrated by the hon. Member for North Essex, who said that if the subsidy was too expensive, everyone could be jumping into taxis rather than onto buses? Instead of one bus, he could have 20 taxis with one person in each going through his village.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I found the comments of the hon. Member for North Essex extraordinary. He suggested that certain rural transport schemes in the Essex constituency were not worth the subsidy and that taxis should be used. What would be the difference between the cost of taxi fares for constituents and that for a bus service that is well used--as we have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was pointing out that for the price of the subsidy per passenger it would be possible to pay for a taxi for each of them. The advantage of that for passengers would be that they could travel when they wanted instead of having to fit in with the rather sparse bus services.
<P>
The question is how to use the money in local transport most effectively for those who most need it. I am not advocating a taxi service; I am merely drawing a comparison. The hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Clarke) should decide whether all the rural bus services in his county are great value for money or simply propaganda for the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Of course they are not. The hon. Gentleman does not need any help from me in contradicting himself over what he is or is not proposing. The Committee clearly heard him say that a subsidy for a rural transport service was not acceptable and make alternative proposals for taxi services.
<P>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister consider whether local authorities such as Northampton, Norwich and Oxford ought to have the opportunity to make their own transport plans? Will he therefore ignore the amendment that replaces "must" with "may" and retain "must", but also allow other local authorities that desperately need transport plans to make them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> As I was listening to the debate, not least the speech by the hon. Member for North Essex, I wondered whether or not in any future edition of Erskine May the Gale rules of debate were likely to feature.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we go any further down that road, the Committee is well aware that the Chairman observes the standard rules of debate and always will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I abide by that ruling. I would merely have reflected upon whether you would have been prepared to vote for them yourself, Mr. Gale, bearing in mind the hornet's nest you have stirred up. You have given members of the Committee your authority to range widely over all aspects of part II of the Bill. My pronunciation is not as good as that of the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), but you have enabled us to take a tour d'horizon of part II.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It will no doubt please you, Mr. Gale, to know that I do not intend to range quite so widely. The Committee will have noted that the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) has moved up the Bench. He is now at the top of the Bench and it is clear to us all that it is he who will be taking the lead role on this issue. He has been passionate about buses for a long time and he has been waiting desperately for us to get to part II of the Bill. He will acknowledge that, when we dealt with National Air Traffic Services in part I, there were times when he was struggling. I am confident, however, that he will have spent the whole weekend with a wet towel over his head going through part II. He is ready, anxious keen and enthusiastic to give us the benefit of the experience that he had with the wet blanket over the weekend.
<P>
I want to make some comments on the speech made by the hon. Member for North Essex and make some suggestions in relation solely to local transport plans. I think that some improvements can be made to the first group of amendments. The hon. Gentleman said something worthy of repetition when he pointed out that concern about local transport was all well and good, but it was important that there should be the resources to back it up. The Labour Government are spending less per year than the Conservative Administration spent. By next year, according to the Government's own projections, they will be spending £270 million less per year than the Conservative Administration. The point made by the hon. Member for North Essex was reminiscent of analogies with pots and kettles. He was right to point out the attempt by the Conservative Government to get to grips with "loony left" councils, 597 598 but surely he acknowledges that the Labour Government's move towards centralisation is for similar reasons. They are still trying to achieve that goal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman should be fair and acknowledge that we have looked at our past and that the Conservative party is changing on this issue. The independence of local authorities is important. We do not wish to continue the process of the past 20 or 30 years, or go back to the days of the previous Labour Government, when much power and independence were taken from local authorities. We need to look at the fundamental structure and finance of local government and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman wants to engage constructively in that debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Certainly. I am delighted to hear yet another example of the change of heart of the Labour Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Old habits die hard--Conservative Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am sorry--Conservative Opposition. There is an element of expediency in some of what the hon. Gentleman says. He is critical of central Government imposing decisions on local government. Yet, only a few years ago I was delighted to receive the support of not only the then Labour Opposition but the Conservative Government for my proposals in the Road Traffic (Reduction) Act 1997. That Act, supported by the Conservatives in Government, placed the first set of requirements on local authorities to develop local transport plans with the principal purpose of reducing road traffic in their area. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not now suggesting that that should be changed. The hon. Member raises an important point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It was very much enabling legislation to allow local authorities to set targets. It did not impose targets on local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am sure that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Gale, if I reminded the hon. Gentleman of the details of the Road Traffic (Reduction) Act 1997. However, if he looks at it again he will see that he is right. Local councils were required to set their own targets. Nevertheless, the plans that they have to produce as a result of that Act require them to demonstrate how those plans will lead to a reduction in traffic in their area, although I acknowledge that the level of reduction is for them to determine and is not decided centrally.
<P>
The allegedly obtuse hon. Member for Northampton, South and the hon. Member for Croydon, Central raised the important issue of integration. We hope that during discussions on this part of the Bill there will be an opportunity to table amendments to ensure that greater integration is included in local councils' plans. It seems important to us that the plans should demonstrate that they will lead to greater integration over a five-year period. We have drafted amendments to that effect.
<P>
We have also made it clear that evidence will have to be produced to demonstrate whether that integration has taken place. Operators will have to make available significant statistical information to make it possible to make such judgments. It will be important that that information is provided in a timely fashion and so on, and we have tabled amendments on that.
<P>
There is a much more fundamental issue in relation to integration. We touched on it when the hon. Member for Croydon, Central rightly made the distinction between an integrated transport plan and one that is not. He used the phrase "market-driven mess". I might not use the same language, but there is a clear distinction between a purely competitive approach and one that has a level of co-operation and consensus as its basis. I am sure that he agrees with that.
<P>
In relation to that need for integration, one of the most significant matters that the Committee will have to address is not in the Bill or in any amendments tabled by Government Members. We have made a modest attempt to table suitable amendments in relation to the Competition Act 1998. The implications of that Act create clear problems in developing an integrated transport plan for an area. I am sure that all members of the Committee have come across many examples. I shall give one to illustrate my point.
<P>
In Norfolk, two companies--Sanders Coaches and First Eastern Counties Bus Company--told the local council that they no longer wanted to be in a position in which one was trying to jump ahead of the other to grab passengers. They wanted to work together to meet the requirements of the passengers in an integrated way in cooperation with the council. They agreed that one company would visit stops, say, on the hour and the other on the half hour. The minute that they did that, the Office of Fair Trading said that they were in breach of the Competition Act. The possibility of developing an integrated, coordinated approach was denied as a result of the  implications of that Act. As we develop the arguments on local transport plans in this part of the Bill, I hope that we shall find a solution to that problem.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a valid point. It may not be the legislative framework that is at fault; we should question whether the judgment of the competition authority is rational. Clearly, operators and providers across the whole gamut of transport are co-operating to deliver customers to one another and to cover timetables together. That is how integration occurs naturally through market forces. The framework of a transport policy has to encourage that. Competition does not necessarily mean that people are all trying to cut one another's throats. On the contrary, it means that a liberalised system can allow a variety of transport operators to co-operate constructively together. That is what the framework should be about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I suspect that all Committee members wish to find the best way to solve some of the problems. We are acknowledging that those problems exist. I could give many other examples. Two different companies chose to use identical liveries on their vehicles on the same route to make it easier for passengers. That, too, was prevented. We need to find an appropriate way forward and I hope that, before long, the Government will make a clear statement on this issue. When the Under-Secretary responds to the debate, will he tell the Committee in which direction the Government intend to go in this regard?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that London is a good example of where integration is clearly necessary? If one local authority opts out of congestion charging and another introduces it, there will be enormous displacement and chaos across the capital, which shows that the Opposition's proposition that the code can be voluntary is, frankly, ludicrous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because he enables me to move on to another deficiency in the proposals. The hon. Member rightly points out that transport matters are not confined to any one special local authority area. There are knock-on implications. That applies not only to congestion charging but to all other aspects of transport. That is why we have tabled a number of amendments that will add a regional dimension to the development of local transport plans and will enable regional assessment of those plans.
<P>
Integration is critical in all of this. We would like to amend the Bill to bring in other modes of transport. The hon. Member for North Essex rightly mentions community transport and dial-a-ride. Many other forms of transport need to be integrated and we are supportive of amendments tabled by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that will require a reference to be made to other modes of transport in the Bill.
<P>
It is vital that we should consider other aspects of transport, including freight. I am concerned that there is insufficient reference to freight in the Bill, particularly to freight interchange. There is no reference to how freight interchange will work or to the need for local authorities to look for appropriate sites for it to take place. Many councils are paying a good deal of lip service to a desire to have more freight on the railways, rather than lorries, but little is being done to ensure that local councils consider where the freight interchanges will be.
<P>
Some Committee members will already be aware that I am concerned about some of the activities of tour bus operators, in particular the practice of buses travelling around empty at times when no tourists are around to avail themselves of their services. That will become a significant issue as we move through part II of the Bill, but I shall not draw attention to it now.
<P>
11.30 am
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex rightly expressed concern about the degree of bureaucracy surrounding the requirement for local transport plans and the procedures for vetting them. I hope that members of the Committee and others will have an opportunity to comment on the current guidance notes issued to local councils on local transport plans and to look at the way in which they are vetted. The hon. Member for North Essex said that civil servants love nothing more than writing detailed reports. If he, like me, has looked at the responses to the current round of transport plans submitted by local authorities, he will know that he was right. A number of local transport plans have been sent to me and I am surprised--amazed--by the way in which this matter is now handled. I hope that the Minister will take a personal interest in the working of the procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Would it be good discipline to ask local authorities to submit their local transport plans on two sides of an A4 sheet?
<P>
<B> Mr. Foster:</B> The problem with that in my experience is that it would not necessarily reduce the total number of pages submitted because the appendices would stretch for many miles. The hon. Gentleman will have to rethink the amendment in more detail than that.
<P>
At present, when analysing the plans, the Department has 28 tables of points for which it has to look. A detailed report is then written on each one. Some of the comments will be remarkably familiar to all members of the Committee. They read like school reports, listing different subjects beside which are comments such as, "Johnny must do better". Some examples are bizarre. For instance, one local authority was criticised for not making enough use of waterways in its area. The council concerned had considered doing so for some time, but concluded for a variety of technical and environmental reasons that it was impractical. It believes that officials in the Department simply looked at a map and saw a lot of blue lines stretching throughout the area. The Department now requires the authority to go to a great deal of expense to demonstrate why it, with its local knowledge, is right.
<P>
Another local authority was surprised that when it read the table that deals with action on climate change, its strategy had been found weak, yet data from the same local authority for buses, rail and walking were deemed to be good. The authority is at a loss to understand why, when it has covered all modes of transport and been given high marks for that, overall its action on climate change should be deemed weak.
<P>
Another local authority found the Department behind the times. One of the requirements is to ensure that the plan contains adequate policies for social inclusion and disability. It has long been accepted by all Members of Parliament, for example in our debates on the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, that we do not deal with disability issues separately. It is an issue that should be dealt with in every aspect of our activities. The local authority in question said in its plan that that is what it intended to do. In each aspect of the plan it referred to what it would do about social inclusion and disability, yet it was criticised in the report for having scattered the subjects throughout the document. That is out of touch with modern thinking and I could give many other examples.
<P>
As I said, the language that is used is often like that in a school report, with comments such as, "The whole LTP would benefit from a more analytical review of current passenger facilities", and so it goes on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is depressing that good public servants are being paid to write such stuff. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that rather than central Government trying to second guess the detail of local government transport plans in this way, the money would be better spent on providing local transport for local people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Liberal Democrats welcome the broad thrust of the Government's proposals on local transport plans and on quality partnerships and contracts, 601 602 to which we shall come later. However, we are concerned that the level of bureaucracy will do more harm than good and the Government should look at that again, not least at the guidance notes to local councils on these issues.
<P>
The amendments have an underlying philosophy, which has been made clear by the hon. Member for North Essex, but we cannot support them because it is important that local councils are required to consider how they can best improve and integrate public transport in their area. The broad principle of the Government's proposals is right and we shall support that, subject to our receiving the assurances to which I have referred and to the Government being able to reduce the level of bureaucracy and to accept at least in principle, a number of the amendments that we shall table.
<P>
The case of the hon. Member for North Essex would be a strong one if he could demonstrate that local councils share his view and oppose this part of the Bill. There is no clear evidence that local councils oppose the way forward, in principle, although some local councils--I suspect the vast majority--are concerned about some of the details.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): We have had such a wide-ranging debate partly because of the masterful drafting of the amendments. When one starts talking about local transport plans, one can cover almost anything and we have just about done so. Nevertheless, at the start of this part of the Bill it is useful to go over this ground because it needs to be brought out. Local government has moved on from transport policy plans to local transport plans.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex pointed out the cost in Buckinghamshire. Throughout the country, one is talking about perhaps £50 million or £60 million, which is a lot of money. Although Governments always say that this will be taken into account when the standard spending assessment and the revenue support grant are given, it is a substantial cost for local government.
<P>
We also know that it is difficult for local government to recruit suitable people in this field, for example transport engineers. People in local government will go to a considerable amount of time and effort to produce these plans. It is important to debate the costs that will fall on local authorities and council tax payers. It is also important to try and understand the relationship between central Government and local government in this context.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) started to make some good points on the criteria set by Governments. Most of us understand that the Government would have to set an overall context and, perhaps, have a touch on the tiller to ensure some sort of national and regional outlook. Nevertheless, it is also possible--particularly with the way local transport plans have been set up--for Government to start to become too prescriptive and interfering in local government. Local government then spends its time dealing with a Government agenda that may have precious little to do with dealing with the problems in their local communities in Bath, Poole, North Essex or wherever. The hon. Member for Bath clearly brought out the absurdity of the way in which these particular systems are judged.
<P>
We have to provide for a balance between the transport policy that it is legitimate for national Government to set and the policy that it is legitimate for local government to determine in the light of local priorities. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central asked what would happen if two local authorities had different policies. Well, we do have local government and people in different parts of the country do have different policies. One cannot go to absurd lengths in that context but, nevertheless, it is possible to have two local authorities with different political control, different priorities, perhaps with different problems, that may see things rather differently. If, from the top, the Government insist on solutions--the solution of either one local government or of the other--it is being too prescriptive and over-ruling local people, who may be making the best decisions because they have the most experience.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. We will see how the statutory provisions for concessionary transport schemes are more restrictive than those in my local authority area in terms of the local authorities that co-operate in the schemes. By laying down a statutory framework from on high--which is what these local transport plans are about--we are cramping the style of local government. We should not be doing that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> My hon. Friend is right. However, we are starting off without even the statutory basis for these plans. We had voluntary local transport plans this year and we already have 28 tables. That is the starting point for Government. Before we know it, other indicators will be put on top of those. If we are not careful, these big tomes--I have seen the local transport plans from this year, will grow. With these plans, in theory, everyone has a say. The reality, however, is that the bigger and the more complex the plan, the more it plays into the hands of large corporations and bodies who can afford the lawyers and advisers to go to all the public consultations and inquiries to put their view. We see that with the structure plans. The barristers and some of the larger house builders go and ensure that their interests are looked after. Ordinary members of the public sometimes find themselves floundering in the process.
<P>
Although on the face of it the plans and so forth sound good, the reality is that the vast bureaucracy will tend to grow. The large coach or rail groups and transport organisations will get used to dealing with this particular bureaucracy and inputting, whereas some of the smaller communities will have great difficulty with it. I am fearful of the future with this form of planning. We may end up with a lot of people in local authorities producing plans basically because they are trying to second guess what the Government want to read. These people--transport managers and so forth--who should be looking at local problems, are spending their time in the office involved in this process. We will end up with a lot of people in the DETR reading these plans, marking them and producing them for the Ministers. Then there will no doubt be a lot of debates in the Palace of Westminster about the success of the plans. The reality, however, is whether that will filter down to mean better transport systems for people at bus stops or in local communities. I am not convinced of that.
<P>
There are problems here and this debate is meant to bring these out. Even if plans are put on a statutory basis, it would be better to have a simpler process and leave a lot more latitude for local people. This is one area where there is some innovation and people can be radical at local level when considering solutions. If we take too prescriptive an attitude and try to measure local government against what the White Paper is to do, then we will let ourselves down. We ought to have more trust in local government. Sometimes people jeer, but the Conservative party has thought again about its attitude towards local government. We much prefer it--in fact we love it--than potential regional government. By and large, local authorities are pretty good with these issues because most transport problems are local. Most local councillors who deal with them face the same transport problems: lack of buses, car congestion, and so forth. Under the Bill, Whitehall will be trying to second-guess what goes on in communities throughout the country.
<P>
11.45 am
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that perhaps one of the problems is that Government have become obsessed with targets in recent years. The Labour Government came in with five pledge-card targets. In their last annual report, they said that they had 600 targets. My research shows that it is more than 6,000 targets across Government. We are getting to the point where the only things that we assess are the easily measurable. Improvements in public transport, schools and so on are not easily measurable in the way that these reports require.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises my last point. As these plans have to last for five years with modest updating on an annual basis, if one sets out 28 criteria and makes judgements, at some point it is necessary to measure how successful they are. All of us know that it is terribly difficult to measure outcomes with transport. In Australia, they have done a number of performance indicators in this area, but it is early days for judging their accuracy and significance and the impact on transport and vehicles. The way in which these things are measured, therefore, will be critical.
<P>
My final point is that we need a transparent system. The hon. Member for Bath made a good point. The Government issue guidance. How the Government grade plans needs to be in the public arena because those people producing the plans need to know what targets they are to meet. Money is dependent on this to some extent, so local authorities would feel aggrieved if they were graded at low level, given only small grants and then not advised why this was so. We need a transparent structure. If the Government are setting an agenda for local government, then it ought to be perfectly clear that that is so. It ought to be clear that if Government are giving money, it is for the Government's priorities. These may not necessarily be those of the local authority. I am a little fearful of that and I look forward to what the Minister has to say.
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): Perhaps I should say at the outset that, in a voluntary aspect, I am a member of the RAC's public policy committee. As I am sure hon. Members know, the RAC has done much research into various aspects of how this Bill will affect the motorist. Clearly, it very much welcomes the steps taken by the Government to do something about congestion. As the RAC has said, it would ultimately be anti-car if congestion was not tackled and it is, therefore supportive of the Government's intentions. The RAC obviously has a great deal of interest in this part of the Bill. Also, in my own constituency--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Does the hon. Lady agree that the RAC is among many organisations that lament the Government's cuts in the roads programme? It believes that one of the ways to cut congestion and pollution is to restore some of the schemes that the Government cut from the roads programme so that the traffic can get moving again.
<P>
<B>Ms Winterton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a little mistaken. The RAC has said that it welcomes the concentration on improving road maintenance. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the comments made by the RAC last week about the announcements on by-passes, he will see that it believes that the Government are on the right track. One of its great concerns was the previous Government's neglect of the existing road network.
<P>
Forty per cent. of people in my constituency do not have access to a car, so I am also concerned to ensure that steps are taken to improve the public transport system. The Bill is a great step forward after years of neglect by the previous Government.
<P>
Some Committee Members have talked about local transport plans and how we can assess the success or otherwise of plans. It is important for every relevant authority to put forward such plans. That is so important. If we are to get true integration and be able to make real improvements, we need to be able to see through the transparency of those plans how to do it.
<P>
In drawing up those plans, it is important that all people who will benefit are consulted. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that in the guidance that will be issued to local authorities the interests of motorists will be taken into account. The RAC has offered to work with the Government to look at transport plans and to do some evaluation, as the hon. Member for North Essex has suggested. I hope that the Minister will look favourably upon that offer. There is no doubt that we can all learn from what works in different areas of the country. Best practice will be important in ensuring that we encourage other local authorities to take innovative steps when drawing up transport plans for the future. It is important to ensure that that consultation is right and that we are able to pass best practic on from one local authority to another.
<P>
With my background in South Yorkshire, I am interested in the suggested improvements in the bus industry. The section on buses shows the importance of ensuring that there is consultation there, too. My slight concern is that part of the Bill places a fair amount of emphasis on consultation the same is not true of the 605 606 previous part. However, I realise that we may well be given assurances about how guidance can ensure that consultation takes place.
<P>
The South Yorkshire passenger transport executive, the local authority and the bus operators have already entered into partnership agreements in my area. There is no doubt that it was widely welcomed in the area by all concerned, including people who for too long have been left stranded and isolated without proper bus services. I welcome all the steps that are set out to encourage more partnerships throughout the country and I hope that the Minister will be able to give some assurance that the agreements reached through the strategic partnerships will be able to continue and that, where they wish to do so, local authorities and bus operators will be able to reach agreement about the frequency and timing of services. That may not be on the face of the Bill, but I hope that that will be permitted in the agreements that can still be drawn up in such partnerships. I also welcome the ability for local authorities to move towards quality contracts if that is felt most appropriate for an area, and I hope that the clause will not be too restrictive in that regard.
<P>
On the amendments, it is essential for local transport plans to be drawn up by local authorities, to be consulted upon widely and regularly reviewed. It is important to have flexibility, but the idea that the matter can be left to the whim of one local authority and that the overall transport position will thereby be improved is wrong. I hope that the Minister will take that into account when considering the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Snape:</B> May I start by making a detailed declaration of interest, as I said I would do before we reached this part of the Bill? Members of the Committee will be aware--because the hon. Member for North Essex and his colleagues have reminded them from time to time, and I make no complaints about that--that I chair a major bus company, Travel West Midlands, which is part of the National Express group, itself a major provider of bus and rail services throughout the United Kingdom. I also serve on the board of various subsidiary companies exclusively to do with the bus industry. For some reason best known to themselves, despite my long railway experience and my membership of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, they keep my activities exclusively directed at bus provision rather than railways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I emphasise that we make no complaint about it either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am grateful at least for that. It may be the only time that harmony prevails this morning. I have listened to the debate with interest. I can never understand the Conservative party. I realise that it is the duty of the Opposition to oppose, but I do not know what they are getting at so far as the amendment is concerned. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for North Essex, in the confusing speech that he made earlier this morning, knew exactly what he was getting at or what the purpose of public transport plans is.
<P>
It is about 26 years since I served on a local authority. In those long-ago days, with about 6 to 7 million cars on the roads, all parties on the passenger transport authority to which I was nominated and on which I served in the Manchester area were anxious to put forward a plan because we felt--again across party lines--that a local transport plan from the passenger transport authority was a sensible way forward. I stress that certain of the constituent councils of that authority at the time were Conservative controlled and others were Labour controlled, but there was a consensus then that planning was essential. Even with 6 to 7 million cars on our roads, it may be difficult to avoid gridlock in future.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex spent time regaling the Committee with stories about Gosplan and the Soviet communist party--all sorts of inferences that our proposals were terribly bureaucratic and that we were trying to dictate what local authorities should do for transport in their particular areas.
<P>
In common with other members of the Committee, I yesterday received a letter and accompanying briefing from the British Chambers of Commerce. That Organisation is as entitled as any other to have its views heard in Committee. I doubt whether even the hon. Member for North Essex would regard it as a left-wing organisation that has allied with the Labour party, in government or in opposition. Yet it supports the Government's objectives in these clauses, even if the hon. Member for North Essex does not. I shall return to the Conservative viewpoint shortly.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
When we embarked, seemingly years ago, on our first sitting, we were honoured by the presence of the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo), who was subsequently elevated to greater heights. We wish him the best in his new role and responsibilities. Before the Committee started, the right hon. Gentleman was summoned by the Conservative Whips Office and given specific and succinct instructions: "Don't embarrass Bernard". The hon. Member for North Essex, to whom that comment applied, has done his best to outflank the right hon. Gentleman from the right--it would be unkind to say the loony right--on every amendment before the Committee.
<P>
So determined was, and is, the hon. Member for North Essex not to be seen as slipping from the rightward drift of the present Conservative party that any sensible proposals--sensible at least in our and the Liberal Democrat party's eyes--must be denounced in the sort of terms employed by the hon. Gentleman this morning. Hence we have heard about Gosplan, planning gone mad and all the rest of his clichæs. The hon. Member for Poole, who shares responsibilities with the hon. Gentleman, did his customary best to put forward a reasoned case against the clause and in favour of the Conservative amendment, which would make the statutory requirements optional.
<P>
Let us return to the British Chambers of Commerce, whose brief was received by members of the Committee this week. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Bill places a duty on local transport authorities...to produce local transport plans to meet the needs of both people and freight. These must incorporate bus strategies"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we are all agreed so far. A column opposite provides the BCC view:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The BCC welcomes local transport plans being placed on a statutory footing for the first time and is particularly pleased that they place a duty to provide for the transportation of freight as well as passengers."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was once, perhaps legitimately, argued that the views of British business coincided with those of the Conservative party. So far to the loony right has the Conservative party drifted in recent times that it is now opposed to the views of British business, which publicly endorses the Bill, supports the clauses before us and implicitly rejects the amendment proposed--not at all ably, if it is not too unkind to say so--by the hon. Member for North Essex.
<P>
I do not wish to intervene in the private grief of the Conservative party--[Hon. Members: "Go on!"] No, my hon. Friends will not tempt me at this time on a Tuesday morning. I just think that it is a great pity that the country is so ill served by the current Opposition that even British business has to distance itself from the Tory party, particularly from the "Loony Tune" views expounded, inadequately in my view, by the hon. Member for North Essex this morning.
<P>
I shall leave the hon. Gentleman to consider whether the Committee deserves better than we have heard so far. We want to hear a detailed critique or perhaps some alternative which is not, "Tear it up all because it is dominated by one communist party or another". We need a reasonable alternative if we are to avoid gridlock throughout the United Kingdom, and that alternative is what the Government hope to achieve by these provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman completes his remarks, I wonder whether, given his wide experience of the bus industry, he might like to comment on the impact of the Competition Act 1998. Does he share my concern that that Act, which comes into effect on 1 March, could have a deleterious impact on some of the current voluntary agreements and quality partnerships?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman might like to comment on that, but he is not going to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> There is not much that I can say in response to that, Mr. Gale. I am sure that we will deal with those issues at other points in the Bill.
<P>
I was intrigued that the hon. Member for Bath felt--he implied this rather than saying so bluntly--that the Government's proposals were somehow bureaucratic. Everyone of the amendments of the hon. Members for Bath and for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) that I have seen would add to bureaucracy so far as the operation of bus services--I shall stick to this group of clauses--is concerned. Still, the hon. Member for Bath is always entertaining and usually a bit more relevant than the hon. Member for North Essex. He is also a bit more humorous. I wait with great interest to see whether the bureaucracy that he envisages the Government creating in these clauses would somehow be reduced by the additional burdens that he would place on local authorities and, in some cases, bus companies through the changes that he and his party would make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman none the less agree that, although I have been critical of the bureaucracy that the proposals involve, I have nevertheless supported the principle? Does he not find it slightly odd that the hon. Member for North Essex, who is totally opposed to the proposals, has also tabled a giant string of amendments that would add far more significantly to the bureaucracy about which he himself complained?
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I do not want to sound as though I am picking on the hon. Member for North Essex. As a former railwayman, I would prefer to pick on someone my own size and I do not think that singling out the hon. Gentleman is a particularly fruitful way of advancing our discussions. However, many of the things that he has said so far, particularly this morning, have been so obviously contradictory that we must let him work out whether he is for or anti bureaucracy during our debates.
<P>
I have twice referred to the hon. Member for North Essex as an intellectual gadfly, so I must not do so again. I have no doubt that he will come up with some other, pretty lightweight reason to justify his proposals, but I understand his dilemma: he must prove that he is just as right wing as the rest of the gang who are running the Conservative party. None of us envy him in that. I notice that his hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray), who has returned from the far east--we welcome him back--seemed to take exception to that view. He was Gordon the pompous locomotive when he disappeared down the sidings a fortnight ago; let us hope that the invigorating air of Australia--[Hon. Members: "And Singapore"]--and Singapore has brought him back to reality. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reject the Conservative amendment, which makes no more sense than most of those that the Conservatives have moved in the absence of the hon. Member for North Wiltshire in the past couple of weeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, I have just returned from Adelaide, where I had discussions with several people who were reminiscing about his visit there to investigate transport matters this time last year.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I suppose that I made a rod for my own back. I said that I was prepared to tolerate a wide-ranging debate. I am not prepared to tolerate a magical mystery tour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> What a sound lot they are in Adelaide, remembering my wise words of a year ago. They probably remember them better than I can, given the hospitality that we enjoyed on that trip. I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Wiltshire for pointing that out.
<P>
The clause is necessary. We have made a reasonable start with the contributions of Labour Members. I listened with interest to the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Rosie Winterton) and the RAC, which occasionally says something with which even I can agree. I regret that all too often the RAC as a whole--not the group of which she is a member--seems to be regarded as part of the road lobby rather than as an organisation that is interested in transport in general. I am sure that her influence, which is 609 610 now being brought to bear on its policy committee, will change that. Labour Members welcome the support that she and the RAC have shown for this eminently sensible clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I shall speak briefly against amendments Nos. 11, 13 and 16. Local transport plans should be set in the wider strategic context of the Bill and our objective of a sustainable environment and economy. An integrated plan should be integrated nationally and locally. The idea of opting out is inconsistent with the framework of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex said that it was awful that Buckinghamshire should have to spend at least £100,000 on its plan, but in the next breath he said that Buckinghamshire would have a plan anyway. To say that a local authority with a budget of £250 million and, for highways and transportation, tens of millions of pounds, should not have a coherent plan that fits in with a wider London and national arena would be ludicrous and a complete waste of money, because of the chaos that would ensue. It is a red herring to say that extra cost will be involved. It is important that local authorities invest in the cost. The philosophical proposition that we need a liberalising framework that allows voluntary in out, shake it all about and that the spontaneous combustion of the marketplace would deliver anything but a pig's breakfast of congestion is characteristically ludicrous.
<P>
Under the strategic framework, using London as an easy example, bus lanes will cross borough boundaries. It stands to reason that people using bus lanes or red routes from, for example, Croydon to Lambeth should not experience discontinuity in bus lanes or approaches. A coherent approach to congestion charges is necessary to avoid the disruptive behaviour of the marketplace, whereby motorists try to find the cheapest route and, end up in gridlock. That would not be in the interests of the capital's economy. Lower speed zones may cross borough boundaries arbitrarily, especially in London. The general health and environmental and economic vitality of the capital needs coherence and would not be able to stand opting in and out.
<P>
Broader issues that we shall not discuss today are also involved, such as the coherence of retail car parking in London and whether anomalies are imposed on the market that have an environmental impact. We need coherence and integration. Signage, for instance, is important. Hon. Members may be interested to know that one in 15 cars in London is driven by someone who is lost. There is not an integrated plan, so people do not know where they are going. Signs are of different colours and types, so people are wondering where to go. As I am speaking about being lost, it would be appropriate to let the hon. Member for North Essex intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What precisely in the Bill will help drivers who are lost in London?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> A local transport plan that is integrated with other local transport plans and overseen in London by the mayor, or elsewhere by the Secretary of State will ensure coherence. So, if one is travelling from Bromley to Croydon/signs--especially those relating to local plans--will not change. Obviously, optimum use of transport facilities requires coherence between adjacent boroughs.
<P>
12.15 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No, I will not.
<P>
At a time when the number of buses elsewhere in Britain was decreasing, London buses, which are subject to a certain amount of regulation, held their own in relation to volume, even against the background of what the previous Government tried to do to the bus fraternity.
<P>
In the past 10 years, the cost of bus travel in London has increased by 30 per cent., despite steady patronage, although costs have gone down 40 per cent. Consequently, we have the highest fares of any European capital. The opportunity to convert people to bus travel has been lost. For example, on Friday evening, every hour, 180 buses carry 6,000 people around Hammersmith Broadway--the same number carried by 5,000 cars in the same place at the same time.
<P>
If we can provide comfortable, reliable, affordable and convenient bus services through integration, co-operation and coherent local transport plans, we will go some way to relieving the gridlock that would occur under the chaotic Conservative scheme that underlies the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I should like to explore the hon. Gentleman's theory about bus fares. Is he suggesting that fares are too high and that London bus fares should be subsidised and reduced? If so, I am sure that that would be welcomed by the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone).
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes, investment in buses, as well as priority and cost, must be tackled. At the moment, bus fares are high and buses are unreliable, so patronage is not high enough. Therefore, local transport plans and local authorities in London and elsewhere must examine a mixture of factors to ensure the delivery of greater bus patronage.
<P>
Issues such as congestion charging also need to be taken into account. The solution is not simply to slash bus fares, as investment, priority and congestion charging are also involved. The number of people travelling in buses, as opposed to cars, shows that there is great opportunity on limited road space. We will be unable to grasp that opportunity unless coherence between boroughs is achieved and we reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> An hour or two ago the hon. Member for North Essex said, "We have looked to our past and we are changing". That is a key phrase, signifying the shift to the right and the extremism of the Opposition. The hon. Gentleman gave an exposition of the free-market philosophy and said that local authorities should not get involved in the bureaucracy of planning. Perhaps we should even question whether cars should drive on the left side of the road and whether that is an imposition of regulation. Whether to stop at traffic lights is too much regulation. Planning in transport is absolutely necessary--not just for basic safety reasons but also to deal with the volume and flow of traffic. It is patently obvious that there are benefits in encouraging good planning. I refer the Committee to my own constituency and the beautiful Aire valley with lots of small villages but quite large towns as well: Bingley, Shipley, Baildon. I have set up a local group called the Aire valley public transport commission--a modestly-titled organisation. It has brought together, for the first time, service providers, bus companies, rail companies, the local authority, the passenger transport executive, the transport user groups, local councillors and others. The commission considers planning and makes recommendations to the local authority and others on how we might make better use of road space and improve and capitalise on Government investment. It puts together new plans for investment with planning for the future. Local transport plans will contribute towards this work. Certainly in our locality, the latest round of local transport plans, which has to be submitted by next July, has caused a stir. Not merely the local council but others are having to focus their attention, to think about these issues and deal with the problems--rather than let them drift on as they were allowed to under the previous Conservative Administration.
<P>
I am astonished by the right-wing philosophy of Conservative Members when they talk about how the free market should deal with these things. The hon. Member for North Essex mentioned the need to build 550 new bypasses. In certain circumstances, where there are congestion pressures, road improvements are perhaps necessary. I know that was the case in my constituency, but it is certainly not the case everywhere. We have to take a more sophisticated approach. We cannot build our way out of congestion everywhere all the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Except in your constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> In my constituency, we are not just building a road. We are also using the road space that is freed up for dedicated bus priority lanes and dedicated cycle lanes. We are using the opportunity to improve public transport and to boost demand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is why there are so many communities in this country, as in the hon. Gentleman's own constituency, who want the Government to spend money on bypasses. He is in a marginal seat and he is a Goody Two Shoes and does what the Government tell him, so he is given a lollipop bypass. What about all the other communities that have had their bypass programmes slashed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> If it were only that simple I would be Goody Two Shoes more often. The curiosity here is whether the Conservatives are actually promising 550 more bypasses. They made promises for decades. The Bingley relief road was supposedly in planning for longer than I have been alive--a ridiculous state of affairs. The hon. Member for North Essex should come to Shipley one day, face the local people in Bingley and tell them that they do not deserve this road and that they received it only through the good behaviour of the local Member of Parliament. Of course I believe that my influence has been important in securing the Bingley relief road, but it was also secured because there was a crying local need for it. It goes hand in hand with moves to improve road safety and the environment and to help local businesses and the economy. All these things are important, but my constituents know that the Conservatives were incapable of delivering. They had no finance available. They never put the money in. They could never get bypass schemes off the ground.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): On the non-delivery of the previous Government's transport policy in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, would he reflect on my previous involvement? I designed and built bridges for the railway to which inadequate attention was paid when the bypass for which he forcefully argued was planned. That is a symbol of non-integration of transport policies as experienced in his constituency under the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> I am delighted to have the civil engineering expertise of my hon. Friend. That is a classic example. The Conservatives built advance works in Bingley, put up new bridges, moved the canal and re-laid railway track, but then failed to fund the road itself. If ever there was an example of poor planning on behalf of the Conservative party, that was it. That is why my constituents kicked out the previous incumbent and why I hope to continue to represent the area for some time to come.
<P>
Let us tackle the idea that imposing integrated transport on local councils is a neo-Communist effort to plan every minute detail of how cars should move throughout Britain. As I mentioned, in the 1980s the Conservatives forced local authorities to publish many plans, including economic development plans. It is interesting that that old, left-wing Thatcherite Government is too in the pink for the hon. Member for North Essex. If he is seriously suggesting that we should leave local government totally free and, for example, let them have complete control over finance, with no reporting to central Government, that has a number of interesting implications, not least for public finance as a whole. He might want to investigate a few inconsistencies there, not least when we consider the other amendments that have been tabled to clause 92.
<P>
When we consider all the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for North Essex--whether it is his ridiculous free market concept or ideas about local democracy--we realise that because local transport plans are popular, no one opposes them, and everyone wants them and sees the crying need for integration not only within local authorities but between them, it is absolutely right that they should be included in the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> My copy of the Bill at this part has the words "terra firma, at last" written on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, there appears to have been some deficiency in the printing. The words "terra firma" do not appear in my copy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Furthermore, my hon. Friend's copy is in Latin. The hon. Gentleman's words are in English.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Committee members will be on firmer ground if they stick to what we are supposed to be discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. To judge from the extremely lively nature of our proceedings this morning, I am probably not the only member of the Committee who has breathed a slight sigh of relief as we leave the aviation provisions behind us.
<P>
We have had an extremely down-to-earth and practical debate reflecting the wealth of hands-on experience of members of the Committee, especially on the Labour side. Before I deal with the detailed arguments, I hope that you will permit me, Mr. Gale, to embark not on a tour of the horizon, but perhaps a tour of the network in my guided bus. It might be helpful for the Committee to have a brief overview of the first set of clauses in part 1, which deal with local transport plans leading into bus strategies, partnerships and contracts, by way of background for explanation of the debates to come.
<P>
Clauses 92 and 93 deal with local transport plans, about which we have heard a great deal this morning. The plans already exist on a non-statutory basis and form the essential building blocks of the Government's integrated transport strategy. They meet the commitment that we made on the transport White Paper, which I am delighted to see adorning the Conservative Front Bench, in front of the hon. Member for North Essex. That demonstrates that we all have the capacity to learn. However, I shall return to a non-learning curve evinced by the hon. Gentleman in due course.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The clauses will put our plans into law. They impose a duty on each local transport authority to formulate transport policies and publish them as a local transport plan. The policies must promote safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport and will provide a framework for the promotion of improvements to bus services under the powers of part II and the introduction of charging regimes under part III.
<P>
We recognise that local authorities are best placed to tailor local solutions to local circumstances. We have given authorities the scope to do that within a broad national policy framework, and we have given them much greater discretion than ever before in using the resources made available by the Government for local transport capital expenditure. However, such an approach needs safeguards.
<P>
Placing local transport plans on a statutory footing is part of the framework to enable us to let local authorities get on with their job. The clauses will help ensure that all authorities produce a plan and, equally importantly, they do their utmost to implement it.
<P>
Clauses 94 and 95 are about bus strategies. They will form part of the local transport plan, but will deal specifically with how local authorities intend to use their bus functions, powers and duties, which are, of course, significantly enhanced under the Bill. In practice, local authorities will already have tackled bus strategy issues in drawing up their provisional local transport plans last year, but the clauses put the process on a statutory footing.
<P>
In preparing its strategy, the authority is to have regard to the transport needs of elderly people and those with mobility problems, and to any relevant transport requirements in connection with its education or social services functions. That mirrors the current provisions in the Transport Act 1985. Clause 95 provides for prior consultation, including with neighbouring authorities and representatives of bus operators and users, and for publicity in the event of a new or amended strategy.
<P>
Clauses 96 to 103 are about bus quality partnerships. They fulfil the Government's undertaking to give legal backing to such arrangements, which have worked well in many parts of the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Under-Secretary rightly says that the schemes have worked extremely well and that he is now giving them statutory force. Will he explain why the language is about quality partnerships when the Bill makes it possible for a local authority to impose a partnership on an operating company? That does not strike me as a partnership.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Bill provides for quality partnerships that are developed jointly and voluntarily between the local authorities and the operators. It is true that the Bill provides for enforcement of those arrangements once they are in place and notified to the traffic commissioners, but clauses 96 to 103 are about quality partnerships. That is distinct from the contract, which we shall discuss in due course. The imposition of a bus scheme in a locality will be subject to several thresholds, not least the acceptance of the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> In view of that response, will the Minister look again at clause 96(3)(b), which categorically states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"operators of local services who wish to use the facilities must undertake to provide local services of a particular standard when using them".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a specific requirement. Where several bus companies operate in an area where the council happens to have put in a bus lane, they are now required to enter into the quality partnership--otherwise they cannot use the bus lane.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me see what inspiration has brought me--although I thought that I gave a perfectly good answer to the hon. Gentleman without the advice that I have just received. I am informed that local authorities can impose standards, but have to provide facilities themselves. The point is that in a bus quality partnership we expect both the partners--the local authority and the operators--to come to a voluntary agreement; once they have established that, it is vital that the buses of all operators using the enhanced facilities provided by the local authority meet those quality standards. It is made crystal clear that that is enforceable. That permits the traffic commissioner to take action against operators who use those enhanced facilities but do not provide the required quality of buses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I promise that this will be the last time that I raise the point. I agree with every word that the Minister has said--apart from his statement that that is clear in the Bill. I hope that he will accept that at the moment it is not. I have tabled an amendment that will make it clear and I look forward to his support for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, and for his amendment, which we will come to in due course. I certainly cannot undertake to accept it, but I know that the hon. Gentleman has tabled it and a number of other amendments in a spirit of ensuring proper, open discussion, and of achieving proper understanding of the intentions of the legislation. I am grateful to him for that.
<P>
The bus quality partnership concept has become widespread in recent years. Some 130 towns and cities now have quality partnerships of some kind, in varying degrees of formality, which have been very successful. It is interesting that in the past one to two years, for the first time since bus deregulation and privatisation in 1986--which was so stoutly resisted by the Labour party--bus passenger usage has increased. If one analyses the source of that increase in detail, one sees that spectacular increases of patronage have occurred in those towns and cities where quality partnerships have been put into place. I emphasise that there is no single blueprint. But what quality partnerships have in common is the recognition that there is a legitimate role for both local authorities and bus operators in seeking to promote and improve bus travel and that there are benefits to be had from working together in partnership.
<P>
Nothing in the Bill need affect existing quality partnerships developed on a voluntary basis.
<P>
I am looking intently at my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central. She raised that point earlier and I shall return to it. We will have ample opportunity to clarify that matter beyond doubt. My old friend the hon. Member for Bath wishes to intervene.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister rightly says that in my view nothing in the Bill will currently harm existing voluntary quality partnership agreements. But does he accept that the absence of measures in the Bill to deal with the problems created by the Competition Act could damage existing voluntary quality partnerships?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That is possible. I shall come to that point in due course. I had only just begun to address the detailed points raised by members of the Committee. I hope to offer not only the hon. Gentleman, but other hon. Members, some comfort on the workings of the Competition Act.
<P>
I said that nothing in the Bill need affect existing quality voluntary partnerships but evidence suggests that there might be advantages in statutory arrangements that would allow quality thresholds to be set and enforced.
<P>
The Bill accordingly provides for that. Clause 96 specifies the nature of the scheme which is essentially the provision by the local authority of facilities, such as bus lanes or other priority measures to help buses through traffic and the setting of quality standards that bus operators must meet if they are to use the facilities. Clause 97 provides for prior consultation, including with bus operators and representatives of bus users.
<P>
Clauses 98 to 101 provide for the making of a scheme, including publicity, for its duration which is a maximum of five years and for variation and revocation. Once a scheme is in force, a bus operator in breach of the provisions--for example, because he is not meeting the quality standards--will be open to action by the Traffic Commissioners for breach of registration service conditions. Paragraphs 7 and 17 of schedule 10 apply the necessary enforcement provisions in the 1985 Act.
<P>
Clauses 102 and 103 provide for the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to make regulations about quality partnership schemes, and to issue guidance, to which local authorities must have regard.
<P>
Clauses 104 to 114 cover quality contracts schemes. Under such a scheme, the local authority determines in detail what local services should be provided in the area concerned, and to what standard, and lets contracts with bus operators to secure those services. The existing operating regime for buses is then suspended, so that other bus operators are not permitted to operate in the area in question for the period of the contract.
<P>
The Bill sets a number of tests for quality contracts. As the Bill stands, the local authority must be satisfied that a quality contracts scheme is the only way of implementing its bus strategy, although we envisage that a Government amendment will soften that strong test somewhat, and that the scheme will implement it in a way that will deliver best value. In other words it should be economic, efficient and effective.
<P>
Clause 104 defines a QC scheme and a "quality contract". It imposes an obligation on the authority to keep under review operators' compliance with the obligations imposed on them by quality contracts. Clauses 105 and 106 require an authority to publicise and consult on a proposed scheme before submitting it to the Secretary of State or NAW, "the appropriate national authority", for approval--or both, in the case of a cross-border scheme--stating the reasons why they want to make the scheme. There is a specific requirement to consult operators and users' representatives. There is provision for operators affected by it to make representations to the appropriate national authority. The scheme may be approved only if the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales is satisfied that it is in the public interest.
<P>
There are further provisions about the practical arrangements for quality contracts schemes, including their making, their duration, which is up to 10 years, their variation and their revocation. I draw attention to clause 107, which provides for a period of at least 21 months between the making of a scheme and its coming into force, and clause 110 which provides for a tendering process. Hon. Members will note, for example, that invitations to tender must be issued both generally and individually, to any operator who has asked to receive them.
<P>
I know that we will debate many of the provisions in clauses 92 to 114 in more detail, but I hope that this overview is helpful to the Committee in setting the scene for our further consideration of these issues, I shall deal now with the many interesting and important points 617 618 made by hon. Members this morning. I shall take them in order of speaking, although obviously a number will overlap.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex made a passionate contribution, expressing his fundamental objection to the scheme. He said that it was "another imposition on local authorities, which meant extra expenditure and more bureaucracy, beloved of new Labour". I have to say that it is also beloved of local authorities. The hon. Gentleman will have received a briefing from the Local Government Association--unrepresentative in his view, but hardly an ultra-leftist outfit. It embraces a small number of Conservative authorities--there are only a small number--but it is made crystal clear in its briefing that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"welcomes the Local Transport Plans as statutory documents, as these will give longer term certainty in local transport planning both in terms of finance and policy."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Obviously, local authorities are on the Government's side when it comes to this "monstrous imposition", in the words of the hon. Member for North Essex.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex also stated his party's commitment to the decentralisation of power to local authorities. To be fair, it was expressed--to lurch into Latin again--in terms of mea culpa. After no fewer than 60 Acts of Parliament, all encroaching on local government, during the 18 wasted years of the previous Conservative Government, Labour Members can be forgiven for being sceptical about this late and rapid conversion by Opposition Members.

<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that this new conversion is the means by which the hon. Member for North Essex attempts to imitate the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea, who is reforming in a similar way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> A mouse may dream of becoming a king, a subaltern of becoming a field marshal, but looking at the hon. Member for North Essex, I feel not.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex also said that he took exception to the Bill because it will force local authorities to conform to the Government's ideas on transport: not so. Local transport plans, as set out and practised for the past 12 months, are far more wide ranging in scope than the preceding transport programmes and policies that were introduced by regulation under the previous Conservative Administration. They also allow for far greater discretion than TPPS. The whole point of the local transport plan is that it is devised by local authorities in order to provide local solutions to local transport problems, but they are, of course, also devised in accordance with national criteria set by central Government--precisely within the framework that the hon. Gentleman supported at one point in his speech.
<P>
It is not unreasonable for the Government to lay down certain criteria about their expectations of local transport authorities. After all, between 70 and 75 per cent. of all local government revenue spending is provided through central Government grants. The local transport plan system provides authorities with far more discretion over the use of capital resources than in the past. Other than for the largest major schemes, we have given authorities a single allocation of resources to spend in support of the plan objectives. It is simply not the case that local authorities are placed in a straitjacket as a result of the local transport plans in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex complained, as did his hon. Friends, about the cost of producing local transport plans. I again remind the Committee that local authorities have been used to producing transport policies and programmes. It is true that some additional costs are associated with local transport plans due to their more comprehensive nature, but there are savings also because the plans are required only every five years, not annually. There is little substance in the hon. Gentleman's complaint about the cost of producing local transport plans.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also claimed that the Government were putting less into local transport than ever before. That was a slightly odd claim, given that local transport plans were only introduced and worked on during the past 12 months. In December of last year, the Government announced a settlement for local transport plans of some £770 million, which was 20 per cent. higher than what was allocated to local transport in the previous year. With the greatest possible respect to the hon. Gentleman, may I point out that that happened when the Government were operating under the spending parameters set by the previous Administration, and we all know what they had in mind for local transport expenditure. We have made it crystal clear that, next year, we expect to increase the allocation to the local transport plans by a further £250 million--an increase of one third. It is our hope and expectation that that process of increased support will continue into the future at levels higher than those ever conceived of by the previous Administration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Will the Under-Secretary refresh his memory about a parliamentary answer that he gave to me before Christmas? I specifically asked him how much money the Government were spending on public transport and to compare it with previous spends in previous years. When he thinks about his answer, he will agree with what I said earlier: that the total amount of Government spending on public transport has declined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I very much dispute the hon. Gentleman's assertion. I shall, of course, consult Hansard--is only fair of me to do so. The facts of the matter are crystal clear. We plan a massive 20 per cent. increase in local transport plans expenditure this year and a further enormous increase of £250 million for next year--an increase of one third. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In December last year, the hon. Gentleman's Department allocated the smallest level of local transport grant ever. He has increased borrowing approvals, which merely give local authorities the freedom to borrow, which ends up on the balance sheet of the council tax payers. Our Government put capital into local transport plans, but the Labour Government force local authorities to borrow that capital. That action counts as a cut in central Government support for local transport plans and, before boasting about how much his Department is spending, the Under-Secretary should get his facts right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I have obviously touched the hon. Member for North Essex on a raw nerve. He protests too much. The record is absolutely clear. The Government inherited a set of plans from the Opposition that would have meant that spending this year would be 20 per cent. lower than what we will spend. I do not know how many times I must reiterate the fact that, next year, our expenditure will increase considerably by a massive £250 million, making it £1.02 billion. The Government's record is writ large and local transport authorities and local transport users are perfectly aware of the enormous largesse of the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Under-Secretary is quite right to say that it is absolutely plain. Let me ask him a very plain, simple, factual question. What was the level of Government grant for local transport plans last year? How does that compare with the year before? I am referring not to spending but to the level of the grant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I confess that I am at a loss to answer that question. If the hon. Gentleman has that information at his fingertips, I should be interested to hear it. I rather suspect he has not. I undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman on the subject. I cannot be more generous than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked if I had the figure. Yes, it is the lowest ever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That is an imprecise figure and, if I may say so, it is inherently implausible. The lowest ever since the 19th century? The lowest since the inter-war period? We are dealing with preposterous assertions.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the understanding is that Conservative Members do not believe that this Government are spending enough on transport and, therefore, want to spend more money, which is another spending commitment from them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Is that not typical of Conservative Members' inconsistency? The Liberal Democrats used to be the tax-and-spend party in this Parliament but now it appears that the official Opposition are trying to outflank them. Given their right wing lurch--to which I will allude in due course--theirs is an inconsistent and implausible position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady is wrong. We object to the Under-Secretary presenting less as more. That is what the Government have done in health and in education. It will add to the growing disappointment with the Government's policies on transport. The figure that he wants at his fingertips is £13.5 million in grant. That is what he allocated in December--lowest grant allocated in local transport plans by all his predecessors in transport packages.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for informing us of the widespread disappointment of the British public with the policies of this Government. I suppose that that is why the Government stand at 50 per cent. in the opinion polls--23 points ahead of the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that a new regime that enables local authorities to borrow to invest heavily in transport infrastructure and that offers opportunities for new income streams and congestion charging enables local authorities to play a much more flexible and innovative role? It presents public transport opportunities now and not later, which was the limitation of the grant regime, and invites us to enter a new Utopian opportunity for public transport. I commend what he is saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The Government have set out in the Transport Bill a number of important opportunities that will arise for further investment. We are extremely optimistic about the levels of funding that are likely to be available for transport in the not too distant future.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friends will also have heard the comments from a sedentary position of the hon. Gentleman the Member for North Essex when he called for "more taxes". I am not quite sure whether, in the light of his comments earlier, it was perhaps "taxis" and not "taxes".
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I do not want to give away too many secrets, but I know that in the course of our proceedings my hon. Friend has developed a bit of a relationship with the hon. Member for North Essex. I shall have to leave it to her to interpret the desires and intimations of the hon. Gentleman and whether it is taxis or taxes. I know that the relationship has been solely on the issue of transport.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South spoke about the case for the new large unitaries. He cited his own city of Northampton. Oxford is another example. He suggested that they might have the right to propose their own transport plans.
