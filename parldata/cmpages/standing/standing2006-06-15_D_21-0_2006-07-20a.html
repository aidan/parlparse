<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000844"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that with this we are
discussing amendment No. 472, in
clause574,page280,line11,leave
out &#145;twelve&#146; and insert
&#145;six&#146;.</div><a name="06072035000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000845"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b> I
shall deal with amendment No. 472, because I believe that amendment No.
471 was dealt with before the
break.</div><a name="06072035000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
established that we believe it necessary to retain the criminal
sanction for public companies, but hon. Members might be wondering why
the penalty on summary conviction appears higher for an offence
committed in England and Wales. We do not consider the offence more
heinous if it is committed in England and Wales, but we wish to
recognise here and elsewhere in the Bill the changes that were
introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003. That Act increased the
sentencing powers of magistrates courts in England and Wales so that
the maximum sentence that they can impose has increased from six months
to 12 months. We see no reason to limit the sentencing powers of such
courts in the case of a breach of the financial assistance provisions,
as there is no qualitative difference between the offences in question
and any other criminal
offence.</div><a name="06072035000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">The apparent
discrepancy between the sentencing powers in England and Wales and
those in Scotland and Northern Ireland is simply because criminal law
sentencing is a devolved matter. The clauses therefore reflect the
different approaches adopted in Scotland and Northern Ireland. There
would, however, be nothing to prevent the courts in Scotland and
Northern Ireland from imposing a higher penalty than six months, but
that would necessitate the offence being tried by
jury.</div><a name="06072035000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
should add for the sake of completeness that section 154(4) of the 2003
Act has not yet been commenced. Accordingly, clause 784 of the Bill
makes transitory provision for Companies Acts offences 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column863" />Column number: 864</div>committed before the commencement of that section. The maximum on
summary conviction for an either-way offence will be six months. I hope
that, in the light of that effective explanation of the reasons
underlying the provision, hon. Members will not press the
amendments.</div><a name="06072035000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000846"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> This Minister has been saved by the bell. In her
remarks this morning the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional
Affairs commented that as financial assistance is a criminal offence,
people will not breach the law. In practice, that is not the case. The
reality is that people are breaching the provision regularly across the
corporate world. In the vast majority of cases they do not know that
they are doing so, and normally it involves small amounts of money.
However, breaches happen all the time, so I thought that changing
criminal liability to civil liability would be appropriate. We will
look at the Minister&#146;s comments in more detail and might return
to the matter on Report. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="06072035000376"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06072035000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000847"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 324, in
clause574,page280,line44,at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(6) It is not
unlawful, by reason only of any rule of law relating to maintenance of
capital, for a private company to give financial assistance directly or
indirectly for the purpose of an acquisition of shares in its capital
or in the capital of its holding company or to give any such financial
assistance of the kind referred to in subsection (2) of section 151
where the acquisition in question is an acquisition of shares in the
company or its holding company, provided that
either&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) the company
has net assets which are not thereby reduced and which are not less
than the aggregate of its paid up share capital, share premium account
and capital redemption reserve (if any),
or</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) to the extent that the
net assets of the company are thereby reduced the assistance is either
provided out of distributable profits or is authorised as a reduction
of capital in accordance with sections 135 to
139.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(7) In this section
&#147;net assets&#148; has the meaning ascribed by section
154(2).&#146;.</div><a name="06072035000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment makes it clear that, notwithstanding any law to the contrary,
a private company can provide assistance for the purchase of its own
shares or those of its holding company, as long as its net assets are
not thereby reduced or, where they are reduced, the assistance is paid
out of distributable profits or, where the assistance gives rise to a
reduction of capital, it is first
approved.</div><a name="06072035000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000848"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):</b> The amendment relates to a matter raised with us
by the Law Society. We are grateful to it for sending us a paper in
connection with that point and for its help generally in scrutinising
the Bill.</div><a name="06072035000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">The general
principle of capital loans is a part of company law and dates back a
long time. Capital has to be maintained while profits can be
distributed to shareholders as a return on their investments. The aim
is to protect creditors and ensure fairness between shareholders, and
under the rules on the distribution of profits, procedures are
available for reducing capital.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column864" />Column number: 865</div><a name="06072035000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the principle of capital
maintenance, a company cannot buy its own shares. However, there is now
a procedure, subject to safeguards, and under a statutory provision on
the prohibition of such financial assistance, others may provide it. A
company might have a good reason for providing financial assistance for
the purposes of someone else buying shares that do not go against the
general principle. The Bill will allow that for private
companies.</div><a name="06072035000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until now,
financial assistance could be provided only in limited circumstances
using the whitewash procedure, which enables private companies to
provide assistance as long as there is confirmation that the
company&#146;s net assets will not be reduced as a result or, to the
extent that the assistance reduces the company&#146;s net assets, it
is provided at a distributable profit.</div>
<a name="06072035000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment raises the
question of whether the whitewash procedure served a further purpose:
the provision of a statutory exception to the general principles of
capital maintenance. If so, and in the absence of an equivalent to the
whitewash procedure in the Bill, removing the prohibition on private
companies giving financial assistance for a purchase of its own shares
would tighten up, rather than deregulate&#151;the
intention&#151;the law on private
companies.</div><a name="06072035000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not
go into the legal reasoning&#151;we had plenty of that this morning.
Our view is that the whitewash procedure did not enable or make it
lawful for companies to do anything that under the Companies Act 1985
can be done only within certain safeguards. That is an exception on the
prohibition on giving financial assistance, not a means by which to
make lawful that which, apart from the prohibition, would not be so. I
hope that that is sufficient to satisfy the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06072035000385"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000849"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister&#146;s explanation is helpful and
makes absolute sense. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06072035000386"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000850"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 325, in
clause575,page281,line23,at

subsection (3), after paragraph (g)

the company itself or in respect of defaults by third parties and
including indemnities in respect of losses arising in connection with

or sponsor to an issue),</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(j)
representations or warranties given by a company in connection with any

capital,</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(k) the payment of any
fees or other costs, charges or expenses by a company in connection
with an issue of shares in its
capital.&#148;.&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column865" />Column number: 866</div><a name="06072035000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly, the purpose of the
amendment is to make it clear that certain arrangements cannot amount
to unlawful financial assistance. I draw attention to the categories
suggested.</div>
<a name="06072035000390"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000851"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> This again is a Law Society issue. In order to
address its concerns, which relate to the impact that the financial
assistance provisions have on business transactions, it would be
necessary to start from scratch, perhaps by adopting a different
approach to the requirements of article 23 of the second directive from
which section 151 of the 1985 Act derives. Article 23 makes no
reference to the items described in the amendment, and we consider that
it would not be helpful to add further to a list which arguably already
gold-plates the directive. Moreover, the difficulty with extending the
list in that way is that it raises a question about the status of
arrangements that do not fall within the exact terms of the
exceptions.</div> <a name="06072035000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was
an extensive discussion in the other place, and the various concerns
that the Law Society and others have about the way in which the current
exemptions are framed may point to a reworking of the provision so that
it is to have the intended effect. Such a provision could refer to
concepts along the current lines or be framed on an entirely different
basis. That would not matter as long as we keep our obligations under
the directive. Such a reworking would be much more suitably addressed
by the use of the power that we are seeking as part of the restatement
exercise than by piecemeal amendments. Therefore, I invite the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. This provision, like the others in
this part, is subject entirely to the restatement procedure, so there
is a summer&#151;as it were&#151;yet to
come.</div><a name="06072035000392"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000854"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000855"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We turn to the power of a company to purchase
its own shares. Amendment No. 431 probes why shares must be paid for on
purchase. Does the clause as it stands allow for delayed payment
provisions, which could help the company&#146;s cash flow? Amendment
No. 432 suggests that the consideration should be in cash or
non-cash.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column866" />Column number: 867</div><a name="06072035000399"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000856"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> We are not aware of any evidence that there are
companies that are in a position to purchase their own shares but find
it difficult to pay for them in cash. We believe that the requirement
for cash payment makes sense, and unless there is some real problem, we
do not see any reason to change the
provision.</div><a name="06072035000400"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000857"></a>Mr.

amount that the company has to pay at a certain
time.</div><a name="06072035000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000858"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I do not know that we have found that that is a
problem. I said that we are not aware of any evidence of that situation
occurring readily. The point is to pay cash at the time of the
purchase. There is a framework of rules around the purchase of own
shares to ensure that it does not undermine the company&#146;s
capital, which has to be maintained to protect the interests of
creditors or shareholders. It is important that the value that is being
transferred is visible and clear. That is best achieved by requiring
the consideration to be satisfied by a payment of a monetary sum. I
repeat that we cannot see any reason why it should not be paid in cash
at the time. Let me see whether there is anything further that
indicates that we are at all aware of such a problem. No, we are not
aware of any such evidence, and therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06072035000814"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000859"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The point is that if, for example, a company is
paying a dividend and it does not have the cash to pay that dividend,
it will seek a loan to pay that dividend. It has the reserves to pay
the dividend but not the money. I should have thought that giving the
company the adaptability to defer payment terms might, in relation to a
purchase of shares&#151;where, of course, the reserve situation is
pretty much the same as with paying a dividend&#151;be helpful to it.
However, on the basis of what the Minister has said I beg to ask leave

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000861"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> While the proposition may seem attractive, the
amendment is unnecessary because, in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column867" />Column number: 868</div>contrast to the position on a company&#146;s share capital, there is
nothing in the Bill, or for that matter in the 1985 Act, to prevent
companies from redenominating their statutory reserves. The
introduction of such a scheme may reduce the flexibility that is
currently available to companies to redenominate as they think fit. In
short, as there is no statutory bar to redenomination there seems to be
no reason to amend the Bill in this way, and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will not press the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000865"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The purpose of the amendments is to provide
companies with slightly more flexibility as to the deadline by which
they must pass a special resolution to effect the redenomination of
share capital. They, too, are tabled at the suggestion of the Law
Society.</div><a name="06072035000416"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000866"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The effect of the amendments would potentially be
to give the company an additional 28 days&#151;in addition to the
three months from the date on which it passed a resolution to
redenominate its share capital&#151;to reduce its share capital in
connection with that redenomination. The clock would begin ticking when
the redenomination took effect, rather than from the date of the
resolution to redenominate it. In our view there is already ample time
under the Bill to make arrangements for adjusting the value of shares
following a redenomination. Most companies will, in any event, want to
renominalise the value of their shares at the time when they
redenominate. I do not suppose that they would want shares valued at
â‚¬1.23 or anything of that kind, so they would want to act as
quickly as possible. We are not, therefore, persuaded that the
amendment is
necessary.</div><a name="06072035000417"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000868"></a>The

<a name="06072035000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000869"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Clause 593 and clauses 594 to 599 are included with
no change whatsoever in new clauses 242 to 258. I propose that clause
593 should therefore not stand part of the Bill, and new clauses 242 to
258 should. They fall into two groups, those that simply restate
provisions that would have been left in the 1985 Act and those that
replace clauses in the Bill. New clauses 242 to 244, 246 and 254 to 258
are simply restatements, new clause 245 replaces clause 583 in so far
as it applies to the allotment of debentures, new clauses 247 to 253
replace clauses 593 to 599 and new clauses 247 to 251 are substantially
different from the current law but provide similar protection for a
register of debenture holders to that which the Bill provides for a
register of members. I hope that my fluent persuasion has persuaded
everybody that that is the course that we should
take.</div>
<a name="06072035000423"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06072035000870"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): We move briefly to part
20, which concerns debentures. They are obviously instruments that
create rights of holders in respect of the company, often constituted
by deed polls and other instruments. I have a couple of questions on
the clauses and I reserve our rights to further reflect on the new
clauses over the summer recess.</div>
<a name="06072035000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the existing clauses, which
are in large part repeated in the new provisions, clause 595 provides a
right of challenge by the company in the event that there is a request
for inspection or a copy of a register of debenture holders. In many
ways, it reflects clause 116, which concerns the rights of inspection
of a share register and the ability of the company to challenge on
that. Obviously, the clause mirrors in part the regime that governs the
share register, but clause 119 provides a provision on share registers
whereby the company must provide a copy and must inform on the most
recent date to which the register has been made up to. I note that
there are certain differences between the registers, but I seek
clarification on why such a provision does not appear to be included in
the clauses and in the new clauses.</div>
<a name="06072035000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 599 entitles the holders
of debentures on request to be provided with a copy of any trust deed
for securing the debentures. The term &#147;debenture&#148; in law
unfortunately has a number of different definitions. The reference to
&#147;securing&#148; prompts a slight conundrum in that regard, as
a debenture can denote almost a loan note or some kind of loan stock
that a company has constituted to the holder thereof, or a type of
security&#151;in other words, a charge over the company&#146;s
assets. Although I did not table an amendment to the new clauses, I ask
the Minister to consider the phrase &#147;securing the
debentures&#148; in clause 599, given the possible double meaning,
and consider whether the phrase &#147;regulating or otherwise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column869" />Column number: 870</div>constituting the terms and condition of the debentures&#148; might
offer further clarity when we come back to the more detailed
examination of the provisions on Report.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000871"></a>Vera

shall reflect on that. On the first point, I may have to write to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000873"></a>Vera

much more important. Does that help? If it does not I shall write with

initial response. I appreciate that there is sensitivity about the time
when someone becomes a member. There could also be sensitivity about
the time when someone becomes a debenture holder, and the question was
therefore whether consideration could be given to reflecting clause 119
in the debenture holder regime. Nevertheless, I am comforted by the
Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="06072035000430"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000876"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I turn now to the part of the Bill that relates to
the holding and transfer of shares and other securities. The Government
have welcomed the work of industry groups that are examining options
for greater use of paper-free holding and transfer. The response to the
March 2005 White Paper showed strong support for the initiative, but it
is also clear that more information is needed on the costs and benefits
of using a paper-free approach more extensively. At this stage the
Government do not wish to rule out any option. We therefore propose to
extend the existing power relating to evidencing of transfer of
securities without a written instrument under section 207 of the
Companies Act 1989, so that the power will be capable of use not just
to permit, but to require, paper-free holding and transfer of company
shares. If the power were used in that way, the Government would want
to ensure that the new arrangements for paperless holding and transfer
did not deprive individual shareholders of existing rights that might
be important to them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column870" />Column number: 871</div><a name="06072035000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments were tabled in
another place to clarify the relationship between section 207 and the
provisions in part 21 of the Bill, which make further provision in
respect of section 207, and extend it. The Government said that they
would seriously consider addressing those concerns by some form of
consolidating amendment to part 21, and that is achieved through new
causes 270 to 280. We are satisfied that section 207 can be repealed
and the new clauses brought into force without in any way affecting the
existing regulations made under section 207, or the systems that rely
on them.</div> <a name="06072035000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
clauses 259 to 273 restate provisions of section 183 to 189 of the 1985
Act, which relate to certification and transfer of shares and other
securities.</div><a name="06072035000438"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000877"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for that explanation, because
the issue is sensitive. At the moment, there is the facility for public
companies whose shares are traded on the market to trade through the
CREST mechanism, under the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 1995.
Part 21 obviously envisages a move towards all such holdings being
uncertificated.</div><a name="06072035000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise what the Minister has said about protecting existing rights,
and it is important that the provisions are not introduced in a way
that would cause any problems in that regard. Although some 85 per
cent. of shares are held in uncertificated form, taking advantage of
the CREST arrangements, there are still some 9 million small
shareholders who hold their shares in certificated form, so it would be
helpful to have a further explanation of how the provisions might be
introduced and, in particular, how they will interrelate with the
provisions in part 9 on nominee shareholders and their rights, which we
shall discuss shortly.</div>
<a name="06072035000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would seem logical for the
part 9 rights to be introduced first and given an opportunity to bed
down, so that if the certificated regime later no longer applies, the
range of alternative ways of holding shares is clear to the individuals
affected. That aspect ties in clearly with the shareholder democracy
issues that we shall debate shortly. In connection with that, further
provisions in this part deal with regulations that may affect certain
types of company.</div>
<a name="06072035000815"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1
pm</div><a name="06072035000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful if the Minister could elaborate on, or explain the thinking
behind, the references to specific types of company and individual or
specified companies. Are we talking about the size of the company or
would that type of provision be used in other ways? It would be helpful
to receive further clarification on the thought behind the regulation
and the order-making process, which refers to certain companies perhaps
being exempting, and on how things would work in practice.</div>
<a name="06072035000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such procedures are valuable
and important in ensuring greater deregulation, facilitating trade and
reducing the burdens on companies in respect of how they relate to
their shareholders. However, we need a proper opportunity to ensure
that any details are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column871" />Column number: 872</div>properly consulted on, that shareholders are properly presented with
their choices and that, for shareholder democracy, their rights are
protected under the new regime that would operate if and when part 21
is brought into
effect.</div><a name="06072035000443"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000878"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I do not think that there is much difference
between us on that. There are about 10,000 paper transactions a day, so
a lot of people clearly still prefer to use that method. We need to see
what comes out of the consultation paper that the Institute of
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators produced in April. We are
committed to making any necessary cost-benefit calculations before
taking any step forward. All that we are doing at this stage is taking
a power that will enable us&#151;of course, after appropriate
consultation with all parties and ensuring that all shareholder rights
are firmly entrenched&#151;to move from a voluntary to a compulsory
paperless transaction environment.</div>
<a name="06072035000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman made a
perfectly valid point about various forms of different companies. As we

restated clauses. As things stand, the provisions relating to the ways
in which the registrar may strike a company off the register are
contained in the 1985 Act, while provisions relating to the ways in
which companies, once struck off the register, can be restored to it
are contained in the Bill. It is logical to bring together the two sets
of provisions, and the new clauses will do so. No change of policy is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000885"></a>Margaret

administrative procedure recommended by the company law review. It will
in no way prevent people from using the courts to pursue their rights
in other ways. If one tried to extend the right to relatives or other
people, definitions would become extremely difficult. We chose to use

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000889"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to part 9, &#147;Exercise of
members&#146; rights&#148;. The list of amendments gives some
indication of the interest that all parties take in the provisions.
They have proved to be some of the most controversial and widely
reported provisions in the Bill. The exercise of members&#146; rights
is an important issue, and the Conservative party feels strongly about
it.</div> <a name="06072035000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">The position has
moved on significantly since we tabled the amendments. I shall address
the issues in the context of the Government&#146;s new clauses, which
we welcome and which form the substantive position for debate today. In
our view, there should be a link between a person who has chosen to
invest in a company&#146;s shares and that company. Once a person
invests his money in a company, a line of trust is created; it is a
thread that runs directly between the company and the person who has
chosen to risk his money by investing in it. The law should acknowledge
and respect that.</div>
<a name="06072035000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are myriad ways of
investing one&#146;s money in a company. While it is still possible
to buy shares in one&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column875" />Column number: 876</div>own name, it is increasingly common, especially among small investors,
to arrange instead for the shares to be held in the name of a nominee.
However, where group arrangements are used, it is often the case that a
nominee account holder is put down as the legal owner of the shares,
whereas the beneficial or actual owner of the shares is somebody quite
different&#151;the person who has paid money to invest in the company
rather than that nominee or broker.</div>
<a name="06072035000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give an idea of the
extent of the practice by mentioning some statistics. We are told that
nearly 50 per cent. of all private shareholdings are now administered
by nominees. Whereas there are 26 million certified shareholdings,
there are now 24 nominee-based shareholdings. It is estimated,
therefore, that &#163;100 billion-worth of share capital is held in
that way. The owners of those 24 million shareholdings held in nominee
accounts should benefit from shareholder democracy. At present, they
have no rights in the companies in which they have chosen to invest
money. They cannot vote on matters that are normally voted upon by
shareholders, nor do they have a right to receive any of the
information that is normally received by shareholders.</div>
<a name="06072035000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have
now gone some way towards heeding our calls, but it is only fair to set
out the views to those who have campaigned hard on both sides. Over the
past 20 years, while shareholder groups such as The Share Centre, the
United Kingdom Shareholders Association and the Association of Private
Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers have lobbied for such
enfranchisement, registrars and various corporate groups have lobbied
against it. Although many of the briefings that I have received relate
to the old drafting of the clause, the groups&#146; points are still
pertinent. We have received a great deal of information from a wide
range of companies and groups that feel strongly. The CBI and some of
its members have expressed concerns about the clause in relation to
indirect investors and have mentioned the costs and burdens that they
feel could be imposed on listed companies should it come into
effect.</div><a name="06072035000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
listened carefully. Mechanisms are already in place for beneficial
shareholders to choose to vote in some circumstances, and more and more
publicly listed companies place their annual reports and other
information on their websites. Many of the companies to which we have
spoken have indicated that they would be happy to provide information
to any beneficial shareholder who might contact them. However, although
systems are in place, we need to do more to encourage active
shareholder participation. A representative of one major public limited
company told us that the clause was not necessary because few of the
private investors in his company vote. We would support an update in
the law because the corporate environment is not healthy; private
investors do not engage enough in the running of what are, essentially,
their companies. In some limited companies, only 7 per cent. of private
investors vote. That should be just as unacceptable as falling national
and local electoral
votes.</div><a name="06072035000480"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000890"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point about
the need for greater shareholder democracy. Does he share my dismay
that, at plc 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column876" />Column number: 877</div>AGMs, the advisers often significantly outnumber the shareholders? That
starts to bring the process into disrepute, so there is a need to
encourage greater participation, engagement and involvement of
shareholders in their
companies.</div>
<a name="06072035000816"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="06072035000481"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000891"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. We have all
been there, and that is often the norm for small and medium-sized
listed companies. However, while that situation is typical, we should
not accept it; we want to move away from it. The Conservative party
stands for increased shareholder democracy. In an ideal world, all
private shareholders would use the avenues there are to obtain the
information available, but in practical terms, unless they are given
the choice to opt in, few will. In an ideal world, all issuers would
take a positive interest in the beneficial owners of their shares and
give them the option to receive information. Unfortunately, that does
not occur. A voluntary system is in place and it does not work very
well. Electronic communication and CREST are delivering significant
cost-savings to companies, but the success of technology should not
mean that members&#146; rights are destroyed. The system needs to be
adapted to cater for
technology.</div><a name="06072035000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of
the anxieties that businesses have expressed about the clause concern
the cost to the issuer. We believe that it will not be as great as many
fear. Thevast majority of communications, for voting or
information, will be electronic, which is quick, easy and far cheaper
than conventional postage delivery systems. As issuers already send
electronic communications to those with a full shareholding who want
them, it would not be a significant cost burden to increase the volume
of those communications to take into account those with a beneficial
interest.</div><a name="06072035000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been various criticisms from the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and
Administrators, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Law
Society and the Institute of Directors. The ICSA expressed
reservations, including concerns about the practical implementation of
the new system and the lack of obligations imposed upon the member, but
its primary concern is about cost. The Law Society expressed anxiety
about the legal workings of clause 138. It is important to hear from
the larger brokers themselves, and I mention one in particular. We
received an e-mail from the Halifax, on behalf of Halifax Share Dealing
Ltd which
states:</div><a name="06072035000722"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
delighted with the new clause 138. It has proposed a Government
amendment to the Company Law Reform Bill... covering
shareholders&#146; right. HSDL is one of the UK&#146;s largest
execution-only stockholders with regulatory responsibility for a number
of nominee companies in which we hold shareholdings on behalf of 2.3
million retail investors. Whenever and where possible we try to obtain
for our customers the same rights as they would have if they were
registered in their own right. However, to do so we have to depend on
the whim of registrars and regrettably all too frequently they are not
willing to help us provide these rights which we strongly believe that
our customers, who are investors in these companies, are entitled to.
We have campaigned long for these rights and as you are aware we are
part of the Shareholders&#146; Rights
Alliance.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000484"></a><div class="hs_Para">The e-mail
ends by saying:</div>
<a name="06072035000723"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On behalf of our
customers and those of other nominee operators it is our fervent hope
that the amendment will remain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column877" />Column number: 878</div>in place and that the moral right of investors will prevail over the
profit motives of a small number of interested
parties.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000485"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
depth of feeling on the issue runs deep; only a couple of weeks ago my
hon. Friends on the Committee, the shadow Secretary of State and I
joined a rally just outside Parliament supporting the people
campaigning for these rights. We are glad, and many shareholders are
relieved, that the Government have seen the right way forward on the
issue and tabled a new set of amendments to the Bill. Having said that,
they were tabled very late in the day, which allowed little time for a
contribution on the clauses.</div>
<a name="06072035000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall explain briefly why we
do not support the voluntary extension of shareholders&#146; rights.
Our view is that when possible the industry should lead without the
need for the Government to legislate. However, in this case, if the
extension of shareholders&#146; rights was allowed to be voluntary
for companies, the status quo would simply remain. The shareholder
groups we have spoken to have been lobbying for nominee shareholder
enfranchisement for nearly 20 years. In that time, relatively few
companies have chosen to extend normal shareholder rights to nominee
shareholders. If little has changed in the last 20 years there seems
little reason to believe that it will change much in the next 20 years
before this House considers company reform
again.</div><a name="06072035000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are glad
that the Government are coming round to our point of view, but I want
to note some of the problems that have arisen as a result of the
measure, because ultimately it has become reactive law, made somewhat
on the hoof. Although we support and welcome the reversal, it should
have come sooner so that all interested parties could have been given a
proper amount of time to consider this important issue.</div>
<a name="06072035000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were provided with draft
clauses on 11 July and the Minister set out the significant
consultation that there has been on the proposals. Although it is
probably going too far to say that every party has everything it
wanted, we are much closer to consensus than we might otherwise have
been. We recognise the Minister&#146;s efforts in that
regard.</div> <a name="06072035000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will recognise that we will need to hear what interested parties have
to say. Although we reserve our right to return to this matter on
Report, the measure is only possible in relation to detail, rather than
form, which is broadly acceptable. However, I should like to mention
some specific
points.</div><a name="06072035000490"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday
afternoon, we received comments from the Law Society, which moved very
fast, dealing with various issues that the Government will need to
consider over the summer. Perhaps the Minister has not received those
comments yet; although I am sure that she will, I shall mention some of
them so she can hear what the Law Society is saying. I have not had
time to consider those comments in detail myself, so that is another
thing to do in the
summer.</div><a name="06072035000491"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society, in respect of clause 2(3),
says:</div><a name="06072035000724"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
definition of &#145;information rights&#146; refers to a right to
receive &#145;a copy of all communications that the company sends to
its members generally&#146;. It is not linked to the information
rights that the shareholder, as a matter of fact, possesses. For
example, articles may include a provision stating that overseas
shareholders are not entitled to notices of meetings unless they
provide an address for communications in the
UK.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column878" />Column number: 879</div><a name="06072035000492"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of clause 2(5), it
says:</div><a name="06072035000725"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
Clause 2(5)(a), replace &#145;(2)(a)&#146; with
&#145;(3)(a)&#146;. In Clause 2(5)(b), replace
&#145;(2)(b)&#146; with
&#145;(3)(b)&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not expect the Minister to respond immediately to these technical
points; I am putting them on the
record.</div><a name="06072035000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society says that clause
3</div><a name="06072035000726"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should provide that a
nomination ceases to have effect if the nominated person ceases to own
the shares beneficially. Equally, it seems that the member or nominated
person should be required to notify the company of this
situation.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause
3(2) it
says:</div><a name="06072035000727"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
not clear whether in the case of shares held by more than one member,
all those members need to request the nomination to be terminated.
Clause 3(2) should provide that the member or nominated person must
notify the company of the termination of a
nomination.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000496"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Law Society says that the provisions in clause
4</div><a name="06072035000728"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;do not encompass the
concepts in the articles of association for how notices are served and
communications made to shareholders which would also need to apply to
the information rights of nominated
persons.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000497"></a><div class="hs_Para">It wants
to</div><a name="06072035000729"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Delete the
last reference to
&#145;appointed&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000498"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
clause 5(2)(a).</div><a name="06072035000499"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
clause 6, the Law Society
states:</div><a name="06072035000730"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
rights introduced by this clause are highly likely to give rise to
unforeseen practical difficulties and issues in relation to corporate
actions. Clause 6 is also unclear. Does a member to whom the section
applies &#145;exercise his rights&#146; within the meaning of the
section...only when he exercises all the rights directly
himself...only in respect of those of the rights which he elects
to exercise directly himself; or...also in respect of rights which
are exercised directly by persons whom he has
nominated?</div><a name="06072035000731"></a><div class="hs_brev">If a
member, without having made any nomination, exercises his rights in two
different ways, does he automatically fall within this clause? If so,
this should be made
clear.</div><a name="06072035000732"></a><div class="hs_brev">If the clause
also applies to a member (A) who has nominated another person (B) in
respect of certain of his shares, (a) does the member only
&#145;exercise his rights&#146; if he exercises them in respect of
the remainder of his shares, or (b) does the member also
&#145;exercise his rights&#146; in respect of rights exercised by
B?&#148;</div><a name="06072035000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">In clause 6(1), it
would like
to</div><a name="06072035000733"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Replace
&#145;person&#146; with
&#145;member&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000501"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
clause 7, the Law Society states:</div>
<a name="06072035000734"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At clause 7(2)(e) we
question whether the computation of the total amount of the sums paid
up will be mathematically correct. The members&#146; request must
already have the support of &#145;100 persons&#146;...It is
hard to understand, therefore, why the calculation requires the
division of the relevant aggregate nominal value by the number of
persons named in the request which will in any event
&#145;name&#146; the registered
holder.</div><a name="06072035000735"></a><div class="hs_brev">We also
envisage uncertainties arising under Clause 7(2)(c)(ii) as to when the
nominee holds shares &#147;in the course of a
business&#146;&#148;.</div><a name="06072035000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have put those points on the record. We are where we are in terms of
timing, but the Minister will have my party&#146;s full co-operation
in making clause 138 work, if the changes that are required
arise.</div><a name="06072035000503"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the new
clauses as they are currently drafted, there will be no compulsion on a
broker to provide the relevant services. The relationship between the
broker and the company, rather than the company and the customer, which
is envisaged in the clauses, means that there is no compulsion on the
broker to provide the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column879" />Column number: 880</div>services to shareholders. In reality, however, we appreciate that it
will be for the shareholder to choose a broker who supplies such
services. That needs to be put on the
record.</div><a name="06072035000504"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
worth noting that the default position for the delivery of information
under the new clauses is electronic delivery. From the cost
perspective, that is the right approach, but we must consider the
remaining issue of the cost to the company if a beneficial shareholder
chooses to opt in for hard copies of information, rather than
electronic copies. I would appreciate it if the Minister confirmed that
her Department will keep that aspect under
review.</div><a name="06072035000505"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
originally used the issue of cost against the approach that they are
now taking; the implementation of the system may well involve increased
costs to companies, especially if many shareholders choose to opt for
hard copies of the information. However, I put it on record that we
believe that those marginally increased costs will be greatly
outweighed by the savings that companies have borne from the use of
nominee shareholders and the CREST share trading system. Again, we
agree that the issue should be reviewed in due
course.</div><a name="06072035000506"></a><div class="hs_Para">The electronic
CREST system is used in the vast majority of those share owning
situations, whether the shares are bought by means of an individual
savings account, personal equity plan or other similar arrangement.
That saves a lot of time and money, as all the information is held
electronically. The enfranchisement of beneficial shareholders is a
natural progression in the modernisation of our company law. Nominee
accounts have brought a great deal of efficiency to the UK stock market
and enabled more electronic trading and settlement.</div>
<a name="06072035000507"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we put the estimated
&#163;6 million per annum that this new system will cost all UK
companies against the savings brought about by CREST, it seems clear
that we are evolving the UK shareholding system for very little real
cost. That is an essential development if we are to have a
participative public financial market.</div>
<a name="06072035000508"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have not
introduced any criminal sanctions into this part of the Bill. We accept
that that is right in the circumstances; indeed, it is a pity that the
Government have not taken that less heavy-handed approach to other
parts of the Bill. We also recognise the fact that stockbrokers have
the right and ability to split votes of shares that they hold as a
block. That is the right approach. Previously, the Government had
argued that the increasingly complex investment claims in place
precluded a one-size-fits-all approach to the enfranchisement of
indirect shareholders. At thetime, they missed the point that
the vast majority of individual shareholders who are currently
disfranchised hold their shares through nominee operators. The names of
those operators appear on the register of members; it is not a complex
investment chain.</div> <a name="06072035000509"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also point out that under the Bill the company will need a list
of people who require information. We should like to receive
confirmation from the Minister that the law provides for that list to
be kept confidential and that the list will not be used by the company
for other or inappropriate reasons. The company will send out a letter

their nominees. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column880" />Column number: 881</div>Will that letter be in the standard Financial Services Authority format?
Has the Minister devised the law in conjunction with the FSA? If she
has not, will she confirm whether that will be done?</div>
<a name="06072035000510"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also note that the
provisions apply only to companies operating in regulated markets. They
will not apply to unregulated markets such as the alternative

why she took that decision? Will the Government inform us about when
they intend to review the position in due course?</div>
<a name="06072035000511"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall, I should like to
commend the Government for finally seeing sense on the issue and coming
round to our point of view. I also recognise the swift work that the
Minister and her officials, having made the decision to change the
Government&#146;s approach, did to produce the clause and consult
relatively widely on it in the short time available.</div>

important, and not just within the narrow definition of allowing them

shareholder activism are the central drivers of increasing corporate
social responsibility and ethical behaviour. An important step in
furthering those goals has been taken today. There is still work to be
done to fine-tune the clauses. As I said, I shall be happy to discuss
that with the Minister over the summer. For now, I shall recommend that
my hon. Friends support the Government&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000894"></a>Mr.

states:</div><a name="06072035000736"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;All

the company&#146;s articles to have a
provision&#148;</div><a name="06072035000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so on. As
I understand it, the clause deems that certain provisions exist in a
company&#146;s articles of association; they are there for the
purposes of the law, whether the company bothers to put them in or not.
The redress to nominee shareholders, beneficial shareholders or anybody
else against the provisions not being observed is simply the sanctions
against directors who act in breach of the articles of association
already dealt with in an earlier part of the Bill. The Minister shook
her head, so if my understanding is wrong, I hope that she will
intervene on me or explain the position to the Committee. We should not
go any further without understanding what the Bill purports to
say.</div>

(David

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000903"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Clause 138 was the result of a successful
Opposition motion in the House of Lords. It is, I suppose, the
Opposition&#146;s text. The Government will presumably propose that
it does not stand part of the Bill and that it is replaced by their new
clause.</div><a name="06072035000527"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000904"></a>Mr.

<a name="06072035000528"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000905"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I suggest that the hon. Member for Grantham and
Stamford looks at new clauses 38 and 39, which is where we want to end
up.</div>
<a name="06072035000529"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000906"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I admit that this was a perverse thing to do in
Committee, but I was addressing the text before us. Perhaps I shall
return to the subject if I find a similar anomaly in the new
clause.</div><a name="06072035000530"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
important, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon
(Mr. Djanogly) has said, an increasing number of
people&#151;beneficial shareholders and investors&#151;choose to
hold their shares via nominee accounts. In the overwhelming majority of
cases, their reasons are entirely respectable&#151;there are often
economic reasons, to which my hon. Friend has referred, because modern
technology often makes it the administratively cheapest way of holding
shares.</div><a name="06072035000531"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should note
that in this country the Government have forced certain classes of
investor to hold their shares through nominees. This Government have
used Taxes Acts to compel people who want to obtain basic tax benefits
to hold their shares in that way. Self-invested pension funds and ISAs
are good examples&#151;in both cases, if one puts one&#146;s name
on the shareholder register, one does not get the tax break. The
Government have pushed investors in that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column882" />Column number: 883</div>direction, and it has been a mistake, because the shareholders,
investors and savers have had to give away at least part, and sometimes
a substantial part, of the tax benefit to the company running the
vehicle&#151;a toll to their scheme&#146;s gatekeeper. A large
proportion of the funds generated by those tax provisions have flowed
not from the generality of taxpayers to those taxpayers who save, which
was the purported intention, so as to increase the inducement to save,
but away from the generality of taxpayers to a number of firms and
institutions. Many of those firms and institutions are in the square
mile, and they have done well out of selling those
products.</div><a name="06072035000532"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the Government that there was a conflict between economic rationality
and HM Revenue and Customs caution, which was arguably excessive, about
the danger of tax avoidance. In that particular conflict, the Revenue
won, and whatever the reason for that may have been, we have compelled
certain classes of investor to invest through nominees, and it is
therefore our obligation to ensure that they do not lose their
shareholder rights as a result. It seems to me to be quite wrong
economically, for shareholder democracy and in terms of equity for that
to happen. The purpose of the clause&#151;I can debate only the
clause before us&#151;is to redress that anomaly.</div>
<a name="06072035000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two of the amendments to clause
138 are in my name. Someone is bound to tell me that they amend a text
that will be voted against&#151;in a few moments, the text will cease
to exist&#151;but I cannot anticipate the Committee&#146;s decision
and must debate the text before us. I shall endeavour to change the
text, because I think that it can be
improved.</div><a name="06072035000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled
amendment No. 251 at the suggestion and behest of the CBI, which
lobbied me&#151;I hope the CBI will not mind my passing on that
conversation&#151;to vote against the clause. I am not going to do
so, as I very much support the idea of protecting shareholder rights,
even if people decide or are forced to invest via nominees. However,
having heard a litany of complaints from various companies about the
cost of the imposition, I agreed to consider whether there might be
merit in restricting the beneficiaries of the new rights to holders of
ordinary shares. I am not sure whether that would greatly reduce the
aggregate financial cost to companies, because the vast majority of
shareholders hold ordinary shares. I think that a good case can be made
for giving other forms of shareholder&#151;preference shareholders
and so forth&#151;the same democratic rights in their companies. I do
not wish to pursue that amendment any
further.</div><a name="06072035000535"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
250 arises from an anomaly that struck me when I first read the Bill.
The clause purports to preserve certain essential rights for those who
invest via nominees. Subsection (1)(b) states that we are trying to
provide for such shareholders to</div>
<a name="06072035000739"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;enjoy or exercise all or any
specified rights&#148;.</div>
<a name="06072035000536"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, subsection (3) states that
&#147;This applies in particular&#148; to a set of designated
rights. The most curious thing&#151;I still cannot understand how the
omission could have occurred&#151;is that the clause does not mention
the most important right, which is the right to attend meetings,
whether exceptional or not, and the right to vote at such
meetings.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column883" />Column number: 884</div><a name="06072035000537"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the avoidance of all
possible doubt, we should proclaim loud and clear to the public and to
all investors that it is Parliament&#146;s intention to provide in
the clause for that right to be continued to be exercisable, even if
people have invested via an intermediary or a nominee. That is the
purpose of amendment No. 250. I may be told that I have missed the
relevant provision and that that right is preserved elsewhere, but it
is curious, when a large number of rights are spelled out in subsection
(3), that arguably the most important right should be
omitted.</div><a name="06072035000538"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000907"></a>David
Howarth:</b> As I said in an intervention on the hon.
Gentleman, the existing text is the result of an amendment passed with
Opposition votes in the other place, and I record my gratitude to Lord
Razzall and Lord Sharman for their part in that.</div>
<a name="06072035000539"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the clause is to
further the enfranchisement of indirect investors, which it does for
two important reasons. The first reason concerns the accountability of
companies to society, not just to fund managers&#151;with all respect
to fund managers, they are less representative of society than the
great mass of shareholders. The second reason is to encourage
participation in the corporate side of the economy, which involves
information being spread among the general public about how companies
work so that they have an understanding of the problems that companies
face.</div><a name="06072035000540"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
raised a number of practical objections to the clause, as passed by the
other place, especially on cost and flexibility. For example, at the
heart of the proposal about voting rights is the question of the cost
and the difficulty of organising annual meetings and votes, especially
of large companies, and at the heart of the proposal about information
was the expense of preparing hard copy documents for large numbers of
people. We said on Second Reading that we were fully prepared to think
about those objections, and after consulting widely, the Minister has
come back with these proposals as a replacement for clause
138.</div><a name="06072035000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are content to
go forward on the basis of the compromise that the Minister has
brokered, although the information side of the compromise is clearer
than the voting side. The proposal is now that the default option will
be electronic communication and that that there will be an option to
opt in for hard copy, although in normal circumstances information will
be transferred electronically, which meets the cost objection. On
voting rights, the Government have not accepted our view, but they at
least accept that they have a role in helping to create a
market.</div> <a name="06072035000542"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Huntingdon has mentioned, the Government&#146;s proposal
effectively provides information for indirect investors about whether
the nominee that they have chosen allows them to act as proxies in the
company&#146;s governance structure. That would allow individual
indirect investors to choose a nominee or an institutional investor who
offers that service, which helps to create a market for that service
itself. It will then be for individuals to decide whether that is a
service that they value. If they value it, they will be able to choose
the nominee who offers that aspect of investment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column884" />Column number: 885</div><a name="06072035000543"></a><div class="hs_Para">It remains to be seen whether
that pure market approach will deliver the social benefits that I have
mentioned. It is possible that it might do so, although it is also
possible that it might not be enough. The benefits that interest us in
clause 138 are essentially social benefits rather than benefits
accruing to the companies or the investors themselves. It might be that
a pure market approach does not deliver those social
benefits.</div><a name="06072035000544"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000908"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that investors
choose fund managers on the basis of two criteria&#151;first, the
perceived quality of the fund management and, secondly, the cost? In
the case of passively invested rather than actively invested funds,
their choice will be based entirely on cost, and they will not take
into account the offer to allow them to act as proxies at AGMs. If he
wishes to give investors that right, he should vote for my amendment
rather than for this new
clause.</div><a name="06072035000545"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000909"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I accept what the hon. Gentleman has said to the
extent that those two factors are the most important that investors
will take into account. It is up to them what they take into account,
and we will see the extent to which this right is exercised through the
market. As I have said, if enfranchisement does not deliver the social
benefits that we envisage, it might be necessary to propose a further
move forward, perhaps to a default option, where voting rights are
transferred but investors can opt out and give those rights back to the
nominee.<i class="I"> </i>Nevertheless, I am perfectly willing to accept the
Government&#146;s present position as a starting point from which to
move
forward.</div><a name="06072035000818"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="06072035000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
smaller matters are outstanding, such as the list of drafting issues
put forward by the Law Society, which the hon. Member for Huntingdon
mentioned. I shall not repeat them, but I wish to mention one final
small issue, which is of interest to a lot of small shareholders. It is
how the arrangements will deal with shareholders&#146; perks. I
remember once having a conversation with someone who is now a prominent
economist, who told me that he had just bought shares in the channel
tunnel company solely to get the perk of cheap rail travel. He
envisaged that, given the size and difficulty of the project, the value
of the shares was likely eventually to fall to zero. However, it was
worth while buying the shares simply for the perks. Will the Minister
address that aspect of
shareholding?</div><a name="06072035000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Member for Huntingdon said, we accept that the Government have
moved a long way and accepted that they have a role in creating a
market. We thought that they should have such a role in our other area
of concern about the business review&#151;the environmental and
social practices of companies. That is a legitimate way forward, and we
are happy to accept as a compromise the Government&#146;s offer
today.</div><a name="06072035000548"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000910"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We will end on consensus; I cannot believe it. It
is a good way to end our lengthy consideration of the Bill. I shall
start by saying that on this issue, on which I came in at a much
earlier stage than on others discussed in Committee, I was grateful 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column885" />Column number: 886</div>to all the stakeholders. They worked incredibly fast and hard to try to
reach a compromise and consensus. I attended three meetings, and my
officials attended others. There are conflicts in approach, and the
issue of cost looms high on the agenda of the companies involved, and
the compromise and consensus that we have reached is down to them,
facilitated by us. I am grateful to all the stakeholders
involved.</div><a name="06072035000549"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that
there is consensus on the importance of the matter. Part of the
underlying thinking that led us to devise the Bill was the intention to
strengthen shareholder rights. We have attempted to do so throughout,
and the position that we reached before the House of Lords debate was
that the costs involved provided an overwhelming argument to companies.
Opposition Members recognised that the clause as it came to us from the
Lords would not have been workable and would have imposed unfair
burdens on companies. We have now found a good way forward, not going
as far as the hon. Member for Cambridge would like, although I am told
that Marks and Spencer has included a note with its recent vouchers
inviting nominees to let them know details of indirect shareholders. We
hope to see such practice spread to other
companies.</div><a name="06072035000550"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may well
return to the issue, because there is consensus in the room that there
will be growth in direct shareholders, so entrenching their rights will
be ever more
important.</div><a name="06072035000551"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06072035000911"></a><b class="B">Paul
Farrelly</b> (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab): I congratulate my
right hon. Friend and her fellow Ministers on the Front Bench on the
fact that, in the many sittings of the Committee, when serious and
credible comments have been made in our scrutiny of the Bill, the
Government have sought consensus. That is demonstrated
now.</div><a name="06072035000552"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000912"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for those remarks. My first
duty as a new Member on entering the House after a
by-election&#151;this is a slightly old anecdote&#151;was to sit on
a Bill Committee, and any amendment tabled by the Opposition, who were
us in those days, was simply ignored. I determined then that that would
never be the way in which I acted when responsible for Committees. Good
ideas, wherever they come from, need to be absorbed. We have done that
during our consideration of the Bill. We shall return to the issue, but
we have taken important first steps on a consensual
basis.</div><a name="06072035000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot avoid
saying that I am delighted that the Conservative party supports
increased shareholder democracy. However, that should stretch right the
way through to include shareholders having the right to know about a
company&#146;s activities and policies when they impact on the
environment, community and other issues discussed earlier in the Bill.
I look forward to its wholehearted support for those clauses when we
return to them on
Report.</div><a name="06072035000554"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
respond to the Law Society&#146;s amendments. I have not seen the
letter, but my officials have. I think that it was responding to an
earlier draft of the clauses&#151;there have been a couple&#151;but
nevertheless, if it has pertinent concerns, we will of course come back
to them. We will keep the cost of hard copies under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column886" />Column number: 887</div>review. I gave that commitment to the companies that negotiated with us
and I am happy to put it on the record today. The list that companies
will need to keep will ensure that information passed to their indirect
shareholders is protected under the Data Protection Act 1998 and that
confidentiality is maintained. Clause 42 contains powers to extend
those indirect shareholder rights to the AIM list and others, if
appropriate.</div> <a name="06072035000555"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) asked about
the voting rights of indirect investors. Clause 307 deals with that
matter, but again we might want to return to it at a later stage. We
looked at providing for such voting rights, but it would have required
all indirect investors to be identified and reported. That would have
been a huge job and would have added to the complications. I was
anxious to build a way
forward.</div><a name="06072035000556"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
remaining minutes I shall take Members through what I have in front of
me. We think that everyone who invests in shares&#151;directly in a
company or through a nominee broker&#151;should be able to enjoy and
exercise much the same rights as other shareholders. If indirect
investors wish to exercise shareholder governance rights, they should
be able to do so. I think that that is the unanimous view in
Committee.</div><a name="06072035000557"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our key
concern, however, has always been that such enfranchisement be achieved
in a way that is proportionate, offers flexibility and avoids imposing
undue burdens on parties involved, whether issuers, investors or
intermediaries. That is why, on Second Reading, we said that we would
look at reversing the Opposition&#146;s amendments and why we have
tabled the new clauses. Also on Second Reading, we made it clear that
we would meet interested parties to discuss other ways in which to
strengthen the position of indirect investors. We have done that, which
has enabled us to move to the new clauses.</div>
<a name="06072035000558"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly, I shall outline how
the new provisions will operate. The new clauses provide that indirect
investors can be nominated to receive company mailings. It is up to the
registered member&#151;typically, a broker&#151;to decide whether
to nominate. The registered member will be able to appoint indirect
investors as proxies under the provisions in part 13 so that they can
exercise their voting
rights.</div><a name="06072035000559"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses at the
end of new part 9 will make it easier for registered members to
exercise rights in different ways to reflect underlying holdings and to
allow indirect investors to participate in, for example, requests for
resolutions at the AGM. We think that that is a balanced package. One
of our key concerns in finding a way forward has been proportionality
and avoiding unnecessary cost burdens on companies or any other
parties. I was keen to explore cost implications in our discussions
with interested parties, and I recognise that our proposals still
involve extra costs being borne by different participants. There will
be some incremental costs for companies in printing additional copies
of their annual report and accounts, but we understand that roughly 70
per cent. of London listed companies are already happy to send copies
of those to anyone on request.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column887" />Column number: 888</div><a name="06072035000560"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other extra cost for
companies will be that of maintaining a list of those nominated to
receive the company mailings under the new procedure. We have addressed
those concerns by requiring a positive opt-in by indirect investors to
hard copy information and by ensuring the validity of, for example,
company meetings is not affected by failure to send communications to
indirect investors.</div>
<a name="06072035000561"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for brokers, they will need
to bear the costs of marshalling, for example, proxy voting rights and
instructing the company accordingly, if they wish to pass on such
rights to nominee investors. It will be up to indirect investors, as
the hon. Member for Huntingdon said, to choose a broker who offers such
rights as part of their
service.</div><a name="06072035000562"></a><div class="hs_Para">In bringing
forward the new clauses, I want again to put on record our appreciation
of the organisations with which we negotiated: the CBI, the Institute
for Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, the Association of
Private Client Investment and Management Services and the London stock
exchange, as well as a number of individual brokers and issuers. We
have already&#151;which is why I was surprised&#151;received
helpful input from the Law Society and the TUC. We have involved both
those who inspired the Opposition amendment in the first place and
those who subsequently objected to it, which was the right way forward.
I am glad of the opportunity that we had to share our thinking on that
and other developments with both Opposition parties in advance of our
Committee debates.</div><a name="06072035000563"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 36 to 44 are good news for everybody&#151;for both small
investors and quoted companies. I therefore commend them to the
Committee and oppose clause 138 standing part of the Bill. I hope on
that basis that hon. Members will not press their
amendments.</div><a name="06072035000564"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072035000913"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for setting out
the debate and how we have moved forward on this significant and
important matter. I put on record the Opposition&#146;s thanks for
the work of Lord Hodgson in initially highlighting the issue. We have
since sought to come up with a mechanism and a workable
approach.</div> <a name="06072035000565"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
there is still further reflection and consideration to be undertaken. I
heard the reservations expressed by the hon. Member for Cambridge about
whether the new clauses go far enough, but it is fair to say that a
consensus has been reached, building on the input of various
stakeholders, broadly reflecting the need to ensure that nominee
shareholders are given rights and that that is recognised in the
Bill.</div> <a name="06072035000566"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that the
Minister commented on cost. Gavin Oldman, chief executive of the Share
Centre, a private client stockbroker,
said:</div><a name="06072035000740"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We think
only 5 per cent. of shareholders would opt in to receive information
from companies. That is 1.2 million nominee shareholders costing say
&#163;5 a year, a total of &#163;6 million. That is an
insignificant amount compared with the estimated &#163;100 million
companies would save from being allowed to disseminate information
electronically, which would also be allowed by the
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="06072035000567"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that
that shows one view on the cost issue. I recognise that various
stakeholders expressed some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column888" />Column number: 889</div>concern about the implications of costs, but I hope that by virtue of
the debate we have arrived at a broadly acceptable
point.</div><a name="06072035000568"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Huntingdon pointed out the implications on the AIM
market and OFEX. We could give some further consideration to that. It
is odd that shares traded on the official market and the nominee
shareholders of those companies should be treated differently. We can
reflect on that further.</div>
<a name="06072035000569"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate has been productive.
I am pleased that we have been able to secure some positive steps
forward, to put shareholder democracy and nominee shareholders at the
forefront. I hope that, in so doing, we can ensure that more people
take a much more active role in shareholder democracy and engage more
readily with their companies.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072041000875"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Bercow. As we
are coming to the end of the proceedings, I could not let the sitting
pass without extending a big thank-you to you and Mr.
Illsley for the way that you have chaired the Committee. You have
endless patience, consistent good humour and complete and constant
fairness, and neither of you ever fell asleep. That is a brilliant
performance.</div><a name="06072041000790"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank
all Committee members, particularly those from the Government Benches.
It is very difficult to be a Back-Bench Committee member on a
Government Bill, particularly such a long Bill that has taken so many
sittings. I thank my hon. Friends for their patience, time, endurance
at some points and participation in
Committee.</div><a name="06072041000791"></a><div class="hs_Para">he
Bill has made history. I am told by the Clerks that, so far as records
can tell, it is the longest Bill ever taken in Parliament. It has made
history for all sorts of other reasons, not least of which was a
two-and-a-half-hour diversionary lecture on takeover panels and a
shorter but also diversionary lecture on Eccles cakes. The Committee
was extremely lucky not to be bored with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column1090" />Column number: 1091</div>the workings of Barking rugby club, although I am confident it will gain
from the proceedings of the
Bill.</div><a name="06072041000792"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have learned a
lot. We have cogitated at length on various issues. I shall pick out
some that really stimulated me: the differences between success and
effectiveness, &#147;alters&#148; and &#147;amends&#148;,
assignment and assignation, costs and expenses, shares and
stocks&#151;that was an easy one&#151;and de facto and shadow
directors. They were all new words for me, and I am sure that I am much
wiser for it.</div><a name="06072041000793"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
also like to express huge thanks to our team of officials, who have
supported us so brilliantlyand have worked exceedingly hard
throughout consideration of the Bill, even when it was in the House of
Lords. They have performed brilliantly. I thank them very much
indeed.</div> <a name="06072041000794"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Clerks and officials of the House for their customary excellence in
ensuring that everything ran smoothly until Members of Parliament got
involved, and particularly for the endless glasses of water that we
have been given in this hot place. I thank the police for their
courtesy.</div><a name="06072041000795"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, our
biggest thanks go to Lizzie Colley, who brought joy to all of us in our
darkest moments during the course of the Bill, and who I am sure has
benefited fantastically. Maybe she has even almost learned to walk
during the last
while.</div><a name="06072041000796"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072041000876"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Bercow. I too would like to say a few words on the conduct of the
Committee. Despite its length&#151;it is a long Bill&#151;I have
enjoyed it, mainly due to the general good nature and humour of the
proceedings and of Committee members and the generally co-operative
approach of the Ministers. The Minister&#146;s offer of a three-day
Report was well received in the Conservative party.</div>
<a name="06072041000797"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had exemplary
chairmanship from Mr. Bercow, in his first Committee, and
from Mr. Illsley. Both of them were calm and decisive when
the Committee was occasionally less so. We have also been well helped
on our way by the doorkeepers, police, <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters and
Clerks, whom I thank.</div>
<a name="06072041000798"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank the Bill team,
which has always been efficient and helpful. I am sure that that will
continue during the summer months as we review the new clauses. Some 30
to 40 City lawyers and accountants have provided me and Lord Hodgson
with help on the Bill, and many other interested parties have given us
briefings and help of one sort or another. There are too many to name,
but I thank them all for their help.</div>
<a name="06072041000799"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I thank my hon.
Friends for their excellent contributions to the Committee and their
support for me. I wish everyone a happy summer break; we need
it.</div><a name="06072041000800"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072041000877"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Bercow, may I add my thanks to all concerned in this exceptionally long
Bill, including you and your co-Chair? It must have been an
extraordinary introduction to the chairing of a Bill Committees. It
used to be the case that, at the end of very long
trials, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column1091" />Column number: 1092</div>judges would tell the jurors that they were excused future jury service.
I do not know, Mr. Bercow, whether you might put yourself in
the same position&#151;and, of course, some members of this Committee
might think themselves entitled to the same treatment.</div>
<a name="06072041000801"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to thank my own
colleagues, and everyone on both sides for their forbearance in what
seemed something like a trial as we proceeded through the Bill. We have
not quite discussed all the big political issues, but we just about
managed nearly all of them. I thank the right hon. Member for
Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) who, I am sad to say, is not with us, for
the one thing that we did not manage to discuss: his excellent new
clause, to which we might have to return at a later point. I add my
thanks to all the staff and officials who have worked so hard on the
Bill. It might not always have been a pleasure to be on this Committee,
but it was certainly a privilege and an
experience.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06072041000878"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Perhaps I can conclude by echoing the thanks
that have already been expressed from the those on the three Front
Benches to all who have facilitated the smooth passage of the Bill. For
my part, I am extremely grateful to a number of people. The first is my
co-Chair, Mr. Illsley, a senior member of the
chairman&#146;s panel, with whom it has been a pleasure and privilege
for me to work. He has been thoroughly collegiate, co-operative and
helpful throughout and, as this is my first outing, I have been
extremely grateful to him. I hope that it will not be judged by the
powers that be that it should also be my last; I await the verdict in
due course.</div> <a name="06072041000803"></a><div class="hs_Para">I echo
the thanks that have been expressed to the police, to the door keepers
and to all the members of the Committee for their helpful contributions
and their accommodating attitude to the Chair. I want to thank senior
executive officer Mark Oxborough, who was in the room until a few
moments ago and who has done a great deal of work on the Bill behind
the scenes.</div> <a name="06072041000804"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my
personal point of view&#151;I hope that others will understand the
significance of this in my mind&#151;I am grateful more than I will
ever be able to say to three other people. The first is Dr. Mark Egan,
who started the work of clerking on the Bill, but who was taken away
from it because of family circumstances beyond his control. He is a
very respected member of the staff of the House, and I am appreciative
of his efforts, his guidance and his patience in dealing with me. The
two others are those who, in practice, have clerked the Bill for much
of the time, Dr. John Benger and Alan Sandall, who is now immediately
on my left. They are very experienced Clerks and were no doubt chosen
partly because of the significance, complexity and length of the Bill
but possibly even, in part, on account of the knowledge of the powers
that be that a completely inexperienced new Chair was going to be
tested and needed to be looked after. They have certainly looked after
me and I am very
grateful.</div><a name="06072041000805"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
want to thank the <i class="I">Hansard C</i>ommittee Sub-Editors who have done
their jobs faithfully, conscientiously and effectively from start to
finish.</div>
