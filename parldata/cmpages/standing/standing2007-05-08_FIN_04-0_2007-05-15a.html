Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): Welcome to the Chair,
Mr. Gale. The clause marks the beginning of the part of the
Bill that deals with the environment. It is progress to have such a
part, given that there was no similar part in last year&#146;s
Finance Bill.</div>
					<a name="07051548000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						By
way of introduction, I shall point out that my hon. Friends and I have
done some research and discovered that in last year&#146;s Budget
alone, the Chancellor mentioned climate change no fewer than 15 times,
whereas in the Budget and pre-Budget statements between 1997 and the
autumn of 2005, he mentioned it on average only once. I shall leave it
to the Committee to work out what stimulated his interest in the
environment, and what might have happened in the autumn of 2005 to
awaken that
interest.</div>

							<a name="07051548000417"></a>Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> I can confirm that carbon emissions have risen
since 1997. I am afraid that I have to disappoint the Chief Secretary
by saying that my research has been less rigorous than his; I have not
sat back and looked at every Bill that was issued in every year since
1979. I should want to check his claim closely, as we always want to
examine with great care claims that are made by the
Treasury.</div>

Friend confirm that, during the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s
period in office, not only 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>has climate not featured heavily in Bills and Red Books, but green
taxes, as a proportion of taxation as a whole, have
fallen?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000419"></a>Mr.

							<b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): The Chief Secretary gave
1999 as the critical year in which green issues suddenly became
important for his Department. I note that since 1999, 15 Departments
have increased their carbon emissions. What does that say about the
Government&#146;s green
strategy?</div>

							<a name="07051548000424"></a>Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> I shall not respond to my hon. Friend&#146;s
question, Mr. Gale, although I was prepared to do so. I
shall instead turn to clause 17, which, by amending the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988, seeks to extend to corporate landlords the
availability of the landlord energy savings allowance. Proposed new
section 31ZC sets out regulatory powers associated with the earlier
provisions of the clause. How many corporate landlords does the Chief
Secretary expect to install energy-saving devices as a result of the
clause? What does he expect total carbon saving to
be?</div>
					
					<a name="07051548000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051548000425"></a>
							<b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I shall be brief
in dealing with clauses 17 and 18. The hon. Gentleman was right: this
is the first time that we have seen part of a Finance Bill deal
specifically with the environment. That is slightly confusing, as we
have just discussed some environmental clauses under the previous
part.</div>
					<a name="07051548000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 17(5)
and (6) specify the definition of an energy-saving item and stipulate
that such items will be defined by regulation. I am not sure that I
have seen the regulations; will the Chief Secretary provide some detail
of exactly what kind of items those will be? Will they refer just to
electricity, or will they include items like ground source heat pumps,
the development of which is making great strides in my constituency? I
also note at the bottom of page 11 in the proposed new section 31ZB(3)
that expenditure relating to holiday lets has been excluded. Can he
explain why that is the case? Surely, we want to encourage greater
energy efficiency in all properties, and not limit that process.
Finally, I would like to know what the projected cost to the Exchequer
of these measures will be, and what the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>Chief Secretary expects take-up to be in terms of the number of
properties that will respond to these incentives to improve energy
efficiency.</div>
					
					<a name="07051548000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000426"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> I welcome clause 17, because it begins to deliver
on the Treasury&#146;s promise of fiscal incentives for energy
efficiency. Although I am sad to see that the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West is not here, I saw in the explanatory notes
that the measure is an attempt to standardise corporation tax reliefs
with an existing income tax relief. The explanatory notes
state:</div>
					<a name="07051548000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
similar deduction...is currently available for landlords who pay
income tax.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
welcome that principle, if only because the clash between the two
regimes has caused so many problems elsewhere in our Finance Bills over
the past few years.</div>
					<a name="07051548000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a few questions about the details, which I hope that the Chief
Secretary can answer. My first question is whether there is any need
for new section 31ZA(5), regarding the definition of an
&#147;energy-saving item&#148;. If the aim here is to achieve
harmony between the income tax and corporation tax regimes, why is it
not possible to use the existing regulations that were made for the
purpose of income tax deduction? I do not want to stray into the
territory of the next clause, but we have had some recent regulations,
a copy of which I have here, that define what an energy-saving item is
for the purposes of income tax deductions under section 312 of the
Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005. The Energy-Saving Items
Regulations 2007 were laid before the House on 14 March and came into
force on 6 April. They define energy-saving items
as</div>
					<a name="07051548000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) hot
water system
insulation;</div>
					<a name="07051548000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
draught proofing;</div>
					<a name="07051548000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
solid wall insulation;
and</div>
					<a name="07051548000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">(d) floor
insulation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">They also
prescribe limits on expenditure.</div>
					<a name="07051548000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If the idea
is to achieve harmony between the deductions possible under the Income
and Corporation TaxesAct 1988 and the Income Tax (Trading and
Other Income) Act 2005, I must ask the Chief Secretary whether it is
not possible to use a common definition of an energy-saving item, and
if possible the same regulations.</div>
					<a name="07051548000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new section 31ZA(7)
seems to imply a wide range of possible conditions, which may be
imposed upon the definition of an energy-saving item. I hope that the
Treasury does not intend to develop a definition of an energy-saving
item that is so specific that no one can make use of the relief. The
list given in the Energy-Saving Items Regulations 2007 is hardly
exhaustive, and I hope that the Treasury is not signalling that it is
going to become any shorter. If this relief is to be useful and not
another of the Chancellor&#146;s gimmicks, it will be helpful if the
Chief Secretary could offer the Committee some idea of what will be
covered by the proposed definition, and whether that definition will be
based on the existing
regulations.</div>
					<a name="07051548000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question concerns restrictions on the use of the relief, particularly
that it is not applicable if a house is in the course of construction.
I would have thought that the best time to make the relief available is
during the acquisition and construction phase; I see the Chief
Secretary nod there. It is at that point that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>availability of a deduction is best able to influence commercial
decisions about whether to proceed with energy-saving
measures.</div>
					<a name="07051548000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government seem to be establishing a false dichotomy between businesses
that improve the energy efficiency of an existing building and those
that elect to improve the specification of a prospective building. I am
sure that there is some logic in that distinction and I would
be grateful for the Chief Secretary&#146;s explanation.</div>
					<a name="07051548000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third point concerns the
restriction in proposed new section 31ZB(5), which restricts any
deduction in respect of expenditure which</div>
					<a name="07051548000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is not for the benefit of a
dwelling house.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems very nebulous and the Chief Secretary may be able to put my mind
at ease by providing the appropriate legal definition. As it stands, I
can think of a number of possible disputes arising over whether an
energy-saving item has been installed to the benefit of a dwelling
house or for another commercial purpose. The scenario I am thinking of
is tied accommodation in which there is very little differentiation
between residential and commercial premises, such as a pub.</div>
					<a name="07051548000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a pub landlord were to
install some energy-saving technology, even choosing from the very
modest list in the current regulations, would he be benefiting his
dwelling or his commercial premises? Presumably both to some extent,
but does that mean that no deduction is allowed at all or that the
benefit should be apportioned out in some way or another? My concern
with the whole of the clause is that its intentions are positive, but
its details risk producing a deduction that is so specific or so
complex that nobody bothers to use it. I should like to see the clause
put to good effect by business, rather than providing another two pages
of primary legislation and yet another set of
regulations.</div>

							<b class="B">Kitty
Ussher</b> (Burnley) (Lab): I rise briefly to express my
support for the clause. Obviously its purpose is to address the market
failure that exists because landlords have a disincentive to invest in
energy efficiency in their properties because the benefits of the
investment flow to the tenant so they cannot get a return on it. The
clause would correct that by giving a direct financial return to the
landlord. I should like to explore the parallels between this clause
and the clauses relating to microgeneration that we discussed late one
evening on the Floor of the House. Those clauses give individuals
exemption from income tax on income from any surplus electricity
generated from installing solar panels and wind turbines, perhaps we
should consider a similar provision for landlords. For a landlord there
is also, presumably, a market failure to invest in microgeneration,
solar panels, wind turbines and so on because he would not be the one
to benefit from selling the surplus energy back. Surely, the
microgeneration clauses should also be extended to landlords. Perhaps
the Chief Secretary can clarify that
point.</div>

							<a name="07051548000428"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> Good morning, Mr. Gale. I welcome you
back to the Chair. Let me briefly repeat the point that I made in an
intervention. The Chancellor introduced in the Budget documentation for
the first time an environmental chapter and it has been in each
pre-Budget report and Budget Red Book since 1999. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>Before that we published a statement of intent on environmental taxation
in July 1997. I will not go further down that road, Mr.
Gale, given your wholly proper strictures to Opposition Members earlier
on.</div>
					<a name="07051548000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
want to comment on clauses 17 and 18 as they are grouped together on
the selection list. About one third of the UK&#146;s carbon emissions
come from residential properties. We have therefore introduced, not as
the hon. Member for Wycombe suggested this first measure, but a series
of measures to encourage household energy efficiency. For example,
energy efficiency measures professionally installed in residential
properties now qualify for a reduced rate of VAT. The energy efficiency
commitment provides incentives under which energy suppliers are
installing a range of energy efficiency measures in residential
properties. By 2010, in combination with initiatives introduced as part
of the warm front scheme, that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
more than 2 million tonnes per year.</div>
					
					<a name="07051548000369"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="07051548000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have also set out our ambition that, by 2016, all new homes will be
zero carbon. We will shortly come to a clause that introduces a stamp
duty exemption for zero-carbon homes. However, action targeted
specifically at the rented residential sector is needed, since such
properties typically produce about 500 kg more carbon dioxide a year
than other homes. There is an obvious incentive for home owners to
improve the energy efficiency of their homes, but, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Burnley said, that does not apply in the case of rented
properties, hence the need for this
measure.</div>
				
					<a name="07051548000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the 2004 Budget, we
introduced the landlords energy saving
allowance&#151;LESA&#151;which allows private landlords to deduct
the cost of installing loft and cavity wall insulation from their
taxable profits. Since then it has been extended to include solid wall
and hot water system insulation, and draught-proofing.</div>
					<a name="07051548000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have explored the options
for a green landlord scheme in some depth. An option that we discussed
in the past was to reform the wear-and-tear allowance, linking it to
the energy efficiency of a property but, having fully investigated the
practicalities, we concluded that LESA provided a more cost-effective
and better targeted way to encourage improvements in the energy
efficiency of privately rented properties.</div>
					<a name="07051548000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">LESA has been successful in
encouraging investment: landlords spent more than &#163;1.3 million
on energy efficiency improvements to rented properties in its first
year. The Energy Saving Trust and the Energy Efficiency Partnership for
Homes are also doing good work in encouraging landlords to improve
energy efficiency in their properties. Building on that progress, we
announced several extensions to LESA in the pre-Budget report last year
to ensure that its scope and coverage are as comprehensive as possible.
Those extensions are expected to reduce carbon emissions by up to two
thirds of a million tonnes a year by
2011.</div>
					<a name="07051548000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">LESA is at
present available only to private landlords subject to income tax, and
clause 17 extends it to landlords in the corporate sector. Corporate
landlords own about a quarter of all properties in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>residential rental sector, so that is a very significant widening of
access to the allowance. As a Government support to businesses, the
extension requires state aid approval from the European Commission
before it can be implemented and we will be shortly be submitting
notification of this aspect of the LESA and seeking approval.</div>
					<a name="07051548000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause also gives powers to
the Treasury to change the level of allowance available to ensure that
the allowance operates fairly in all situations and to specify the
types of energy-saving items covered. I will return to that matter in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="07051548000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will lay
regulations introducing the same conditions for corporation tax that
are already in place under the existing allowance for income tax, and
the regulations will set the maximum deduction available at
&#163;1,500 per property per year and provide for that deduction to
be apportioned in cases of joint ownership. A draft of the regulations
has been provided for the Committee and I hope that all members will
have seen
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07051548000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000429"></a>Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> Will the Chief Secretary say when the regulations
were sent to the Committee, as I have no recollection of receiving
them? If he cannot answer my question now, perhaps he will do so in due
course.</div>
					
					<a name="07051548000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000430"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I do not have the date in front of me but I will
check it. I hope to be able to respond to the hon. Gentleman in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="07051548000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Corporate
landlords will be able to deduct the cost of acquiring and installing
solid wall, cavity wall and loft, floor and hot water system
insulation, and draught-proofing.</div>
					<a name="07051548000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Extensions to LESA for
non-corporate landlords, who already benefit from the original LESA,
aremade for income tax in clause 18 to match those in clause
17 for corporation tax, and represent a further incentive for landlords
to increase the energy efficiency of their properties. Clause 18
extends LESA by making the allowance that is currently set to end in
2009 available until 2015.</div>
					<a name="07051548000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						From 2008,
energy performance certificates will be introduced in the private
rented sector for every home bought, sold and let in the UK. Those
certificates will highlight to landlords and tenants the existing
energy efficiency of properties, as well as suggesting affordable ways
to improve them. Setting 2015 as the date strikes a good balance
between giving landlords enough time to take advantage of the allowance
and encouraging them to take steps to improve the energy efficiency of
their properties as soon as possible. The extension of the allowance by
six years gives them time to take full advantage of the extended
allowance and to benefit from the information provided by energy
performance certificates.</div>
					<a name="07051548000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the clause ensures
that the LESA is available for expenditure on increasing the energy
efficiency of communal areas within properties, providing an incentive
to improve the energy efficiency of the whole building. We have
already, through secondary legislation, made the allowance available
for expenditure on floor insulation, changing the maximum annual
deduction available from &#163;1,500 per building to &#163;1,500
per property. That means that for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>landlord who owns and lets a block of 10 flats, the maximum deduction
available per flat is increased from &#163;150 to &#163;1,500. I
hope that the Committee has seen the draft of the regulations that we
intend to lay afterthe Bill receives Royal Assent. They ensure
that the maximum annual deduction of &#163;1,500 will continue to
operate correctly for expenditure on communal areas.</div>
					<a name="07051548000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me respond to some of the
points that have been raised in our brief debate. The hon. Member for
Falmouth and Camborne asked a fair question about furnished holiday
accommodation. We have thought carefully about that, and the evidence
is that there is not the same market failure in the case of furnished
holiday lettings that there is in the private rented sector more
generally. For example, it is common for owners of furnished holiday
accommodation to live in their properties for part of the year, so they
will benefit directly from energy efficiency improvements.</div>
					<a name="07051548000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any case, the commercial
letting of furnished holiday accommodation is treated more favourably
for tax purposes from other rental businesses. That suggests that it
would not be right to provide the LESA for furnished holiday
accommodation. However, it is a fair point that we ought to keep under
review arrangements to encourage the right level of energy efficiency
in furnished holiday accommodation. If it is appropriate at some point
to introduce fiscal incentives for that purpose, we will be open to
doing so.</div>
					<a name="07051548000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect
the cost of the extensions to be up to&#163;10 million per
year. That is set out in table 1.2 of last week&#146;s pre-Budget
report documentation. The things that will count as energy-saving items
in the regulations will be those that I have listed: floor insulation,
loft insulation, cavity wall insulation, solid wall insulation,
draught-proofing and hot water system insulation.</div>
					<a name="07051548000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Braintree
asked why we did not make the incentive available for a dwelling under
construction. The answer is that, as a result of recent changes,
building regulations require new properties to be built to a high
standard of energy efficiency. As a regulatory requirement already
exists, making the LESA available would cost the taxpayer money but
would not have a beneficial effect. The aim of the LESA is to target a
market failure where there is no requirement, as in the case of
existing privately rented properties, for energy efficiency measures to
be taken.</div>
					<a name="07051548000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the hon. Member for Braintree also asked why we needed separate
regulations for income tax and corporation tax. It is because they are
covered by two different Acts, so it is necessary for there to be two
separate sets of regulations. Indeed, they will take effect on
different dates. However, I can reassure him that the definition of
energy saving items will be the same for both income tax and
corporation tax. I hope that that will be of some comfort to
him.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000431"></a>Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> This clause covers relief for new zero-carbon
homes and as you know, Mr. Gale, Friends of the Earth and
the National Landlords Association do not always find cause to unite
them, but this clause seems to have done the trick. Friends of the
Earth said that it would affect</div>
					<a name="07051548000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a tiny number of new
properties&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07051548000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">while the
National Landlords Association said that</div>
					<a name="07051548000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the impact of the tax break is
likely to be relatively
limited.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, they
agree on that. I am sure that both organisations, none the less,
welcome the proposal, which we will not be opposing. However, their
reaction suggests some useful lines of inquiry.</div>
					<a name="07051548000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause empowers the
Treasury to make regulations granting relief on zero-carbon homes,
which may take the form of an exemption from charge or a reduction in
the amount of tax chargeable. As the House of Commons Library points
out&#151;I went to the Library to see what it had to
say&#151;</div>
					<a name="07051548000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the budget
report itself does not give an estimate, stating the Exchequer impact
to be &#145;negligible&#146;. Item A.90 in the budget measures
shows the cost as...less than &#163;3 million a
year&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051548000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is what the
Red Book describes as a relief to</div>
					<a name="07051548000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;kick-start the market for new
highly efficient technologies in
homes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Library also
says that</div>
					<a name="07051548000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at this stage
it is difficult to estimate how many homes would qualify for the tax
relief, and much will depend on the projected number of new homes that
may be built during the qualifying period.. .at this stage there does
not appear to be any reliable estimate or figure of the likely number
of houses to be covered and how much this will cost the Government
until 2012&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051548000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
Library&#146;s assessment.</div>
					<a name="07051548000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">So it is not at once apparent
how this welcome but modest measure can accurately be described as
&#147;likely to kick-start&#148; a market, or how exactly it will
make a substantial contribution towards the Chancellor&#146;s goal
announced last weekend of five eco-towns, containing 100,000
carbon-neutral homes.</div>
					<a name="07051548000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						When I say
&#147;announced&#148;, of course I
mean&#147;re-announced&#148;, since that goal was first
announced, according to my researches, by the Minister for Housing and
Planning almost exactly a year ago, on 17 May 2006. [Hon. Members:
&#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] I hear Government Members say
&#147;Hear, hear&#148; but I was about to go on to remark that the
process of passing this information on to the Economic Secretary, with
whom I believe the Minister in question is acquainted, and then for him
to pass the information on to the Chancellor, with whom he is also
acquainted&#151;though not, of course, in the same way&#151;has
taken the best part of the year.</div>
					<a name="07051548000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						When I say
&#147;re-announced&#148;, I mean, of
course,&#147;re-announced and slightly modified&#148;,
since the Housing Minister&#146;s original speech, as the Economic
Secretary will know, referred to 120,000 homes, not 100,000, so there
has been a net loss of 20,000 homes. When I say
&#147;re-announced&#148;, I mean, &#147;re-re-announced&#148;,
since the Government apparently announced that they would build seven
new eco-communities, with 9,000 new homes 10 years ago, and have to
date built only one in 10 of those homes.</div>
					<a name="07051548000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of questions obviously
follow. First, how many zero-carbon homes exist at present? The Chief
Secretary told the shadow Chief Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member
for Chipping Barnet, in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>Chamber that the answer is &#147;a very small number&#148;. He was a
bit more forthcoming on &#147;Newsnight&#148;, when he told Jeremy
Paxman that the answer is</div>
					<a name="07051548000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I think a couple of
dozen&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051548000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will spare the
Committee the whole exchange, because it makes for painful reading.
However, because it is obviously unsatisfactory for
&#147;Newsnight&#148; to have the precise figure when the House
does not have it, we are confident that the Chief Secretary will
respond
appropriately.</div>
					<a name="07051548000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
what estimate has the Treasury made of the number of additional
zero-carbon homes that it expects to be in place by 2012 as a result of
this measure? Thirdly, what estimate has the Treasury made of the
number of zero-carbon homes that it expects to qualify for this tax
relief? What proportion does it expect to be exempted from charging
altogether?</div>
				
					
					<a name="07051548000370"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div>
					<a name="07051548000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly, can
the Minister give us an idea where these homes are expected to be built
and which local authorities have expressed an interest in seeing them
built? The Chief Secretary said on Second
Reading:</div>
					<a name="07051548000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a development
of zero-carbon homes is going forward at Gallions Park in my
constituency.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 April 2007;
Vol. 459, c. 661.]</div>
					<a name="07051548000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the
Economic Secretary confirm that, as common sense would suggest,
&#147;going forward&#148; means that planning permission for these
homes has been given? Fifthly, what carbon saving does the Treasury
expect as a result of the measure? Finally, does the estimate in the
table contribute to the cost of the five eco-towns and 100,000
zero-carbon homes and where in the Red Book are those costs
covered?</div>
					<a name="07051548000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
gives rise to a number of more specific questions as its main effect is
to give the Treasury the power to make regulations granting relief on
zero-carbon homes. Picking up on an exchange on the last clause, I may
be at fault but I am not aware of having seen the regulations that will
offer a definition of zero-carbon homes, that may extend the relevant
tax concessions beyond 2012, that may set up a process of certification
under the home information pack regime which could affect take-up, and
that may, although not necessarily, provide for relief to be withheld
where a person acquires more than one zero-carbon home within a
specified period. Obviously those are important regulations. If they
have not been published, when will they be published?</div>
					<a name="07051548000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Economic Secretary tell
the Committee whether the definition of zero-carbon home will include
carbon emitted during construction or in the manufacture of building
materials? What evidence on the carbon neutrality of their homes will
people be required to provide and through what process will they do so?
Above all, can he guarantee that the House will get the opportunity to
debate the regulations which, by their nature, will be unamendable
under the affirmative
procedure?</div>
					<a name="07051548000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
may I offer some good news? Speaking of acquaintances of the Economic
Secretary, the hon. Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin
Challen)&#151;the future Lord Challen, as my colleagues insist on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>calling him&#151;is on the case. I received from him only yesterday an
invitation to a meeting entitled &#147;Zero-carbon homes: how we can
meet housing costs and protect the environment.&#148; His letter
begins: &#147;Dear Helen Goodman&#148;. I look forward to the Chief
Secretary&#146;s
response.</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> The regulations may have arrived with my mail
this morning, but it had not been processed by the time I arrived here
today. They may be sitting in my in-tray, but I have not had a chance
to look at them yet. In any event, there was hardly a huge amount of
time to scrutinise them before the debate.</div>
					<a name="07051548000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for Wycombe
said, we do not know what impact clause 19 will have on Treasury
revenues. My key concern is that although it will provide a demand-side
incentive for people to purchase new zero-carbon homes, there will not
be a similar incentive for builders to build them. That lack of
symmetry may mean that demand will not be met, thus there will be no
opportunity to take advantage of the tax
incentive.</div>
					<a name="07051548000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the announcement was made in the pre-Budget report, I wonder if there

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>
					<a name="07051548000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do I take it that it depends on the price
of the property&#151;that if it is above the &#163;500,000
threshold it will result in a reduction, but if it is below that
threshold it will result in an exemption? Exactly how will the measure
operate? Will the Economic Secretary explain why it should apply only
to the first time that the new building is sold? Why are not the
Government extending it to future sales, as that will clearly have an
impact on the price?</div>
					<a name="07051548000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mentioned regulations, but my concerns revolve around the impact that
the proposal will have on affordable housing. A couple of years ago,
there was a high-profile demonstration in my constituency of a
zero-carbon house, a BedZED property, that could be built for less than
&#163;70,000, which still puts it out of reach for people on an
average household income, which in my constituency is just below
&#163;20,000 a year. The &#163;70,000 is just the price of the
property; the key expense will be the plot of land. What impact does
the Economic Secretary think the measure will have on the entire price
scale, not just on the most expensive properties? People who want to
buy new, affordable housing will still find it very difficult to buy a
zero-carbon home.</div>
					<a name="07051548000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">What impact will the measure
have on social housing stock? It would be excellent if new social
housing could be built on a zero-carbon basis. The fundamental problem
is that the proposal will apply only to new properties when, as the
Chief Secretary said earlier, one third of all emissions from the UK
are from the housing stock. How does that break down between projected
new housing stock and existing housing stock? Three quarters of the
stock that is standing today will still be standing in 2050, and on
that basis the key target must be existing stock, not least because
that is where fuel poverty, for example, is at its
worst.</div>
					<a name="07051548000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
constituency, there is very poor, usually very old, housing stock, a
high incidence of fuel poverty and a poor take-up of the Warm Front
scheme, not least because there are no installers anywhere in the
county of Cornwall. That deprived group of people cannot access the
environmental benefits of the clause or take advantage of provisions
that would have an impact on their pockets and save them money. The
problem is that those people, whether they are in rented or privately
owned housing stock, will not be in a position to benefit from the
proposal.</div>
					<a name="07051548000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
great innovation out there, but I am worried that the measure is a very
limited way of stimulating increased development. In my constituency
there is a hot rocks project&#151;technologies investigating making
use of disused mines as a way of cutting down on heating costs. Carrick
Housing is being innovative in retrofitting those technologies to its
existing social housing stock. The proposed incentive sits outside that
framework, however. What plans are there for incentives not only for
people looking to buy new houses, but for developers and builders?
Ultimately, if using more energy-efficient materials increases costs,
the builder who uses them faces increased risk. What plans do the
Government have to tackle the inherent inefficiencies in the existing
housing
stock?</div>

these clauses, and that I would ensure that the regulations were
circulated in draft. I cleared them on Thursday. I understand that they
went from our office to the shadow Chief Secretary, the hon. Member for
Chipping Barnet, in the normal way on Friday. I should have endeavoured
to ensure that they got to the hon. Member for Wycombe directly as
well, so I appreciate the generosity of the shadow Chief Secretary. If
we were remiss, I apologise.</div>

important part of the Bill, which creates a regulation-making power on
which we will consult. In that light, and given that we intend to
conclude the consultation by July and publish a further set of
regulations, I would be happy&#151;subject to agreement from the
business managers&#151;if we could deal with the regulations under
the affirmative, rather than the negative, procedure, to ensure that
the House has a further opportunity to scrutinise the detail of the
regulations before they come into effect.</div>

						</b> I welcome the initiative in the light of the 27
per cent. of the UK&#146;s greenhouse gas emissions, or 40 million
tonnes a year, that are attributable to households. I am concerned that
from the outset there is a limited window of opportunity&#151;five
years&#151;attached to the scheme, however. As a business man, I
point out that the technology required to approach the standard of a
true zero-carbon home will require significant capital investment from
developers to reduce the high unit cost of microgeneration
technology.</div>

					<a name="07051548000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Treasury
is committed to achieving a culture of change within the building
industry, which I wholly support, it is unhelpful that these provisions
will be curtailed in 2012. I do not think that proposed new section
58B(7), which mentions the possibility that the Treasury will extend
its largesse, will be reassuring to the building industry when looking
at long-term investment decisions. The Chancellor&#146;s record shows
too many examples of initiatives that are cancelled once they have
begun to become effective&#151;the home computing initiative springs
to mind.</div>
					<a name="07051548000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
rationale seems to be that stamp duty relief will act as a catalyst for
change, after which it can be reassessed and presumably quietly
scrapped. However, a five-year window for that process to occur is
almost hopelessly optimistic; just how optimistic is shown by the fact
that the zero-carbon home is not so much an endangered species as a
mythical beast. Although the Chief Secretary says that some zero-carbon
homes have now popped up in his constituency, they are hardly
widespread. My point is that, even if developers make the decision to
develop zero-carbon homes, there will be such a long lead time that the
relief will have expired before such homes begin to appear in
meaningful
numbers.</div>

							<a name="07051548000447"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> If I could broaden the debate for a moment,
the hon. Gentleman was talking about lead times. Is it not the case
that, for individual planning applications, it may well be possible to
go ahead and submit a planning application for a very small
development? The problem is that there are very large developments on
the cards for the coming years which are exactly the type of
developments that need to be zero-carbon, but they will probably not go
ahead on that basis.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000448"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> The hon. Lady makes a good point in support of my
argument, and I thank her. As I said, my point is that, even if
developers make the decision to develop zero-carbon homes, there will
be such long lead times that the relief will have expired before such
homes start to appear in meaningful numbers.</div>
					<a name="07051548000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Aberdeen-based developers the
Stuart Milne group have already unveiled a prototype for a low-carbon
home. The prototype includes microgeneration technology, such as solar
panels and wind turbines, together with reuse of grey water and so on.
However, it is telling that the plans still fall short of the desired
six-star zero-carbon rating. Quite simply, it will take time to reach
the required standard and to roll out both the technology and best
practice across the industry. The managing director of the Stuart Milne
group had this to say:</div>
					<a name="07051548000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The single biggest
impact on our business will be climate change and we felt we should
take an industry lead by building a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>commercially viable house that reflected the Government&#146;s
objective to achieve zero carbon houses within a
decade.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the key
remains that the project must be commercially viable. It is no good
making such projects commercially viable for five years, then pulling
the rug from under the developers just when they are beginning to catch
on.</div>
					<a name="07051548000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one further
point to make on the envisaged time scale. As we have all heard, the
Chancellor has recently announced the construction of 100,000 new
eco-homes that will meet the zero-carbon standard. Perhaps we should
welcome the prospect that 100,000 new home owners will be able to buy
homes that benefit from clause 19, but precedent suggests that it will
take far longer than five years to deliver those homes. The last time
that this policy was launched was 10 years ago, as we heard from my
hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe. Then, there were high expectations
of the Government. Now, we know better.
</div>
					<a name="07051548000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some &#163;130
million has been spent on the seven millennium communities, delivering
homes to the excellence standard. I was amused to see&#151;perhaps
this is what my hon. Friend was alluding to&#151;that one of the
seven communities, which is in east Manchester, was in true new Labour
fashion named New Islington. It is a wonder that the Chancellor did not
go the whole hog and call it New Jerusalem, but I hope that he can at
least name a street after the Granita. The fact remains that after 10
years the homes have not been delivered, so the idea that a large
number of homes will be built in time to take advantage of clause 19
is, once again, optimistic.</div>
					<a name="07051548000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a zero-carbon standard
that many people think is unattainable, we have a very limited window
of opportunity to take advantage of tax relief, and we have a
Government with a strong track record of scrapping tax reliefs that are
actually used. If the Chancellor&#146;s 100,000 houses were to go on
the market at an average price of &#163;200,000 each, the Treasury
would forgo &#163;200 million in stamp duty. In contrast&#151;I
note that paragraph A2.10 on page 230 of the Red Book predicts that
&#147;The Exchequer cost&#148; of clause 19</div>
					<a name="07051548000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is expected to rise to around
&#163;15 million by
2011-12.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the
Chancellor is strong on mathematics, but that is an anticipated uptake
of only 7,500 carbon-free homes by 2012. Even if the Chief Secretary
cannot answer the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for
Wycombe, I hope that I have.</div>

&#163;15,000, which would mean that the &#163;15 million going to

							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): Like my hon. Friend, I
support the construction of energy-efficient housing and the
Government&#146;s objective in that respect. To help out in response
to the intervention from the hon. Member for Caerphilly, there are a
number of projects around the country, including in my south Shropshire
constituency, where imaginative, creative construction engineers are
coming up with projects to develop energy-efficient homes. They are not
necessarily all new homes. Many of them include energy efficiency
measures for existing homes that we discussed under earlier
clauses.</div>
					<a name="07051548000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings
me to the point of my contribution to this part of the debate. The
title of the clause that we are considering is not only misleading but
a misnomer. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe mentioned, the
measure defines zero-carbon homes in terms of energy efficiency in
ongoing maintenance and running costs once the property has been
constructed. Nothing in the definition in the Bill or in the draft
statutory instrument covers the construction costs of such homes. They
are not, therefore, zero-carbon, but they are energy efficient going
forward. It is unfortunate that the Government have chosen to cloak the
clause in green credentials by claiming for it something that it will
not actually deliver.</div>
					<a name="07051548000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">A much more effective means of
encouraging energy efficiency than the intended relief from stamp duty
would be the introduction of a zero rate of VAT on energy efficiency
measures. What work was done by the Treasury to compare the cost of the
measure before us and the cost of introduction a zero rate of VAT? That
would seem to be a much more effective way of kick-starting the
development of such properties, which is the Government&#146;s
objective.</div>
					<a name="07051548000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Red
Book, paragraph 7.70 on page 183 includes a reminder of the
Government&#146;s ambition</div>
					<a name="07051548000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to ensure that, within a decade,
all new homes will be zero
carbon.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a very
ambitious objective. The proposed measure will go only a modest way
towards achieving it&#151;such a modest way, in fact, that I have
been unable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>to find out from the analysis of policy decisions what revenue impact it
will have. There is no line setting out the impact of zero-carbon homes
on Government revenues this year, next year or the following year. By
their own admission, the Government anticipate that this will be a puny
measure and will contribute little to the achievement of their
objective.</div>
					<a name="07051548000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is no
surprise to those who have studied Government measures for energy
efficiency and VAT that a zero rate has not been introduced. Only last
year, the Government decided to apply VAT to grants given by the Energy
Saving Trust, which advises households on energy efficiency. Its
chairman told the BBC last
July:</div>
					<a name="07051548000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
collect about &#163;25m that we spend on energy efficiency measures
and reducing carbon, and we will now take about &#163;5m of those and
return it back to the
Treasury'&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051548000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						So
the Government are using energy efficiency measures as a
revenue-raising mechanism rather than to encourage increased energy
efficiency. This measure smacks of green gestures rather than of a
genuine commitment to greater energy efficiency in housing
construction.</div>

					<a name="07051548000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since 1997, carbon emissions
have risen, green taxes have fallen as a percentage of overall tax
take, and the Chancellor has missed his target on renewable energy. The
question to which all that gives rise is: why should we have confidence
in this new measure, which has
suddenly&#151;miraculously&#151;appeared in the Finance Bill,
almost as a knee-jerk reaction to pressure from other
parties?</div>

					<a name="07051548000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
might be misreading the regulations because I have looked at them so
quickly, it is clear that paragraph 14(3) on linked transactions

says:</div>

of each first acquisition of a zero-carbon
home&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051548000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">From a quick
calculation, it appears that the Government are allowing for only 1,000
homes to be sold under this regime. Where do the 100,000 zero-carbon
homes fit in? Where is the incentive to kick-start the market? How many
zero-carbon homes are expected to be built as a result of this measure?
It is trumpeted as being a wonderful thing, but as soon as one looks at
the detail, it appears almost trivial and irrelevant.</div>
					<a name="07051548000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally could the Economic
Secretary give us one or two tangible reasons why we should have
confidence in the measure, given that the regulations seem to be

exists?</div>

described that as a re-announcement and he may be correct, but let me
for the moment assume that it is an exciting, new and wholly original
proposal. If so, the time frame&#151;less than five and a half
years&#151;is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree pointed
out, a somewhat short period in which to benefit from the proposals in
the clause. Will there be time? If there is time, it suggests that
sites have already been identified. Perhaps there has been some

							<a name="07051548000457"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I am well aware of that.</div>
					<a name="07051548000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Wycombe referred to the announcement made in May 2006. Perhaps I can
focus on two other announcements made by the Minister for Housing and
Planning. In October 2006, she announced 45 new developments as part of
the new growth points programme. She described it as</div>
					<a name="07051548000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a significant opportunity for the
new communities to become exemplars of sustainability by pioneering
eco-development and encapsulating high design standards in parallel
with meeting the housing needs of local
communities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
that work might be useful in assisting the Chancellor in his exciting,
new and wholly original proposals that he announced at the weekend.
Perhaps even more relevant would be the announcement made in March this
year about new towns. As the Minister
said:</div>
					<a name="07051548000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Now is
the time for us to look at new
eco-towns&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051548000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
&#163;2 million fund was also announced for the purposes of these new
eco-towns in March, will the Chancellor be making use of that fund for
his new proposals?</div>
					<a name="07051548000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
appointment of David Lock, chair of the Town and Country Planning
Association, was also announced; he will report to the Government on
further developing the criteria for eco-towns. Will Professor
Lock&#146;s report be used for the Chancellor&#146;s new proposals?
If the&#163;2 million fund and Professor Lock&#146;s
report will indeed be used for those purposes, it may well increase the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>chance of those five new eco-towns being developed before October 2012,
but it might bring into question just how poor the original proposals
were.</div>
					<a name="07051548000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Braintree alluded to an important point, which is that
the Treasury tends to propose exemptions in order to encourage
particular behaviour. However, if that behaviour is actually carried
out on a much greater scale, that exemption and encouragement tends to
be withdrawn. The home computing initiative to which my hon. Friend
referred was a good example.</div>
					<a name="07051548000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that, within the
provisions of the clause, the Treasury has the opportunity to extend
the stamp duty land tax relief available for zero-carbon homes. Does
the Economic Secretary have any criteria in mind that might be used in
deciding whether to do so? Given that, by 2016, as we have heard, all
new homes are supposed to be zero-carbon, if there are, in fact, many
developments by 2012 would it indicate to the Treasury that the relief
is successful and should therefore be continued, or would it then
constitute too great a cost to the Exchequer and be withdrawn?
Conversely, if it is little used&#151;and, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Windsor pointed out, there are such indications&#151;would
that be an argument for abandoning the relief, because it proves to be
useless, or for maintaining it? I am conscious that the Economic
Secretary cannot bind his successors and that, by the time that we come
to make this decision, I shall perhaps be referring my questions to
those sitting on my Front Bench rather than to this Government. None
the less, I should be grateful for an indication of what the criteria
will be.</div>
					<a name="07051548000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, as
this relief will apply only to properties of less than &#163;500,000,
if house prices continue to grow substantially in the years ahead, a
home of &#163;500,000 might not be that exceptional by 2012. Indeed,
in some parts of the south-east of England, it is already not that
exceptional a price. Would the Government then look at reviewing the
figure of &#163;500,000, as that may preclude a lot of new properties
by 2012?</div>

							<a name="07051548000458"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> I am very grateful to you, Mr.
Gale, for ensuring that all Committee members have been provided with
drafts of the regulations and for giving me the opportunity to speak
again. Looking through the draft regulations conjured up concerns borne
out of my experience from working as a regeneration officer for Carrick
district council before being elected to Parliament. The area of my
work was in helping small businesses to access objective 1 funds, and
part of the funding available was for work and business space. Because
there was a real shortage of business space in Cornwall, it was one of
the few areas where private developers could access objective 1 funds.
Because there was such demand, tight environmental standards were set
for the buildings, so only those applications with the highest
environmental standards went forward.</div>
					<a name="07051548000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two things arose from that.
First, concerns arose from the fact that the goalposts kept moving,
which echoes the concerns of other Members about how people can have
confidence that the scheme will not be withdrawn or that higher
standards will be set. The moving goalposts undermined confidence in
that scheme. Secondly, there was a total lack of capacity to assess the
environmental standards that had been set. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>Even for those projects that were entirely compliant with all the
restrictions that had been specified by the objective 1 partnership, it
was impossible to find someone in the whole of the south-west
region&#151;not just in Cornwall&#151;who was qualified to say
whether the criteria had been met.</div>
					<a name="07051548000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern here is that an
accredited assessor will be appointed, but it is not clear from these
regulations whether all members of the accreditation scheme for the
energy performance and buildings regulations will be eligible to assess
whether a home is a zero-carbon home. I suspect that the experience
will be the same as mine when I worked for the Carrick regeneration
team. Particular people will be specifically qualified to comment on
whether a property is zero-carbon, but it is difficult to find such
people and, in practice, it could prove impossible.</div>
					<a name="07051548000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would appreciate the Economic
Secretary&#146;s comments on how many people he thinks will be
accredited, and what the spread will be across the country. My concern
is that it will end up being impossible to accredit anyone and that we
will encounter exactly the same problems that came up during my
experience working for the Carrick regeneration team. I therefore urge
him to hold a conversation with the objective 1 partnership office in
Cornwall to discuss the problems that it encountered and to find some
practical solution. If he does not, the regulations may encounter
problems in terms of
delivery.</div>

							<a name="07051548000459"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale, for your generosity
in dealing earlier with the points of order. It is a privilege to serve
under your chairmanship for the first time in a Finance Bill, and I
hope that we will be able to continue to have such a co-operative
relationship as we move towards the &#147;thank yous&#148;? As I
said in my point of order, to the extent that an error was made on my
part, I apologise in particular to the hon. Member for Wycombe, with
whom I had a direct conversation.</div>
					<a name="07051548000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The comments just made by the
hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, which drew on her own
experience, show that it would be desirable to debate the regulations
under the affirmative procedure if that can be done. In the policy area
in which I have been active in the Treasury, I always welcome the use
of the affirmative procedure. When important areas of policy are taken
forward, it is right that there should be an opportunity to discuss the
detail in the House. I think that sensible Ministers welcome such
opportunities. In this case, both because of the problem that we have
had this morning but because of the importance of the issues, that
would be desirable. I should also say&#151;I shall some back to this
in a moment&#151;that these are genuinely draft regulations for
consultation.</div>
					<a name="07051548000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation process over the next few months will be conducted
properly. There may well be changes, as an opportunity to revisit some
of the issues would be welcome if that could be achieved. I also think
that a debate would provide a welcome opportunity for Conservative
members to have a further chance to debate these matters. So far, I
have felt a sense of confusion among Conservative Members about the
measure. I cannot work out whether they think that it is a good thing,
or a bad thing; whether they think that it is insufficiently generous
or far too demanding; and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>whether they believe that the objective of zero-carbon homes is beyond
reach or whether the measures are insufficient to the task.</div>
					<a name="07051548000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have also noted the regular
tendency of Conservative Members, when talking about the environment,
to return to questions of presentation. When an announcement is made
and if we are to take forward an agenda on the environment or housing,
the important thing is to get beyond the presentation and start talking
about the substance. That is what the regulations are about.</div>
					<a name="07051548000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem with matters of
substance is that, when it comes to housing and the building of new
houses for first-time buyers, Conservative Members have been consistent
in their local opposition to building new houses. When it comes to the
measures that we have taken forward since 1997 on the environment, such
as the climate change levy, Conservative Members have been consistent
in their opposition to taking forward concrete action on the
environment. It would be my guess that over the next two years, there
will be an increasing debate, not simply about presentation but about
substance. Labour Members will relish those debates, because the more
we focus on substance, the more people will see that it is this party
that produces concrete proposals that deliver for hard-working
families. For all their spin and bluster, Opposition Members
consistently oppose measures to take forward policies for hard-working
families.</div>

					<a name="07051548000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause,
which deals with exemption from stamp duty and land tax for new
zero-carbon homes, will take effect from 1 October 2007. It will
kick-start the technologies and techniques needed to build zero-carbon
homes to meet our ambition that from 2016 all new homes should meet the
zero-carbon standard and make no net contribution to carbon emissions.
As hon. Members have noted, that has been a subject of much debate
lately. The issue has been with me day and night in recent
days&#151;</div>

take an idea, to build support not only in Parliament but among
voluntary organisations and house builders, to discuss it with local
authorities and the wider public, and to persuade what looks likely to
be the next Prime Minister to back it in public is the process of
policy-making that delivers hard outcomes. That is what has been going
on over the past year. I cannot work out whether Opposition Members
support the proposal or oppose it, or whether they are just confused.
When people read the <i class="I">Hansard</i> report, they will
conclude&#151;</div>

							<a name="07051548000462"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> The Economic Secretary places great significance on
being able to persuade the next Prime Minister to back a proposal that
was publicly made under the present Prime Minister. Is the hon.

announcements that were made under the previous Prime Minister, we
cannot necessarily assume that the Chancellor supports
them?</div>

							<a name="07051548000463"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> As I said, a notable feature of the debate is that
one listens hard but ends up being very confused by the contributions
of Opposition Members. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the
Budget a tax measure to back our zero-carbon homes plans, so he has
clearly been backing the proposal for some time. It was prefigured in
the pre-Budget
report.</div>
					<a name="07051548000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
that when the putative Prime Minister backs a measure on the campaign
trail it increases the substance and salience of the issue. Over the

in office, and the Leader of the Opposition. Debates of substance on
these issues will be very much welcomed on the Labour

							<a name="07051548000467"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> Encouraged by your good self, Mr. Gale,
and by the hon. Lady, I shall continue. I am happy to respond in detail
to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Wycombe and
others.</div>
					<a name="07051548000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
briefly put the proposal in context. We set ourselves a target to
reduce overall carbon emissions in the UK by 60 per cent. from 1990
levels by 2050. More than 25 per cent. of all carbon emissions in the
UK result from energy use in the home. In 2050, about one third of all
homes will have been built after 2016. If we can ensure that all homes
built after 2016 are zero carbon and that they will make no net carbon
emissions, it will make a very significant contribution towards the
2050 objectives. In answer to a question asked by Opposition Members,
if all new homes were zero carbon by 2016 the annual carbon saving
would be 8 million tonnes a year, amounting to 90 million tonnes saved
by 2050, which is a substantial potential contribution to meeting our
environmental challenge.</div>
					<a name="07051548000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I encourage Opposition Members,
particularly the hon. Member for Ludlow, to be more confident and
ambitious in backing our objective for zero-carbon homes, rather than
starting from a position of scepticism and conservatism. Our ambition
to have zero-carbon homes from 2016 is bold and radical, but I believe
that it is deliverable and I shall explain why.</div>
					<a name="07051548000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">In recent years, we have used
building regulations to improve the energy efficiency of new homes.
Changes to the building regulations in 2006 achieved a 40 per cent.
improvement on pre-2002 standards, and a 70 per cent. improvement on
pre-1990 standards in the efficiency of new homes. However, this
Government want to go further. In part, we will do that through
regulations that require that by 2016 new build houses will meet the
zero-carbon standard. As the hon. Gentleman knows&#151;this is
outside the scope of the Committee, but relevant to the debate&#151;a
consultation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>process on building regulations and the definition of
zero-carbon homes is under way, led by the Department for Communities
and Local Government.</div>
					<a name="07051548000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Guidance on
six different levels of sustainability has been issued to help the
industry. The strategy of the DCLG is to build the regulations up over
time toward the level that will ensure the building of zero-carbon
homes. Building regulations will play an important part in our
achieving our objective. We will also, as we heard in the announcements
that were made at the weekend, depend on local leadership. The
Government&#146;s objective is not to impose new planning
requirements or new eco-towns on local communities but to encourage
proposals for eco-towns to be made locally.</div>
					<a name="07051548000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge hon. Members on both
sides of the House to back such proposals rather than to be sceptical
about them. It is crucial to build a cross-party consensus in our
country on the importance of building sustainable homes. I am
continually frustrated that, for all the talk, Opposition Members all
too often appear to stand in the way of such developments. The right
way forward is not to impose from the centre but to encourage local
leadership. That is our objective in the eco-towns
proposal.</div>
					
					<a name="07051548000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000468"></a>Mr.
Goodman:
						</b> On the subject of frustration, I am waiting for
the Economic Secretary to answer some of the questions that were asked.
For example, given that he was able a few moments ago to give us a
figure for carbon savings, surely he can tell us how many zero-carbon
homes the Treasury estimates will be built as a result of this measure.
What is the
answer?</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> I am pleased to hear the Economic Secretary
speaking about the need for local leadership. However, I do not
understand how he can square that with the position that the Government
took on the Local Planning Authorities (Energy and Energy Efficiency)
Bill&#151;the private Member&#146;s Bill that came after Second
Reading of the Sustainable Communities Bill&#151;which specifically
allows local authorities to set higher environmental standards when
giving planning permission for properties. Why did the Government take
that position and how does he resolve the
contradiction?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000471"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> That point goes well outside the responsibility of
the Treasury or the scope of this Committee. However, a consultation is
under way on building regulations for interim steps to improve
standards between 2010 and 2013, before we go to full zero-carbon homes
by 2016. The Government have launched the code for sustainable homes in
England as a voluntary standard. It will allocate a star rating from
one to six for new homes by assessing their overall sustainability and
setting out aspirations for new build housing. Progress is being
made.</div>
					<a name="07051548000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
that we make progress on social housing, too. We have announced that
the minimum requirement on all homes built with social housing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>grant or on English Partnerships-developed land will be to meet code
level three. That is a 25 per cent. improvement on current building
regulations for energy performance. Obviously, we want to go further in
that area, too. The lead on that, however, will be taken by the
Minister for Housing and Planning rather than by me. My role is to talk
about the tax measure that we are introducing today, which I shall turn
to now.</div>
					<a name="07051548000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
amends the stamp duty land tax legislation in the Finance Act 2003 by
inserting new sections to deal with relief or exemption for the first
sale of new zero-carbon homes. They will enable the Government to make
regulations to define zero-carbon homes, to quantify the amount of
relief or exemption and to deal with administrative matters. The
regulations will cease to have effect at the end of a five-year period,
on 30 September 2012, unless we decide to extend that relief further.
In the Budget, we said that we will review the effectiveness of the
relief before the end of that period to see whether it should be
extended. We will make that decision in the light of the circumstances
at the time and the effectiveness and cost of the
measure.</div>
					<a name="07051548000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To
the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, I say that we will use a
range of criteria to assess the measure. If it turns out that the
objective has already been reached by the time of the assessment and
every home is zero-carbon, that might suggest that we do not need to
continue with the measure. If, as I anticipate, developments are
proceeding apace but there is still further to go, it might be right to
extend the relief, subject to cost considerations, which the Chancellor
of the day will have to consider carefully. In this area, it is
sensible to make policy by setting out regulations for five years, to
assess performance along the way and to give a clear, public signal of
our future intentions well in advance of the end of that five-year
period. That is what we will
do.</div>

						</b> From my business background, and given how long
it takes to build properties, it seems to me that putting a short time

developing new homes? It sends no confidence signal at

take the intervention.</div>
					<a name="07051548000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulations that we set out
are in draft. For reasons of good policy making and wider politics, we
welcome the opportunity to have a further debate if the business
managers allow. We genuinely intend to consult on the regulations. The
Department for Communities and Local Government is currently consulting
on the definition of zero-carbon homes by 2016, which is part of the
reason why our approach must be consultative. Our regulations are
running in parallel, and it desirable that those consultations end up
with aligned definitions. That is our hope and expectation. The
regulations will therefore have to be considered in the light of those
wider
consultations.</div>
					<a name="07051548000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first exemption will be complete for all new homes priced at less than
&#163;500,000; purchases above that level will benefit by
&#163;15,000. Stamp duty land tax will be paid only on the balance,
which is equivalent to stamp duty at &#163;500,000. The regulations
set out a technical definition of a zero-carbon home, but that is in
draft and for consultation.</div>
					<a name="07051548000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for Falmouth
and Camborne said, the regulations provide for operational matters,
particularly certification. Stamp duty is a one-off tax, so it is
important to ensure that the certification is robust and protects us
against avoidance when we levy it, and that is partly why we need to
ensure that we get the consultation right. Finally, the regulations
also contain rules about microgeneration and dealing with linked

						</b> The hon. Gentleman has intervened to make exactly
the same point that he made in his speech. Given that it is the same, I
will answer both his speech and his intervention now. The London
Development Agency has earmarked the site for the development of a
zero&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Ah!&#148;]
Ah? The agency has earmarked the site for the development of a
zero-carbon house&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;A house?&#148;] Sorry, homes. A developer has been announced
since the pre-Budget report, and the GLA has appointed an approved
contractor. The development is within GLA guidelines, as the hon.
Gentleman knows. In due 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>course, under the present process, planning permission will be
considered. Has planning permission been granted at this stage? As I
understand it, it has not. The reason is that the development is going
through the planning process. That is what happens when we build
houses: we go through a planning process, and that is what is going on
with that development.</div>
					<a name="07051548000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There is also
a development on surplus public land at Northstowe in Cambridgeshire,
which is intended to be an exemplar growth-area development. The
development aims to be low carbon, but I do not believe that it is
intended to be zero carbon at this stage.</div>
					<a name="07051548000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I explained earlier, the
ambition is to move towards all homes being zero carbon by 2016. The
starting point today is that few or no homes are zero carbon. We have
set out to achieve our objective by 2016 and we believe that it can be
achieved by steadily building up building regulations and using a tax
incentive to encourage developers to take the necessary steps. That
objective can be achieved by 2016, but it is not being achieved today.
We are taking the proposed steps so that we can save a further 8
million tonnes by 2016.</div>
					<a name="07051548000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are few or no zero-carbon
homes today. As the Chief Secretary said on the Floor of the House,
there is intended to be a development in his constituency and there are
small demonstration projects around the country. However, we are
starting with no or few zero-carbon homes and we intend to get to the
point where 200,000 such homes are built each year by 2016&#151;that
is the ambition. When hon. Members say that there are no zero-carbon
homes today and say &#147;Ah!&#148;, they are right, which is why
we are introducing a policy of regulations and tax incentives to
achieve our objective. Opposition Members were very sceptical about
whether our objective is deliverable, and I understand that, but I
disagree. By taking the right action, we can deliver on our objective
of moving from zero homes to 200,000 over the next eight
years.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Francois</b> (Rayleigh) (Con): Let us return to Gallions
Park as an example of the process that is under way. If I heard the
Economic Secretary correctly, he said that planning permission had not
yet been granted for zero-carbon homes at that location. However, he
implied, although did not state, that a planning application had been
submitted. If so, it would have to specify how many zero-carbon homes
were proposed. Will he confirm whether a planning application has been
submitted for zero-carbon homes at Gallions Park and, if so, how many
are to be zero carbon?</div>

						</b> I shall finish the point first. The development
intends to deliver zero-carbon homes&#151;that is its objective, as I

and a contractor has been approved. It is a good job that it is in a
constituency that has a Labour Member of Parliament. I fear that if it
had had an Opposition Member of Parliament, there would have been local
objections on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

								Mr.
Francois:
						</b> This doctrine that the Economic Secretary has
developed that Members of Parliament and Ministers do not comment on
planning applications is a revelation to me. The Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government has a great history of commenting on
planning applications&#151;usually to object to them in her own
constituency. He has reinvented parliamentary doctrine on his
feet.</div>
					<a name="07051548000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come back to
the point, a planning application, by definition, is a publicly
available document&#151;under the planning process, it has to be.
Given that it is a publicly available document, there should be no
problem about the Economic Secretary&#146;s commenting on it. Has a
planning application been submitted at Gallions Park and, if so, how
many zero-carbon homes are in it? Will he answer those two simple
questions?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000487"></a>Ed

						</b> As I said, it would be entirely inappropriate for a
Treasury Minister, during proceedings on a Finance Bill, to comment on
a particular housing development. I am not going to comment on what
individual Members do in their constituencies. That is a matter for
them. I shall just point out that, as it happens, hon. Members opposite
consistently oppose housing developments in their
constituencies.</div>
					<a name="07051548000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the case of Gallions Park, I am advised that the planning process is
under way. I do not know what stage it is at, and there is no reason
for me to know that. All I know is that the intention is that it will
be a development of zero-carbon homes. The hon. Gentleman is trying to
make the point that there are currently no zero-carbon homes. I would
say that he is right. There are none. That is why we are legislating in
the Finance Bill, with public money, for an incentive to deliver such
homes&#151;in fact, for all homes to be zero carbon by
2016.</div>
					<a name="07051548000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said to
the hon. Member for Wycombe last week, I cannot understand the point
that hon. Members are making. If they are claiming that there are no
zero-carbon homes today, they are correct. Luckily, we have a
Government with the confidence and commitment to set an objective to
deliver zero-carbon homes by 2016 and to take the actions on tax and
regulation to achieve that. If the hon. Gentleman would clarify his
point, it would help me very
much.</div>

2016, and we are currently consulting on regulation changes and
legislating on tax so that we can start the process of getting
zero-carbon homes&#151;so far as I am concerned, today there may well
be none.</div>

					<a name="07051548000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know the answer to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s question. It may well be that there are a
number&#151;a small number&#151;of lower-carbon homes around the
country. Given that the Department for Communities and Local Government
is currently consulting on what the definition of zero-carbon homes
should be, and given that we are consulting on draft regulations about
what the definition of zero-carbon homes for tax purposes should be, I
am afraid that the answer to the question of how many zero-carbon homes
there are rather depends on the outcome of those two
consultations.</div>
					<a name="07051548000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that the hon. Gentleman seems to enjoy making is unbelievably
obscure, and therefore we might as well all agree that we are starting
from a position whereby the number of zero-carbon homes is low or zero
and our objective is to get to 200,000 a year. Perhaps we should get on
to the substance of whether we are taking the right decisions on
regulation and tax to reach that objective, rather than engaging in
this seemingly obscure and meaningless
debate.</div>

							<a name="07051548000499"></a>Ed

						</b> I shall come on to the substance of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question, which is about the costings.</div>
					<a name="07051548000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, we start from a
position where a small number, or zero, homes are zero carbon. We are
consulting on exactly what the definition of zero-carbon homes should
be for tax purposes; it is a genuine consultation, and it was conducted
mainly to change the regulations following that consultation. Our aim
is to get from zero to 200,000 zero-carbon homes a year by 2016. At
this stage, given that this is uncharted territory, we do not know what
the pace of build-up will be. It will depend on the way in which the
regulations are calibrated and ratcheted up, and also on the success of
this tax measure. It is not easy for us to make a forecast. Therefore,
the Treasury has to make a decision as to how we sensibly cost this
measure in the Finance Bill, when we do not know exactly what the
outcome is likely to be. There is not really any sensible basis for a
forecast, because we are starting, essentially, from zero.</div>
					<a name="07051548000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">We took the view that we start
from zero and will get to 200,000 in 2016, and that the build-up will
not be linear, or like a straight line, but that there will be a
progressive acceleration over that period. On the basis of that, from
nought today to 200,000 a year by 2016, and on the basis of the stamp
duty relief that we have set out today, we will produce a
costing.</div>

the target will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>reached faster than in that non-linear projection; it may well be that
that happens more slowly. If it happens more slowly, we will either
have a later acceleration or miss the target. We may need to make the
relief more generous. If it happens faster, it may well be that the
cost of the measure will exceed our estimates&#151;a very desirable
thing indeed. This is one of those areas where the Treasury would be
pleased if the cost of the measure exceeded our expectations. We have
projected forward from zero to 200,000 on a curve, and produced some
costings on that basis.</div>

nature of the exercise, it would not be sensible for us to set out in

would give the impression that the process was based on science and
forecasting, and that it was an objective. Frankly, it does not have
that status. We do not know what the take-up will be, but we will have
much more evidence in a year or two. It is a sensible, projected way to
cost, and that is what we have
done.</div>

that does not satisfy the hon. Member for Wycombe, but it is the best
way to proceed, given that what we are doing is so innovative. It has
not been done before, and there is no sensible way of making a

forecast, but our objective is to get from zero to 200,000 a year by
2016.</div>

of a low or zero-carbon house will be, surely that should be the point
at which to determine what tax incentives might be necessary to provide
the correct incentive for a large number of such properties to be

we are using language carefully, which hon. Members mocked, and
kick-starting a process. If something like a motor bike is
kick-started, it is because it is stationary and one wants it to move
forward. There are very few carbon-zero homes and we want to kick-start
the process by saying that as well as regulatory change there will also
be a tax incentive on the table. That is what we are legislating for,
and consulting on in the case of the regulations, so that we can
kick-start a path towards 200,000 such houses a year by
2016.</div>

will be able to see whether the stamp duty exemption&#151;it is only
part of the package; the regulations are also important&#151;is
sufficient. We do not know the answer, which is why we must return to
the matter following a debate in Committee on future Budgets. We may
need to make the measure more generous, or we may find when we look in
advance of 2012 that we were more generous that we needed to be and
that there is a lot of dead-weight cost.</div>

challenging, given the planning challenges and so on. How many business

								The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):
						</b> As the
Committee knows, the aggregates levy is designed to bring environmental
benefits by making the price of aggregates better reflect their true
environmental costs, and therefore encouraging recycling and the use of
alternative
materials.</div>
					<a name="07051548000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
introduces a new exemption from the levy for aggregate removed from the
ground along the proposed line of a railway, tramway or monorail in the
course of maintaining, constructing or improving it, provided that the
aggregate was not excavated purely for the purpose of extracting it. It
makes the treatment of railways, tramways and monorail consistent with
those of the construction and maintenance of highways. It is also
consistent with the environmental rationale, which is to give aggregate
produced as a by-product a commercial advantage over directly quarried
aggregate.</div>
					<a name="07051548000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect
that the cost of the revenue exemption in the clause is unlikely to
exceed &#163;3 million each year. We treat that as an estimate,
therefore there are no specific calculations of the tonnage that will
be affected. I hope that is sufficient information for the Committee to
accept the clause.</div>

not actually named in the notes, but it is the regulatory body that
oversees environmental bodies that make use of the landfill communities
fund&#151;and to HMRC, which oversees Entrust. The scheme, which
allows a portion of the landfill tax to be given to local community
social and environmental schemes, was reformed in 2003 following fears
that it was being abused to some degree. The HMRC website lists further
changes that the clause will bring about. How many environmental bodies
had their approvals by Entrust revoked in 2004-05 and during subsequent
years, and what is the cost of administering the
scheme?</div>

								John
Healey:
						</b> The clause should improve the operation of the
landfill communities fund, which was known until last year as the
landfill tax credit scheme. Every member of the Committee will have a
significant number of projects or schemes in their constituency that
have been supported in recent years by the landfill communities
fund&#151;valuable projects, such as improving, building and
repairing village halls, churches or historic buildings, or providing
sports facilities, cycle trails and wildlife sanctuaries. Since the
fund was set up, it has received &#163;875 million towards such ends,
providing projects and schemes that benefit a spectrum of our
communities.</div>
					<a name="07051548000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						HMRC approves
a regulatory body to oversee the fund. Currently, that body is Entrust.
We have not specified Entrust in the legislation, because, as the hon.
Gentleman will recognise, there might be circumstances&#151;although
we do not have this planned&#151;in which the regulator body would
change. It does not seem sensible, therefore, to specify Entrust in the
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07051548000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Entrust
oversees a fund that we increased in the Budget by a further &#163;5
million, so that it will be worth &#163;65 million in this coming
year. It already works to conditions agreed by HMRC that are contained
in its terms of approval, which is a document agreed between HMRC and
Entrust each year. The statutory instrument provided for by the clause
will enable the commissioners to impose enforceable conditions. In the
event of a failure to observe those conditions, they may take steps in
extremis to revoke the approval of the regulatory body.</div>
					<a name="07051548000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statutory instrument will
give a binding effect to any targets or performance measures that the
commissioners might wish to see from Entrust. It will also allow
Entrust to add or remove conditions on environmental bodies in line
with best practice and the principles of better regulation. Under the
conditions of its approval, Entrust will now have to provide the
commissioners with advance notice and obtain their agreement to any
general conditions it intends to impose on environmental
bodies.</div>
					<a name="07051548000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
condition that is being added will require environmental bodies to
provide project details in advance of spending. That is already
established as best practice and is followed in the vast majority of
cases. However, at present when it is not followed and when there is
resistance from the environmental body, Entrust is not in a situation
in which it can require that the environmental body follows those best
practices. Indeed, as things stand, an environmental body that was
determined not to follow the best practices as set out by the regulator
could challenge Entrust&#146;s ability to insist on them. The clause
and the regulation that stems from it will remove that uncertainty and
reinforce Entrust&#146;s hand, quite rightly, in ensuring that
environmental bodies follow the best practice that it sets. There is
negligible cost to the Exchequer from the changes.</div>
					<a name="07051548000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman simply asked
how many environmental bodies had had their approvals revoked in
2004-05. A very small number have had them compulsorily revoked. My
estimate, from dealing with this territory in the past few years, is
fewer than five, but, if he will accept this way of dealing with
things, I shall write to him if I recover further information from
HMRC.</div>

							<a name="07051548000516"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> It is a pleasure to address the Committee in the
pre-lunch graveyard slot. Schedule 3 provides for the insertion of new
section 61B into the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, which
contains conditions setting out the definition of what is known as a
managed service company; that is the focus of this measure. Where the
relevant conditions are satisfied in relation to a particular company
it will be obliged to account for PAYE and national insurance on
payments that it has made in connection with the services of the
workers whose services it provides.</div>
					<a name="07051548000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the company does not make
those payments, schedule 3&#146;s proposed new section 688A of ITEPA
allows HMRC to pursue certain third parties for the tax liability. The
provisions represent the Treasury&#146;s latest attempt to police the
borderline between those operating and providing services of a
freelance and contracting nature through companies, and those who are
employed. They are a successor to chapter 8 ofpart 2 of ITEPA,
the controversial measure commonly referred to as
IR35.</div>
					
					<a name="07051548000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051548000517"></a>
							<b class="B">Stephen
Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): The hon. Lady will recall
our debates in the House on clause 25. She and I discussed IR35, which
she has now conveniently mentioned. I said to her that Opposition
Members had overplayed its problems, and were overplaying the problems
with the schedule, and that no one had ever approached me in my
constituency subsequent to the previous so-called row.</div>
					<a name="07051548000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">After I said that, one of the
so-called organisations that she seeks to represent put on its website
a message encouraging people in Wirral, West to contact me if they had
had problems with IR35, because I had said that there had not been any.
No one contacted me, except one person who turned out not to be my
constituent. What she is about to say is overplaying the problems with
the
schedule.</div>
					
					<a name="07051548000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000518"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I do not accept that we are overplaying concern
about schedule 3, and I shall refer to some of the contractors who have
been in touch with me about the fact that their work is in jeopardy and
they are suffering problems because of the schedule and the uncertainty
associated with it. I understand that IR35 has cost an incredible
amount of money and time in compliance checking. It is regrettable that
the Government have always refused to publish any information on the
revenue that they have collected through IR35, given the significant
compliance burden that it has placed on every contractor; every time
contractors enter into a contract with an end client they must check.
That costs money. I am not convinced that the revenue raised as a
result has justified that compliance cost.</div>
					<a name="07051548000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Opposition are happy to support properly targeted attempts to crack
down on abusive behaviour in that area. However, we are concerned that
legitimate freelance workers who are genuinely in business on their own

<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>account will be hit by schedule 3 where they choose to outsource
functions relating to the service company with which they are
connected. Similar concerns have been expressed by a range of bodies,
including the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales,
the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Law Society, the Professional
Contractors Group, the London Society of Chartered Accountants, the
Institute of Directors and the Association of Technology Staffing
Companies.</div>
					<a name="07051548000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The goal
of the amendments that we have tabled is to prevent the new framework
from biting on genuine freelance workers who are not in a disguised
employment relationship. We also seek to ensure that those
professionals who advise freelancers and small service companies are
not unwittingly or unfairly caught up in the legislation and made
liable for the tax debts of their clients. Lastly, we seek to prevent
the serious damage that could be caused to the flexibility of the UK
labour market if staffing companies and the end clients who engage
contractors find themselves at risk as a result of schedule
3.</div>
					<a name="07051548000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Above all, we will
be seeking clarity and certainty from the Minister about what his
legislation means. That is an incredibly important task for the
Committee&#151;even more important, dare I say it, than in our
previous debate on how many zero-carbon homes there might or might not
be. The confusion surrounding schedule 3 is causing enormous anxiety
and it is already costing people their jobs. To illustrate that, as I
told the hon. Member for Wirral, West, who intervened earlier, I will
refer to just three of many representations that I have received from
people worried about the proposals.</div>
					<a name="07051548000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ian Preece, director of
Greybeard Consulting Ltd, told me:</div>
					<a name="07051548000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the biggest issue I have with the
proposed legislation is the fact that it is impossible to understand if
you will be &#145;caught&#146; or not. Therefore trying to
understand if I will be affected or not is akin to gazing into a
crystal ball.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Andrew
Frith of AFMS, an IT consultancy based in the north-west, told
me:</div>
					<a name="07051548000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We seem
to have fallen victim to the new MSC regulations even though the
legislation is not yet on the statute books and in any case would not
seem to directly affect our company at all. The problem is that due to
the transfer of debt provisions...recruitment agencies are not prepared
to deal with us &#145;just in case&#146; we come within the
provisions. Our supply of new work for our consultants has dried
up...we are now making a significant loss and have already had to
take action by giving notice to our newest
recruit.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chris Cumber,
who runs a small contracting business, said:</div>
					<a name="07051548000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My concern is that my
accountant appears unable to answer my question &#145;Does his
involvement make my company an MSC?&#146;. I seem to be spending more
and more time worrying about uncertain taxation and less time actually
producing income for my company. The latest attempt is badly
worded...and designed...to have us contractors running around like
ants&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051548000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">He concluded on
this pessimistic
note:</div>
					<a name="07051548000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It will
all end in tears with some case-law, which is totally
counter-productive for the Chancellor&#146;s coffers and for us
contractors&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051548000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
introduced the general issues, I will deal with amendments
Nos. 40, 41, 45 and 46, which go to the heart of the concerns
that I have set out. Subsection (1)(d) and subsection (3) of proposed
new section 61B, which these amendments seek to amend, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>play a central role in determining the scope of the provisions under
discussion. Paragraph (d) states that a company becomes an MSC if it is
involved with &#147;an MSC provider&#148;, which is defined as
someone who</div>
					<a name="07051548000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;carries on
a business of promoting or facilitating the use of companies to provide
the services of individuals&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051548000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3) provides a limited

					<a name="07051548000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
45 and 46 would clarify the ambit of the protection afforded to
professionals under subsection (3).</div>
					<a name="07051548000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Those four
amendments seek to address the concern that the definition of MSC
provider is very wide, and would catch anyone involved in setting up
companies as part of their business&#151;for example, lawyers,
accountants and company secretaries. The amendments tackle an important
flaw in the legislation, in that it could hit genuine freelancers who
choose to outsource aspects of the management of the companies through
which they work. Without clarification, paragraph (d) could also impose
significant risks on those who regularly advise freelance workers and
it would leave them potentially liable for the tax debts of their
clients, as well as leaving them at risk of being sued by other people
who might be drawn into the MSC net or the third-party debt rules as a
result of the professional adviser&#146;s activities.</div>
					<a name="07051548000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The danger is
that that will drive up the cost of professional advice for small
companies, as advisers withdraw from the market or charge higher fees
in order to compensate for the increased risk that they are
undertaking. The intention behind the four amendments is to ensure that
the legislation does not impose unreasonable restrictions on
contractors who want to outsource administrative functions in relation
to their service companies and that ordinary professionals on a
day-to-day basis are not included in the definition of MSC
providers.</div>
					<a name="07051548000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
question that the Committee needs to address is how do we ensure that a
sensible line is drawn between those professionals operating on an
ordinary, day-to-day basis and the dubious operators whom HMRC wants to
shut down. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has highlighted,
naturally, some of the problems that its profession faces. It points
out that many accountants will recommend a corporate structure to a
client, provide them with an off-the-shelf company for that purpose and
then go on to carry out the necessary company secretarial
services.</div>
					<a name="07051548000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
clarification of the legislation, it would appear that a professional
accountant who advises her client to incorporate in that way is
&#147;promoting&#148; the use of companies under paragraph (d). If
she provides an off-the-shelf company for that purpose, she is
&#147;facilitating&#148; the use of companies under
that
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>paragraph. However, as the Institute of Chartered Accountants points
out, those activities are an incidental part of a professional
accountant&#146;s business of providing an all-round service to the
client.</div>
					<a name="07051548000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Considerable
concern has been expressed about the wide scope of the concept of
&#147;promoting&#148; in paragraph (d). If accountants provide
services relating to company structures, will advertising those
services automatically bring them within the scope of paragraph (d)?
Arguably, promoting services relating to setting up companies is
promoting the use of those service companies, which could pull them
into the scope of the MSC provisions. Any clarification the Minister
can give on what &#147;promotion&#148; means and how it will
operate in practice would be very
welcome.</div>
					<a name="07051548000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) of proposed new section 61B introduces a second concept:
influencing. The problems in this area are compounded by
newsection 61B(2), with its broad concept of involvement with
a company. It is focused around the concept of
&#147;influence&#148;, yet any professional adviser could be
expected to influence their client. People do not go to professional
advisers and pay them large fees unless they are considering acting on
their advice. Advice and influence are inextricably linked. In
particular, many advisers will give clients advice on the best way to
make payments. That could bring them within new subsection (2)(c).
Surely it is not worth engaging an accountant unless they have at least
some influence over the company&#146;s finances or activities. That
seems to bring them within the scope of new subsection
(2)(d).</div>
					<a name="07051548000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The solicitors
Blake Lapthorn Tarlow Lyons, advising members of the Association of
Technology Staffing Companies, commented on the influence
tests:</div>
					<a name="07051548000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Note
that it is enough for any one of these (still rather sweeping and hard
to interpret) tests to be satisfied.</div>
					<a name="07051548000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">They do not all have to be
satisfied.</div>
					<a name="07051548000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">Clearly
this captures many so called Personal Service Companies who thought
that they would be outside the new legislation...The test can be
satisfied by the fact of the MSC provider receiving ongoing payments
linked to the contractor&#146;s ongoing services, or
&#145;influence&#146; over how payments are made or activities
carried out.</div>
					<a name="07051548000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">Therefore it is intended that
the only types of PSC who are outside the new regime are ones who
genuinely do not use third party assistance to setup or operate or
manage their
PSC.&#148;</div>
				
					<a name="07051548000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is at least a risk that the concept of influence could be so broad as
to cover insurance companies. By way of illustration, selling insurance
to small service companies, for example to cover professional risk,
certainly facilitates the use of such companies, which could pass the
test set out in paragraph (d) of proposed new section 61B. However, an
insurance company that sells such policies to contractors may lay down
particular rules and working practices to mitigate risk. Does that mean
that the insurance company is &#147;influencing&#148; within the
meaning of subsection (2)(b)? There is therefore a danger that it could
become liable for the tax debts of the companies it insures. As an
insurance company, there is no way it could get the protection of
subsection (3), because it cannot be described as offering services
relating to accounting or legal services.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07051548000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar
problems occur for company formation agents. A core part of their
business is setting up companies. Again, their services facilitate the
use of companies that provide the services of individuals. It seems
that the legislation is not intended to bite in that way. It is not
intended to hit ordinary accountants, insurers or company formation
agents who just happen to be providing services to small service
companies as part of their
business.</div>
					<a name="07051548000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC seems
to have indicated that the target of the legislation is those who set
up companies to provide the services of individuals as a discernable
and core part, not an incidental or occasional part, of their business.
Amendment No. 40 translates that informal indication into the wording
of the legislation. Proposed new section 61B(1)(d) would catch only
those whose sole or main business is providing or facilitating the use
of companies through which to provide the services of individuals. It
is these specialists that HMRC seems to be concerned about. The
Opposition believe that amendments Nos. 40 and 41 would greatly assist
in targeting those providers, while leaving other advisers outside the
scope of the legislation.</div>
					<a name="07051548000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC has also indicated that
the average accountant, company secretary, or formation agent would not
be caught by the legislation, because they are not sufficiently
involved with the company, even if they have set it up and run its
books and statutory returns. It seems to want to focus on someone who
takes over all the activities of the company, so that its ostensible
proprietor has no meaningful involvement. Why not make this clearer in
the legislation? The situation the Government seem to want to get at is
where the company is essentially the creature of the scheme provider.
In seeking to draw a distinction between what they describe as
&#147;personal service companies&#148; and &#147;managed service
companies&#148;, they seem to be concerned about a situation where
the worker does not really have any involvement with the company at all
and the company is the emanation of the scheme provider and not a
genuine going concern.</div>
					<a name="07051548000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 41 would give
real substance to that interpretation by stating that companies would
be caught in the definition of an MSC provider only if they are
regularly involved in almost all aspects of the way the company works.
Situations where the company is a genuine going concern and the worker
has merely decided to outsource an aspect of running it, are less
likely to be hit if the Committee were prepared to accept amendment No.
41.</div>
					<a name="07051548000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not enough
for HMRC to issue guidelines which seek to remove and mitigate some of
the risks, which I have just outlined, for both contractors and their
professional advisers. Guidance does not give enough certainty. Firms
under risk of falling within the MSC provisions are under significant
financial and legal risk to the last penny of their personal wealth.
They are likely to have to make significant provision for litigation
risk, and there are indications that the risk may be uninsurable.
Guidance cannot be litigated in court, so there will be no
clarification through legal proceedings. As the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of England and Wales has pointed out:</div>
					<a name="07051548000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is no substitute
for having a legal definition.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>
					<a name="07051548000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clarification of what this provision means
is needed now and not in two or three years&#146; time, when a case
may have made its way through the courts.</div>
					<a name="07051548000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to the closely
linked issue of the safe harbour for professional advisers in
subsection (3), because the Minister will no doubt tell me that that
sorts out all the problems. If amendments Nos. 40 and 41 were adopted
to rein in the scope of paragraph (d), most of the problems in relation
to professional advisers would fall away and the scope of the safe
harbour in subsection (3) would become much less important. However,
amendments Nos. 45 and 46 seek further clarification on the safe
harbour for professionals and the meaning of</div>
					<a name="07051548000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;providing legal or accountancy
services in a professional
capacity.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051548000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment
No. 45 would broaden the range of professionals who could use the safe
harbour, while retaining the focus on services provided in a
professional capacity, such as through a practice. Amendment No. 46
would set out some of the services that will not trigger problems with
the MSC legislation. Given that the real difficulty in finding a
general formulation that covers the wrongdoers but leaves the innocent
adviser outside the framework, setting out a non-exhaustive list of
services could be one of the simplest and most effective ways to give
the clarity and certainty that we so badly need here. It would give
critically important assurance and guidance to those who want to comply
with the
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07051548000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new subsection (3)(b) would also give the Treasury power to set out in
secondary legislation further examples of services that professionals
could safely provide without incurring any risk of the MSC legislation.
Parliament would also have the chance to keep a close eye on how the
legislation is working in practice when the secondary legislation came
to it for scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07051548000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The simple question for the
Committee to consider is what types of services can accountants,
lawyers and other professionals continue to offer to small service
companies without losing the protection of the safe harbour set out in
subsection (3). There seem to be at least three possible approaches.
First, a narrow one, which says that a safe harbour covers only basic,
traditional accounting services and legal services, such as
bookkeeping. Secondly, there is a wider definition that could cover any
services ordinarily provided by accountants. The third approach would
cover accountancy services ordinarily provided in the course of an
accountancy business.</div>
					<a name="07051548000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need much greater
clarification on services, such as invoicing and routine tax advice,
company secretarial services and IR35 compliance checking, and on which
side of the divide they fall. Accountants frequently perform many of
those services, so a wide interpretation would not cause a problem.
However, if a more restrictive interpretation is correct, setting up
companies and company secretarial services might fall outside the safe
harbour and leave the accountant at risk of
liability.</div>

							<a name="07051548000519"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> The hon. Lady is making a good case, but she seems
to be narrowly focusing on accountancy in general and not on
secretarial services. In the case of many contractors, the agents whom
they instruct may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>well advise them on specialist training courses before, for example,
taking an offshore North sea job. They could be advised on
accommodation, if they were going to take a job in engineering or a
contract job in the middle east. Those are perfectly legitimate things
to do in the early stages of acquiring a contract, so should we not
agree that the scope of the exemptions must be as wide as possible
rather than using the narrow definition for
accountancy?</div>
					
					<a name="07051548000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051548000520"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> If I understand it correctly, the hon. Gentleman
is concerned about the position of employment agencies and staffing
companies, which I shall come to in due course. He is absolutely right
to say that it is not only accountants and lawyers under consideration
here. We must ensure that we get clarity from all the relevant parties,
or contractors are going to find life very difficult&#151;their costs
will increase and the flexibility of the UK labour market will be
damaged as a result.</div>
					<a name="07051548000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a series of questions for the Minister about what is meant by
&#147;in a professional capacity&#148; in subsection (3). First, is
it the nature of the services provided that determines whether someone
is an MSC provider, or is the question determined by the qualification
of the professional status of the person providing the service? If
someone is providing services &#147;in a professional
capacity&#148;, do they fall outside the MSC provider definition,
regardless of what services that they perform? Is it possible for
anyone who is not part of a regulated profession to use the subsection
(3) safe harbour? Do people need a current practice certificate in that
profession to use the safe harbour? Does one need to be part of a
traditional professional practice? What about accountants and other tax
professionals, who are not registered but who are instead employed
in-house? And to what extent can service providers outside the remit of
the traditional professional set-up use the safe
harbour?</div>
					<a name="07051548000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings
me to a series of questions about accounting service companies, which
have emerged in recent years to offer companies cheap, commoditised
services, which were previously offered only by accountants. Does the
Minister envisage that any accounting service companies would be able
under any circumstances to use the carve-out in subsection (3)? Some of
them seem to think that they can carry on almost as normal, if they
have an accountant on their books. Does an accounting service company
have to be owned by qualified professionals with current practising
certificates to use the safe
harbour?</div>
					<a name="07051548000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly there
are players in the accounting services sector that the Government want
to shut down. HMRC has some justified concerns in this area, but my
concern is that there is no evidence that all accounting services are
somehow dodgy. Do the Government envisage that any of those companies
will be able to survive under the new framework? Do they want to shut
them all down? If so, a slightly unfortunate side effect of the
legislation seems to be that freelancers would be completely barred
from using specialist providers to manage their company affairs and
would be restricted only to using the more traditional accountants, who
have a more broadly based area of work. I would be interested to hear
whether there will still be room for cheaper and more commoditised,
factory-style services.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>
					<a name="07051548000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As partly
adverted to in the intervention by the hon. Member for Dundee, East, in
focusing in people who hold legal or accounting qualifications,
subsection (3) misses some of the important problems caused by schedule
3&#151;solving a problem for lawyers and accountants does not solve
the problem with schedule 3. For instance, the subsection (3) safe
harbour does not seem to take into account how many professionals hold
qualifications other than accountancy and legal qualifications. Company
formation agents have been mentioned, and other examples include those
holding qualifications relating to company secretarial services or to
tax, such as those from the Association of Taxation Technicians or the
Chartered Institute of
Taxation.</div>

Villiers:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Many
different sectors are affected by the changes, but my concern is
particularly about the impact on the IT sector, where contractors and
freelancers perform such a valuable role. The nature of the IT sector
is that, very often, specific people are wanted to build a specific
project. Keeping permanent employees on an ongoing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>basis is very difficult if the project only lasts a few months. Critical
in scrutinising schedule 3 is for the Committee to assess the impact on
the IT sector, including the point made by my hon. Friend the Member
for
Windsor.</div>
					<a name="07051548000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
understand that a number of professional bodies, such as the Institute
of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, is seriously worried that
their members may fall into the definition of MSC providers
automatically&#151;after all, their business is to set up and run
companies. By amending proposed new subsection (3) as I propose in
amendment No. 45, those professionals can gain the same protection as
accountants and
lawyers.</div>
					<a name="07051548000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The status of
other professionals is also uncertain under the current wording of
subsection (3). Other professionals whose activities might conceivably
bring them within the scope of &#147;promoting&#148; or
&#147;facilitating&#148;, yet seemingly without the protection of
the safe harbour, could be management consultants, franchisers who help
franchisees run their business, factoring and invoice discounting
houses which help follow up unpaid invoices, payroll companies and
business advisers. I would be very interested to hear from the Minister
how he sees their status under proposed new section
61B.</div>
