<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000260"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Nick
Ainger):</b> Welcome to the Chair,Mr. Williams. We
dealt with quite a number of important issues this morning quite
expeditiously. I hope that we will continue in that vein this
afternoon.</div><a name="06063014000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) was asking me about the
need for timely interventions in relation to the clause. I appreciate
her point about the need to act quickly where an older person may be in
danger and about the role that whistleblowing arrangements will have in
ensuring that such information comes to light. Indeed, that is why
whistleblowing arrangements have been included in the clause.</div>
<a name="06063014000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
commissioner&#146;s review function in the clause is primarily a
strategic role designed to help to ensure that adequate arrangements
are in place for dealing with problems when they arise. This is a broad
power that will apply to many types of arrangements and in respect of a
wide range of bodies. To make action under this general power subject
to some sort of time scale would not be practical. There are a number
of existing bodies who have the responsibility for protecting older
people, such as the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales. The role of
the commissioner is not to duplicate their ability to take direct
action, but to check that they are aware of instances of concern if
those are brought to the commissioner&#146;s attention and that more
broadly they are fulfilling their responsibilities towards older
people.</div> <a name="06063014000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
if the commissioner were to become aware that arrangements for
advocacy, whistleblowing or complaints in a care home were placing
older people at risk we would expect him to bring that to the attention
of the CSIW immediately. It would be for the CSIW to obtain the
necessary information required to assess the risk and to take the
necessary action to deal with any risk. I hope that the hon. Lady will
accept those points.</div>
<a name="06063014000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put and agreed

to amend Schedule
3</div><a name="06063014000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06063014000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06063014000261"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Cheryl Gillan</b> (Chesham and Amersham) (Con): May I welcome
you to the Chair, Mr. Williams? I gather that it is your first time in
Committee and I hope that, like your predecessor in the Chair this
morning, you will have little trouble from this Committee and your
chairmanship will sail
by.</div><a name="06063014000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rise briefly on
this clause to ask the Minister what, if any, barriers lie to changing
schedule 3. Obviously the Assembly may, by order, amend schedule 3, but
is there any limit to the number of times that schedule 3 can be
altered? Can it be altered as and when the Assembly believes that there
needs to be an omission or a change of description? With what frequency
is it envisaged that the power will be
used?</div><a name="06063014000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000262"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Clause 7 allows the Assembly to add to, delete
from, or alter the description of persons listed in schedule 3. A
person can be a body or individual. It sets out the conditions that
must be met before a person can be added to the schedule, namely that
the person must provide a service in Wales in an area in which the
Assembly has functions. The hon. Lady asked me whether there was any
limit to the number of times or circumstances in which this can be
used. The answer is no. It just depends on whether a body or an
individual qualifies under the criteria set. They must broadly be a
public sector body with at least half of their expenditure on the
discharge of functions in Wales being met directly from payments made
by the Assembly.</div><a name="06063014000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
envisage in the future new functions being given to the Assembly, or to
a new or amalgamated body. In such circumstances the power to amend
schedule 3, under clause 7, would be used. There is no limit, but those
are the conditions that would have to be met in order for clause 7 to
be used. I hope that the hon. Lady accepts that
argument.</div><a name="06063014000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
put and agreed
to.</i></div><a name="06063014000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause 7

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000263"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I have a brief question about the assistance that
the commissioner may give to a person making a complaint or
representation. Will the Minister confirm that that would include
translation facilities, signing, braille or any other method of
facilitating communication that might be
necessary?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 45</div><a name="06063014000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000264"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The clause enables the Assembly to make
regulations that empower the commissioner to assist an older person in
Wales</div> <a name="06063014000220"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in making a
complaint or representation to or in respect of the
Assembly&#148;,</div><a name="06063014000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">or,</div>
<a name="06063014000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person providing regulated
services in Wales&#148;,</div>

person providing services on behalf of or under arrangements with a
person mentioned in schedule
3&#148;.</div><a name="06063014000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order for that
service to be delivered, there might well be occasions when the
services to which the hon. Lady referred, such as braille, translation
and so on, would be required. I am certain that with the
Assembly&#146;s general policy on providing assistance to those with
certain disabilities, and support for language, there will be no
problem with providing those
services.</div><a name="06063014000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000265"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I have a question on the provision of those
services. If we were coming to the end of the financial year, and the
level of interpretation or assistance required by someone under clause
8 would be expensive, would there be any let or hindrance to the
commissioner, and would it be necessary to wait until the next
financial
year?</div><a name="06063014000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000266"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> No, I am certain that the financial provisions
under which the commissioner will operate will allow that facility to
be made available whatever the state of the finances or the time of the
financial year. I am absolutely certain that there will not be such a
problem.</div><a name="06063014000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000268"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following amendments: No. 26, in page 6, line 31, leave out subsection

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000269"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b><b class="B"> </b>It gives me great pleasure to speak to the
amendments. Clause 10 relates to the examination of cases. I can see
from the consultation document that there were obviously concerns about
that matter. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 46</div>hope that I can articulate some of those and ask the Minister to make
clear his
position.</div><a name="06063014000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, there
was some concern that the commissioner would be able to demand an
answer from a person. A community council was concerned that in a free
country with citizen&#146;s rights a person should not be forced to
speak by legal coercion from the state. The council hoped that in
instances of whistleblowing, confidentiality would be of paramount
importance. Will the Minister address those
concerns?</div><a name="06063014000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concern was
also expressed about the powers of examination. Some respondents hoped
that the commissioner would be schooled in the rules of court procedure
or that a clerk of the court would attend to expedite powers in
connection with the examination of cases under clause
10.</div><a name="06063014000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
regulations are made under clause 10, what consultation will take
place? What will the Assembly do to inform itself while making those
regulations? Will it consult widely on the detail of the regulations?
Will it, for example, consult the Law Society? What is the position on
data protection legislation and freedom of information relating to the
examination of cases under clause 10? Can a person appeal against
examination?</div>
<a name="06063014000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 refer
to the report that will follow the discharge of particular functions. I
should like some clarification from the Minister on what will happen
when the reports have been compiled following the discharge of the
functions referred to in clause 10. To whom will those reports be sent?
Will they be timely? What limits will be set on the time for production
of the reports, what will happen to those reports and who will respond
to them, and on what time scale?</div>
<a name="06063014000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the circulation of
those reports is intended to include a list that was in the statement
of policy intentions, but will the Minister confirm that that list will
still apply when and if those organisations are required to respond to
the
reports?</div><a name="06063014000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06063014000270"></a><b class="B">Mark
Williams</b> (Ceredigion) (LD): Liberal Democrat amendment No.
26 would enable the commissioner to examine individual cases on
non-devolved matters, and amendment No. 28 would allow the commissioner
to make a report on a non-devolved matter. I do not wish to bore the
Committee any longer, so I shall not say any more. We rehearsed the
debates at length this morning, but I shall be interested to hear what
the Minister has to
say&#151;again.</div><a name="06063014000068"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000271"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Amendments Nos. 30 and 33 would place the Assembly
under obligations to make regulations providing for the examination of
cases by the commissioner and for the commissioner to make reports
following the discharge of any of his functions. The Government do not
believe that either amendment is necessary. The Assembly is committed
to establishing a commissioner for older people with powers of
examination and powers to make reports, and its statement of policy
intentions makes clear the intended detail of the regulations on those
matters. I assure hon. Members that in each case, the wording is
identical to that found in the Care Standards Act 2000, which
established the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 47</div>There has been no question of regulations not being made in respect of
the Children&#146;s Commissioner&#146;s equivalent powers. I hope
that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham is satisfied on those
points.</div><a name="06063014000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked about the relationship with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the
Freedom of Information Act 2000. The clause will disapply neither. She
also asked how the Assembly will consult. They will consult widely on
the regulations and the Law Society is on the consultation list. The
consultation will be on the full draft regulations. On the timeliness
of reports, paragraph 45 of the statement of policy intentions lists
the people to whom it is intended that reports will be sent. That has
not altered since lunch time. I assure the hon. Lady that paragraph 47
reflects the intention that time scales for responses will be
set.</div><a name="06063014000235"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="06063014000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
31 and 34 would ensure that regulations made by the Assembly detail the
types of case that can be examined, the circumstances in which an
examination may be made and the procedure for conducting an
examination, as well as the contents of a report and the persons to
whom copies must be sent. Amendment No. 34 would also provide that the
regulations must enable the commissioner to make a joint report with
the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales, make provision about the
publication of a report, and specify any further action that the
commissioner is required to take. Again, the amendments are
unnecessary. The Assembly has made clear its intention to include such
provision in the regulations&#151;again, I draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to the statement of policy intentions. It
is difficult to envisage how regulations that make provision for the
examination of cases and for the making of reports by the commissioner
could not include such
information.</div><a name="06063014000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come
now to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark
Williams). Amendment No. 26 would enable the Assembly to make
regulations enabling the commissioner to examine the case of an older
person in Wales in connection with both his power to make
representations to the Assembly on non-devolved matters and his power
to undertake research and educational activities on non-devolved
matters. Amendment No. 28 would do something similar in relation to
non-devolved
matters.</div><a name="06063014000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning,
we debated extensively non-devolved matters, the relationship that the
commissioner has in that respect, and how he would make representations
on behalf of older people in Wales. I know that I have not satisfied
the hon. Gentleman on those matters&#151;I do not think that I have
satisfied any Opposition Member on them&#151;but my position has not
changed since lunch time. The Government cannot accept the amendments,
for the reasons that I have explained at great length. I therefore ask
the hon. Lady and the hon. Gentleman to withdraw or not to press their
amendments.</div><a name="06063014000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000272"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> The Minister never seems to be able to satisfy me,
so I will have to continue to be dissatisfied, but I appreciate his
attempt to give answers to the questions that I posed. I was a bit
premature in posing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div>one of them, but I shall pose it again in relation to the next
amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06063014000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000273"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in clause 10, page
7, line 9, leave out subsection
(7).</div><a name="06063014000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a probing
amendment about the High Court powers. Omitting subsection (7) would
not add to the coherence of the Bill, so I hope that the
Minister&#146;s reply will not be based solely on the amendment. It
was tabled as a probing amendment, rather than as an amendment that I
hope will be made to the Bill. I simply wanted to inquire what other
bodies have the powers envisaged in subsection (7).</div>
<a name="06063014000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I posed my
next question previously because I was reading my scribbled notes
without the aid of my glasses. Will the commissioner or members of his
staff involved in examining cases be schooled in the rules of court
procedure, or have a clerk of the court in attendance? In addition,
does the power to apply to the High Court for the power of entry add
anything to the existing provisions relating to the police and
magistrates? That question was posed by City and County of Swansea
council and Swansea Network 50+.</div>
<a name="06063014000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the event of hearings, does
the Minister envisage a place being specified for them to take place,
what would be the optimum staffing for hearings and examinations, and
to what extent could those activities involve witnesses
abroad?</div><a name="06063014000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000274"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The hon. Lady has asked a number of questions on
clause 10. First, she asked what other organisations have similar
powers. In Wales, such powers certainly exist in other commissioner and
ombudsman legislation, including that which established the
Children&#146;s Commissioner and the public service ombudsman, so I
hope that that reassures
her.</div><a name="06063014000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
also asked about the training to be given to the commissioner&#146;s
staff. Obviously, it will be for the commissioner to ensure that his or
her staff have the training necessary to be involved in examination of
any case. It would be helpful if the Committee understood what clause
10 is about. It will ensure that the commissioner has the right powers
to obtain the evidence, to hold an inquiry, to carry out research and
to ensure that he or she is fully appraised of the case that may be
presented.</div> <a name="06063014000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady alluded to concerns expressed by certain organisations. We
envisage the power being used not against individuals who make a
complaint, but against those who may be complained about. The ombudsman
and the Children&#146;s Commissioner have such powers and, as far as
I am aware, no one has complained about those powers being exercised by
the ombudsman or the Children&#146;s
Commissioner.</div><a name="06063014000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sort
of people who would be subject to the powers are likely to include
those connected with the provision of regulated services to older
people in Wales, such as providers or former providers of those
services, their employees and perhaps voluntary workers. They are also
likely to include people connected with the provision of other services
to older people in Wales by bodies such as the Assembly, a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div>schedule 2 body or any body that provides services in Wales on behalf of
or under arrangement with a schedule 3
body.</div><a name="06063014000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked about witnesses from abroad. They could be called by service of a
writ, but the commissioner would have no power to force them to attend.
She also asked whether a place would be specified for hearings and
about staffing. It will be for the commissioner to decide the most
appropriate venue for such
hearings.</div><a name="06063014000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000275"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way while
he receives inspiration. Can he tell me whether there will be a minimum
number of people present at a
hearing?</div><a name="06063014000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000276"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> No, I cannot. It will be the appropriate number
that is required.</div><a name="06063014000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady asked about the power to apply to the High Court, whether
that adds to the police&#146;s powers of entry and so on, and whether
it goes further than the police powers. It will not affect the powers
of the police. It is needed to ensure that the commissioner can require
the information he needs to examine a case on his own behalf. I
reiterate that the purpose of the clause is to ensure that the
commissioner can carry out his job. There may be circumstances in which
he needs powers of entry and examination. Everybody appreciates that
when dealing with allegations of elder abuse, those powers are
important. Some people allege that the commissioner will not have any
teeth, but in that situation, he will have the teeth to carry
outhis role.</div>
<a name="06063014000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06063014000277"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stephen Crabb</b> (Preseli Pembrokeshire) (Con): Is the
Minister aware of any instances when those types of powers have been
exercised by the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales or the public
service ombudsman in Wales?</div>
<a name="06063014000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000278"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I cannot think of any off-hand, although the
commissioner carried out an inquiry into the case of a drama teacher
who had been accused of&#151;well, we know the allegations&#151;and
I am assured that the powers were used in that case. It is a good
example of a case in which allegations had been circulating for a long
time and the Children&#146;s Commissioner finally obtained what an
awful lot of parents had been asking for: resolution and closure. It
could have been done only by the Children&#146;s Commissioner using
those types of powers. With that assurance, I hope the hon. Lady will
withdraw her amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000279"></a>Mrs.

flesh on the bones of the legislation, although I remain concerned
about the examination of cases. The Committee knows far too little
about the way in which the function will operate, however I live in
hope that when the regulations are produced, there will be more
details. I have tried to probe a little, but I understand that the
Assembly will consider the matter in detail.</div>
<a name="06063014000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am still worried that the

authorised by him the power to enter premises that are not private
dwellings to interview older people with their consent and in
connection with the commissioner&#146;s powers in clauses 3 or 5 to
reviewthe functions of specified people. I am using the
amendments to probe and elicit some answers from the
Minister.</div> <a name="06063014000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
constitutes</div> <a name="06063014000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person

commissioner&#151;in subsection (1)? Would that person have to be a
member of the commissioner&#146;s staff, or could it be any person
procured by the commissioner to take part in the exercise of entering
premises and interviewing an older person? What safeguards are in place
to ensure that that person has received the necessary checks to be put
into that position? Would it be necessary for anybody who is authorised
by the commissioner to deal with such vulnerable people to have
undergone Criminal Records Bureau checks or other appropriate
checks?</div><a name="06063014000236"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

Minister then define a private dwelling? There has been some discussion
about that, but we need to avoid uncertainties. Do private dwellings
include privately run care homes? If a care home was owned and operated
in the private sector, could an individual&#146;s room be deemed to
be a private dwelling? I hope that the Minister will give more details
on how we define a private dwelling, because the power of entry is very
broad. The only building or structure that cannot be entered is a
private dwelling, so we need to be certain what the exact definition
is.</div> <a name="06063014000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like the
Minister to define &#147;reasonable time&#148;. Subsection (3)

powers conferred by subsection (1) are exercisable at any reasonable
time.&#148;</div><a name="06063014000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we read such
things in legislation we need to know what is in the Minister&#146;s
mind as to what is a reasonable time. For example, an elderly person
might go to bed at 9 o&#146;clock at night, but that would be a
reasonable time for me, as someone who does not go to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div>bed until about 1 or 2 o&#146;clock in the morning.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> Settle down&#151;it is because I am
working very hard on the Bill. Notwithstanding that, I would like the

subsection (1)(b), the interview with the older person may take

person consents.&#148;</div><a name="06063014000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
talk about consent, particularly that of older people, I am concerned
about how we interpret it in the case of people who might at first
appear to be capable of giving consent to such an interview, but who
are subsequently deemed not to be so. I am thinking of elderly people
who suffer from dementia and are not capable of giving that
consent&#151;or, indeed, who withhold it&#151;but who nonetheless
appear to be quite compos mentis. The Minister will be familiar with
the issue, because it covers a swathe of law in other instances, but it
would be interesting to hear what is in his mind in this
instance.</div><a name="06063014000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) says:</div><a name="06063014000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
interview must be
conducted&#151;</div><a name="06063014000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)

other person&#146;s presence;
and</div><a name="06063014000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
otherwise in the presence of others only to the extent that the older
person and the Commissioner have consented to their being
present.&#148;</div><a name="06063014000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that mean
that an interview could be conducted entirely in private? If so, that
would surely defeat the purpose of the interview. Because the interview
is part of a quasi-judicial process, there should be an independent
advocate or witness at all times. If information is adduced from an
interview of an older person conducted entirely in isolation, as a
one-on-one exercise, what safeguards are in place to ensure that the
individual gives their consent and is in a condition to give that
information?</div><a name="06063014000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
someone refuse entry for reasonable cause or refuse to be interviewed?
Subsection (3)
says:</div><a name="06063014000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
powers conferred by subsection (1) are exercisable at any reasonable
time.&#148;</div><a name="06063014000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us suppose
that someone in a home in multiple occupancy had died, or was close to
death. It would seem reasonable that the person in charge of the
building might refuse entry to the person authorised by the
commissioner. What would happen if the individual refused entry? Would
that be covered by &#147;at any reasonable time&#148; as a defence
to refusing entry and refusing to allow a person to be
interviewed?</div><a name="06063014000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">A matter
that also comes under the power of entry and of interview is that of
the qualifications of the person authorised by the commissioner to
carry out the interview, which are crucial when older and vulnerable
people are involved. I want to know what qualifications will be held by
someone carrying out that function. A great deal of trust will be put
in the individual concerned because he or she will have what appears to
be an absolute right of entry and an absolute right to interview an
older person.</div><a name="06063014000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that is all I wanted to say in this debate, but I hope that the
Minister will allow me to intervene if anything else strikes me when he
replies.</div><a name="06063014000110"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000283"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The hon. Lady asked me several questions. At the
outset, I should say that subsection 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div>(1)(b) enables a commissioner to interview an older person but only on
condition that the older person consents to the interview taking place.
The Committee should appreciate that it is up to the individual older
person to decide whether they want to be interviewed by the
commissioner or a member of his staff. The hon. Lady asked who
is</div> <a name="06063014000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person authorised
by him&#148;</div><a name="06063014000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">and if they would
have been subject to CRB bureau checks.</div>
<a name="06063014000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady also asked about
the qualifications of those who will carry out the interviews. It will
be an important part of a job specification for members of staff who
carry out the role that they are experienced in dealing with older
people and able to conduct interviews and elicit information in a
sympathetic way, especially as the older person will have made a
complaint or expressed
concern.</div><a name="06063014000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000284"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> What sort of qualifications does the Minister
envisage the individual
having?</div><a name="06063014000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000285"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I imagine that they would be experienced in social
work and in dealing with elderly people. I am not saying that they
should have a particular degree, but they should have experience in
dealing with older people perhaps in a social services framework. They
may well be solicitors with a legal qualification who can take evidence
from individuals.</div> <a name="06063014000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not setting out a series of qualifications, but obviously the
commissioner must be mindful that the interviews have to be conducted
sensitively to elicit information.</div>
<a name="06063014000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06063014000286"></a><b class="B">David
T.C. Davies</b> (Monmouth) (Con): To prevent a re-run of the
controversy when the deputy Children&#146;s Commissioner was
appointed, does the Minister agree that it would be desirable if the
commissioner for older people was not a member of the Labour
party?</div><a name="06063014000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000287"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> That has altered the tone of the debate. The
deputy commissioner has an extremely long history of dealing with
children and their care issues. She was eminently qualified for that
job, and remains so. She obtained it on the basis of her qualifications
and experience, not her membership of any political party. I am certain
that a deputy for the Commissioner for Older People will be appointed
purely on their experience and qualifications, not on their membership
of any political party.</div>
<a name="06063014000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady asked what was a
private dwelling&#151;an important issue because the Bill refers to
it. A private dwelling is a person&#146;s own home. That includes
where a person holds a tenancy agreement. It also includes a family
home where an older person is accommodated with his or her relations.
However, &#147;private dwelling&#148; would not in our view include
the communal areas of a care establishment, and the commissioner will
therefore have the power to enter such establishments under the
Bill&#146;s provisions.</div>
<a name="06063014000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any unwanted intrusion into a
person&#146;s home would be likely to constitute a disproportionate
interference with an individual&#146;s right to privacy and a breach
of article 8 of the European convention on human rights. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div></div><a name="06063014000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000288"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Will the Minister confirm that someone&#146;s
own room within a care home setting would not be capable of attracting
the powers of entry under clause 13, so they will apply to the common
parts of that home but not the individuals&#146; rooms
themselves?</div><a name="06063014000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000289"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I refer to what I said at the beginning.
Subsection (1)(b) enables a commissioner to interview another person
but only on the condition that the older person consents to the
interview taking place. If the older person who has made a complaint or
is part of a case wants to be interviewed by the commissioner and is
resident in a care home, the managers and owners of that care home
cannot prevent the commissioner from coming in to see and talk to that
individual, as long as the individual wants to talk to the commissioner
or a member of his staff. I hope that the hon. Lady accepts that, if we
did not have that power, it is distinctly possible that an individual
who had made a perfectly legitimate complaint about the standard of
care in a particular home would not be able to speak to the
commissioner because he would not have the power of entry into that
home to speak to the
individual.</div><a name="06063014000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000290"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> It is an extremely complex situation, because a
complaint may be made by an individual in a care home setting who
presents as though they are capable of making a complaint and
consenting to be interviewed, but in fact they are not, which would be
known to the people running the care home. The interviewer from the
commissioner turns up, comes into the general part of the care home,
but then the alleged consent, which could not have been given in the
first place, may be withdrawn or may continue to be given even though
that person is not capable of giving the evidence. A fairly complex
situation could be emerging on the ground with regard to the
interviewing process, the disruption to the home, the individual being
there, and so on.</div>
<a name="06063014000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister confirm that
a private room within a care home cannot be
entered?</div><a name="06063014000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000291"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I come back to what I said
earlier.</div>
<a name="06063014000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06063014000292"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Madeleine Moon</b> (Bridgend) (Lab): Perhaps I can add some
clarification. What has been asked is no more than any inspector would
do in a care home on any day on which they were visiting. Any inspector
has a right of entry into a care home at any time, day or night. They
certainly would not wish to intrude on someone who did not wish to be
interviewed, and that would be equally true for a service user who was
asleep or who did not want to talk.</div>
<a name="06063014000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of capacity, we are
moving into extremely difficult areas. Most people are deemed to have
the capacity to speak for themselves if they are making allegations.
Allegations would always need to be substantiated. It would be
extremely rare for an inspector, or, I assume, the commissioner, to
take a statement from an individual without being able to substantiate
it by looking at records, interviewing other service users or
interviewing members of
staff.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div><a name="06063014000237"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<a name="06063014000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000293"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I am grateful for that informative intervention
based on my hon. Friend&#146;s long experience in the Care Standards
Inspectorate. May I help the hon. Lady again? I will add to what my
hon. Friend said. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham specifically
asked whether a commissioner would be able to go into a person&#146;s
own room in a care home. He would be able to enter the care home, but
he could enter the individual&#146;s room only at their invitation. I
come back to the point I made before about subsection (1)(b), which
enables the commissioner to interview an older person but only on
condition that the older person consents to the interview taking place.
I hope that the hon. Lady is now satisfied on that point.</div>
<a name="06063014000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bridgend(Mrs. Moon) and the hon. Lady referred to the capacity
issue, which is important. In circumstances where it is determined that
an older person lacks capacity to make decisions, this will mean that
they lack capacity to give consent to the specific request for an
interview. It is not appropriate to give the commissioner a general
power to interview the older person in those circumstances. Where a
person lacks capacity to make decisions, there may be exceptional
circumstances where it is considered appropriate for them to be
interviewed by the commissioner.</div>
<a name="06063014000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice, this is an issue
that the commissioner will need to handle sensitively&#151;as my hon.
Friend said, inspections of care homes are taking place
regularly&#151;in light of individual circumstances and legal and
medical advice, including the application of the key principles and
best interests checklist in the Mental Capacity Act 2005. More broadly,
the commissioner may want to draw up a good practice protocol on
requesting consent which he and his staff follow when they deal with
individuals who lack capacity.</div>
<a name="06063014000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady also asked what
the commissioner can do to enforce his powers of entry. In fact there
is no enforcement power that will enable the commissioner to gain
entry. However, if he were concerned about an older person and was
refused entry he could alert the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales,
the police or social services as appropriate so that further action
could be taken.</div>
<a name="06063014000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06063014000294"></a><b class="B">Glenda
Jackson</b> (Hampstead and Highgate) (Lab): I take my hon.
Friend back to the definition of what constitutes a private dwelling.
Mention of elder abuse was made earlier. No one in the Committee is
labouring under the delusion that such abuse occurs only in private
nursing homes. It can happen in the family as much as in any other
situation. If the commissioner has no right to enter a private
dwelling, what will happen if someone lays concerns before him and he,
having examined them, thinks that there is a reasonable case to
presuppose that a family is abusing an elderly person? Who then would
be empowered to carry forward that investigation if the commissioner is
not allowed to go into that private
dwelling?</div>
<a name="06063014000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000295"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that important
point. If the commissioner were alerted by a neighbour, a relative or
another person that something 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 55</div>might be happening in a private dwelling, his or her response would be
immediately to contact the police or social services, who have power of
entry, to examine and check whether the allegations put to him were
accurate and therefore immediately protect the elderly person who might
be suffering abuse. I assure my hon. Friend that the role that the
commissioner would play as the one-stop shop to which the hon. Member
for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) referred means that he
would then refer the case immediately to the appropriate agency. In
this case that is likely to be the police and the local social
services.</div> <a name="06063014000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Chesham and Amersham asked about qualifications for
interviews, which will be an important part of the job specification.
She also asked about reasonable time, which is an important point,
particularly when one is dealing with elderly people. Obviously, the
reason for the visit and the person being visited would have to be
taken into account. For example, they may be out during the day for day
care. If it would be more appropriate for the interview to take place
in their own home, it may have to be in the evening. If the interview
is to take place in a care home, arrangements can be made to ensure
that it fits into the pattern of care in the
home.</div><a name="06063014000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate the
point that the hon. Lady makes. Elderly people may want to have a nap
during the afternoon, for example, and an interview would not be
appropriate at that time, but I am sure that interviews would not take
place at 1 or 2 o&#146;clock in the morning&#151;although I know
that the hon. Lady would be awake at that
time.</div><a name="06063014000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000296"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> May I just take the Minister back to the person
authorised by the commissioner? He did not entirely satisfy me on one
point. Is it envisaged that the interviewer will be a member of the
commissioner&#146;s staff, or could it be someone who is not employed
by the commission and therefore acting as an agent, in which case would
criteria be laid down to ensure that they carry clear identification?
It seems clear from the legislation that interviewers are not
restricted to staff of the commissioner&#146;s office, and that there
will be occasions when others would be used to carry out
interviews.</div><a name="06063014000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000297"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> In the fullness of time, that may wellbe
the situation. As more cases come to the commissioner&#146;s
attention and he needs to act expeditiously, a senior social worker may
be required to act on his behalf. Clearly, they would have to satisfy
his rigorous qualification that they were a suitable person to carry
out this type of interview. Again, I hope that my comments have
satisfied the hon. Lady and that she is now prepared to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06063014000137"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000303"></a>Nick

enough to include the national forum. It would be for the commissioner
to work eitherwith other commissioners, such as the
Children&#146;s Commissioners for Wales, or with the ombudsman, but
certainly not with the university of the third age, for example.
Collaborative working would take place with public office holders, such
as other properly constituted ombudsmen or commissioners, not a wide
range of organisations, such as representative organisations, because
there are formal arrangements. I hope that that answers the hon.

<a name="06063014000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Commission for
Equality and Human Rights is fully set up, it is likely that the

employment, so it is right that the Commissioner for Older People in
Wales should have a proper working arrangement with it. I hope that the
hon. Lady is satisfied with that point.</div>

considers it appropriate to do
so.'.</div><a name="06063014000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000309"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> The purpose of this simple amendment is to probe
the Government&#146;s arrival at the magic age of 60 as the
definition of an older person. I know many people who are 60 and over
who would perhaps resent being described as an older person. Indeed, if
one is four, a seven-year-old is an older person. Some explanation
behind the thinking here would be appreciated because during the
enormous consultation process there was a variety of opinions as to the
age at which these provisions should bite.</div>
<a name="06063014000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some people were of the opinion
that because the strategy for older people in Wales focuses on those
who are 50 and over, it should perhaps be even as young as 50.
Certainly it was suggested by some of the respondents that if older
people were defined as 50-plus, it would at least give the commissioner
some locus, prior to the 60th birthday, in an area where individuals of
that age may need some help. Some argued that because health policy
considers an older person to be aged 65 and over, that should have been
the age.</div> <a name="06063014000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, it
was considered that if the age of retirement is to increase, as I
believe it will, that should perhaps be the age at which the provisions
kick in. It would be a moving age but it would be in line with the view
that someone who is no longer in the world of work and who has retired
is perhaps more in need of the services that are
provided.</div><a name="06063014000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have read
most of the arguments that have been put forward and I am certainly not
at odds with 60 being the age, but it would be interesting to know why
the Minister arrived at that particular age, rather than 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div>taking a slightly more inappropriate younger age, or a more appropriate
older age, as people are now living longer, showing great signs of
activity and working sometimes well into their 70s and
80s.</div><a name="06063014000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000310"></a>Adam
Price:</b> I rise to speak to amendment No. 37, which proposes
a degree of flexibility&#151;one of the arguments that a number of
consultees advanced in relation to the definition of an older person.
It is a subjective thing, clearly. Victor Hugo said that 40 is the old
age of youth and 50 is the youth of old age, but I am a little close to
both. The serious point, as has been touched on by the hon. Member for
Chesham and Amersham, is that we are in danger of creating a profusion
of different definitions of &#147;older person&#148;, much as at
the opposite end of the age scale, we have had an issue for several
years about the different rights given to young people at 16, 17, 18,
21 and so on.</div>
<a name="06063014000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly there would seem to
be an advantage from a public policy perspective in having a degree of
consistency when it comes to a definition of what constitutes an older
person for these purposes. As has been said, we have in Wales the
strategy for older people, and now we have in England the sister
strategy of opportunity age, both of which take 50 as their starting
point, because that, they believe, is the point at which people begin
to experience age-related problems, in terms of the delivery of
services and the context of their own lives. There is therefore a
problem of mismatch, because we have a strategy that is seeking to
enhance and improve the provision of services for older people in
Wales, yet the Commissioner for Older People will be dealing only with
people aged 60 and over. All that my amendment&#151;I was tempted to
say &#147;our amendment&#148;, but obviously you are in the Chair,
Mr. Williams&#151;seeks to do is to offer that flexibility.</div>
<a name="06063014000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have argued that
we have to draw a line somewhere and that there is no perfect answer.
They argue that it would be better to veer towards 60 rather than 50.
That is because at 50, we would be including one third of the
population and growing, as the demographic bubble changes day by day.
There is some strength to that argument. However, as many of the
consultees suggested, why not give a general rule of 60 to the
commissioner but offer him the flexibility to look at cases that
involve people who are 50-plus and who have a problem that is clearly
age-related, particularly in the employment sphere? It could be argued
that the Commission for Equality and human rights will cover that.
However, there is also the matter of Alzheimer&#146;s and other
dementia-related illnesses that begin to kick in, unfortunately, at
50-plus. There is a strong argument that the commissioner could perform
an important function in looking at people between the ages of 50 and
60 who receive regulated services and suffer an age-related impairment.
Yet in the current framework of provision, the commissioner would not
be able to do that.</div>
<a name="06063014000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We touched earlier on the fact
that the way that we ended up deciding on 60 was strange. In the other
place, Lord Evans was quite courageously trying to justify it with
reference to all manner of things. At age 60, winter fuel payment and
pension credit benefits kick in, as well as the Assembly&#146;s free
swimming and bus pass schemes. One could almost justify the choice 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>of any age; for example, there is probably a good argument for choosing
57 lurking somewhere.</div>
<a name="06063014000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the consultations by the
Assembly advisory group offered three options: 65, 50-plus and 65 with
flexibility. The age limit of 60 was never offered in the consultation
but that is the one that we ended up with. The most popular option,
with 139 respondents behind it, was 65, but with the flexibility that I
referred to.</div> <a name="06063014000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know
that the Government have addressed the matter in the other place, in
Grand Committee, and on Second Reading. There is a strong argument for
giving the commissioner the opportunity to look at age-related public
policy matters and problems as people get closer to the
Government&#146;s chosen definition of 60.
</div><a name="06063014000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000311"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> That was an issue that we addressed on Second
Reading as well as in the other place, to which the hon. Member for
Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr has referred extensively. Both the hon.
Member for Chesham and Amersham and the hon. Gentleman are right in
saying that a line has to be drawn somewhere. The difficulty is in
getting that right and having sufficient flexibility to address some of
the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has raised.</div>
<a name="06063014000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">One issue, apart from getting
the age right, is making sure that the commissioner is capable of
dealing with the issues that will be brought to him. Setting the age
threshold at 50, as the hon. Lady has suggested, would provide the
commissioner with too broad a remit, one that would cover more than a
third of the population of Wales. There are approximately 600,000
people over the age of 60 in Wales, but if the age were to be dropped
to 50, the commissioner&#146;s remit would extend to incorporate more
than 1 million people, or an extra 400,000. If we want an effective
champion for older people, as I am sure we all do, we must draw a line
somewhere. We believe that 60 is a sensible and pragmatic choice.
Despite the fact that nobody suggested 60 in certain consultations, we
might have drawn the line about right by taking into account all the
different
proposals.</div><a name="06063014000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
concerned that an age limit of 60 will fail to catch those people
experiencing discrimination in employment, as the hon. Member for
Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr said, the CEHR&#146;s new age equality
regulations, which will come into force this October, will make it
unlawful to discriminate in employment on grounds of age and vocational
training. It will be the role of the CEHR, which will have appointed a
chair and a board by autumn, to enforce that legislation.</div>
<a name="06063014000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role of the Commissioner
for Older People will be different from that of the CEHR. It will be
primarily to act for the protection of those who receive or are in need
of services as older people in Wales. Of course the commissioner will
want to work with the new CEHR on matters affecting older people which
are of interest to them both. I envisage that the working relationship
will be underpinned at a practical level by a memorandum of
understanding or protocol setting out their respective roles. It could
also be formalised using the provisions for joint and collaborative
working that I referred to during debate on clauses 16 and
17.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div><a name="06063014000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 37 seeks to
provide the commissioner with the discretion to extend his remit to
include persons aged between 50 and 60 who suffer from age-related
illness, impairment or disability, or if he considers it appropriate
for whatever reason to do so. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concern that the commissioner&#146;s remit should encompass as far as
possible those vulnerable people suffering from dementia or
Alzheimer&#146;s disease, for example. The Government and the
Assembly considered carefully whether any flexibility in the age
threshold could be applied. However, because of the need to specify any
exceptions to the normal age threshold in the legislation and because
of the difficulties of doing so, the single criterion of 60 was
used.</div> <a name="06063014000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks to specify exceptions to the age threshold of 60, but the
criteria are extremely wide. In our view, the amendment would lead to
uncertainty and confusion about the commissioner&#146;s powers. The
listed exceptions would require the commissioner to decide on a
case-by-case basis whether someone fell within the category of persons
listed or not. That task would consume a considerable amount of the
commissioner&#146;s time and require additional expertise. As for the
commissioner&#146;s residual general discretion, it could in effect
lower the age threshold to 50. Such a low threshold would bring us back
to the issue of the extra 400,000 people who would be eligible to make
representations to
him.</div><a name="06063014000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
balance&#151;we must strike a balance&#151;I believe that 60 is the
clearest, most sensible and pragmatic choice. However, that does not
mean that persons aged under 60 will not benefit from the appointment
of a commissioner. The commissioner will have a significant strategic
role, which will include reviewing the functions and arrangements of a
number of public bodies and issuing guidance. Any general
recommendations or guidance that the commissioner makes to improve
services or arrangements will help to drive up standards for all
service users, including those under 60.</div>
<a name="06063014000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman referred to
the strategy for older people in Wales, which would cover people over
the age of 50. Its purpose is not just the same as the
commissioner&#146;s but encapsulates the active citizenship agenda
and preparing people for retirement and older age. The
commissioner&#146;s remit is quite different. That is why the
strategy took a threshold of age 50. We could carry on this debate and
come forward with other ages. I was not particularly happy that the
hon. Gentleman suggested 57, that being my next
birthday.</div><a name="06063014000239"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

Ainger:</b> Perhaps I
should.</div><a name="06063014000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The age of 60
is a reasonable balance. As I have indicated on the provision of
services, particularly for those with a particular condition such as
dementia, if there is a shortfall in the services provided to those
aged 60 and above, it will also be an issue for those below 60. Sadly
there are those who are now suffering from dementia below
60.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div><a name="06063014000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000314"></a>Glenda
Jackson:</b> I believe the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East
and Dinefwr earlier in our debate, in one of his attempts to move the
commissioner&#146;s rights to cover non-devolved issues in Wales,
said that the CAB had reported that 80 per cent. of cases presented to
them had to do with the benefits and/or pensions system. I point out
that the pensionable age for women in Wales, as in the rest of the
United Kingdom, is
60.</div><a name="06063014000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000315"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Absolutely. That is one of the justifications for
choosing the age of 60. The hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and
Dinefwr referred to a number of other benefits that people receive in
Wales, virtually all of which start at the age of 60. As part of the
main function of the commissioner is to review the services that people
receive, it again seems sensible to decide that the threshold when
people start receiving those benefits and services should be 60. I
would ask that the hon. Lady and the hon. Gentleman withdraw their
amendments.</div><a name="06063014000183"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000318"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="06063014000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 1 is
purely inspired by the so-called bonfire of the quangos, which has not
escaped the notice of many people in Wales. It has caused some
controversy, and in the new clause I seek to put the Assembly firmly
back in the driving seat so that if at any stage it wished upon itself
the demise of the commissioner&#146;s office it would be able to
effect it. It may be, for example, that the Government in their wisdom
want to appoint a commissioner for England and Wales jointly because it
has proved such an excellent idea in Wales. In that case, the Bill
would need to be removed from the statute book and a new Bill perhaps
introduced. Or the Auditor General, using his powers under paragraph 13
of schedule 1, might carry out an examination and report that resources
have not been used efficiently or effectively. The new clause would
give the Assembly a sanction against the organisation in that
eventuality.</div> <a name="06063014000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would put the Assembly back in control. I do not mind if the
Minister thinks it is not fit for purpose and wishes to table his own
amendment on Report to ensure that the Assembly has the power to set
light to this particular quango without too much controversy if it so
wishes.</div><a name="06063014000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000319"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> While I appreciate the point that the hon. Lady
has made, the effect of the new clause is pretty draconian to say the
least. It would result in the Act ceasing to have effect if the
Assembly so resolved or if the Auditor General produced a report
concluding that the commissioner
had</div><a name="06063014000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;failed to use his
resources efficiently or
effectively.&#148;</div><a name="06063014000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should the
Assembly conclude that for some reason there was no longer a need for
the commissioner&#151;the hon. Lady suggested the example of a merger
and a UK-wide commissioner&#151;it would be able to relieve the
commissioner of office, simply fail to reappoint him or seek to secure
the repeal of the supporting legislation. If an incumbent
commissioner&#146;s contract still had time left to run, there is a
provision in paragraph 3(3) of schedule 1 for arrangements to be made
for any necessary early severance payment to be
made.</div><a name="06063014000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon. Lady
is concerned about financial mismanagement or misconduct by the
commissioner, I tell her that the Assembly takes the view that in such
circumstances it should be able to relieve him of office. As noted in
its statement of policy intentions, it is intended that regulations
will include the power to do so on the grounds of
misbehaviour.</div><a name="06063014000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of the new clause deals with the impact of an unfavourable
audit report from the Auditor General. It seems a somewhat draconian
response to provide that the Act shall automatically and immediately
cease to have effect if the commissioner is judged by the Auditor
General to have failed in any respect, however minor, to use his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div>resources efficiently or effectively. There are safeguards built into
the Bill to enable the Assembly to ensure that taxpayers&#146; money
is used effectively by the commissioner. There is a requirement of
audit in paragraph 12 of schedule 1 and provisions for examinations
into the use of resources in paragraph 13. Before public money is
committed at all, the Assembly Government will set the
commissioner&#146;s level of funding by negotiation with him on the
basis of a forward work programme. The proposed allocation will be
subject to the approval of the
Assembly.</div><a name="06063014000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Assembly
Government have made clear in paragraph 69 their statement of policy
intentions that they intend to require the commissioner, by regulation,
to make an annual report to the Assembly giving an account of his
actions in the discharge of his functions over the previous financial
year and a summary of his proposed work programme for the current and
next financial year. Following the custom and practice in the case of
the Children&#146;s Commissioner, the Assembly would hold a debate on
the report, which would provide an opportunity to give a view on the
value for money that the commissioner has given the public. That would
in turn inform discussions about the appropriate level of funding for
his planned future activities. I therefore ask the hon. Lady to
withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="06063014000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000320"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I have listened to the Minister, and I am sad to
hear that he does not want to put the Assembly firmly in control.
However, on this occasion I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div> <a name="06063014000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and
clause, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000321"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="06063014000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The swansong of
new clauses is a very simple one tabled to reassure several people who
have made representations to me about their concern that there might be
a duplication and overlap of functions, particularly with the Care
Standards Inspectorate for Wales. I tabled the new clause so that the
Minister could have the opportunity in Committee to set people&#146;s
minds at rest, because he too will know about those concerns. I hope
that the new clause is a suitable vehicle to enable us to hear from him
how the new commissioner will avoid conflict with the
CSIW.</div><a name="06063014000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000322"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to set the
record straight on the concern that some individuals and organisations
have had about the possible duplication of roles between the
commissioner and the CSIW. However, can tell the hon. Lady that the new
clause is not necessary. The remits of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 64</div>commissioner and the CSIW are quite different and there is no likelihood
of the two offices tripping over each in seeking to safeguard older
people.</div><a name="06063014000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CSIW&#146;s main focus is on registration and inspection of the care
sector in Wales. It enforces the Care Standards Act along with its
associated regulations and national minimum standards in Wales. It
deals with complaints that arise from the operation of those
arrangements.</div><a name="06063014000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Broadly
speaking, the commissioners remit in that area is to check that the
CSIW is doing its job properly in relation to older people. He will not
have statutory powers to inspect or bring civil or criminal proceeding
against service providers. The commissioner&#146;s role is more
strategic. For example, the Assembly&#146;s intention, as with the
Children&#146;s Commissioner, is that the commissioner should use his
powers to focus on cases that raise a question of principle, or that
have more general application or relevance to the rights or welfare of
older people.</div><a name="06063014000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
proposed approach was set out in paragraph 33 of the statement of
policy intention. Crucially, the commissioner will be required to take
into account whether the issues involved in the case have been, or are
being, formally considered by other persons, and if they have not, or
are not, whether they are more suitable for consideration by
others.</div><a name="06063014000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, where
the case is the subject of legal proceedings, clause 21 will apply to
restrict the commissioner&#146;s powers in relation to proceedings. I
know that this is a probing new clause, and I hope that I have set out
the different
roles.</div><a name="06063014000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000323"></a>Mrs.
Moon:</b> Does the Minister agree that the chances of the
commissioner having a conflict of interest with the CSIW would be the
equivalent of the Children&#146;s Commissioner having a conflict of
interest with the CSIW given that it has a major role to play in the
regulation of children&#146;s services? That conflict has not arisen,
so it seems highly unlikely that it would arise in the case before
us.</div><a name="06063014000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000324"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Absolutely. My hon. Friend again makes an
excellent point, based on her experience. As far as I am aware, there
has not been any conflict between the Children&#146;s Commissioner
and the CSIW and I would not expect it to happen with the commissioner
for older people. With those words I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="06063014000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000325"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister. As he knows, I
was reflecting representations that had been made by, for example, the
city county of Swansea, where there was fear that there could be a
duplication of functions. I am glad that I have been able to do them
the service of not pre-judging the issue myself and uttering words of
wisdom from the Opposition Benches, and allowed him to put his comments
on the record. I am therefore grateful, and I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the motion.</div>
<a name="06063014000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and clause, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000326"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Williams. Before you
conclude our proceedings, I should like to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 65</div>thank you for your stewardship of our proceedings, and to ask that you
pass on our thanks to Mrs. Dean as well. The day has been an
interesting one and we have had contributions from all sides of the
Committee. As is our normal custom, I also thank all the officials,
Doorkeepers, police and other people who have served us so well in the
past few hours. I should like to say to the hon. Member for Chesham and
Amersham and to other Committee members that I think it has been useful
to tease out some issues on this important legislation for Wales.
Although we have not agreed on everything, we have done ourselves and
the people of Wales a great service in properly scrutinising the
Bill.</div>
<a name="06063014000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000327"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Williams, I associate myself entirely with the Minister&#146;s
remarks. I thank everybody who has been involved in the Committee Room
in the process of scrutiny of the Bill. Sadly, following the passage of
the Government of Wales Bill, this Bill will be one of the last of its
nature to be scrutinised in such depth in this place. Nevertheless, I
wish this piece of legislation well. When it started in the other
place&#151;more than a year ago now, in effect&#151;there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 66</div>was little opposition from my side of the House, but there was a genuine
desire to examine it in detail, and I think we have had ample
opportunity to do that. It is rare that we manage to finish
scrutinising a piece of legislation in good order and in good time,
because the Government are usually quite curmudgeonly about time. The
Minister&#146;s generosity in allowing us sufficient time on this
occasion and in enabling us not to have to consider the Bill on another
day could not have anything to do with an election in Blaenau Gwent,
could it? No, that would make me far too
cynical.</div><a name="06063014000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
hon. Friends on this side of the Committee for supporting me and I
thank the hon. Members who spoke for the Liberal Democrats and for
Plaid Cymru. It has been a pleasure working with both of
them.</div><a name="06063014000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06063014000328"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I thank hon. Members for an interesting first
experience in Standing Committee.</div>
