to your first sitting of the main part of the Committee, Mr Weir. Next
Tuesday is the final day before the Easter recess, and the hours of the

the original meeting of the Programming Sub-Committee, we discussed the
possibility that the Committee would not sit on Thursday 5 May, because
people have engagements elsewhere in the country. I shall therefore
move a manuscript amendment to delete Thursday 5 May from
the programme order. I do not intend to amend the programme order to
put in an extra slot but, since Thursday morning sittings last an hour
and a half, I intend that on another Thursday the closure motion should
not be moved until an hour and a half later than the hour to which we
would normally sit on a Thursday afternoon. We will have an informal
discussion across the Committee to work out which Thursday would suit
us all
best.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000020">&#160;</a>

make reference to an independently determined Minimum Income
Standard.’.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Good
morning, Mr Weir. The amendment proposes that, in setting levels for
the universal credit, Ministers should make reference to an objective
and independent minimum income standard. I will expand on this point
later, but I say at the outset that the amendment should not be seen as
a request for another spending commitment. The wording is
careful—to “make reference” to minimum income
standards. It is not necessarily to set benefits at such a level,
although in the long run that might be an aspiration that we could all
share.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
the uninitiated—I apologise for being something of a junkie for
minimum income standards—I will explain a little of the
background to what the amendment is substantively about. I do not know
if this is still the case, but in the old days people used to receive,
with their benefit payment, a statement from the Government:
“This is what the Government believe you need to live
on”. The figure was never actually true, but only more recently
have we been able objectively to test the accuracy of such
statements.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that we understand how much a person needs to live on if
we are to construct a social security system that delivers a minimum
safety net, through which we would not want anyone to fall. In moving
the amendment, my contention is that we need to be aware, as we develop
the universal credit, that current levels of out-of-work benefits fall
well short of what that safety net should be. As we move into a totally
new world of social security and financial support for families and
individuals, we have an opportunity to rethink what we mean by safety
net benefits. At the same time, we will, rightly, think about what we
mean about levels of in-work support and the appropriate balance
between rewards from working and the financial support offered to
people who are either unable or, in some cases, unwilling to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
minimum income standard seeks to answer the question of how much people
need to live on. For clarity, I should say that that is not the same as
the official poverty line, although they are clearly connected. It is
worth noting in passing that adult out-of-work benefits fall well short
of the official poverty line, too.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, I am
not talking about setting benefits in relation to the poverty line this
morning. This point is a little different. Most crucially, what is
different and what is important and valuable about considering a
minimum income standard, is that the work done to develop such a
standard has been based on what the public think. That is a crucial
point, which is about not only the legitimacy of the benefits system,
but how to build popular support for a benefits system that is
adequate, as well as being about removing the stigma from the benefits
system—<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> It is nice to have a
little applause for my argument. As we all agreed earlier this week,
removing that stigma is an important objective of what universal credit
could achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000029">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Work
that was done to identify a minimum income standard for this country in
2010 stated that for a single adult with no children, the income
required to meet an acceptable minimum standard of living is
£14,400 a year—and it will be uprated shortly, of course.
For a couple with two children, that amount is £29,200 a year.
It is clear from those figures that the minimum income standard is able
to take economies of scale into account. It does not give the same
amount per head, then add and add, for each member of the household. It
is a subtle measure. In a few moments, I will explain what goes into it
and discuss some of the things that get counted into the minimum income
standard, as well as how it can be subtle in assessing the needs of
different kinds of households and their different
characteristics.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000030">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes, it is. I should say that the minimum income
standard is still a work in progress, which is another reason why we
might not want to use it as our direct read-across for benefit levels
now. Benefit levels are, of course, set on a national basis. We do not
have regional benefits, except in the case of payment for housing
costs, which reflects the variations of local housing markets now, and
will reflect them to some degree in the future, although we are
concerned that that will be to a lesser
extent.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000032">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> With the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, I
do not think that he listened to my opening remarks, because I was not
suggesting that we should use the minimum income standard as a level
for benefits payments. It might, however, be a long-term aspiration,
and I put on the record that it is a long-standing aspiration of mine.
Those who have watched my campaigning efforts over the past decade will
be aware of my personal commitment to the minimum income standard, but
that is not what the amendment proposes. We are merely saying that
Ministers should make reference to the minimum income standard when
determining what benefit levels should be, for the reasons that I have
mentioned—public buy-in, legitimacy, and so on—which I
will develop as I go through my arguments.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important that we understand how far short basic out-of-work benefits
levels leave families, compared with the minimum income standard. That
might interest the hon. Member for Dover, because he will see the
extent of the gap that we are talking about and why it might not be
realistic, even for those of us who are very keen on the minimum income
standard, to move straight to it in one big, expensive jump. What we
see today is that a minimum income standard for an adult with no
children is more than twice the rate of existing out-of-work benefits.
Families with children, who are on out-of-work benefits only, would
achieve an income of about two thirds of the minimum income standard
that has been assessed, as at April 2010—I am using April 2010
figures. We have not uprated the minimum income
standard, or the benefits levels—we will do
the latter 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 264<a class="bkMark" name="Column264">&#160;</a>
                           </div>next week. The standard does not jump significantly
from year to year—although, as I will show, it does move
significantly over time—so the figures will be in that broad
ballpark.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
the income that pensioners receive from pension credit and other
sources brings them pretty much up to the minimum income standard,
provided that they take up all the benefits to which they are entitled.
That is a big caveat, however, because they are often reluctant to
claim means-tested benefits, and concern about that is shared across
the House. Labour Members very much look forward to seeing
Ministers’ detailed proposals for a foundation pension, and to
seeing how well that might address some of the
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000036">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Perhaps it will assist my right hon. Friend if, in
answering those important questions, I talk the Committee through the
methodology for constructing the minimum income standard, and talk
about who has been involved in its construction, what has happened in
the past with seeking to uprate the standard, and what it is hoped will
be the case for the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000038">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On the
question of whether anyone in this country makes use of this kind of
approach to setting income standards, it is interesting to note in
passing that the Mayor of London, in setting the London living wage, is
adopting a similar philosophy. He is not necessarily using the standard
but he is saying that the minimum wage is plainly not a living wage,
that it does not mean the minimum living standard in London. We have
there a sort of philosophical example, at least, of practical use being
made of the approach in this country, and I will come on to examples
from other
countries.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
do we construct the minimum income standard? That is an important
question, because it would clearly be difficult for me to advocate for
a standard in which people do not have faith and about which they can
feel sceptical, believing that it is a standard for a life of luxury on
benefits. I fully acknowledge that that would present a serious
concern. A team at the university of York has managed the construction
process, with input from teams at a range of academic institutions, and
it is important to understand how the standard has been built up under
that team’s
leadership.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
the public were asked. I know that there is some scepticism about focus
groups. Some concerns were raised in last week’s evidence
sessions about qualitative research, but I think that it has been well
accepted, over many decades of academic research, as a valid way of
advancing and testing policy theory. Representative samples of the
public—focus groups—from the different kinds of family
structures for which the attempt has been made to construct a minimum
income standard, are brought together. They are asked not to say how
much money they think X, Y or Z family needs, or
how much 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 265<a class="bkMark" name="Column265">&#160;</a>
                           </div>money their own family needs, but to construct,
bottom up, what items of household expenditure they think particular
kinds of households need to incur: for example, an adult and two
children, a pensioner, and a young man who is not working but is
looking for a
job.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000041">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Not
surprisingly, the focus groups say some obvious things. They say that
households will need to buy food and drink, items such as cleaning
goods, furniture and bedding, and electrical appliances. I know that
electrical appliances are contentious, with people saying, “Oh,
they’ve all got flat-screen TVs,” and this research
helpfully asks the public what electrical items they think a family
with two children
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000042">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is an interesting question. I suggest that it
would be wrong to ask the public that question today without their
having the benefit of a very wide understanding of the minimum income
standard approach that I advocate. An educated public are likely to
make a better assessment, and that, fundamentally, is my argument. This
is an opportunity for all of us who care about a valid and legitimate
social security system to begin to bring the public onside. We should,
and will, all welcome that. The hon. Gentleman and I anticipate a rosy
future on many fronts, given the sittings over the past couple of days,
and perhaps, in some rosy future, we may have such shared understanding
of minimum income standards that it becomes possible to arrive at a
consensual agreement on what the levels of benefits ought to be. I
regret to say that we are a long way from that position
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I was
explaining what items the public would use to construct a minimum
income standard. I have said food and drink, basic household goods and
electrical appliances, which are contentious. Someone might not feel
that a DVD player was necessary for a family with two children, but
today the public think that it is. Interestingly, and perhaps not
surprisingly, they also think that a computer and internet connection
at home are essential. In 2008, researchers asked the public why they
thought a household needed a computer; the response was that it helped
children’s education. In 2010, the public said something a bit
different. They still said that it helped children’s education,
but they also said that it was vital for a job search. That is an
interesting reflection of the labour market and economic circumstances
in
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is interesting that all the groups, except pensioners, agreed that a
computer and internet connection in the home were necessary for
education, job search or whatever. The public, including pensioners, do
not believe that home internet access is a necessity in constructing a
minimum income standard for pensioners, and based on the experience of
my father crossing the road to the local library to access the
internet, I think that is probably right. However, we are concerned
that that service is about to be removed from the library because of
the cuts. It will be interesting to see what happens to the internet
connection element of the minimum income standard when it is next
reviewed.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000046">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Also in the
standard, which, again, is possibly contentious—it is what the
public say—is the idea that there should be opportunities for
social occasions, tea parties for children, birthday presents and a
one-week, self-catering holiday once a year. That is not perhaps an
absolute necessity to escape destitution, but the public see it as
essential to an acceptable minimum standard of living

I do not think that anybody on the Government Benches or elsewhere

how the question is framed is desperately important to the answer. Were
the questions put in the context, “If you found yourself in
financial difficulties, what are the minimum things you ought to
have?”, or were they more broadly framed, “Ideally, what
do families need to live a modern
life?”<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000048">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will be perfectly frank. It was an open question
of, “What in today’s world constitutes an acceptable
minimum standard of living?” It was not, “If you were
really struggling and on the breadline, what would you do without to
get by?” That too is a question that can vary for different
families. It might be a short-term situation, and we could all forgo a
holiday for one year, and I suspect that many of us would in difficult
financial circumstances, provided we could see the way out. We are
talking about a more abstract construct of a life course: what should
happen in a year of a life course? I accept exactly what the hon.
Gentleman says, but this does not mean that families will not cut their
coat according to their cloth in some years. These are what families in
general circumstances today see as necessities, but that is in the
context of the current economic situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000049">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
I am reminded by the hon. Gentleman’s question that when people
were asked in 2010—a time of straitened circumstances for many
families—what items they would put in the basket as minimum
essential items, they did not take anything out just because times were
hard. They sought necessities such as phones and an internet
connection, and one week’s holiday remained, even in difficult
times. That is because the public understand that it is a more
objective assessment. It is meant to assess not a particular crisis
point but general needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000050">&#160;</a>

Does she not believe that context is extraordinarily important to the
questions being asked? I repeat that nobody would deny that the basket
that she describes is what everybody would wish to have as a minimum if
they found themselves in certain circumstances, but how those
circumstances apply to the family is crucial. I contend that she would
receive a different answer if she changed the nature and context of the
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000051">&#160;</a>

venture to suggest that it is the right one. It is about identifying
the norm for today that delivers a minimum but acceptable standard of
living. I suggest that a civilised and large economy such as this

£40,000 a year for a family. She mentioned a net figure of
£29,000, which is presumably a net figure of cash in hand. There

discussing families who are likely, in many cases, to be below the net
for tax entirely, although not all will be. That is why we are trying
to set safety-net benefits. I think that we all share an
aspiration— I must admit that it has not been particularly well
achieved in recent years—not to allow people in and out of the
tax system so that they both receive benefits and pay tax. The hon.

costs are also in the shopping basket, although not cars,
interestingly. Cars have never gone into the shopping basket for any
kind of family. I find that interesting. We might all think that most
families would tend to regard it as a necessity for taking their kids
to school, doing the weekly supermarket shop, visiting their parents
and so on. However, cars are not in the minimum income standard and
never have
been.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000059">&#160;</a>

admitted, push the level up. That is important, too. It answers the
question asked earlier by the hon. Member for Meon Valley about how one
would cut expenditure in bad times if one had to. It is recognised that
the standard is transparent. People understand what goes into the

it would be more appropriate to address the issue through the work of
the Cabinet Office under the Prime Minister’s leadership on
well-being and measures of well-being in our society? It is an evolving
agenda that is still being developed by academics and people working in
this field, so we should be continuing the debate in that context,
rather than in this Bill
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000061">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, because she brings
me to my next point. I am conscious that this is a debate that goes
wider that merely setting the level of the universal credit, but in a
consideration of where the universal credit fits in and the
implications of the financial support that we provide to families
through it, well-being is important, exactly as she says. It is
important for health outcomes and to enable children to participate in
education—I mentioned earlier the reasons the public believe
people need computers and so on. It is also a very important issue when
we think about helping families to avoid falling into debt, which I
know is an issue of great concern across the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000062">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Jobseeker’s
allowance, currently £51.85 a week for a young person aged 18 to
25, will rise to £53.45 next week. For a working age adult of 25
or over it is currently £65.45 a week, which will go up to
£67.50 in the next few days. Hold those figures in mind, because
the minimum income standard says that a single adult needs
£45.65 for food alone. So, if a young person aged 18
to 25—currently on an income of £51.85, going up to
£53.45 next week—is spending the minimum income standard
correctly, then £45.65 of that is going out on food
bills.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000063">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
food bill has been validated. I said earlier that the minimum income
standard was constructed by asking the public, “What do you
think people need?” Obviously they said that people need to eat,
among other things. I am sure that there will be questions in hon.
Members’ minds as to what people are eating. Is it all junk
food, takeaways, and far too much booze? The answer is that the food
standard in the minimum income standard has been validated by
independent nutritionists. They went out and asked, what is the minimum
needed for a young person, a working age adult, and so on, to have a
healthy diet? So the food standard is objectively validated, and then
it is price-checked at Tesco—I can tell you—both in the
supermarket and online. It was observed that it is cheaper to shop in
the supermarket than online, so the minimum income standard can reflect
all of that; it is a very subtle standard and I like it a lot, as hon.
Members will
notice.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000064">&#160;</a>

does allow for alcohol in modest amounts, which I am sure is in the
minds of hon. Members. It assumes—rather worryingly—that
if you are a single adult you will drink at home rather than go out. It
assumes couples might go out socially to the pub, but the amounts
allowed for alcohol are actually very modest—around £4.50
a week. It is a transparent index, which is important because it
addresses concerns such as “Oh, well, they’re burning it
all off on booze and junk
food.”<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000065">&#160;</a>

the computer and phone, which the public say are essential, whatever

establish a benchmark that all Governments can be measured against.
However, in order to establish clearly what this means I think we need
an assessment of what the aggregate cost to the country would be. Given
the current state of the public finances, in order to have credibility
we need a clear case of where that money would come from, and where it
would not be spent. She has been very careful in the amendment not to
say what those levels should be at this point in time, but in terms of
broader public understanding it would be helpful to know the
opportunity cost of going down this
route.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000067">&#160;</a>

Committee. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, I am not proposing that
we spend money on this benefit and put such a restriction in the Bill
today, but we have a real opportunity to compare the cost of securing
an adequate safety net for people when they are out of work with the
information that we also have available about the costs that fall to
society as a whole from poor health, poor educational attainment and
the strain on our other public services such as criminal justice and so
on, for which we have some estimates. One estimate in 2006 suggested
that the cost of child poverty on that sort of assessment was some
£25 billion a year. So I agree with what the hon. Gentleman
said: it would be right to cost out what it would cost to get all the
way there today and to cost out, if we wanted to do this over time,
steps on the way to achieving it. But that cost would need to be offset
by the evidence of costs saved elsewhere in the public expenditure on
families and households.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000068">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I would say two things to the hon. Gentleman.
First, it is wrong to extrapolate policy on the basis of two families
in one street. We politicians have a tendency to do that because it
gets us popular support. It is how the public currently view the
experience of poverty and disadvantage in this country, but it is
unfortunately an overall misrepresentation of the way in which families
in poverty
live.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000071">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I specifically referred to my constituents because
I did not want to refer to my personal experience. I am being genuinely
honest and speaking from experience, but I will broaden it out. I meet
youngsters from abroad, particularly those from the Indian
subcontinent, who experience genuine poverty. I will quote my
grandmother, as I frequently do in the House. When I was a young child,
she would say that nobody in this country is poor compared with the
childhood that she had when she would not know where the next meal was
coming from for the next 72 hours. Poverty is always relative. We are
talking about the poverty of ambition and
aspiration.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000072">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the hon. Gentleman says, I am afraid we are
going to disagree. I do not think that we are talking about a poverty
of ambition and aspiration, but a poverty of resource. I mentioned Adam
Smith earlier, because the point that hon. Gentleman makes about
poverty in other countries is one that we hear often, and it is an
important one to address, but we address poverty in this country by
making sure that people can participate fully in the society in which
they live. That is why Adam Smith has always explained to us the way in
which we need to think about poverty in time and in place. In talking
about how necessity should be defined with reference to present-day
standards within a particular country, he
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000073">&#160;</a>

necessaries I understand not only the commodities which are
indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the
custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even
of the lowest order, to be without. A linen shirt, for example, is,
strictly speaking, not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans
lived, I suppose, very comfortably though they had no linen. But in the
present times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day
labourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt,
the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree
of poverty which, it is presumed, nobody can fall into without extreme

receipt of benefits, and rightly so: they get housing benefit and tax
credits under the current system, and they will be in receipt of
universal credit under the future system. We should look at this
minimum income standard not as something that simply determines what
happens to people when they are not working, but what happens to people
on low incomes as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000075">&#160;</a>

will reaffirm the Government’s commitment to the targets and the

cross-party support during its passage in 2010. We can be confident
that we will see that reaffirmation from the Government because the
Prime Minister himself said in

about this. The hon. Gentleman has done me a tremendous personal
favour. He is absolutely right. We had several years of substantial
progress in reducing child poverty under Labour Administrations and
then we had two very bad years when child poverty rose. It is crucial
that hon. Members understand why that happened. Child poverty fell
until 2006-07 because we were pumping money into family budgets. We
were using tax credits and benefit increases to lift more and more
families with children above the poverty line. The two years when
poverty rose are the two years in which, regrettably, the previous
Labour Government did not significantly increase benefits or tax
credits either for families in work or out of
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000080">&#160;</a>

years of fall, we flat-lined for a year. I hope that we will start to
see a slight improvement as the effects of Labour’s realisation
of its error and actions to begin putting money back into families are
fed through. We have a long lag in receiving the child poverty data; as
my right hon. Friend says, next week we will receive the figures that
will take us up to the end of 2009-10. We are always looking a long way
back at our child poverty figures, and we will not know for some
considerable time—until 2012—how well Labour did overall
in working towards the target to halve child poverty by 2010. Hon.

the hon. Lady join me in making representations to the Backbench

suggestion, which I would certainly like to pursue with her outside the

I take her point about the much broader front that I am opening up, so
perhaps I should draw my remarks to a close by highlighting one other
aspect of my arguments for looking at the minimum income standard as
part of the way in which we set the levels of universal credit. That is
quite salient—it is not on the wider and interesting social
policy territory that we have been treading on over the past few
minutes, but the issue of the level at which the universal credit is
not just set, but
uprated.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
suspect that we will have quite a lengthy debate later on uprating, but
to inform that debate, it might be of interest to hon. Members, who I
know have been taking a keen interest in my description of the minimum
income standard, to know what effect its uprating over 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 273<a class="bkMark" name="Column273">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the past 10 years has had. In the year to April 2010, the items in the
minimum income standard, and therefore the standard itself, rose by
between 3% and 4%, which was broadly in line with general inflation. In
one year, it was a good indicator of rising living costs for families
and households. However, over the whole of the preceding 10 years back
to 2000, because of patterns of rising food costs, public transport
costs and the costs of some other items that were in the basket, the
minimum income standard’s budget came in at 38% upwards of the
2000 figure, compared with a general inflation of 23% over that
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is my other argument for using the minimum income standard in the
context of the way in which the universal credit will be managed over
time. We are, as I said, looking forward to a debate later this morning
or this afternoon—depending on our speed—on uprating, and
it would be useful for hon. Members to bear that fact in mind and, when
we discuss the right measure of uprating and how we approach uprating
of the universal credit, be aware of the socio-economic context that
the minimum income standard helps to expose. I know that hon. Members
would like the debate to continue extensively, but we have others
matters to address.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000088">&#160;</a>

proposing today that we set benefits at the minimum income standard,
although hon. Members will be interested to know that some in other
countries are exploring such a thing, including the mayor of New York,
who has been doing some interesting work on it. Inevitably the Nordic
countries are looking at it, as are a number of other European
countries, New Zealand and Australia. It is an important debate to have
when introducing a radical change to our social security system, which
the universal credit undoubtedly is. It is an important opportunity for
us to open up a wider debate about the purpose and the structure of our
social security system. To do that in a way that genuinely involves the
participation of the public, as the minimum income standard has done, I
would argue, very effectively, helps to lower the stigma of the benefit
system. It helps to legitimise in the public’s mind the way in
which we structure and pitch financial support for families, and,
importantly, it will give us the opportunity to compare the input costs
of benefits with the returns on
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000089">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady raised in her lengthy, thoughtful and knowledgeable
contribution. No one in the Government doubts her experience and
commitment or the passion and energy that she has put into these causes

benefit from it.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000090">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On this
matter, however, we simply do not agree with the hon. Lady. Most
fundamentally, the purpose of the changes, and the intent of the
introduction of universal credit, is to deal with poverty by moving
more people out of the benefit trap in which many of them live and into
the workplace. There is no doubt that some of the figures that we see
in this country are scandalous, such as the number of children who are
being brought up in workless households. The cycle of generational
worklessness has a hugely damaging effect on the generations as they
come through—young people who have grown up in an 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 274<a class="bkMark" name="Column274">&#160;</a>
                           </div>environment where their parents and grandparents did
not work—and in many of our most deprived areas the generations
pass pretty quickly these days. The received wisdom of life as it
perhaps once was—the working day, elements of family
responsibility and the kind of structure of life that most of us have
experienced to a greater or lesser degree—simply is not there.
We have a big challenge to help those young people and their families
to take a step into what for many is the unknown: a life of work, where
there is a different focus in their days and their weeks and they are
taking a step out of the poverty trap in which they now sit.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000091">&#160;</a>

is the core purpose behind the Bill. At its heart, and I suspect that
there is a philosophical difference between us and the Opposition, we
are passionately of the view that the best and most powerful way to
deal with poverty and deprivation in our society is to help people to
make that move into the workplace. That is why we are moving ahead with
the Work programme and the universal credit, and why they are so
central to what we want to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000092">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I completely agree with the Minister about the
centrality of work and the value of the universal credit, among other
things, in improving taper rates and incentives. Is it not true,
however, that half of children in poverty live in households where
someone is in work? That is also something that we have to address,
which is why the fundamental arguments that my hon. Friend the Member
for Stretford and Urmston is advancing are
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000093">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have never doubted the importance of the
issues that the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston has brought
before the House. Although it is always a delight and a pleasure to see
a newly elected Conservative—indeed, now Liberal
Democrat—Member of Parliament, the hon. Lady’s arrival in
the House has added genuine value to it. She has brought expertise from
outside that will inform debates in the House in the years ahead, and
we welcome her being here.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That does not
mean, however, that we shall always agree. The central point in the
hon. Lady’s proposal is that it would have a significant adverse
effect on the likelihood of people moving from benefits into work, and
my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton South West set out the
position clearly and plainly. The hon. Lady helpfully provided some
figures for the Committee. She talked about an income of £29,000
for a family, and my understanding is that that is net of tax and
national insurance. Whether or not it is net of tax or national
insurance, the figure is higher than the typical wage of the average
household in the UK. Likewise, the figure for a single person of
£14,400, or some £270 a week, which is equivalent to 45
hours work on the minimum wage, is higher than would be experienced by
someone moving into the workplace. We have recognised that in the
structure of the universal credit, which is designed to address the
point that the shadow Minister made about poverty in
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000095">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
integration of the in-work and out-of-work benefits system is designed
to create a smoother flow with a clearer ladder. The taper is designed
to constantly encourage people to take further steps in work, to have a
dynamic effect that encourages people to work more hours, to be more
ambitious and to end up with more money for their family at the end of
the week. That will help lift more children out of
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000096">&#160;</a>

service businesses are manned by people who have come to the UK from
other countries and found jobs. I could take Committee members to

workless households, but is there not a danger of conflating the
arguments about the numbers of people on benefits of various kinds as
all being generationally workless? I represent a seat where the fourth
most deprived ward in Scotland happens to be situated, although there
are lots of wealthy bits as well. My experience is that many of those
people are in and out of work. Not all of them are, and I am sure we
could all point to such cases. It is not right to imply—perhaps
the Minister was not doing that—that the number of people out of
work at any snapshot in time are long-term, intergenerationally
workless.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000099">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is right to say that there is a
mix, but I stand by my comments. There are a large number of people out
there, who are long-term, intergenerationally, out of work. She is
right: some people move into and out of work. One of the strengths of
the universal credit is that it makes it easier for people to move into
and out of work without having to reapply for benefits every time, in a
system that is much more likely to encourage them to keep looking for
work and to keep taking the steps that will build up more substantial
work in their lives and help lift their family out of
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000100">&#160;</a>

Minister’s point, but in our evidence session with the Secretary
of State, I asked him whether he would supply us with figures from the
Department for Work and Pensions on the number of intergenerationally
workless and put them in context. It is an important point, and one
with which we totally agree. It is also important, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Edinburgh East said, that we understand the relationship
between long-term and intergenerationally workless, and the much larger
pool of people who are on the borders and are moving constantly in and
out of
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000101">&#160;</a>

number to hand. If I recall correctly, there are, for example, 900,000
people on incapacity benefit, who have been on benefits for many years.
We would all agree that many of those people, with the right help, can
get back into the workplace. That is what the Work programme will aim
to deliver. We are describing a multifaceted problem, but at the core,
the best way of helping all these people, whether they are
intergenerationally workless—when nobody has worked for a long
time—or whether they drift in and out of work and go through all
the challenges of getting a job for a short term, losing it and
reapplying for benefits, is the system that

                           </div>we are putting in place for a universal credit. What is common in all
those cases is that if we have a welfare system that seeks to replicate
the situation that a family might experience in working life, it will
create a disincentive for people to move into working
life.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000102">&#160;</a>

being lifted out of poverty in the past eight or 10 years, and
Labour’s success in doing that, which is difficult to deny,
while regretting that they had not put in enough money in the past two
years to continue that progress. Does that not demonstrate that pumping
money into the system is an artificial way of dealing with the problem?
When the money falls away, as it inevitably does in economic cycles, it
is revealed that the structural problems of unemployment still sit
underneath and that poverty is still
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000103">&#160;</a>

into paid work is the best route out of poverty. Does the Minister not
agree, therefore, that one of the elements of success in
Labour’s policies for reducing child poverty was the increase in
the employment rate until 2008? Lone parent employment, for example,
rose from 44% in 1994-95 to some 57% by 2007-08. Does the Minister not

in the UK. Thanks to the determined work of the hon. Lady’s
colleague, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field),
who chipped away at it month after month and year after year, what
emerged was a picture showing that the vast majority of those jobs had
gone to migrant workers from overseas. Through those years we
consistently had some 5 million people on out-of-work benefits, as well
as the other underlying issues relating to children growing up in
workless households, which the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston

Responsibility forecasts that 900,000 new jobs will be created in this

by the Minister. However, for reasons of clarity, I should say that the
purpose of our discussion was to air an issue about which I feel
strongly. It was useful for us to have such an effective policy debate.

do not intend to press the amendment to a

                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the right hon. Gentleman referred to some important issues that
coalesce around the argument that people should be better off in work,
which is a point that Ministers have been making throughout the
presentation of their proposals. We entirely endorse such a position
and want to achieve it, but not at the expense of forcing people who
are not able to be in paid employment into a position of poverty.
Perhaps that is the real difference between our
approaches.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister said that he was worried that the £29,000-plus figure
that I cited for a family with two children was way in excess of the
typical wage of a low-earning household. Helpfully, I have received
advice that enables me to respond to the point made by the hon. Member
for Redcar. That £29,000 is a gross figure, so the stretch is
perhaps not as large as might have been feared. None the less, the
Minister makes the important point that we need to ensure that people
are better off in work. The minimum income standard has a useful
application for setting wage levels, and I have mentioned the work of
the Mayor of London in that context,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
I fundamentally disagree with the Minister that inadequate, low
safety-net benefits propel people into work. All the evidence is to the
contrary. If benefits are inadequate, people do not move into work,
because the effort, the strain, and the drain on one’s personal

person’s health might be compromised. People’s time is
certainly compromised as they seek desperately to make ends meet. They
might be devoting themselves to fending off creditors and shopping
around for the cheapest items that can enable them to feed their
family. Mothers, in particular, will often go without food themselves
in such situations, clearly depleting their own energy and damaging
their health, and therefore their ability to move into paid
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000121">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have had
an interesting opening debate, thanks to the contribution of my hon.
Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston. Amendments 18 to 20, which
relate to the regulations to be tabled, are simple, so I do not imagine
that we will spend very long debating them. It is worth making the
point, however, that my hon. Friend was absolutely right to table
amendment 3 and initiate our previous debate. If we look at the note on
the regulations under clause 9 that has been circulated, we see that
appended to it is a list of the current 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 280<a class="bkMark" name="Column280">&#160;</a>
                           </div>applicable amounts in jobseeker’s allowance. It is right that we
reflect on the amounts that are currently being paid to people on
benefit and the amounts that are likely to be paid in the future to
people on universal credit in the light of the objective research that
my hon. Friend
described.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
18 to 20 relate to the question of how the amounts that are paid out
will be updated in the future. They would oblige the Government to set
out in the forthcoming regulations how the amounts payable would be
annually uprated.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government and Labour take different views on this subject. Given the
scale of the deficit, we have accepted that there should be a more
modest formula for uprating benefits in the next three years that is
linked to CPI. For many years, the uprating has been linked to RPI, but
I understand that the Government believe that the CPI uprating formula
should be adopted permanently. Will the Minister confirm that the
Government intend permanently to use CPI uprating for universal credit?
The procedure in the past, which was adopted by the previous
Government, was an uprating in line with RPI, and it is important to
draw attention to the fact that that is very different from uprating in
line with earnings.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let us look
at the figures in the annexe to the note that has been circulated to us
on the regulations. My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston
referred to some of these figures in her speech earlier. It is worth
bearing in mind that the figures have most certainly not been uprated
in line with earnings for many years, but they have been uprated in
line with RPI. As I understand it, the Government want to move away
from that form of uprating and permanently to put in place what has
generally been a significantly lower index—the CPI—for
the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All the
amendments would do is to require the mechanism to be explicit in the
regulations so that it would be subject to debate. If we felt, as
Labour Members do, that a different procedure ought to be adopted, we
could argue for that and have a permanent arrangement that everybody
understood. The Minister circulated the current figures for
jobseeker’s allowance as an indication of how the regulations
under clause 9 are likely to look. Will he tell us whether he expects
that the standard allowance for universal credit will be the same as
the figure in the regulations that have been circulated? The present
amount is £51.85 although, as my hon. Friend said, it is about
to go up next week. Is that the figure that the Government have in mind
for the standard allowance for universal credit? Does the Minister
expect that the differential between the single and the couple rate in
universal credit will be as it presently is for jobseeker’s
allowance? Does he expect that the list of the different payments to be
made—for example for dependants and for a couple with both
members aged under 18—will be precisely the same for universal
credit as it has been for jobseeker’s allowance? The substantial
point is that permanently linking these benefits to a rate that is
generally lower than the rate that households have to contend with due
to inflation—that is to say RPI—is a matter of great
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000138">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I can affirm, as I did on that occasion, if I
remember rightly, that tying us to CPI uprating for good would be a
serious mistake. We have talked already about the real implications of
the current levels of JSA. It would be a mistake to tie ourselves
permanently to a rate of indexation that is less than the rate of
inflation that people actually experience.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000140">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As my right hon. Friend says, the amendment
requires the Bill to provide for a mechanism for uprating. That is
important, because even the mechanisms that have been used up till
now—the retail prices index and the Rossi index—have been
shown to have deficiencies. Earlier this month we learned that the
consumer prices index should probably have been 0.3 of a percentage
point higher each year between 1997 and 2009 than Office for National
Statistics figures had stated. That was because of a discrepancy
between the figures recorded by the ONS and the actual rise over that
period in the cost of certain goods, such as clothing and
footwear.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again I
emphasise the point about ensuring that we have a benefits system that
enjoys perceived legitimacy and credibility. When there is concern
about inflation indices, as I think is the case is in the light of the
information released earlier this month, it is important that the
Government are absolutely committed to a mechanism for uprating that is
accepted and understood by the public. Amendment 18 requires that the
Bill is transparent about that, which is why I support
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I begin by
reassuring the Committee that we already intend to make such a link.
Paragraph 22 of schedule 2 amends the Social Security Administration
Act 1992, which is the current mechanism for the routine uprating of
benefits, to provide arrangements for uprating universal credit. The
mechanism that the right hon. Gentleman seeks to introduce will operate
under schedule 2.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under those
arrangements, we are committed to reviewing the amounts of the standard
allowance, and other additions within universal credit, to ascertain
whether they have retained their value in relation to the general level
of prices. Following such a review, the Secretary of State may decide
to increase the amounts of universal credit in the annual uprating
order. The arrangements are the same as those that apply to all
existing out-of-work benefits and to the state pension credit. The
Committee should be reassured, therefore, that the Bill provides
suitable arrangements for the standard annual uprating.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000145">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Neither the
amendment nor the existing provisions for uprating, which we will use
for universal credit, specify how the general level of prices is to be
estimated. As the right hon. Gentleman has said, in the past, the RPI
has been the basis for uprating income-related benefits, excluding
housing costs, and different elements of the tax credit system have
been uprated in different
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have decided that the best way to establish universal credit is to use
a standard index, which should be the consumer prices index. Of course,
however, the whole structure of the Bill is sufficiently flexible. My
bookcase will make its first appearance of the morning—we built
the bookcase to enable a future Government of whatever persuasion to do
things differently, should they choose to do so. Nothing in the Bill
would prevent that from happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For the time
being, however, and certainly for the foreseeable future, we have
formed the view that the CPI will be the basis on which we uprate
benefits. We have no plan to change that, but the matter will be open
for another Government to argue for something different in future,
although they would have to explain how they intended to pay for such a
change. I hope that my explanation reassures the right hon. Gentleman
about the nature of the Bill and its intent.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman has asked specifically about the standard allowance.
Essentially, the standard allowance for universal credit is intended to
mirror the comparable standard rates in JSA and employment and support
allowance, which, as he has rightly said, go up in the next few days.
In the standard adult rate of JSA and ESA, the basic component will be
approximately £67 a week. That is the building block that we
intend to use for the universal credit. In two years’ time, once
the universal credit has been established, that amount will be
different, because it will have been uprated. The intention is to
transpose the elements that he has described into the universal credit
system. I hope that I have reassured the Committee and that the right
hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000149">&#160;</a>

Government policy, on which, if I may, I will comment, as it will
explain the context. As a

                           </div>result of the significant change that the Government are proposing, the
direction of travel of the amendments has altered. As Members are
aware, during last week’s evidence sessions I raised with a
number of witnesses the question of the importance of these provisions
within universal credit. I hope that Members will recall that many
witnesses said that these are vital provisions and will matter a great
deal to the people concerned. The amendments are in specific reference
to children, so I will refer specifically to the Government’s
proposals about children as they have been indicated to us thus far. I
have a range of questions, and the Minister’s responses will
determine our
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000167">&#160;</a>

am somewhat surprised by the Government’s approach to informing
us about such significant developments. We had the Secretary of
State’s statement at last week’s evidence session. It was
perhaps not entirely his fault, but it was somewhat rushed and many of
us were  not entirely clear exactly what was being proposed. I
therefore made it my business to dig out the detail of the
Government’s proposals. I eventually found, on the DWP website,
a paper, “Additions for longer durations on Universal
Credit”, which details significant changes to universal credit
and to the current provision. I was a wee bit concerned that I had to
dig that out from the DWP website. I do not want to be self-righteous:
I appreciate the scale of the changes the Government are introducing
and the pace of legislation; I was a Minister for a number of years, as
you know, Mr Weir, in the Scottish Government, and I appreciate that
Governments sometimes have to work to perhaps not the most perfect time
scale.<a class="bkMark" name="11040110000168">&#160;</a>
