remove their jackets, although I see that someone in the Committee has

Members would realise that permission should be
given.</div>

Although I have served on many Public Bill Committees, this is the

all hon. Members to the Committee. I particularly
welcome the hon. Member for Northampton, South and my hon. Friend the

allow the Committee to meet at 10.30 am and 4 pm on Tuesdays and 9 am

the consideration of schedules immediately after the
consideration of the relevant clauses. For example, schedule
1 will be considered immediately after clause 1. I am sure
that no hon. Member wishes to see the Bill unnecessarily delayed.
Bearing in mind that it has already been the subject of 21 months of
Select Committee

							<a name="07112234000275"></a>Mr.

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in
clause 1, page 2, line 9, at
end insert &#145;not exceeding three
metres&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07112234000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is the first of four dealing with the works, works permissions
and works authorisations necessary to build Crossrail. The Bill vests
those permissions and powers in the nominated undertaker. The amendment
deals with clause 1(4), which
states:</div>
					<a name="07112234000039"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
constructing or maintaining any of the scheduled works, the nominated
undertaker may deviate vertically from the level shown for that work on
the deposited sections to any extent
downwards.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112234000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment
would add the words &#147;not exceeding 3 metres&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112234000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are concerned that the
subsection, as so worded, may not confront some of the realities of
construction. Might there not be sections of the route in which to
allow any deviation downwards would mean that the scheduled works would
hit, touch or interfere with all sorts of other infrastructures? Why is
there any need 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>for unlimited downward deviation and to what purpose? The limits of
deviation are set in other paragraphs in the Bill. Consistently during
the sittings of the Committee, I will wish to test why the Government
seek to take powers outside either the scheduled route or the limits of
deviation.</div>
					<a name="07112234000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I point out
that subsection (3) gives the nominated undertaker the power to deviate
laterally</div>
					<a name="07112234000043"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to any extent
within the limits of deviation for that
work&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112234000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">So why not deviate
vertically downwards to the limits of deviation for that work? Might it
not be sensible to so limit that downward vertical deviation as well? I
look forward to the Minister&#146;s reassurance as to why the
Government wish to take those
powers.</div>
					<a name="07112234000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000276"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The limits of deviation are well precedented in
earlier private Acts for railways. The Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act
1996 was the last hybrid Bill for a railway project; mention of that
Bill will recur many times during our debates and in the
Department&#146;s model clauses for orders made under the Transport
and Works Act 1992. They reflect the fact that the design of Crossrail
is only at an outline stage; the detailed design will come later.
Therefore, flexibility is essential. The nominated undertaker will, in
any event, be bound by the environmental minimum requirements, which
are a set of arrangements that will regulate Crossrail
construction.</div>
					<a name="07112234000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
general limit of deviation of 3 m upwards, or 6 m in specific
instances, is there to protect people with surface interests who need
the comfort that noise and movement will not affect their properties.
Downward deviation, for obvious reasons, would tend to make such
concerns diminish and, therefore, there is no need to put a downward
limit on deviation in the way that the amendment would do. With that
assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw
the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112234000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000277"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I am interested in what the Minister says, but
would he would clarify one more point? He ended by saying that downward
deviation would not incur the same noise problems that upward deviation
from the scheduled route might. For example, if the scheduled route
were 3 m from the surface, a downward deviation beyond the
limits&#151;which the clause particularly addresses&#151;might well
incur noise issues. Will he reassure the Committee that, without
putting a limit to vertical downward deviation, there will not be
potential noise problems for the
public?</div>
					<a name="07112234000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000278"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I am happy to clarify the matter as best I can.
Clearly, in a project of this size, our priority must be to protect the
interests and the environment of people who live or work at the surface
of the Crossrail route. Downward deviation from the existing plans will
have far less a detrimental effect on the environment than would upward
deviation. As I have already said, that is well precedented; the factor
was specifically written into the 1996 Act simply because of that
concern. I fail to see how a downward deviation of greater than 3 m
could have any greater detrimental effect or could not have a more
beneficial environmental effect on people living and working on the
surface at the point of Crossrail
construction.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>
					<a name="07112234000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07112234000279"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): The concern
arises from the fact, which was drummed into us on many occasions
during the Select Committee&#146;s consideration of this hybrid Bill,
that noise and vibration are not necessarily dependent upon depth, but
on the structure, the geology and other matters of that kind. A deeper
level of boring can occasionally cause more problems for people living
above it than a higher level. The issue is not that simple and I
understand why there could be confusion. It took me a long time to get
my head around it, and we had two years at it. With that in mind and
because Crossrail travels through London, many people were concerned
about vibration, noise and the impact on their daily lives. This was an
important issue. Consequently, I would hate to think that we were going
to open up that issue again. Will the Minister consider that
point?</div>
					<a name="07112234000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000280"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns.
As I said in my opening remarks, he and my hon. Friend the Member for
Leicester, South have almost literally an in-depth knowledge of the
Crossrail project. He is right to suggest that depth alone will not
necessarily alleviate the effects on the surface of vibration or noise.
However, neither will deviation downwards have a detrimental effect on
the environment at the surface. The hon. Gentleman is right to point
out that there are other things to consider such as the geology of the
area. However, I fail to see how a downward deviation of greater than 3
m would have a detrimental effect on the environment.
</div>
					<a name="07112234000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are at a very early stage and the work has not yet
started. It is simply a standard procedure in a Bill of this kind to
allow some flexibility. That is all we are asking for. There is no
intention on the part of the engineers or the Crossrail team
deliberately to need that extra deviation. However, in a project of
this scale, possibly a year or two before work begins, that discretion
is needed in the Bill. As I have said, it has always been a part of
these hybrid Bills and I expect it will be a part of all hybrid Bills
in future. On that note, I ask the hon. Member for Wimbledon to
withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112234000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000281"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I accept that this an
exceptional Bill and will require some exceptional conditions to be
placed in it. I accept that there is a need for flexibility. What is a
well established principle, as the Minister has said, is that there is
a deposited route and a deposited schedule of works. There is also a
deviation that allows flexibility and there is a limit to that
deviation. The amendment would introduce some restriction on works
outside that limit of deviation. Although I am happy to accept the
Minister&#146;s reassurance, we will test this point a number of
times in Committee because there are bounds to flexibility. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000282"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I do not wish to detain the Committee long, but
this clause is important. It authorises the nominated undertaker, who
may or may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>not be the Secretary of State, or a nominated undertaker nominated by
the Secretary of State, to construct and maintain the works necessary
for Crossrail. Those works are specified in the Bill as the scheduled
works and some of the clause&#146;s subsections, as we have just
discussed, show that there is no limit to the specification of
deviation. I return to the remark that I have just made and to a trend
that is reflected throughout the Bill. In a number of clauses, powers
are granted to deviate from the line of build without limit, and that
principle starts in this clause. We will want to test that principle
several times throughout the Committee&#146;s proceedings.</div>
					<a name="07112234000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We entirely accept that this is
an exceptional project, for which flexibility will certainly be
required. However, those powers and such flexibility must be reasonable
in both effect and extent. We are concerned that in several cases that
is not so. I am happy that the Minister has been able to reassure the
Committee on the clause, but I am doubtful that he will be able to do
so for all the clauses as we
proceed.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000283"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that
Crossrail is an exceptional project. However, it is not an
unprecedented project and I will refer many times during these debates
to exactly the same provisions that were in the Channel Tunnel Rail
Link Act 1996. Clause 1 authorises the construction and maintenance by
the nominated undertaker of the Crossrail works specified in schedule
1. It is a standard clause, similar to those found in all works
Bills.</div>
					<a name="07112234000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
also sets out the permitted limits of deviation from the siting of
works as shown on the relevant plans. Those limits are well precedented
in earlier private Acts for railways and reflect the fact that the
design of Crossrail is of necessity at outline stage only. Detailed
design will come later, and therefore some flexibility is essential.
That said, the nominated undertaker will be bound by the environmental
minimum requirements, a set of parameters that will control most of the
construction of
Crossrail.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> These amendments and their purposes are
identical. Amendment No. 26 deals with disputes over highway access and
amendment No. 27 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>deals with disputes over the discharge of water. Amendment No. 26
proposes that the relevant subsection should read:</div>
					<a name="07112234000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any dispute with a
highway authority under this paragraph shall, if the parties agree, be
referred to
arbitration&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112234000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would remove the ultimate power for dispute resolution from the hands
of the Secretary of State. Disputes should be referred to arbitration,
the process of which should be designed to ensure that a solution is
reached. It seems that there is no need for a provision to be written
into the Bill that will allow decisions to be made by the Government,
rather than by someone charged with arbitration. There is a risk that
the Government will not only be one of the parties in the arbitration,
but the arbiter as well, which seems to be an inequitable position.
Therefore, I look forward to the Minister accepting these sensible and
reasonable
amendments.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
agree with what my hon. Friend has said. Does the Minister not also
understand that, in a sense, the Secretary of State&#146;s power is
imposed only when the parties disagree at the outset? The danger is
that the Secretary of State will get involved in what could be a very
difficult political debate between parties that disagree about
arbitration. Given the amount of compulsory purchasing and the other
elements in which either the Secretary of State is potentially a final
arbiter or state bodies own part of the land concerned, it seems the
worst of all worlds for the Secretary of State to take on that power.
However, as my hon. Friend rightly points out, the parties should be
obliged to go to arbitration whether or not they
agree.</div>
					<a name="07112234000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000288"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> As the hon. Member for Wimbledon knows, paragraph
1 of schedule 2 grants the nominated undertaker general powers to carry
out ancillary works additional to the scheduled works. Paragraph 2
allows the nominated undertaker to provide highway accesses, whether
permanent or temporary, at the points marked on the deposited plans,
except when the highway authority objects on the specific grounds
provided. Such access may be similarly provided with the consent of the
highway authority&#151;such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld&#151;at any other point within the Bill limits. Any disputes
about the provision of highway accesses are to be determined by the
Secretary of State unless the parties agree that the matter should be
referred to
arbitration.</div>
					<a name="07112234000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
8 allows the nominated undertaker to make use of sewers and
watercourses for removing water in connection with the construction or
maintenance of Crossrail. Any disputes about making use of sewers and
watercourses are to be determined by the Secretary of State unless the
parties agree that the matter should be referred to
arbitration.</div>
					<a name="07112234000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s ability, as the
hon. Gentleman said, to determine disputes about highway accesses or
the discharge of water, meaning that they would in all cases go
straight to arbitration. Giving the Secretary of State the ability to
determine disputes about various matters is well precedented in
projects of national significance such as Crossrail. The provisions are
modelled on identical provisions in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>Act 1996, and the Bill contains many other provisions whereby the
Secretary of State, sometimes acting jointly with another Secretary of
State&#151;for example, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs&#151;will be able to determine disputes.</div>
					<a name="07112234000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Arbitration can be a rather
time-consuming and costly experience, particularly when both sides do
not feel that it is necessary, and the Bill&#146;s approach is to
allow for arbitration only when both sides agree. The amendments would
ensure that arbitration occurred even when both parties did not want
it. The provisions in the Bill worked well in legislation for the
channel tunnel rail link, and Ministers are well used to exercising
such functions. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07112234000289"></a>Stephen

to his comments about precedent in other legislation and to the point
that the amendments would refer people to arbitration even if they did
not want it, which in some cases is extremely helpful. I hope that he
has taken on board the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Cities
of London and Westminster, who made the point that, in relatively minor
cases, the Secretary of State may be drawn into political disputes that
he would not wish to be drawn into. Nevertheless, given the precedent
in other legislation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

							<a name="07112234000292"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The clause deals with the Electricity Act 1989,
which established the regime under which the consents for overhead
lines are granted, and disapplies that regime within the deviation
limits on other land on which it is intended to build Crossrail. It
establishes schedule 4, which details the new consents regime, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>then makes provision for the expiry of the disapplication and the
application of the consents regime in the 1989 Act.</div>
					<a name="07112234000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a number of public
safety and other concerns when dealing with electricity. The consents
regime was put in place so that specialists would deal with the
national electricity grid and its distribution. Will the Minister tell
us why he feels, therefore, that it is necessary to disapply the normal
consents regime in that highly specialised area? Why is that necessary
given that many other construction projects are built complying with
the 1989 Act consents regime? Why is Crossrail different? Why are these
powers necessary? I look forward to him reassuring us that the powers
are
necessary.</div>

							<a name="07112234000293"></a>Mr.

					<a name="07112234000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman said, the clause disapplies the provisions in section 37(1)
of the 1989 Act in relation to overhead electric lines installed within
the deviation limits, in exercise of powers conferred by the Bill or
pursuant to any of the protective provisions in schedule 16.
Furthermore, it introduces schedule 4, which makes alternative
provision for consent of such lines, and enables the relevant
Secretaries of State to grant deemed planning permission alongside that
consent, with or without conditions. The construction of Crossrail will
require a number of diversions of overhead electric lines, including
the two specified in the table in paragraph 3 of schedule 2. Clause 4
and schedule 4 will provide a more tailored, detailed consent regime
for the approval of works under the Bill. I had hoped that those
provisions would be uncontroversial; they, too, are precedented in the
1996 Act.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000298"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The amendments are identical. The schedule deals
with the temporary possession and use of land. Whether the land is to
be used for the construction of works, as with the lead amendment, or
for the maintenance of works, as with amendment No. 29, the
nominated undertaker is required to give only 28 days&#146; notice to
the owners and occupiers of land of which he intends to take
possession. That is not long if one has to make necessary arrangements
and move off one&#146;s
land.</div>
					<a name="07112234000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seek to be fairer to those who are to be required to move off their
land, and I think that 56 days, or two months, is a more suitable
period. Given the length of advance planning that has gone into this
project and the advance notice that will be given to people, giving 56
days&#146; notice should not cause the nominated undertaker any
problems. I hope that the Committee will look favourably on the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07112234000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000299"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> It is no surprise that we are having a debate
about extending 28 days to 56, but I had expected it to be in a
slightly different
context.</div>
					<a name="07112234000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
allows the nominated undertaker temporarily to take possession and make
use of land in connection with Crossrail works. It requires that 28
days&#146; notice be given by the nominated undertaker to the owners
and occupiers of the land before possession is taken for constructing
and maintaining the works. The amendments would double that notice
period.</div>
					<a name="07112234000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 28-day
notice period for the temporary possession of land is sufficient and
well precedented in many private railway and hybrid Bills, as well as
in the Department&#146;s model clauses, which consider 14 days
appropriate. Doubling the notice period would impose additional
inflexibility on the nominated undertaker when it came to carrying out
Crossrail construction and maintenance works efficiently.</div>
					<a name="07112234000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cross London Rail Links is
already in touch with many of the relevant owners and occupiers, and,
in many cases, has agreements in place for a longer notice period where
the matter is of particular sensitivity and could reasonably be
accommodated by the nominated undertaker. Agreeing such arrangements
case by case is the appropriate solution when these matters arise. I
therefore cannot support the amendment, and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will be satisfied by my assurances and withdraw
it.</div>

pleased to hear that the Department has doubled the period recommended
in its model arrangements. I am also pleased that he thinks 28 days a
suitable notice period; I am sure that he will think the same on other
matters, otherwise the Government might lose some members, I suspect.
Having listened to his assurances and his concern about the restriction
on flexibility, and taking on board the fact that the Government have
already moved some way on this, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

					<a name="07112234000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is purely technical and reflects a recent change to the law
on the enforcement of compulsory purchase orders. The change means that
High Court enforcement officers and the high sheriff of each county can
enforce compulsory purchase orders in England and Wales. The amendment
will apply that change to the enforcement of powers in the Bill to take
temporary possession of land.</div>

							<a name="07112234000302"></a>Stephen

seek some reassurance. Paragraph 6 of the schedule sets out the
arrangements for enforcing the provision of any land, be it
compulsorily purchased, required or taken temporarily, if the owner
fails to give up or hinders the taking of possession. I can see why the
Government might want to tighten sub-paragraph (3), and we would
welcome that, but the amendment will mean that the paragraph applies
only to land that is compulsorily purchased, as it enacts section 13 of
the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965. That does not seem to allow the
flexibility that the Minister wanted in other clauses or to have the
same wider power implied in paragraph 6(1), which states that if the
nominated undertaker is authorised, they
can</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000303"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that his
concerns are unfounded. The Government do not believe that that will be
the effect of the amendment. To clarify, the 1965 Act does not provide
for compensation for temporary possession. Schedule 5 will give an
entitlement to
compensation</div>
					<a name="07112234000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to the

in paragraph 1 shows the land in question and the purposes for which it

means of access, provision of working space, highway access or a work
site.</div>
					<a name="07112234000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
requires 28 days&#146; notice to be given to the owners and occupiers
of the land before possession is taken, and the possession is
time-limited to one year after completion of the works, unless the
owners agree otherwise. Compensation may be payable for such
possession, with any disputes about such compensation to be determined
under the Land Compensation Act
1961.</div>
					<a name="07112234000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 2
requires the nominated undertaker, before giving up possession of any
land used under paragraph 1, to put the land in question back into such
condition as may be agreed in a scheme between him, the owners of the
land and the local planning authority, or as determined by the
appropriate Ministers. The paragraph also sets out what such a scheme
may and may not
require.</div>
					<a name="07112234000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 3
allows the nominated undertaker to use any road situated on land
specified in paragraph 8 of schedule 6 for the passage of persons or

allows the nominated undertaker, during the maintenance period of any
work, which is defined as being up to five years from the date on which
the work is brought into general use, to enter upon and take possession
of land within the Bill limits and within 20 m of any scheduled work,
if such possession is necessary for maintaining the work. The power
granted by the paragraph does not apply to any house or garden, or land
not subject to compulsory purchase under the Bill, and the nominated

Hammond:
						</b> The Bill deals with the powers and authorisations
necessary to build Crossrail. Those powers are vested in either the
Secretary of State or the nominated undertaker. The Secretary of State
clearly has the power to nominate the nominated undertaker, so the
power in the clause to acquire land is vested with the Secretary of
State. What will happen if a nominated undertaker has already been
nominated? Will that nominated undertaker also require the power to
acquire land
compulsorily?</div>
					<a name="07112234000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
inserting &#147;nominated undertaker&#148;, the amendment would
cover circumstances in which the nominated undertaker was not the
Secretary of State, and if it was the Secretary of State, those
circumstances would also be covered, because the Secretary of State and
the nominated undertaker could be one and the same at any
time.</div>
					<a name="07112234000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a simple
amendment, but on reflection perhaps I should have drafted it so that
the power would be vested not in the Secretary of State or the
nominated undertaker, but in the Secretary of State and/or the
nominated undertaker. None the less, I believe that it would fill a
potential gap in the Bill, but if I am wrong I look forward to the
Minister enlightening the Committee as to why the Secretary of State
alone is sufficient, and not also the nominated
undertaker.</div>
					<a name="07112234000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000309"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I am tempted, but not quite enough. The amendments
are workable, but not desirable. Many of the powers are conferred on
the nominated undertaker who will undertake particular works. However,
in the Bill, as in the 1996 Act before it, we have deliberately chosen
to vest the compulsory purchase powers in a public authority because of
the special sensitivity of such powers, and to give added public
confidence in the exercising of those powers. I shall explain how they
will work.</div>
					<a name="07112234000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
nominated undertaker will design his works, and as part of that will
establish what land is required to undertake those works. He is
unlikely to need all the land within limits specified in the Bill
plans, so this is a selective process in determining what is required.
Under the amendment to clause 6, he would proceed directly to serving
notices to treat, which initiate the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>acquisition process. However, under clause 6, there is
a further stage. The nominated undertaker&#146;s land requirements
will be submitted to the Secretary of State, or the Greater London
authority and/or Transport for London if devolved to them. The public
authority must then satisfy itself that the issue of notices to treat
is appropriate. That is intended to provide additional public
confidence in the process for acquiring land
compulsorily.</div>
					<a name="07112234000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
public accountability issue arises in the amendment to clause 7.
Generally, if the nominated undertaker finds that he needs land outside
the Bill limits&#151;for example, for mitigation works&#151;he will
seek to acquire that land by agreement. Only if that fails will the
nominated undertaker need to seek compulsory acquisition. As in clause
6, clause 7 will require the nominated undertaker to submit his
proposals to the Secretary of State, the GLA and/or TfL, which will
then decide whether seeking a compulsory purchase order is
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07112234000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
projects that do not involve a public authority, compulsory powers will
be exercised directly by the body responsible for the works. There is
nothing wrong with that, but for a hybrid Bill, since the Secretary of
State is the promoter, there tends to be an expectation among those
affected of her continuing accountability for the exercise of the
compulsory purchase powers. For those reasons, I want to maintain the
provisions of clauses 6(1) and 7(1). They are precedented and will help
to maintain public confidence and accountability. I therefore urge the
hon. Member for Wimbledon to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Sir
Peter Soulsby</b> (Leicester, South) (Lab): I want to take the
opportunity, as one of the survivors of incarceration in the Select
Committee, to draw attention to the significant number of properties
that are included in the schedule. I remind Members who did not have to
suffer that incarceration that the Select Committee gave landowners and
others affected, many of them by schedule 6, the opportunity to
petition against the Bill and have their interests
considered.</div>
					<a name="07112234000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
received a large number of petitions and took careful consideration of
the impact on the petitioners. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>In particular, we listened to the cases that they made to us on how
compensation will be applied and how compulsory purchase will affect
their interests. As a result of hearing those petitions, we were able
to seek from the Government and the promoters of the Bill amendments to
their proposals, which mitigated to some extent the situation of
petitioners and
landowners.</div>
					<a name="07112234000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
worth my reminding the Committee that those whose land and interests
are included in the schedule will have a further opportunity to
petition, should they wish to do so, when the Bill goes through the
Lords. We can be reassured that the interests of those affected were
taken into account at the early stages and that those people will have
a further opportunity to have them considered, if they
wish.</div>
					<a name="07112234000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000312"></a>Mr.
Field:
						</b> I very much endorse what the hon. Gentleman has
just said. I did not have the privilege or otherwise of being
incarcerated in the Select Committee, not least because my constituency
will be fundamentally affected by the Bill, particularly in the City of
London, Mayfair and Bayswater. I have recently had correspondence with
Paddington Residents Active Concern on Transport. There is a sense
among local residents that they had their day in the sun. They are
grateful for the opportunity to petition, and they recognise that that
is only part of the process and that they will have further
opportunities to make their views clear to the House of Lords. They
feel that they were dealt with courteously by the Select Committee and
were able to put their points
strongly.</div>
					<a name="07112234000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
number of residual problems. Without getting down to the narrow
specifics, they are broadly to do with noise and vibration from trains
underneath certain residential areas. We have already debated the 15-m
limit, rather than one of 20 or 25 m or a floating slab track
underneath, which could be extremely expensive, and the Minister will
have had the matter well rehearsed with him. There are also ongoing
issues of a highly localised nature, and common sense needs to prevail
in relation to changes in
traffic.</div>
					<a name="07112234000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
those changes will be a particularly big issue in the centre of London
while works are ongoing. Moves to make particular roads one way or to
make existing one-way roads two way could have an immense knock-on
effect for a locality, particularly around Paddington. Again, I am
reassured that the Committee was in listening mode during consideration
of the hybrid Bill, and I hope that that continues going
forward.</div>
					<a name="07112234000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
there is an understanding from people in central
London; they recognise that it is important to have Crossrail. Equally,
a lot of residents understandably feel great worry about the noise and
disruption, and obviously there are concerns about the likely costs to
the London council tax payer. However, the biggest issue, as I see it,
is blight.</div>
					<a name="07112234000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this
stage, we need to get on with the project. The worst possible scenario
would be either failure of the financing or a very long-winded
parliamentary process, such that people who live in the vicinity of the
project find that their whole life is
blighted.</div>
					<a name="07112234000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
we will come on to the issue of blight under clause 7 and further
schedules that try to ensure that, where there is blight, it is kept to
an absolute 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>minimum. This process of scrutiny has been useful, but we need to get on
with the work to ensure that the effect on the residential
amenity&#151;which is clearly going to be suffered by many tens of
thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people&#151;is kept to an
absolute
minimum.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000313"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I had not intended to do anything other than
formally move the schedule, but given the comments made by the hon.
Member for Cities of London and Westminster and by my hon. Friend the
Member for Leicester, South, I shall make a few closing
remarks.</div>
					<a name="07112234000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, this
is not the first time, and it will not be the last, that I have paid
tribute to the work that my hon. Friend and other hon. Members did on
the Select Committee. This Committee should indeed be very grateful to
them. That leads me to the comments made by the hon. Member for Cities
of London and Westminster. A great many of the concerns felt by private
individuals along the Crossrail route were fully expressed in the
Select Committee, which is why, of course, it took 21 months of hard
work to hear all those
concerns.</div>
					<a name="07112234000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
the comments that the hon. Gentleman has made, and I know that he has
been an active Member of the House in representing his
constituents&#146; concerns, specifically with regard to the effect
of Crossrail on his constituency. In fact, I believe that he and I have
corresponded on one or two of those issues. He can be reassured that
the process that we are going through in this Committee, obviously with
specific reference to schedule 6, will allow everyone who has concerns
about Crossrail to express them&#151;to have, as he put it, their day
in the sun. I have no doubt that, with a fair wind in Committee, on the
Floor of the House and in another place, the delays that he is worried
about will not occur.</div>

to be an extraordinary
power.</div>
					<a name="07112234000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
dedicated route and, understandably, there may need to be deviations
from that route for the work to progress, and as the work progresses
there will be a need for flexibility, hence the need for the power to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>acquire land within the limits of deviation. There may be a need to
acquire land alongside the route, so as to facilitate the building of
the railway or to support the railway when it is operational. All that
is understood. To cover both those eventualities, a deviation from the
route has been
proposed.</div>
					<a name="07112234000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
deviation is certainly necessary and it has been specified. However,
the clause goes well beyond that, as it allows the compulsory purchase
of land</div>
					<a name="07112234000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;outside the
limits of deviation for the scheduled
works&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112234000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
means that the Secretary of State may compulsorily acquire any land
that she deems necessary for building Crossrail, wherever it may
be.</div>
					<a name="07112234000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
questions that the Minister must answer to the Committee&#146;s
satisfaction. For example, why will land necessary only for
construction, which is surely the land approximate to the route, fall
outside the limits of deviation? Surely, along the designated route,
the limits of deviation have been set so as to anticipate all necessary
diversions from it. The limits of deviation as specified should be, and
are, adequate. The worrying aspect of the clause is that it brings to
mind the Martini principle: the Secretary of State can acquire land
anywhere and at any time that she deems necessary for the construction
of Crossrail. What is the purpose of
that?</div>
					<a name="07112234000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of
State is potentially being granted extraordinary powers, and there is a
potential cost to the public purse that is wholly disproportionate to
that need. My amendment&#151;I hope the Minister will be even more
tempted by this one&#151;would allow the extra flexibility that he
craves, but also define it. The Secretary of State would have power to
acquire land outside the deviation, but limited to 50 m, which is an
adequate restriction that would cover all eventualities for
construction or land running alongside the route. The amendment would
also allow for any circumstances along the confines of the route that
anyone could envisage in respect of land acquisition being
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07112234000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
equally tempting amendment would grant the Secretary of State the
exceptional powers that the Minister desires while placing a limit on
the flexibility that he
requires.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000315"></a>Mr.
Binley:
						</b> May I speak in support of the amendment moved so
ably by my hon. Friend? The process that we went through in the
interminable hybrid Bill Committee aimed at ensuring that
people&#146;s rights were fully protected and that petitioners who
might have been affected by the route as then outlined had every right
to bring their concerns to the Committee in a proper way. Many of those
people were not the wealthiest in the land&#151;they did not have a
great deal of money to get lawyers to fight their case&#151;but they
were able to come before our Committee, make their plea and state their
case. That was a fine example of parliamentary
democracy.</div>
					<a name="07112234000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern
is that the clause opens the whole thing up again.
Although I understand the point about the House of Lords, those people
are denied the opportunity to appear before the hybrid Bill Committee,
which they had with regard to the defined route. I found that Committee
process very impressive. If I may pay tribute to a Committee that I was
a member of, it considered these matters seriously and, most
importantly, compassionately. That is what this process is all
about.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>
					<a name="07112234000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are serious concerns about
green land and open areas in London. That became apparent throughout
the process. We were careful not to impact too greatly on the available
green land because of its scarcity, which made sense to me, and the
hybrid Bill Committee clearly supported that view. My concern is that
the clause opens up the opportunity yet again&#151;after the end of
proceedings in the hybrid Bill Committee&#151;for the
project&#146;s undertakers to suggest to the Secretary of State that
other routes need to be considered or included, meaning that we will
not be able to consider such matters in the depth that we did in the
hybrid Bill
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07112234000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I express
the same concerns as my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon, and I
hope that the Minister, who is a fair man, will recognise that common
rights&#151;the rights of the common people&#151;are important, and
that some limiting is important to protect those
rights.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Lee Scott</b> (Ilford, North) (Con): Although Crossrail will
not run through my constituency, it will run through neighbouring
constituencies, and concerns have been raised with me that if the
current project is allowed, there will be the blight to which my hon.
Friend the Member for Wimbledon referred, and uncertainty in a much
wider area than is absolutely necessary for the deviation of Crossrail.
I support my hon. Friend and ask the Minister to reconsider and accept
our amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112234000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000317"></a>Mr.
Field:
						</b> I fear that the reference to Martini powers dates
my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon and me. I am sure that our
youthful Whip, our hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth,
will not remember such things from the 1970s, although they were
perhaps a precursor to today&#146;s binge-drinking problem.</div>
					<a name="07112234000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support all
that my hon. Friends the Members for Wimbledon, for Northampton, South
and for Ilford, North have said. As I said earlier, the potential for
blight within the whole project is sufficient to make unacceptable a
compulsory purchase power as untrammelled as the Minister would like.
Even our amendment limiting the land to 50 m beyond the outer limits of
deviation would have a major effect in London, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Northampton, South rightly pointed out. One of the
difficulties of maintaining green spaces in London&#151;some of which
may be run by local authorities, some of which may be common
land&#151;is to prevent the residential population rising up in arms
if such land is used even for the purposes of the 50 m limit, let alone
for the untrammelled limit that the Minister would have us put in
place.</div>
					<a name="07112234000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I worry that
in central London even 50 m is an incredibly large distance. It
potentially brings tens of thousands more people within the scope of
Crossrail&#146;s inevitable blight. An untrammelled power would
certainly send the wrong signals, not least given the sense from the
business and residential communities that this is an important
infrastructure project. Even those people who it will directly affect
recognise its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>general national importance, but that good will could be undermined by
the Minister&#146;s untrammelled power of potential compulsory
purchase. I accept that it is unlikely to be exercised in a great many
cases, but the amendment is a sensible suggestion which would pare back
the worst aspects of the
power.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000318"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Blight concerns me and my colleagues
greatly, and we hope to address it later in the Bill&#146;s
consideration. The Minister may feel that he cannot quite commit to a
specific limitation of the power now, but by the time the Bill makes
its way through the other place, there should be far greater clarity
about the potential deviation required, the final route and the outer
issues. However, it is crucial that the scope of the affected project
area is identified and clarified as early as possible. Although blight
is bad, perceived blight is almost worse and the present system offers
no potential for compensation.</div>
					<a name="07112234000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000319"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The concerns that hon. Members have expressed are
understandable. I understand why on the face of it the provisions look
like powers for the Secretary of State to implement a Soviet land grab.
At the risk of disappointing some of my hon. Friends, that is not the
intention of the clause; neither is it a proposal to allow deviation of
Crossrail to Stoke-on-Trent or areas far beyond what has been laid down
in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112234000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Member for Wimbledon is aware, clause
7 provides additional powers to acquire land outside the Bill limits.
However, unlike the principal land acquisition powers in clause 6,
which deals with land acquisition within the Bill limits, the power to
acquire land under clause 7 can be exercised only through a compulsory
purchase order under existing compulsory purchase legislation.
Accordingly, the Secretary of State would be required to prepare and
publicise a draft compulsory purchase order, so that those affected
could object, which might necessitate a hearing or public local
inquiry. Furthermore, the acquisition of any land under a compulsory
purchase order would attract compensation under the national
compensation code. I hope that that goes some way to meeting the
concerns of the hon. Member for Northampton,
South.</div>
					<a name="07112234000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
tabled by the hon. Member for Wimbledon would, in effect, restrict the
Secretary of State&#146;s powers to acquire compulsorily land outside
the Bill limits, in connection with Crossrail, to within 50 m of the
outer limits of deviation for the scheduled works. The extent to which
land outside the Bill limits can be acquired compulsorily is well
precedented. For example, section 5 of the 1996 Act made similar
provision, and of course the powers that the clause will give to the
Secretary of State have, in the past, been given to Secretaries of
State in previous Governments.</div>
					<a name="07112234000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said previously, the
design of Crossrail is currently at an outline stage&#151;detailed
design work will come later&#151;so flexibility is essential.
However, even at this very early stage in the design and construction,
it is possible that, without prejudice to the generality, land further
than 50 m from the outer limits of deviation for the scheduled works
will be required.</div>
					<a name="07112234000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 7 gives three specific
instances where the power might be used to acquire land in order to
help those affected by the project: to mitigate the effect of the
Crossrail works on the environment using, for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>example, the erection of sound barriers; and for the relocation of
utility apparatus that merits diversion or replacement as a result of
the Crossrail works, and crucially in order to provide land in exchange
for common land, certain allotment land or open space acquired for the
Crossrail works.</div>
					<a name="07112234000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
emphasise again that any such proposal would demonstrably have to be
for, or in connection with, Crossrail. It could not be used to acquire
land for other purposes. Full protection is provided under the normal
compulsory purchase scheme. I assure hon. Members that we do not intend
to make general use of the clause; it is a failsafe mechanism, and will
be used only with restraint. In that context, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman feels that he can withdraw his amendment.

and I note his comments about precedent, limits and the need for
flexibility, as well as the fact that a proposal to go outside the

public inquiry. None the less, the power proposed is extraordinarily
wide. I referred to the Martini principle&#151;any time, any place,
anywhere. The trouble with the Crossrail Martini is that it will shake
and stir people if used outside the limits. Despite what the Minister
said, I am not tempted to withdraw the amendment. I would like to press

Hammond:
						</b> So as not to incur your displeasure, Lady
Winterton, I do not wish to rehearse what we have just discussed in the
previous amendment. However, subsections (2) and (3) allow some further
widening of the power to purchase land outside the conditions set by
clause 6(1), so I would like the Minister to clarify under what
circumstances he envisages the Secretary of State or the nominated
undertaker using those provisions. Will he give the Committee
reassurance about the power to acquire easements or other rights, as
enacted by the clause? Do the Secretary of State or nominated
undertaker require those powers in order to access sites, which, in
reality, will be a small strip of land, and that, therefore, the
acquisition of an easement or a right will be both easier and less
costly to arrange? Does the Minister envisage many such easements to be
required and does he expect the length of the easements that are
acquired 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>to be temporary or permanent? I look forward to his replies to those
points, as that will aid the Committee&#146;s understanding of the

explanation in response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions, I
reassure him that the powers to which he refers are, as I said in our
earlier debate, intended entirely as a failsafe mechanism. The
Government and its agents in Crossrail would not intend to make general
use of that power. I hope that he will be satisfied with that answer.
If there are any other details with which I can provide him and other
members of the Committee with regard specifically to the clause, I will
be more than happy to write to
them.</div>

						</b> Amendment No. 10 is necessarily a consequential
amendment to amendment No. 9, which I am sure that the Minister will
wish to accept.</div>
					<a name="07112234000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with the extinguishment of private rights of way.
Subsection (2) extinguishes private rights of
way,</div>
					<a name="07112234000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the case of land
acquired after the coming into force of this Act, at the appropriate
time.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112234000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
clearly a sensible power; private rights of way could
not and should not take precedence over land acquired for the building
and construction of Crossrail, and, therefore, cannot take precedence
over the land on which the railway is also
operating.</div>
					<a name="07112234000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
subsection (4), which amendment No. 9 seeks to address, appears to act
contrary to the purpose of subsection (2)(b). Clause 8(4) states
that:</div>
					<a name="07112234000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subsection
(2)(b) does not apply to a right of way that is
excepted&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112234000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
effectively counters and reverses subsection (2)(b), rendering the
provisions in it null and void, because the Secretary of State can
direct that the right of way be excepted from extinguishment. It seems
to us that the Secretary of State could effectively acquire land for
the purposes of construction, yet allow the private rights of way to
persist. That would seem to be potentially injurious to the citizen and
disruptive to the building and operation of
Crossrail.</div>

					<a name="07112234000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the intent
of clause 8(4) is to allow the Secretary of State to
regrant rights of way after the end of construction, during which land
that may have been required for build but not operational purposes had
its private rights of way extinguished, that is understandable. If that
is the intent, perhaps the Minister will explain how subsection (4)
will achieve it. Otherwise, subsections (2)(b) and (4) appear to be
contrary in purpose. Therefore, the amendment would help the Government
by removing that contrary
aim.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000341"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The purpose of clause 8 is to extinguish most
private rights of way over land held by the Secretary of State where
that land is required for or in connection with the Crossrail project.
That will ensure that the Crossrail works can be carried out safely and
effectively. Such provision&#151;I suspect that the hon. Gentleman
knows what I am about to say&#151;is well precedented in previous
private Acts for railways and can be found in the Channel Tunnel Act
1987.</div>
					<a name="07112234000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some private
rights of way are protected under the clause. For example, subsection
(3) provides for certain rights of way to be excluded from being
extinguished. Subsection (4), which amendment No. 9 would delete,
further enables the Secretary of State to direct that particular
private rights of way are not automatically extinguished under
subsection (2) and, therefore, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment
would take that right away from the Secretary of State and remove that
additional protection. Therefore, I cannot ask the Committee to support
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000342"></a>Stephen

saying and following his logic, but will he explain under what
circumstances the Secretary of State will want those
powers?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000343"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> There are circumstances when we will want to
protect some rights of way. One example that was considered with regard
to the clause is the rights of way that help utility operators to
maintain their apparatus. Amendment No. 10 would allow subsection (5)
to be altered in association with amendment No. 9, so I cannot support
it
either.</div>
					<a name="07112234000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the hon. Member for Wimbledon appears to be concerned about the
Secretary of State&#146;s involvement in relation to the
extinguishment of private rights of way, that particular role is
intended to help to protect such rights of way from extinguishment when
reasonably avoidable. Therefore, I urge him to withdraw the

Minister has often said that I might anticipate what he is about to
say, but he might equally anticipate what I am about to say. Clauses 10
to 15 deal with the planning issues that affect Crossrail. The general
presumption is that planning permission will be granted unless there
are exceptional
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07112234000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
10 provides for the deemed planning permission to exist under part III
of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Subsection (1) provides that
planning permission be granted for the development except where limited
by subsection (2). The amendment would put a further restriction on the
process. At line 7, it would insert new paragraph (c), which states
that</div>
					<a name="07112234000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the development
falls within the limits of deviation for the scheduled

effect of subsections (1) and (2) is that any land stated for the use
of the Crossrail development will be deemed to have planning
permission. Why should it be any land? The amendment would impose a
reasonable restriction on the Secretary of State or the nominated
undertaker.</div>
					<a name="07112234000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said before, there is a deemed route and a schedule of works. There are
agreed limitations of deviation to that route. As with previous
amendments, I contend that the limits of deviation are a fair
restriction on those powers. By adding that the development must fall
within those limits of deviation, the amendment would have the effect
of deeming planning permission for developments on the deemed route and
land outside the route that is within the deemed limits of deviation,
but not on land beyond that. In my opinion, that is
fair.</div>
					<a name="07112234000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister will remember, we have gone through the arguments as to
why there ought to be some restriction on the powers, while still
giving flexibility. I think that the amendment satisfies both those
tests. I trust that he will find it reasonable and
fair.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112234000348"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I stand reluctantly to disappoint the hon.
Gentleman once again. The amendment would require separate planning
permission to be sought for any works authorised by the Bill that were
not scheduled works and which fell outside the limits of deviation. In
practice, that would affect a wide category of works&#151;for
example, alterations to existing stations, electrification and
signalling works on the existing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>network, and works to mitigate settlement impacts. All those things
often take place outside the limits of deviation of
works.</div>
					<a name="07112234000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Requiring
separate planning permission to be sought for such works would
undermine the very purpose of the Bill, which is to obtain deemed
planning permission for the works reasonably required to enable
Crossrail to be built, where there has been appropriate environmental
assessment. The amendment would expose the project to the risk of
severe delays as local authorities considered applications for such
works under the 1990 Act regime. That would include the possibility of
public inquiries. Works other than scheduled works are, like the
scheduled works themselves, subject to the detailed consent regime set
out in schedule 7. The Government believe that that provides for the
appropriate
scrutiny.</div>

							<a name="07112234000349"></a>Mr.
Field:
						</b> I am very curious about this issue. Can the
Minister give examples of any stations that are outside the limits of
deviation? Given the importance of stations within a railway project, I
cannot foresee any of the stations being outside the limits of
deviation. That puts a coach and horses through his argument on the
works in the vicinity of stations
themselves.</div>

Harris:
						</b> No doubt inspiration will descend upon me shortly,
but I can reassure the hon. Gentleman&#151;for example, on the issue
of signalling works. Crossrail will result in a large step change in
the number of through trains going through the capital city. That will
have a knock-on effect on capacity demands elsewhere on the network.
Therefore, if we are to accommodate the extra people travelling through
the centre of the city, works might be needed at stations not
associated with
Crossrail.</div>
					<a name="07112234000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
anticipate significant increases in passenger numbers throughout
London. If we have to make changes to signalling, tracks or stations
that do not lie directly within the Crossrail line, it is incumbent on
us to ensure that we can carry out those improvements without imposing
undue delay on the construction of
Crossrail.</div>
					<a name="07112234000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
