<H2><center>Standing Committee D</center></H2>
<H4><center>Thursday 27 January 2000</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Humfrey Malins in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/010/2000100.htm">Terrorism Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be convenient for the Committee to know that the document entitled, "International convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings", which is relevant to clause 61 is on the table.
<H4><center>Clause 37</center></H4>
<H4><center>Disclosure of information, &c.
<p2>Mr. Simon Hughes (Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I beg to move amendment No. 104, in page 17, leave out lines 28 and 29.</center></H4>
<P>
Welcome to the Committee, Mr. Malins. I hope that you will find that we proceed constructively and that you enjoy your tenure in the Chair.
<P>
The amendment relates to the last clause in part IV, referring to disclosure of information. It is a probing amendment about the consequence of conviction and liability. It would remove two lines in subsection (7), which says that it would be an indictable offence, leading to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, to a fine or to both"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We had a similar debate in Committee on Tuesday about the appropriate tariff for an offence, together with where the burden of proof should lie. We explored those issues, and you will have seen from Hansard, Mr. Malins, that there are three points to consider. There is the straightforward one when the prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt in the normal way. The second one is what is properly described as the reverse burden of proof, and the third is the provision for statutory defence, irrespective of other offences that may arise in the general law.
<P>
The amendment refers to one of those offences when there is a reverse burden of proof and an opportunity for the defence to make the case. It is a probing amendment, and I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on the appropriateness of an indictment and sentence of imprisonment if this is an either-way offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): May I, Mr, Malins echo the words of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Simon Hughes) in welcoming you to the Chair of this Committee for the first time?
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that this is a probing amendment, which is consistent with a number of others that he has tabled. I am not inclined to follow the argument that he has presented to the Committee today. While I can see that there may well be a great many occasions--perhaps the majority--when such an offence should be dealt with summarily, I can imagine circumstances in which an indictment trial with higher penalties would be appropriate.
<P>
I shall cite a hypothetical example. Let us say that someone disclosed information or interfered with material in a way that either delayed or fatally hindered a police investigation into terrorist activity, and it later transpired that the damage to the investigation made it possible for further terrorist outrages to take place, involving loss of life or grievous injury. In those circumstances, it would be appropriate for the courts to impose a severe sentence, including a substantial term of imprisonment. While I accept that it is right to have a debate on the detailed matters raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, I do not believe that to remove the option of trial on indictment would be an appropriate way forward.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office </B>(Mr. Charles Clarke): May I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Malins?
<P>
 The debate on this amendment is similar to the debates that we had previously on this matter. The offence is a serious one. The person commits an offence if he or she
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "discloses to another anything which is likely to prejudice an investigation resulting from the disclosure under that section, or . . . interferes with material which is likely to be relevant to an investigation resulting from the disclosure under that section."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a serious matter and we believe that there should be the same scale of penalty and a legal framework around that offence, as for others in this part of the Bill. There is not a reverse burden of proof, I do not think that the arguments of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey are correct, so I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I tabled the amendment merely to allow the Minister to put his justification for the provision on the record. I do not dissent from the point made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington). Clearly, there is a band of circumstances, some of which could produce severe consequences. I am grateful for the Minister's explanation and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 37 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. The Minister has been helpful in informing the Committee when the Government have taken action, as a result of representations made in Committee or otherwise. We are about to start on part V of the Bill, which includes clauses to which the Government have tabled amendments. Will it be possible in future to have notes on amendments that are tabled by the Government to help us in Committee, just as explanatory notes on clauses are helpful? If such notes could be available the day before the Committee sits, that would be useful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> That is a perfectly reasonable request with which I shall try to comply.
<P>
Clause 38 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 39
<P>
<H5>Arrest without warrant</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 106, in page 18, line 9, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'reasonably suspects to be a terrorist'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'identities as having committed an offence under this Act.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment raised the first important issue that comes under part V of the Bill, and is about the drafting of the qualification in the clause. Clause 39 is about arrest without warrant on terrorist-related issues. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "A constable may arrest without a warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My amendment would replace the last part of that sentence with the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "identifies as having committed an offence under this Act".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall explain why we are concerned about the current drafting.
<P>
There is a suggestion that clause 39 contravenes the European convention on human rights under article 5(1)(c), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The question is whether that would allow the arrest of someone reasonably suspected of being a terrorist by nature of a previous conviction--someone who had a terrorist past might fall within that broad definition.
<P>
The proposed alternative would be a more specific trigger for an arrest because it would require someone to have been identified as having committed an offence under the Act. That is narrower than the general band of offences. It would be even tighter drafting if a new offence, not previously dealt with, were introduced. As drafted, the Bill has a retrospective element, so there may be a risk of the police arresting someone who may be alleged to have committed terrorist acts before the Act comes into force or has committed such acts that have already been dealt with.
<P>
This probing amendment raises important issues about double jeopardy and returning to matters that have been dealt with before. If additional powers are to be conferred, under the umbrella of dealing with terrorism, we must not draw them more widely than we need to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> This is a reasonable amendment on which to air the issues. However, we hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment because it would mean that only a person whom an officer had identified as having committed an offence under the Act could be arrested under the special terrorist arrest power. The ability to arrest if an officer reasonably suspects an  individual of being a terrorist is an important qualification. It is in line with the current prevention of terrorism Act and it gives officers an arrest power that can be used when there may not be reasonable suspicion that an actual offence has been committed. The power is important because experience has revealed some difficulties in combating terrorism without it.
<P>
As to the wording, it is important to stress that the courts, not the police officer, will ultimately take a view on whether the offence has been committed. The Bill suggests that the police officer should make that judgment, but it is ultimately for the courts to decide.
<P>
We continue to take the view that the arrest power is necessary when an officer has reasonable suspicion that the person is, or has been, involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. That would allow the police to act at the point when they have a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity, without waiting until they have reasonable suspicion about the offence that the individual is going to commit or has committed. Waiting until that point could mean that a bomb goes off and evidence of the incident is destroyed. That is why the power is so important.
<P>
I should like to explain a couple of points to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. First, the power does not give carte blanche to the police to round up people whenever they like. I share the hon. Gentleman's concern about that potential effect, but the wording does not allow it, as there must be a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in an act of terrorism. That suspicion is reviewed by an independent officer regularly during the first 48 hours of detention, which will be extended only if a judge is persuaded of the case.
<P>
The arrest power may not be used for fishing trips or intelligence-gathering exercises. It has been most often used thus far in Irish cases, but not exclusively so. The reasons that I have set out for needing this special power apply just as much to some international or even domestic groups. The police regularly underline to us the importance that they place on this power in preventing and detecting terrorist crime. That is why the Government believe that we must keep it.
<P>
On the human rights point, I would observe--as I have previously--that we are of the view, having taken considered legal advice, that the Bill is consistent with the Human Rights Act 1998. In the Brogan case, the European Court confirmed that this arrest power was not incompatible with article 5.1 of the European convention on human rights, which talks of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The court ruled that, although no specific offence was listed in conjunction with the arrest power, the way in which the power was constructed was analogous to an offence.
<P>
I hope that I have responded to the reasonable concerns raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and that he will therefore consider withdrawing his amendment.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his considered response. I will examine the Brogan case, although clearly not before the end of this debate. The one issue that remains in my mind is how much the Brogan case dealt with articles 5.3 and 5.1 of the European convention. I shall read up on that and come back to it.
<P>
Two things follow from the Minister's response. First, I understand the argument, but I wonder whether, if the amendment read "reasonably suspects to have committed an offence under this Act" instead of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"identifies as having committed an offence under this Act",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that would go halfway to meeting the Minister's concerns. I appreciate that it would not go all the way, for reasons that I shall come to. It is normally important to hang on to a reasonable suspicion requirement. I appreciate that there is a test of reasonable suspicion in the clause, but it is not offence specific. The alternative that I proposed did not contain a test of reasonable suspicion. Is it an important test to keep?
<P>
Secondly, there is always concern that people should be arrested only if the arrest relates to clearly definable offences. We debated the definition of terrorism at the beginning of the Bill, but it seems perfectly possible to list the offences, so that one can be a terrorist only if one commits certain offences as provided for by the Act. Has the Minister considered or taken advice on whether it would be possible to set out the specific offences that would take someone into that category instead of using the general statement "to be a terrorist"? I accept that the drafting would be longer, but at least the arrest without warrant power would apply to specific offences and there may not be as much between us on the test of reasonable suspicion. I should be grateful, if  that has been considered, for an explanation of why listing the offences has been rejected as an alternative strategy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I thought that I had tried to address that in my previous response. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that one can conceive of such a list of offences, but we think that the description
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"reasonably suspects to be a terrorist"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 gels a practical problem that has occurred in some cases, where drawing up a list of offences does not go to the heart of the matter. We all know that these powers would be available in absolutely exceptional circumstances, but all I can say is that there are occasions on which this exceptional power is necessary and would be strengthened by the definition in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes: </b>I do not think that we are going to reach agreement. I said that I would consider the full breadth of the Brogan case. It is clearly important that we get it right. The Minister has given a perfectly reasonable response, and I am happy to come back to the matter if necessary. In a way, it is the linchpin in the arrest and special powers provisions. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</B><P>
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes: </b>I beg to move amendment No. 105, in page 18, line 14, leave out '48' and insert '36'.</B><P>
<P>
The amendment seeks to explore the time for which people can be held under arrest without warrant. The question, which arises elsewhere, is the difference between the Bill's provisions for terrorist offences and the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 powers vis-ã-vis the citizen.
<P>
Under subsection (3), and subject to the later subsections,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a person detained under this subsection shall (unless detained under any other power) be released not later than the end of the period of 48 hours beginning--
<P>
(a) with the time of his arrest under this section, or
<P>
(b) if he was being detained under Schedule 6 when he was arrested under this section, with the time when his examination under that Schedule began".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We propose is that the 48 hours should be reduced to 36 hours--a day and a half, rather than two days--to bring it in line with the PACE provisions. The amendment is tabled to allow the Minister to put on record the Government justification for increasing by a third the detention powers provided under PACE.
<P>
I shall stand back from the issue for a moment. I accept that the number of hours is arbitrary, and that police officers work to a clock like everyone else. They obviously appreciate that when they come to the end of that time, they must be more urgent in their inquiries. However, it could reasonably be argued that a day and a half is more than sufficient time to enable officers to conclude whether a charge should be preferred.
<P>
The burden ought to be on the Government and the authorities to justify the need to go beyond that. For obvious reasons, to say that it is because the offences are more serious is no answer. A murder case is clearly a serious offence. It could be argued that, under the PACE provisions, a differential tariff could be used, depending on the severity of the offence or the length of imprisonment that could be imposed. That, of itself, however, is not an answer.
<P>
I should be grateful for an explanation. It might as well be said now that when differential and greater powers are given to the authorities, compared to the provisions of PACE, each case should be separately considered to ensure that that extra power has been used reasonably; and the results should be compared with severe offences that are not terrorist offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington: </b>I would need a lot of persuading to support the amendment. The balance of evidence is that the police need the additional time because of the exceptional circumstances of terrorist inquiries. I found Lord Lloyd's account extremely persuasive. He looked at the matter in great detail and considered specifically the different arrangements between PACE and the PTA and concluded that the maximum permitted time of 48 hours in detention should remain.</B><P>
<P>
Lord Lloyd described that investigation in some detail on page 45 of volume 1 of the report. I do not propose to read it out, but it is worth paraphrasing. He describes how the Metropolitan police anti-terrorist branch made its case to him, based on what happened during a major terrorist inquiry. Lord Lloyd said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is not at all unusual for the whole of the first 24 hours to be taken up with matters preparatory to interview. First, the suspect has to go through reception procedures."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Terrorist suspects often need to be interviewed in special high-security locations, which can add substantially to the delay, especially if the suspect has to be taken from a distant location elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The police will then have to try to ascertain or confirm the identify of the suspect. Those who are members of professional terrorist organisations will have been trained in counter interrogation techniques and are likely to be aware of the legal provisions of anti-terrorist legislation. They will seek to delay the police finding out who they are for as long as possible.
<P>
I remember talking to police and prison officers with responsibility for dealing with terrorist suspects. They explained that those men and women had clearly been highly trained, and that it was very difficult to get even the most basic information out of them. Surveillance evidence may be needed, and samples may need to be analysed by forensic scientists. That may be the only means of ascertaining whether the suspect has been in contact with explosives, and searches may need to be undertaken to find further evidence to help support the case against the suspect.
<P>
Lord Lloyd concludes his study of that aspect of the report by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The process is markedly more thorough and time-consuming than in the normal run of criminal investigations. I do not think that it would serve anyone's interests to reduce the time available to the police to carry out this work."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Lloyd says that the result of reducing the permitted maximum time from 48 hours to 36 hours or even less would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to increase the frequency and number of applications for extension of detention."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would add to the burden of whichever authority had been appointed by law to authorised extension of detention.
<P>
I found Lord Lloyd's analysis of the problem persuasive. For those reasons, I do not support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</b> The purpose of the Bill is to deal with situations that are qualitatively different from the general run. That is the reason for differences such as the time of detention. I give the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey the assurance that he seeks; we seriously considered each specific case on that general point before it found its way into the Bill.</B><P>
<P>
We are extending the current provisions under the PTA, and we take the view, expressed so clearly by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, that Lord Lloyd's analysis is extremely powerful and persuasive. Lord Lloyd considered the matter in great detail, and he clearly and firmly recommended the retention of the 48 hour detention period.
<P>
I shall not deal at length with Lord Lloyd's recommendations, because the hon. Member for Aylesbury did it so effectively, but I shall highlight three points. First, Lord Lloyd pointed to the procedures to be gone through following an arrest and reported that it was not unusual, because of the complexity of such cases, for the first 24 hours to be entirely taken up with matters preparatory to interview.
<P>
Secondly, Lord Lloyd referred to the difficulties that can be encountered when trying to confirm the identity of the detainee. Terrorists are often highly trained--that is often what makes them qualitatively different from people who have been considered under the more general PACE requirements to avoid giving answers to questions. Inquiries overseas or forensic tests may be necessary. The fact that terrorists are qualitatively in a different position to resist interview than many other people is an important point, which point Lord Lloyd identified.
<P>
Thirdly, Lord Loyd identified a point that the hon. Member for Aylesbury also made:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I do not think that it would serve anyone's interest to reduce the time available to the police to carry out this work. The result would simply be to increase the frequency and number of applications for extension of detention."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That, too, is a powerful point in considering how to deal with these matters.
<P>
I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey probed the point, but I hope that he will accept that we and Lord Lloyd have considered the matter in great detail, and that there are serious and important reasons for our belief that the Bill should remain as drafted and that the amendment should be resisted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Both the hon. Member for Aylesbury and the Minister are being perfectly reasonable. Lord Lloyd's argument is strong, and I am aware of it. However, once the PACE threshold of 36 hours has been passed, what happens to an individual is more arbitrary. The case for the 48-hour rule is that that is the period in existing legislation, which will be carried over into the new legislation. Has that additional period--one third extra time--been specifically evaluated as beneficial? I understand the general point that the people involved need to do more work and therefore need more time. Once 36 hours has passed, they could argue for 72 or 60 hours. Has 48 hours been re-evaluated as being the best period once 36 hours has passed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Yes, it has. The experience of the 48-hour rule under the PTA has been substantial. As my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office said on a previous occasion in Committee, the matter is kept under constant review, and, having considered the matter, we concluded that specifying 48 hours is the right way to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is a perfectly full and frank answer, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 18, line 29, after 'detained', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'subject to paragraph 31 of that Schedule,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 100.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> These are minor, technical amendments to improve and make clear the relationship between the review of detention requirements and judicial authorisation of extended detention. The amendments provide that a detainee must be released if the grounds on which the warrant of further detention was issued by the judicial authority cease to apply. In such cases, it will, of course, be open to the police to make a further application to the judicial authority.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 39, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Detention</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 107, in page 101, leave out lines 6 and 7 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'A person arrested shall be taken by a constable to a police station as soon as possible after the arrest'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The schedule deals with detention, and part I deals with the treatment of people detained under clause 39 or schedule 6. The amendment is designed to probe two points. First, what is the justification for giving the Secretary of State power in this case? The second point relates to the word "possible", or, to use an alternative word, "practicable".
<P>
The schedule provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may direct the place where a person is to be detained."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment proposes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person arrested shall be taken by a constable to a police station as soon as possible after the arrest".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The obvious question is why the Secretary of State should make the initial decision, as opposed to the police deciding to take action and to take someone to a police station, as is normal. There is an argument that that allows more political interference in the case than is justifiable.
<P>
If the provision were replaced by the amendment, that would not enable a Home Secretary or a Northern Ireland Secretary to indicate to the police a view on where a detention should take place. However, once the Secretary of State is given the power to determine that, it has all sorts of potential consequences. It might give those investigating the case a view that might not otherwise have been in their minds. It would allow the Secretary of State total discretion and thereby effectively take the investigation out of the normal police process. As a general principle, the Bill does not do that; it retains the normal process of police investigation, but gives the police additional powers -- wider powers of arrest and of detention, and so on. It does not seek to replace the normal investigative agencies by governmental investigative agencies.
<P>
We have tried in Britain to keep separate the powers of the Executive and of those who act as the law enforcement agencies on behalf of the Executive. Over the past few weeks, the Secretary of State has on many occasions demonstrated that he has powers that are separate from and additional to the powers of the police. The power of extradition is a good example of that. After someone has been arrested in such a case, judicial and quasi-judicial considerations by the Secretary of State are then involved. It is important that, even in the area of terrorism, we keep the powers separate and do not give Ministers powers that override the normal powers of investigation and processing.
<P>
Playing devil's advocate, I asked myself in what sort of cases the Secretary of State might want to use the power. If someone were arrested under the terrorism powers in the smallest police force area in the country, the Home Secretary might take a view that the security of its detention facility was not as great as that of another facility -- Paddington Green, for example, in the Metropolitan police area. He therefore might decide that it would be much safer for the person to be transferred from force area X to force area Y. It would be perfectly proper for the Government to communicate to the police their concerns about that. Police forces always work collaboratively, as do the national agencies of the police. Again, we would need to be persuaded that there was a need for that additional power.
<P>
The amendment specifies that a person should be taken to a police station
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as soon as possible after the arrest".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That phrase was not included from any tight theological justification; the PACE phraseology is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as soon as practicable after the arrest".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would be grateful for the Minister's comment on whether, irrespective of any justification he may make of paragraph 1(1), the Government believe that a person should be taken to a police station as soon as possible or as soon as practicable after arrest. Which drafting is preferred?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have just two comments on the amendment. It is a reasonable amendment and it is reasonable for us to be debating this part of the schedule. I am inclined, subject to the Minister's comments, to believe that the drafting of the schedule is preferable to that of the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey acknowledged the possible difficulties in regard to a small, modestly staffed and insecure police station. Although the various police forces and the central police agencies on the whole work together collaboratively and successfully, it is not unreasonable for the Secretary of State to have that overriding power to ensure that investigations are handled smoothly. Above all, we must remember that the clock on the 48-hour period starts ticking from the moment that the terrorist suspect is arrested. In order for those exceptional powers to be used most effectively for the public good, it is vital that the interrogation of the suspect and other inquiries related to his arrest and detention take place as swiftly and smoothly as possible. The provision in the schedule to give the power of direction to the Secretary of State will help attain that objective.
<P>
I should like to know the Government's thinking on a minor point. The schedule, as is usual in such circumstances, refers only to the Secretary of State. I assume that the Government intend that, at least for the time being, the powers will be exercised by the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in their respective domains. However, there is clearly a question about what will happen to some of those offices; there is discussion, in particular, about whether the office of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should continue in its present form, if and when devolved government in that Province becomes a reality. Terrorist organisations will cross national and provincial boundaries within the United Kingdom; do the Government therefore believe that the Home Secretary will have a lead role, even among his colleagues, in respect of the investigations of that power or will the Government follow the practice of giving different, parallel powers of direction to the three Secretaries of State, as I would imagine is currently the case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I want to address the same point as my hon. Friend, but from a different angle. The amendment would provide that the Secretary of State "may", not "shall", direct the place. The overwhelming norm is that the Secretary of State does not exercise that power at all. As my hon. Friend has argued, the Bill should retain the power for the Secretary of State to intervene in exceptional circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I welcome the debate because it allows me to clarify some points about which there may be misapprehensions. A statutory power to allow detention in places other than a police station is necessary. It is up to the police which place they use. The Secretary of State will not intervene in individual cases. The Secretary of State uses his equivalent power under the PTA to make a form of direction as to the places where detention can take place: it provides essentially for ports and prisons to be used. I therefore make it clear, because it is obvious from the contribution of members of the Committee that we have not done so, that we are not giving the Secretary of State the power to deal with individual cases.
<P>
 I shall duck the constitutional question asked by the hon. Member for Aylesbury about the future prospects of the Secretary of State in the United Kingdom. I am aware that he is initiating an entertaining and interesting discussion, which will run and run. However, the phrase "Secretary of State" is clear in the Bill.
<P>
On the points raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, the key to detention in port is flexibility. The vast majority of examinations are short and conducted with good grace all round. It could be counterproductive to introduce inflexible elements into the process, however well intentioned. Many interviews take only a few minutes and the individual moves on. Requiring in law that a person should automatically be taken to a police station, rather than the port, even in trivial cases, is not the right approach.
<P>
Several factors influence the decision whether to take to a police station a person detained at a port. They include the length of time estimated for the inquiries, the sort of inquiries involved and the wishes of the individual. Clearly, we must ensure that someone stopped at a port for a couple of minutes--who is then likely, having answered the questions, to be waved on his or her way--does not have to be taken to a police station.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is, however, likely that a person in respect of whom complicated and lengthy inquiries have to be made would be taken to a police station in any case. For the sake of clarity, let me put on record that PACE requires that fingerprints and samples may be taken without consent only at a police station. If inquiries have come that far, a transfer will have to take place. Nothing in the Bill changes that fundamental requirement.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister poses questions to which I do not know the answer. It is my understanding that there is always a police presence and some sort of police office--if not the size of a general police station--at all ports, whether sea ports or airports. Could not the power referred to by the Minister be dealt with administratively by designating as a police station the place where the police, Customs and Excise and the Immigration and Nationality directorate are based at ports?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> A relevant case is where it is decided to search someone's suitcases. It can take a while to organise and there can be delays for logistic reasons, especially at the larger ports. Large distances are involved in some circumstances. The police officer will want the person to be present when the case is opened, but, at a port, it could be a good hour's drive from one terminal to the police station in that port, especially if it is based at the other end of an airport. It would be possible to move a person to a police station, but it would be easier all round for the person to wait at the airport for the search to take place, particularly if the individual has someone waiting at the airport or has a connecting flight to follow. The provisions are not onerous. It may not be the hon. Gentleman's intention, but the effect of requiring immediate removal to a police station could be more onerous for people who are merely being interviewed before moving on and proceeding with their ordinary lives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand that, but I am still troubled because that does not justify a general power to direct. A person could be detained by the authorities--the police or other designated authorities--at ports of entry as well as at police stations. The drafting of my amendment may be over-specific, but the Minister should address the point that the clause is over-general: there may be a happy medium.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall turn now to the phrase "as soon as possible", as the hon. Gentleman may want me to explore that route. On the wider issues, it is, as the hon. Gentleman said, a theological discussion. He is more expert than I in such matters, so there is no point in engaging with him on them. The question nevertheless arises, what is meant by "as soon as possible" or "as soon as practicable"? We believe that the hon. Gentleman's requirement would, as I explained earlier, cause more inconvenience and difficulty for all concerned, especially for people who would have only a brief interview by the police. The Secretary of State's ability to name places, as set out in the Bill, will provide the flexibility to ensure that the police can conduct their responsibilities most effectively to meet the needs of all who go through the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</b> I accept that the amendment's wording is inadequately formulated. If, for the sake of argument, we accept that ports of entry and police stations are appropriate, will the Minister tell us what other places have been designated in the past as appropriate for detaining people?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</b> We are talking about ports and police stations in this debate. I have not studied the question in detail, but I believe that prisons may have been used in the past. I shall take advice and return to the question later.</B><P>
<P>
To conclude, even if we accepted the amendment, we would still need to retain the lines that the hon. Gentleman proposes to delete--whether "as soon as possible" or "as soon as practicable"--to allow detentions of individuals at ports for the period before it becomes possible or practicable to get them to a police station. That is an important point about time lag.
<P>
Finally, let us remember that the Bill will introduce substantial new elements to the process. The maximum period of detention is down to nine hours from 12. A code of practice will govern the use of powers. Interviews at police stations and even pre-clause 39 arrests will be audio-recorded. We are aware of the need to act sensitively and with due speed, but for the reasons that I have already advanced, the amendment would not work in the best interests of those who are detained, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</b> I take the last point about the unhelpful element of the amendment--that it could disadvantage the arrested or detained persons. I shall withdraw the amendment, but I shall want to return to the matter of having a list of designated places for detention, which would include places of detention at ports of entry or places of inquiry. I accept that it would be better to deal with the issues on site, probably the port, than somewhere else. A bilateral discussion or correspondence could be useful to establish whether there is another way of avoiding the general power. It is fine if the general power is justified, but I am worried about it being too open and allowing political interference in the activities of agencies of law and order. The hon. Member for Aylesbury touched on that when he asked about the technical definition of the Secretary of State. An intervention on a particular case by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland might be less helpful than one by the police acting within their normal powers. There are outstanding issues, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</B><P>
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke: </b>I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 103, line 31, at end insert</B><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>', if the interview takes place in a police station'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that schedule 6 detention interviews have to be taped only if conducted in a police station by a police officer. To require the audio taping of clause 39 interviews is a major step, and it is right to extend the requirement to interviews of those detained at police stations under schedule 6. However, it would not be practical also to require the taping of interviews at courts. In any case, most such exchanges are short and there is no need to set up an elaborate regime to tape them.
<P>
The amendment makes it clear that the requirement applies only to interviews at police stations, which will be after examination processes have gone on for some time and have become more formal. The PACE process to which I referred earlier would then be appropriate.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter: </b>We are talking about audio recording of interviews, and I want to ask the Minister about the accountability of the code of practice in schedule 12. Perhaps I can leave that to our debate on that schedule.</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: </b>I can help the hon. Gentleman. We shall come to that matter at a later stage.</B><P>
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke: </b>I beg to move amendment No. 92, in page 103, line 39, leave out '15' and insert '15A'.</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: </b>With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 93, 94 and 85.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</b> Amendments Nos. 92, 93 and 85 deal with access to solicitors in Scotland. I hope that the hon. Member for Aylesbury supports them, as I know from our previous debate that he is concerned about the issues raised by the Law Society of Scotland, though I am not sure whether on constituency grounds. The amendments require the Secretary of State for Scotland to make provision for Scotland that is broadly equivalent to that for England and Wales in relation to the rights of a person arrested or detained under terrorism legislation to have access to a solicitor. Solicitors will be permitted to attend all police interviews once access has been granted, subject to conditions and exceptions to be prescribed by the Secretary of State.</B><P>
<P>
Amendment No. 94 makes Scottish provision equivalent to that of England or Wales in relation to the taking and retention of fingerprints and intimate body samples from those detained under terrorism legislation. In each case, that would be for the purposes of only the terrorist investigation.
<P>
That sums up the situation. We desire the law to be clear for Scotland, and I hope that the Committee will support the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</b> Part VII will cease to be needed under the phasing-out provisions provided. The schedule deals with Scotland. I have not checked through everything, but will the Northern Ireland rules be provided for separately, as their jurisdiction is obviously different, or will they be in all respects identical to the England and Wales rules? If they are provided for separately, where will that be done?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke: </b>My understanding is that Northern Ireland is covered under the PACE orders, but I shall consider the matter in more detail and will write to the hon. Gentleman if I have not dealt with his point fully.</B><P>

<B>Mr Charles Clarke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 96 in page 105, line 23, leave out 'where an application for' and insert 'after'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendement No. 97.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> These are also minor technical amendments to clarify the relationship between the review of detention requirements and judicial authorisation for extended detention. They ensure that the review of detentions continues until a warrant of further detention is issued by the Judicial authority. As drafted, the Bill provides for review to cease when the application is made. I hope that the amendment clarifies the Bill and that the Committee will support it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 99.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> There are again minor technical amendments, in this instance to improve and clarify the relationship between the review of detention requirements and judicial authorisation of extended detention. They require the review officer to make a record of detention under clause 39(5) and (6). That will ensure that where a person is detained during the making of an application to the Judicial authority, a written record of the detention is made. The amendment is consequential on amendments Nos. 96 and 97, which continue review up to the point at which the warrant of further detention is issued.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
Amendment made: No. 99, in page 107, line 39, at end insert 'and ( ) the fact that the detained person is being detained by virtue of section 39(5) or (6)'--[Mr. Charles Clarke.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 108, line 11, leave out 'seven' and insert 'four'.
<P>
The amendment relates to the extension of the period of detention. It probes the justification for the difference between the four-day rule under PACE and the seven-day rule. The question that would most help the Committee were the Minister able to answer it is, what is the history of the frequency with which the extension of time has been used? My understanding is that although the power may be thought necessary--I will come back to the general issue in an appropriate debate later--it has been sought on few occasions; so few, indeed, that it is right to question the need for it. The Minister may argue that one occasion is sufficient, but if we reduce the number of arrests under the prevention of terrorism Act or the emergency provisions Act powers to a very small number, it is right to question whether we need the power at all.
<P>
The ball is in the Minister's court. Knowing how often the power has been used may help to justify the use of the extended three days for which the schedule provides. I should be grateful for that information, because it would allow us to judge whether there is a case for going beyond PACE--apart from the general argument that it is a good idea to go beyond it for terrorist offences.
<P>
Earlier, the Minister expressly said that in every case where there is a power greater than those in PACE, it has been separately considered and assessed. The question that follows--the Minister will have easier access to this information than we have--is whether there are any cases where the current powers go beyond. PACE and where the Bill provides a reduction in those powers which bring them nearer to the powers in PACE, or whether the proposed new powers shadow existing powers in every case. Are there any proposals to take the special terrorism powers beyond the existing powers of the Emergency Powers Act or the Prevention of Terrorism Act? I am using the amendment to ask the Minister for a general answer. If he would prefer to respond when we debate the schedule, I shall be happy to give him that time, and I look forward to his considered reply.
<P>
<B>Mr Lidington:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked the Minister a perfectly reasonable question about how often the existing power to extend detention beyond the initial four-day period has been used, and how long the extension goes beyond the four-day period that his amendment proposes.
<P>
I come to hon. Gentleman's amendment from a slightly sceptical point of view. I should be more inclined that he is to say that even if it could be shown in only a handful of cases that the seven-day power was needed, the power would still be justified to prevent loss of life and injury.
<P>
The extension of the Bill to international terrorism makes it more likely that an extension will be needed in a greater number of cases. More people will be detained and our police force will need to obtain evidence from a foreign police service. That might require the translation of documents or the use of interpreters to ensure proper understanding of conversations. If we are to get to grips with international terrorism, I fear we might need to keep the seven-day power on the statute book.
<P>
I understand the desire of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to debate the relationship between the Bill and PACE. As Lord Lloyd pointed out, a four-day period rather than a seven-day period would reduce the risk of the Bill, when enacted, breaching the European convention on human rights. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but I am inclined to think that the seven-day period remains necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis  </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): The harsh reality is that terrorists are often members of tightly-knit cells that are well organised and well conditioned to resist interrogation by police. There is no ideal length of time of detention, be it four, six or seven days, or longer. It is important to recognise that when a terrorist suspect is arrested, it affects not only the suspect but the interaction of the police with the terrorist cell to which the suspect belongs. The arrest of a terrorist triggers a series of activities that are vital to the safety of society. It is important to recognise that, so that rather than looking at the individual one looks at his value and effect within a terrorist group. For that reason, and from my experience over the years of detaining people who are well trained and well conditioned, I believe that the amendment should not be accepted. The Bill should remain as it is drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) that there is no ideal length of time. Special judgments are always involved. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is right that the period of more than four days has not been used a great deal. I shall give him the latest figures to illustrate the point. That it is why it is reasonable for him to discuss the question in the way that he wishes.
<P>
The latest figures for PTA detentions in Northern Ireland from the third quarter of last year--from 1 July to 30 September--set out the facts. Four persons were detained in the three to four day period, of whom two were charged and two were released. In the four to five day period, two people were detained: one was charged and the other was released. In that quarter, no individual was detained for more than five days. That illustrates the hon. Gentleman's point that the power to detain over four days has been used sparingly in the most recent period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It is dangerous to look at this issue in terms of recent events in Northern Ireland. It would be useful to look at the period from the mid-1970s right through to the mid-1990s, when terrorism was quite intense and this power needed to be used many more times.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I accept that point, but we believe the seven-day detention should be retained in the Bill because we are always in rapidly changing circumstances. We have no guide on how the Bill will best be applied to new situations. There might be the complications such as those that the hon. Member for Aylesbury raised concerning interpretation and international relations or other reasons. We believe that the current arrangements should continue, but I expect that seven-day detention will still be rare. That does not mean, however, that the provision is no longer needed. It is a question of balance. Our position is that the police need the flexibility to detain for seven days and the judicial authority provisions are a major new safeguard that I hope the the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will acknowledge.
<P>
I accept the force of the point that use of detention for more than four days over the recent period has not be great, but I do not accept the corollary that we therefore do not need the legal power to retain a seven-day detention requirement. Circumstances in Northern Ireland or elsewhere can change and we need the power to deal with them. I hope that that clarification answers the points made by the hon. Gentleman and I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone about the period over which we should look at the use of the powers. My question was not intended to misrepresent that. Obviously there are specifics that go back over the whole period; periods of greater terrorist activity are just as valid evidence of when powers are needed as periods of lower terrorist activity. I am grateful for the Minister's confirmation that there have been relatively few incidents recently and that one must therefore be careful if one goes beyond the powers.
I was going to raise this matter on stand part but it logically follows from the comments made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury. There is a European convention point relating to this power of detention. I did a stint at Strasbourg for a few years for the Council of Europe processing applications under the human rights legislation, including from Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The impression I formed was that this area of the convention understandably produced the largest number of applications. Arrest and detention were the legal processes about which people most often raised their rights. The largest number of dossiers was from prisoners or people in detention who would know the convention backwards. They would know all the case law on the convention and would quote it at some length in their applications.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that one of the reasons for his interesting experience in Strasbourg may have been that in the whole area covered by the Council of Europe the sharpest issues of liberty and freedom were being tested in Northern Ireland? It is not surprising, therefore, that the largest volume of cases that he dealt with came from that part of Europe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Absolutely. There were other places including Corsica, Spain, France and the Basque countries. The Minister is right that Northern Ireland had the most consistent set of issues. That is not meant to be a criticism of the United Kingdom. My point is that the articles of the convention were tested all the time. Every additional power was questioned regularly. Applications were brought under every subsection to the convention often from people in detention in the United Kingdom in relation to this sort of legislation.
<P>
That leads me to the question of compatibility, which follows on from the point made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury. My understanding is that in the Brogan case the delay of four hours and six days was held to be in violation of section 5.3, despite the special features of the case. The summaries of all the cases are in my office. I understand that the United Kingdom Government managed to uphold the legislation by their power under the convention to make a derogation for public order and security matters, which they are perfectly entitled to use.
<P>
By definition, derogations have to be for emergencies. Permanent derogations are not possible. The derogation was sought and upheld to be valid in a second case, that of Brannigan and McBride, which allowed the article 15 power of derogation. Does not putting the power of seven days in the Bill, and therefore eventually in permanent legislation, take these powers the other side of the European convention line? This is a move from temporary legislation to permanent legislation, even with the review provision that the Minister suggested we should have. Does it not contradict the idea that derogations are possible only for a temporary purpose because by definition they are meant to give temporary powers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is no, there is not a contradiction in our very considered view. I understand the points he made. His point about the relationship between temporary and permanent legislation is perfectly legitimate. We have thought about that a great deal. As I said earlier, according to our legal advice, our proposal does not bring us into conflict with the Human Rights Act. That is why we use the proposed words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister tells the Committee that this has been considered. Does he make the argument on the basis of the addition judicial safeguards that he referred to earlier? Is that one of the reasons that his advisers give him as justification for having extended powers in a non-temporary Bill?
<P>
Secondly, am I right in saying--I have been advised that this is correct--that under the PTA, international terrorism suspects have, as a matter of policy, not been detained for more than four days since the Brogan case, although there were powers to do so? If so, does that not suggest that there is at least some nervousness about the law? I am not suggesting that it is improper for the Government to use such powers, although someone might then have to test them by taking up a case in an Irish or other context. However, it would be helpful if the Minister could answer those two questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The Brogan judgment centred on the lack of judicial involvement in the detention process and on the time consideration. We would not accept a judicial authority granting five-day detentions as a matter of course. The Bill provides for further extensions to be granted. That reflects the current position, whereby extensions are granted incrementally. I do not favour introducing a statutory limit; that would be a matter for the judicial authority nearer the time. Once the judicial authority has authorised detention, the convention is satisfied. That will happen at 48 hours, at the latest.
<P>
It might be helpful if I stated that we intend to withdraw the derogation to which the hon. Gentleman referred. It applies to Irish terrorism only; international suspects have been detained for only four days.
<P>
I am trying to help the hon. Gentleman. The development of judicial involvement in the detention process is a key aspect of the Bill and it addresses the Brogan judgment. We believe and intend that the Bill will fall firmly under the terms of the Human Rights Act and will enable us to operate effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I want to raise one last matter, which I was going to leave until later. However, the hon. Member for Aylesbury mentioned the European convention, and it would be better to deal with the relevant issues now.
<P>
Is the Minister's advice that under the Bill, which covers Irish, British and international terrorism, the self-denying ordinance under which the PTA allows for no more than a four--day period in relation to international terrorism will no longer apply because of the judicial safeguard provisions and that the new powers will cover all terrorism? As the Minister rightly said, the derogation applies only to Irish terrorism, but the Bill applies to all terrorism. My understanding, therefore, is that the Government will not seek a derogation from the convention, because there is a judicial safeguard. Will all terrorism be in the same category for legal purposes? Once the Bill is enacted, will there be no need for a derogation?
<P>
I raise those questions because my advice is that challenges have been made on the issue in the normal way and that people have been allowed to intervene. Amnesty and the Liberty organisation--which was formerly known as the National Council for Civil Liberties and which happens to be a constituent of mine in terms of its headquarters--were invited to give views on the extradition case as third party representatives. They are concerned that the Bill's provisions may become permanent and that there would be no derogation provision, in which case they would want to challenge what was happening. It would, therefore, be helpful to know the basis for the Government's position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I had not appreciated that Liberty's headquarters was in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. That certainly explains a great deal. I am sure that the Committee will be grateful for the information.
<P>
The best I can do is repeat what I said. I expect seven-day detention to continue to be rare. We are not saying that we want to detain people for seven days, but simply that we do not want to withdraw the powers. The seven-day provision would apply to all terrorism. No derogation will be needed because we are satisfying the convention obligations through the judicial extension provisions. I hope that that provides the clarity that the hon. Gentleman seeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have a final point, which is prompted by the Minister's remarks. I am proud to have Liberty as a constituent, but it is not the only organisation based on the south bank. Although they are technically in the constituency next door, the security services, MI5 and MI6, are also based there. No doubt everybody is keeping an eye on each other on that side of the river.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's comments, and I will not press the amendment now. However, we are talking about important legal matters that raise wide issues, which have often been tested in the courts. The best thing is to allow those with an interest to read our debate and to make representations to us in the light of it. We will test the legality of the proposals on Report or in the other place, if it seems right to do so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 109, in page 109, leave out lines 16 to 19.</B><P>
<P>
The schedule gives the judicial authority power to exclude from any part of the judicial review hearing the person to whom the application relates and anyone representing him. My understanding is that paragraph 28(3) would allow the police, security services or anyone else to seek to persuade the court to continue detention without the suspect being able to challenge any of the allegations. That raises a fundamental question of civil liberties. People should be able to be present or be represented when a judicial authority arbitrates on matters that relate to their freedom.
<P>
Under article 5 of the European convention, there is an absolute right to have one's detention reviewed by judicial authority. I therefore make no criticism of the fact that a judicial review element is being built into the process. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee accept that such a provision is proper.
<P>
Article 6 of the convention guarantees a fair and public hearing in respect of a criminal charge, as well as all civil rights and obligations, including liberty of the person. Neither article 5 nor article 6 has derogation possibilities. It is therefore difficult to see how excluding somebody from a hearing to determine the legality of his detention can be reconciled with articles 5 and 6, our current law and, from 2 October 2000, the Human Rights Act.
<P>
I have two final points. The proposition in the schedule seems to be contrary to the traditional process in our court system, whereby people have an adversarial opportunity to put their case and to be seen and heard to do so before an authority makes a decision. Secondly, a point of natural justice arises. We are keen to have a fair legal system, in particular in the most sensitive areas. In that respect, the Bill is taking us away from the Northern Irish context and towards a United Kingdom and international terrorism context. However, the chance that people will feel that the system is being fair to them will be reduced if they are unable to see and hear the process that determines whether their detention is lawful.
<P>
You and I know, Mr. Malins, as do other members of the Committee, that bail applications are often made without the applicant being present. Someone can make the application on the applicant's behalf, and if the applicant is in custody on remand, or if it is a repeat application, it will often be a lawyer. The application is made in public in court in the usual way, but even if the application is made in chambers, someone will be present on behalf of the applicant to hear what the judge has to say.
<P>
It seems to me that the provision to allow the judicial authority to exclude someone is a provision and a power too far. I am minded to press the matter, I hope with the support of Conservative Members, on the basis of natural justice and under the principles of the convention. There may be an adequate explanation, but I have not yet found it. I wonder whether the Minister can rise to the threshold of suggesting that there might be one.

<B>Mr. Lidington: </b>My question to the Minister is whether the type of hearing covered by paragraph 28</B>(3) could involve sensitive information about people who had given information relating to terrorism to the police, or information derived from telephone intercepts or from intrusions upon property. If so, the same arguments probably apply to amendment No. 109 as applied to our debate on applications for deproscription and appeals against their refusal. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has made some reasonable points, but I would not wish to do anything that compromised the safety of informants or the flow of information to the authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> I hope that I can rise to the threshold set by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey; he always sets a demanding target. I hope that he will consider withdrawing the amendment.</B><P>
<P>
First, I make it absolutely clear that the purpose of paragraph 28(3) to schedule 7 is not to exclude the detainee as a matter of course. Article 6 rights are not relevant at the pre-charge stage. The rights that apply are those of article 5. I shall summarise our rationale for the judicial authority provisions before saying why I cannot accept the amendment. However, I would urge the Committee, if necessary, to vote against it should the hon. Gentleman press the matter.
<P>
Our key policy aim is to withdraw the United Kingdom's derogation from the European convention on human rights. It is right in principle that we should put in place a system that allows us to do that, and it is essential that the new arrangements are compliant with our convention obligations. We started with a careful examination of the rights that apply at the pre-charge stage of a police investigation. We are concerned principally with article 5(3), which is the right to be brought promptly before a judicial authority.
<P>
The leading case on the matter is that of Schiesser, which sets out the essential elements for such a hearing. Those elements are built into the arrangements in part III of the schedule. It includes the right to be heard, enshrined in paragraph 28(1), under which the detainee has an opportunity to make written or oral representation. That is crucial also to maintaining the independence of the judiciary, as the judicial authority will be able to hear both sides of a case. The Schiesser case further stresses that the judicial authority must have full discretion, which is ensured by his being able to hear both parties to a case. Paragraph 28(2) to schedule 7 goes further than Schiesser, by ensuring that the detainee can, if he wishes, be represented during the preceedings. I hope that it is clear that we intend the detainee to be able to participate in proceedings.
<P>
The amendment seeks to remove the discretion of the judicial authority to exclude the detainee, his representative or both of them from the proceedings. The Bill makes that provision primarily to allow the smooth conduct of the hearing. The judicial authority must be able, if necessary, to remove persons being disruptive or who are causing a nuisance if the disruption or nuisance would adversely affect the judicial authority's ability to exercise his function under the schedule.
<P>
The provision may also be used to allow unforeseen points in relation to information that the judicial authority has ruled should not be disclosed to be explored in the proper way without having to be revealed during the hearing. I am happy to place it on record that we expect the power to be used only when absolutely necessary, and that we positively want the detainee to engage in proceedings. That is his right.
<P>
The short answer to the question posed by the hon. Member for Aylesbury is yes. It could cover sensitive information. Paragraph 29 to the schedule makes provision for protecting such information from disclosure. We shall turn to that matter in detail on amendments Nos. 110 and 111.
<P>
I hope that I have set out the position clearly. I have tried to emphasise our strong desire to ensure that the entire Bill complies with the European convention on human rights. As a result, we can fulfil our key policy aim to withdraw the UK's derogation. I know that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey shares that ambition despite our occasional disagreements about lawyers. I hope that he will consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</b> It is always better to air a matter and put our views on record, which is the benefit of the Committee procedures. That is why some of us criticised the accelerated procedure used for the Disqualifications Bill. The Committee procedure gives us time to make a considered assessment of arguments and to take advice before going on to the next stage. Although I am still troubled, I am happy to consider the matter.</B><P>
<P>
I would ask the Minister one more question. I am told that another case governs the law in this matter--the Lamy v. Belgium case of 1989. It deals specifically with the right to withhold information. That case may be covered by what the Minister said in his response to the debate. He may not be able to give a considered answer now, but will he take advice and give his considered view of the impact of that case on the Bill, and how the Bill is reconciled with that judicial decision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke: </b>We did not take account of that judgment when preparing for this debate, so I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on the subject.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</b> I said a moment ago that we should not put into legislation something that might offend the convention or that could be open to judicial challenge. I shall withhold my agreement, but I shall not press the amendment to a Division. Several amendments have been tabled to the schedule and to the clause that preceded it, which need to be considered together.</B><P>
<P>
This has been a useful exchange. Other hon. Members may want to reflect on the matter and, after consideration, they too might want to register their objections. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes: </b>I beg to move amendment No. 111, in page 109, leave out lines 20 to 44.</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to debate amendment No. 110, in page 109, leave out lines 41 to 44.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</b> I apologise, Mr. Malins, that I alone speak for the Liberal Democrat party, but I have no choice. The possibility of allowing the Committee to hear a variety of voices and opinions is not open to me. I would wish it as much as the Committee, which I hope that hon. Members understand. The presence of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone seems a greater benefit to the Committee than sparing it from listening to only myself--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: </b>Order. I speak for myself and, I am sure, all hon. Members when I say that it is a great pleasure to hear the hon. Gentleman.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes: </b>You are so kind, Mr. Malins, but this is your first sitting in the Chair, which may make a difference.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke: </b>Was that vote on behalf of the whole Committee or was it a single vote for, nil against and 10 abstentions?</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: </b>Order. The Minister will note that I did not call a formal Division on the matter.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes: </b>We proceed with general courtesy and good will, and I intend the tone to stay that way. Occasionally, the temperature will rise a little, but that is understandable.</B><P>
<P>
The amendments seek deletions of certain lines that the Minister mentioned in the previous debate, which are on page 109 of the Bill. Amendment No. 111 would remove lines 20 to 44 of schedule 7, which is the paragraph headed "Information". Amendment No. 110 would be covered by the other amendment, and proposes the removal of lines 41 to 44, which is a similar provision about the power of the judicial authority to direct that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the person to whom the application for a warrant relates"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and those representing him could be excluded from the hearing of the application. The amendments relate to the access of lawyers to the deliberations on the warrant issue.
<P>
The amendments are intended to probe the ability of an accused person, at a different stage of proceedings, to be deprived of information on which the police intend to rely in support of their application for a warrant. The second amendment would prevent that from happening, and the first would allow the application for exclusion to be made but would prevent the judicial authority from excluding the accused from the hearing. The argument is one of principle: is it right for people to be unable to make representations in respect of access to information that may affect their continued defence?
<P>
he Samuel case, a British domestic law case now 12 years old, is the most commonly cited case that establishes that access to legal representation on arrest is one of the most fundamental rights of the citizen. That right is specifically upheld in article 6.1 and 6.3(c) of the convention. The Murray case in the European Court in 1996 held that powers to deny the rights of the defence were incompatible with article 6, and that was in the context of a statutory instrument, the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. In that case, the court decided that the lack of access to a lawyer from the outset might have irretrievably prejudiced the defence.
<P>
There are powers elsewhere covering how long access to lawyers can be delayed, which are on the other side of the coin of the right to be represented. This pair of amendments is designed to probe the justification that the Government would have us accept for the removal of the right to have information at the time that the decision is made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I propose to say a few words about the general question of judicial authority in the schedule 7 stand part debate. However, my objections to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, which I believe my hon. Friends would share, centre on our concern that during the period of detention which is authorised in these special circumstances to facilitate a terrorist investigation designed to save life, it is vital that the sensitive information--perhaps including information about informants--that is available to the police is not compromised by being made available to the person who is under investigation for that limited period.
<P>
It was partly for that reason that the previous Government held the view that the Secretary of State--that is, an Executive authority--rather than a judicial authority should be charged with the responsibility of granting detention extensions in respect of terrorist inquiries. Given that the Government have decided to adopt a different policy--one which, in fairness, they have signalled for several years--it is vital to ensure that safeguards of the type provided for in the schedule are sustained. For that reason, I cannot support the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The amendment would delete in its entirety paragraph 29 of schedule 7, which enables certain information to be withheld from the detainee if its disclosure would cause harm. I should emphasise that paragraph 29 is aimed at protecting information and not at preventing representation. In fact, paragraph 28 gives the detainee rights of representation during the proceedings.
<P>
As I explained, we went to considerable lengths to design a system that protects a detainee's rights. That is a core policy goal of the Bill. I am advised that article 5 rights at this stage of the investigation are less onerous than article 6 rights, which apply to the post-charge phase. It follows that there is no absolute right to full disclosure of all the information in the police's possession as long as the judicial authority has access to it and his discretion therefore remains unfettered.
<P>
We must remember that the purpose of extended detention is to assist the police when they are not in a position to bring a charge. The detainee will, of course, be told that an application is being made to the Judicial authority and he will know the ground upon which detention will be sought, which will assist him in making his representations if he wishes to exercise that right. But there is another consideration to be balanced--the need to protect information from disclosure where such disclosure would cause harm to individuals or where evidence would be compromised. That is a legitimate policy aim, given the nature of the information on which the police may need to rely at this stage in the investigation. It is the principal reason why I cannot accept amendment No. 111, which would leave the police with only two options: either to disclose the information against their better judgment, with potentially dreadful and lethal consequences, or to abandon their case.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said that this was an issue of principle, and I understand why. But there is another principle at stake, which is the obligation on Government to protect the life and liberties of individual citizens from terrorist attack. In certain circumstances, a conflict between the two can arise. The principle argument, though I am sure that the hon. Gentleman makes it with integrity, is not one way; there are two principles and we must decide which way to go, We are clear that in the highly specific circumstances of the cases that are set out fully in paragraph 29(2)(a) and (f), if those principles are in conflict and a judgment must be made, it is critically important to ensure that terrorism is inhibited, which is what the Bill is about.
<P>
Amendment No. 110 is an alternative to amendment No. 111 and would remove the requirement on the judicial authority to exclude the detainee and his representative from the disclosure hearing. That would make the disclosure provision unworkable, as the detainee would know the nature of the information that the police wanted to withhold.
<P>
As I said, I can see the purpose of the amendments, but the whole of this paragraph is designed to ensure that convention rights are delivered while at the same time ensuring that sensitive information is not disclosed where harm would result. I ask the hon. Gentleman to take seriously the points that I have made about the conflict of principles and to consider whether it would be better to withdraw the amendment rather than pressing it to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> As I said, one of the purposes of tabling amendments is to put the arguments on the record and to allow for considered reflection. The same applies in this case. I have one more question.
<P>
There is always a balance to be struck between the liberty of the individual and the power of the state. What is the mechanism for ensuring that the internationally recognised liberties of individuals--they are not a British speciality; we may often have drafted the provisions and put them into international law, but they are recognised in British, European and international contexts--are trespassed on only by a process that is internationally recognised as being valid? The safeguard must be an independent judicial process. Such a safeguard is even more important in a country that does not have a Bill of Rights as part of its domestic law and, therefore, relies largely on common law matters, even though the European convention helps to establish rights in domestic law.
<P>
I understand the argument, but I always start from the proposition that we need to defend the rights of the individual. If states are taking away the normal rights of an individual, they must be checked by someone independent. There is a provision for a judicial hearing and assessment: the authorities have to go to a judicial authority and say, "This is my case", and the judicial authority can uphold the request by saying, "Yes, I am satisfied that the greater interest requires that the information isn't disclosed." That leads me to a simple question. Under this part of the legislation, how senior must a judicial authority be and how much experience must he have? I ask because people need to know that the judicial authority has sufficient seniority, competence and experience to be able properly to adjudicate in a way that has the confidence of all those concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I am not in a position to answer that question immediately, but I hope to be able to answer it shortly. Meanwhile, I am happy to tell a few jokes.
<P>
Paragraph 24(4) defines who can act as a judicial authority--that is not a joke, but a serious statement--and provides that the judicial authority will be appointed by the Lord Chancellor. I am sure that Lord Chancellors will in all circumstances, as the hon. Gentleman said, take account of the need for a judicial authority to have the weight of experience, including in these issues, which would enable good judgments to be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That exchange reveals the benefit of being in government as opposed to being in opposition. In government, one normally has several people immediately available, whereas if Opposition Members have such people, they are probably not here; certainly they do not have as many people who can give the matter so much attention.
<P>
I thought that the Minister would give that answer, but I have one technical question. When I read paragraph 24(4), I wondered if there might be an inaccuracy in the drafting. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in England and Wales, the Senior District Judge (Chief Magistrate) or his deputy, or a District Judge (Magistrates' Courts) who is designated for the purpose of this Part by the Lord Chancellor".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The definitions for Scotland and Northern Ireland seem accurate and well drafted. Partly because I have been out of the legal system for longer than some members of the Committee, I am confused about whether those two titles are correct. Does a person exist who is always called "a senior district judge"? Are he and the chief magistrate therefore one and the same? The drafting of the provision, using brackets, suggests that they are. The use of the phrase "District Judge (Magistrates' Courts)" cannot be the right way to draft the paragraph. It is a drafting matter, as well as a matter of interpretation, and I shall be happy to pursue it later, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> As I understand it, the names are simply the new names for stipendiary magistrates. The language is used in legislation to describe those people. Obviously, I shall ask my advisers to consider the hon. Gentleman's point carefully in order to ascertain whether the paragraph lacks clarity, but I believe that the wording used is merely the new technical term for stipendiary magistrates.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): The Minister is right about the names, and it is a pity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's remarks, and am interested in his observation on the language used. I do not know whether he contributed to the debate when the names were changed, but I take it seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister may be right. Perhaps the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor), who is a solicitor, followed the changes.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. My position should be clarified. As I have told the Committee in the vernacular, I was a practising solicitor for 22 years, until I went straight in 1988, since when I have not offended. I hope that you will take that into account.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall certainly take it into account in sentencing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> In that case, I should like to make a further comment in mitigation before you sentence me. I should like the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to know that I am advised by the Law Society that my correct designation is "solicitor (non-practising)".
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We are grateful for that clarification. I have never asked, but when I visit my chambers in the Temple, which is not often these days, and see my name still on the list--although, as I complain, it does not seem to be moving up very quickly; it remains about halfway up, which says something about the lack of people falling off the top--I, too, am described as a barrister, non-practising. However, no one has ever told me that formally, and I have certainly never been told that there are brackets around the last two words.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's answer, and I shall confirm whether the drafting is satisfactory. The crucial point is that the person involved should be a qualified, experienced and specially appointed member of the judiciary, rather than a relatively unqualified and inexperienced lay person. That is why I raised the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words about schedule 7 in general. I shall discuss two of the major policy issues involved: the introduction of obligatory tape recordings for all interviews of terrorist suspects, and giving the power to grant extensions of detention to a judicial authority, rather than leaving it with the Secretary of State.
<P>
In each case, the Government have changed the practice adopted by their predecessor by incorporating that change into existing anti-terrorist legislation. Previous Secretaries of State have not taken the decisions to sustain the arrangements on tape recording and on the power to extend detention in the existing prevention of terrorism legislation lightly, but only after careful reflection. It is therefore right that we should debate this now and that I should ask the Government to give a more  detailed account than has been possible in our debate on the amendments of the rationale behind those two policy changes and to give an account of their consultations, particularly with the police and the judiciary, on those changes.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On the decision to make the tape recording of interviews obligatory, I start by making it clear that the introduction of the tape recording of interviews with police suspects has been of enormous benefit to the criminal justice system and to the police service itself. When that requirement was first introduced into legislation, the police were suspicious of it, but it had been made necessary by a series of well-publicised miscarriages of justice and botched or even, I fear, corrupt police investigations. There is little doubt that the use of tape recording has helped--as the police recognise--sustain public confidence in the police service. However, previous Secretaries of State decided that an exception should remain for interviews with terrorist suspects--I remember that arising when I worked for the now Lord Hurd when he was Home Secretary, for example. The previous Government took that decision because of the special circumstances of terrorist inquiries and because of the fear that tape recording would indirectly lead to the drying up of the supply of information to the police because it would make it easier for terrorist organisations to threaten and blackmail those whom they suspected of being police informers. That point was discussed by Lord Lloyd in his report; his conclusion was that terrorist suspects should be brought within the statutory regime of tape recording. However, he did so after making the point that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"intelligence is the most potent weapon in the counter-terrorism armoury"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that terrorist organisations were well aware of that and would be, in his words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"energetic and ruthless in their efforts to choke off the flow of intelligence to the authorities."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Lloyd expressed the concern that when a terrorist suspect was released following arrest by, for example, the RUC, the terrorist organisation concerned would make every effort to establish whether that man had given any information away, deliberately or otherwise. Lord Lloyd added that the task of the terrorist organisations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would be made easier if there were a taped record of the interview."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The detainee could then be ordered--on pain of violent retribution--to initiate an action against the police or to seek disclosure of a copy of the tape recording during the course of criminal proceedings. If he refused to do it, the terrorists would take that as an admission of guilt and take retaliatory action. In paragraph 9.35, Lord Lloyd concluded that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Such a state of affairs would put informants at risk and jeopardise the flow of vital intelligence".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
From a reading of his report, what seems to have persuaded Lord Lloyd that the balance of evidence was in favour of bringing terrorist interviews into the provisions of general criminal law was that the view of the police service had changed. The police now believe that tape recording could be extended to interviews with terrorist suspects without that materially compromising their investigations.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee what consultations the Government had with the police service on that proposal. Is it true that the police believe that the risk that, in their opinion, used to exist has now diminished to the point where terrorist suspects can be brought within the current statutory regime without that threatening the effectiveness of terrorist inquiries? If so, is that the view of the police in all parts of the United Kingdom or is there a difference between the views of the police authorities in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland? What is the Government's assessment of the concerns that Lord Lloyd expressed in his report about the possible risk to informants if tape recording were generally introduced in terrorist cases?
<P>
My next point relates to who should exercise the power to grant extensions of detention. Life starts to resemble "A Dance to the Music of Time" for me at this point. I remember being at the Home Office when the Brogan case came up and the Government were trying to frame their response to it. I again emphasise that the then Government and the then Secretary of State's decision to seek a derogation from the European convention on human rights in respect of terrorists in Northern Ireland was a decision taken only after the most careful reflection on international legal questions and on the practical question facing the Government of how to counter the threat from the IRA and other Irish terrorist organisations.
<P>
As members of the Committee will know, in November 1988 the European Court held that the detention of applicants under the PTA for more than four days in the Brogan case constituted a breach of article 5.3 of the convention because the applicants had not been brought "promptly" before a judicial authority. About a month later, Lord Hurd, the then Home Secretary, announced that the Government would derogate from article 5.3 in respect of Northern Ireland terrorism, as they were entitled to do under article 15 of the convention.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey pointed out in an earlier debate, in the later case of Brannigan and McBride, the European Commission of Human Rights found by a majority vote that the convention had not been breached. That view was then referred to the European Court which, in a final decision of 1993, upheld the United Kingdom's derogation by a decisive majority of 22 to four.
<P>
When the then Government had to deal with the Brogan case in 1988, my recollection--I did not keep a diary at the time, so I rely on my memory--[Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull expresses, with the habit of an ex-Whip, relief that I was not keeping a diary. My recollection is that the key factor in the Government's decision was the attitude of the judiciary, especially the judiciary in Northern Ireland. There was a view in Whitehall that it might be possible to put together an arrangement in England and Scotland that would introduce a judicial element into the review of detention.
<P>
However, the question of Northern Ireland was the real stumbling block.  The difficulty was grounded on two facts. First, the Northern Ireland judiciary were few in number, and they were living under the threat of terrorist attack. To give them that responsibility would expose them further. Secondly, there was the problem that because of the special circumstances in Northern Ireland, judges in the Province had the responsibility of trying cases without a jury and determining guilt or innocence in a way in which their judicial brethren in the mainland did not have to do.
<P>
Because of that, the situation in Northern Ireland represented particularly acutely the dilemma of how to involve judges who are used to hearing all sides making representations to them in court. They are expected to make executive decisions to which the normal rules of disclosure or the giving of an equal hearing to both sides may may not apply. The dilemma was particularly acute because the men and women who make decisions about the extension of detention for a terrorist suspect are drawn from the same body from which are drawn the judges who decide without a jury someone's guilt or innocence.
<P>
For a long time, the Government have signalled that they want to substitute for the United Kingdom's derogation from the convention a different approach, based on the incorporation of the convention into domestic law and the introduction of a judicial element. I still have reservations about the wisdom of doing that and the risk of blurring the distinction between the judiciary on the one hand and the Executive on the other. A number of points have been made in the wider debate outside the Committee in support of the Government's view, including reference to the fact that judges are already involved in hearings of public interest immunity certificates, or decisions to extend detention under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
<P>
There is a qualitative difference between those powers and what is being proposed under schedule 7. Public interest immunity is concerned with the rules of evidence, not with Executive acts that determine whether an individual should be detained for questioning in an investigation. In a public interest immunity application, the judge knows the issues from both sides. He has the prosecution statements and depositions, which will make the defence case clear. If he does not have them, he can ask the defence for them. In addition, the court has a duty to continue to monitor the issue of disclosure. If it becomes clear that the material that has not already been disclosed would assist the defence, the court must reverse its decision and order disclosure. That is materially different from the sorts of decision that we are considering in respect of the power to authorise the extension of detention. The judicial authority is being asked to act on the basis of material that would not be disclosed either to the suspect or to his legal adviser.
<P>
A similar point applies to the argument about the power to extend detention under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Under that Act, when a magistrate grants an extension, there is a full inter-partes procedure, at which the defendant is present, for which he is legally represented and when he is fully aware of the grounds for the application. That lies behind many of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The defendant is told the nature of the evidence on which he has been arrested, and why his continued detention is necessary. A magistrates court has no power to act, except in those circumstances.
<P>
That is completely different from an application under terrorist legislation when the detained person may not be given the procedural safeguards because of the sensitivity of the material in question. I differ from the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in that I come down on the side of protecting sensitive information. That is the higher priority in my view in the defined circumstance of a terrorist investigation. Is it then right for that decision to be given to a judicial power, or should it lie with a member of the Executive, who is accountable in the last resort to Parliament?
<P>
Will the Minister give an account of the political philosophy behind the Government's approach, especially on whether the judiciary in Northern Ireland is content with the Government's Proposals? In the past, the judiciary has been greatly concerned about the issue, which has deterred previous Secretaries of State from going down the path that the present Government are now urging on the Committee. Schedule 7 involves serious questions about the constitutional relationship between the Executive and the judiciary, and I hope that the Minister can give a full account of the Government's reasons for the change of policy.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I have a brief but highly technical point to make on schedule 7, relating to paragraph 9, entitled "Audio recording of interviews". A point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury at the start of his remarks prompted me to rise to my feet. I do not want an answer from the Minister today, but I wonder whether he will reflect on the question whether he may have restricted himself too much by referring only to audio recording of interviews with suspects. I am not sure why video has been excluded. There may be good reasons, or it may be because the Home Office cannot break through the block that most lawyers have on the use of video evidence. If the Minister has not considered the matter in his general ministerial capacity, I recommend that he calls for a report.
<P>
When I left the Home Office, I was very keen on video recording. Three years ago, the technology was just about perfected and studies were being conducted in various police forces. The Metropolitan police may have been involved; the police in Powys certainly were. The technology seemed to be pretty good. I recall that there were two main problems, one of which was the financial implication. Interview suites have to be kitted out with video camera technology, which the police say has to be bobby-proof, easy to work and probably digital. Secondly, it must be acceptable in evidence. The legal system, the judiciary and the Crown Prosecution Service all detest video tapes. If the Minister examines the test cases when video-taped interviews have been conducted, he will see that the finest, freshest evidence is presented to the court. The jury can see wonderful examples of the demeanour, attitude, behaviour and character of both the police and the suspect. Such evidence is often difficult to refute, which is why defence lawyers hate it.
<P>
There is another problem. The system is geared to transcripts of interviews. The Minister will have spent much time trying to speed up the involvement of the police, the CPS and the court in the judicial system. If, in the past three years, the Government have reduced the thousands of hours that the police waste transcribing audio tapes to give to lawyers, they will have been successful.
<P>
In my first year in Parliament, I sat on the Committee on what was then the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill. In my naivety, I believed that two tapes were made when interviews were audio taped, one for the accused and one for the court, and that the first-hand evidence of the interview was played in court. I thought that the judge and jury would hear the accused's answers and make judgments on his truthfulness or whether the police had bullied and hectored him. Of course, the tapes are never played. Soon after PACE was passed, we--the Government and the police collectively--let the grip slip, because lawyers insisted on transcripts. It is nonsense that we have perfect audio tapes of interviews that the police have to transcribe because the CPS and the judge refuse to touch them unless they have a transcript.
<P>
The Minister will know about the video taping of child interviews. One has to be careful how one describes the judiciary without getting into contempt, but I would call at least one judge's wisdom into question. He tried to insist on having a transcript of the video interview of the child's evidence. When I left the Home Office, the police force concerned was fighting that tooth and nail with my encouragement, as it seemed to be nonsense.
<P>
I have begun that road only by way of example. I am merely trying to emphasise that I believe that the video taping of interviews, of terrorist suspects or others, is generally of benefit to the court. It is the only way in which we can ever cut through the nonsense of transcribing every audio tape. As a Minister, I could never claw back the ground that we had lost since 1984 because the CPS, the Lord Chancellor's Department, the legal profession and the judiciary had taken it as a God-given right that they never touched audio tapes but had written transcripts. However, if most interviews were video taped, perhaps we could leapfrog ahead and stop the development of the new nonsense of transcribing video tapes for the courts and lawyers.
<P>
I have perhaps made that point at more length than I intended, but I want the Minister to consider it. He may have good reasons not to want video taping of any terrorist suspect interviews. One good reason may be that not enough police interview suites are equipped for it, or perhaps experiments with video taping have been deemed to fail. However, if it might become a regular practice, I suggest that the Minister reflects on whether he should widen the scope of paragraph 9 on Report or in another place so that the Secretary of State may make an order requiring an audio or video recording by digital or other appropriate means. The Secretary of State's hands should not be tied merely to audio recording.
<P>
I hope that I have not laboured the point. I do not need an answer today unless the Minister has one to hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The contribution of the hon. Member for Aylesbury motivated me to make a few observations, as it was especially relevant in terms of where responsibility for terrorism lies in the Executive, the police and the judiciary.
<P>
The subject of the police's thinking on the matter was raised. Sadly, constabularies in Northern Ireland and Great Britain are ever encouraged to eschew everything political. They are increasingly pressured not to make political observations or observations that could be interpreted as--
