<P>
<B>Mr. Eddie McGrady </B>(South Down): I beg to move amendment No. 200, in page 16, line 4, leave out from ``shall'' to ``any'' in line 7 and insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) insofar as practicable comply with the policing plan, and

<P>
(b) have regard to'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This simple amendment is designed to ensure that the Chief Constable is under a statutory duty, as far as is practicable, to comply with the policing plan that is drawn up by the Policing Board. The board's policing plan should be treated as an important and essential document, which sets out its strategy for training, education and the general development of a new police service in Northern Ireland. The Achilles heel of the Bill's proposed arrangements is that the Chief Constable merely has to ``have regard to'' the policing plan. That gives him a very wide discretion. If he has only to consider the plan, he can, in effect, do whatever he likes. No obligation is placed on him; he has only to take it on board. That is not good enough in terms of the new dispensation that we hope will apply to the delivery of police services in Northern Ireland.

<P>
At the same time, we accept that the Chief Constable must maintain his operational responsibility. That is why we do not favour obliging him to follow the plan, unless he has been given power by the board not to do so. That would be inflexible and wrong. The amendment merely proposes that he should be under a duty, as far as is practicable, to comply with the plan. That is a straightforward proposition, which emphasises the necessity of adopting an attitude whereby we have not only a regard for, but a duty to implement, the policing plan that is drawn up by the Policing Board.

<P>
I commend the amendment to the Committee.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth):</b> As my hon. Friend the Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) explained, the amendment would require the Chief Constable to comply with the policing plan, in so far as is practicable. As drafted, the clause requires the Chief Constable to have regard to the policing plan to allow for any unforeseen changes in policing requirements. Let me make it clear that the Government expect that he will adhere to the plan as far as is possible.</B><P>

<P>
Essentially, we are talking about a planning process. As my hon. Friend will know, given his long experience of such matters, plans are sometimes overtaken by events. No one can anticipate every eventuality, and references to complying with plans do not allow sufficient flexibility. Paragraph 6(4) of the Patten report stated that the police should develop the short-term, tactical plans for delivering the board's objectives, and the words ``have regard to'' give them the flexibility to do that.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Down will acknowledge that there is hardly a gulf between us. It could be argued that the phrase ``have regard to'' is a simpler way of saying
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>insofar as practicable comply with.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke):</b> The Under-Secretary is discussing an amendment that relates to clause 31(2), which will give the Chief Constable the flexibility to respond to unforeseen policing developments. We discussed this matter in relation to an amendment to clause 22(1), which involved the Secretary of State, but the Minister rejected the argument. Why is his argument relevant to the Chief Constable but not to the Secretary of State?

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The starting point in this regard is the Patten report, paragraph 6.21 of which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is the Chief Constable's  duty to take operational decisions, and  neither the government nor the Policing Board should have the right to direct the Chief Constable as to how to conduct an operation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Patten makes a sharp distinction between the role of the Secretary of State, to which the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) referred, and the role of the Chief Constable. Our approach is reasonable in this context, as distinct from that which is raised by the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down.

<P>
In the circumstances, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment, which simply involves a difference of words. Our intentions are essentially the same, and I have clarified what the relevant expectations are. He will agree that the fact that I made such a statement in Committee is significant.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The Minister's comments on the duties of the Chief Constable coincide with the amendment's sentiments. With that clear understanding, and in the hope that the matter will be fulfilled in practice with the relevant rules and regulations, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 31 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 32 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>

<H4><center>Appointment and removal of senior officers of the police service</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): </b>I beg to move amendment No. 236, in page 16, line 42, after ``person'', insert ``with experience of policing''.

<P>
The clause deals with the removal of police officers, who will have an opportunity to appeal. The Secretary of State can appoint a person to hold an inquiry and to report to him before he makes a final decision. If the amendment were agreed to, subsection (6) would state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The person appointed under subsection (4)(b) (or where two or more persons are so appointed, at least one of those persons) shall be a person with experience of policing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If there is an appeals mechanism, the person to whom the police constable or police inspector would appeal would need to have some experience of the workings of the police, hence the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</b> I understand why the hon. Gentleman has brought the proposal forward and that there may be fears that the person conducting the inquiry will not have the competence necessary to understand the issues at stake.</B><P>

<P>
The requirement in the amendment is that the person concerned should have knowledge of policing-in other words, he should be a police officer or a retired police officer. However, if there were to be a complicated fraud case, it might be argued that it would be best to have an accountant to conduct that inquiry. Strictly speaking, it would not be a policing issue, even though it involved a police officer in a discipline and appeal procedure. The clause has been drafted to allow some flexibility. The qualities that a person could bring to such an inquiry or appeal mechanism would be considered-it would be horses for courses. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the reasoning behind the clause and will not press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I can see that, in certain circumstances, financial matters may need someone with experience in that field. Having heard the Minister's explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 33 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 34 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 35</center></H4>

<H4><center>Appointments to the police service reserve</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 17, line 32, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) No person shall serve as a member of the police service reserve on a full time basis four years after the entry into force of this subsection.

<P>
(4) The Secretary of State may by order extend the period mentioned in subsection (3) if he is satisfied that there are compelling reasons related to the protection of public safety and public order in Northern Ireland to do so.

<P>
(5) Before making an order under subsection (4), the Secretary of State shall consult-

<P>
(a) the Board;

<P>
(b) the Chief Constable.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment deals with the full-time reserve and how the present community imbalance in the force can be redressed in a reasonable, orderly and equitable way. Lest I be misinterpreted, I should say that my party acknowledges the commitment shown by the vast majority of full-time reserve police officers to their duties and the sacrifices that they have made. It is not our intention to impugn that record of service in any way. However, we must deal with the phasing out of the full-time reserve in an orderly and proper fashion, so that we can implement other parts of the Bill that relate to community balance in the composition of the police service.

<P>
In the amendment, we propose that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No person shall serve as a member of the police service reserve on a full time basis four years after the entry into force of this subsection.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, we are aware that there will be difficulties, so subsection (4) would allow the Secretary of State to extend that period
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if he is satisfied that there are compelling reasons related to the protection of public safety and public order in Northern Ireland.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (5) would require the Secretary of State to consult the board and the Chief Constable.

<P>
It is interesting that the Patten report used the word ``disbandment'' only once, in relation to the full-time reserve. The Bill does nothing to address that recommendation. The implementation plan does not even provide a timetable for disbandment of the full-time reserve. In terms of one of the crucial elements of the new police service, there is a total blank. The amendment would require that the full-time reserve be disbanded within four years, but some flexibility is given to the Secretary of State. If there are compelling reasons why that requirement could not be met, they would have to be made public.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
There is a rider, which does not pertain to the amendment. On the part-time reserve, the thrust of Patten was that, as drafted, the Bill would make it difficult to establish better cross-community representation and retain the full-time reserve, because the process must be subject to the force's standing order requirement. Therefore, if the amendment is not accepted, the Government will find it difficult to address a fundamental issue, that of rapid progress toward recruiting minority representatives into the police service. However, as I said, it would in no way impinge on the full-time reserve. Instead, it offers a new dimension that would meet Patten's requirement to provide a cross-community-and therefore acceptable-police force in Northern Ireland.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> When he replies to the amendment, I hope that the Minister will address the three points that were uppermost in my mind when listening to the hon. Member for South Down. First, will the Minister confirm that turnover in the full-time reserve has been accelerating for the past six years or so? Were that trend to continue, would it not account for the hon. Gentleman's objective? Secondly, cannot the provision be questioned on the principled ground that it is a vehicle for taking positive discrimination too far, too soon? Thirdly, does the Minister agree that there are practical reasons why, where possible, experience should be maintained in the full-time reserve, given that experience greatly enhances its effectiveness and capability?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): We all know that, prior to his appointment, the Chief Constable was responsible for the fundamental review. He proposed that the full-time reserve be done away with, but, in his defence, he did suggest that that should happen only when there was a change in circumstances, and unlike Patten, he set out three specific and realistic scenarios against which the changes should take place.

<P>
I should like Committee members to consider the matter in slightly different terms. Such is the influence and organisation of the mafia sub-culture in Northern Ireland that, in a transitional period when the overall structure of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is changing, there might be a need to retain the full-time reserve for much longer than was originally envisaged. That may not be the case-if it is not, events will take their natural course. However, let us suppose that it is the case, as I believe that the hon. Member for South Down has recognised. In those circumstances, we should not inhibit the Chief Constable in respect of the status of the full-term reserve. The amendment is somewhat contradictory in that respect-or perhaps not contradictory, but simply unnecessary. It proposes a period of four years in which to get rid of the full-time reserve, and then recognises, as most of us do, that that might not be achievable. There is, therefore, no reason for the amendment: what is necessary is necessary.

<P>
Although my knowledge of the internal workings of the police in Northern Ireland is limited, I am very concerned that we are losing out because of the natural wastage that has been occurring in the full-time reserve for many years. I do not have the exact figures, but I suspect that the number of full-time reserve officers who have disappeared through age, illness or injury is perhaps as high as 500. That leaves a huge gap in the ability of the police to deliver the kind of services at community level that have been recommended, and that both the hon. Member for South Down and I would like to see. I would hope that the Chief Constable will be left with the latitude-perhaps not desirable in his own specific terms-not only to extend the lifetime of the full-time reserve if necessary, but to recruit to the reserve if he finds, for other reasons, that he has inadequate personpower-or manpower, as we used to call it. That recruiting is not happening at the moment.

<P>
The amendment is unnecessary. I do not find fault with the hon. Gentleman for raising the issue, but any measure that ties the hands or constrains the authority of the Chief Constable in terms of delivering a service that society needs in a transitional period would be absolute folly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I begin by echoing the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down when he paid tribute to the role played by the full-time reserve since its inception. It has been on the front line alongside the regular officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and has clearly performed a useful and powerful function during that time. The Patten report recognises that, and pays tribute to the role of the full-time reserve.

<P>
The amendment would make statutory provision for the discontinuance of the full-time reserve four years after the coming into force of clause 35, unless the Secretary of State extends the period on the grounds of public safety or public order. Paragraph 12.17 and recommendation 103 of the Patten report state that in future the police service should not include a full-time reserve. As the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) said, the Chief Constable himself foresaw that eventuality in the fundamental review.

<P>
Patten envisages that the full-time reserve will be phased out over three years, after reasonable notice as contracts expire. The reasoning for that is set out in paragraph 13.11. The Government recognise the strength of Patten's argument that the full-time reserve should be phased out, and we accept the recommendation. Downsizing will be achieved through non-renewal of reservists' contracts and enhanced severance arrangements. Clause 45 makes provision for those arrangements.

<P>
Having said that, overriding consideration must be given to the security environment in which the process takes place. Of course, in an ideal security climate, it could be completed within a four-year time scale, but I would argue that the Chief Constable must be permitted some discretion in what is essentially an operational assessment. We have made it clear all along that the security profile should not be tackled on the basis of political will or political determination-although there must be some play-in of political assessment and analysis. Essentially, the Government take the advice of the Chief Constable and security advisers as to the reality on the ground when making our assessments of what may happen in the period ahead. Those assessments may well differ from perceptions out in the wider community.

<P>
Governments have to take tough decisions based on security assessments. We have never shirked from doing that, and shall not do so in future. We must at all times exercise maximum caution and discretion in our judgments, because getting them wrong could have serious and profound implications for the wider community in Northern Ireland, not only for one particular section of that community. That is why we are not minded to accept the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. Neither he nor I can predict what the security situation will be throughout that period. Our horizons tend to be much shorter, for obvious reasons-the situation is extremely volatile, and has many dynamics built into it. We continually question and challenge the assessments to see whether they stand up to full examination.

<P>
My hon. Friend asserted that the retention of the full-time reserve will limit the ability to recruit an enlarged part-time reserve, but that is not so. There is no connection between the retention of the full-time reserve and the recruitment of an enlarged part-time reserve. The Government want a rapid change in the composition of the police service-for example, the 50:50 recruitment approach, which we shall debate shortly. As part of that process, we want an enlarged part-time reserve to be recruited as quickly as possible. One element is neither contingent on, nor a constraint on, the other.

<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke referred to accelerated turnover. I am uncertain of the precise figures in that respect. I shall consult my officials and advise the hon. Gentleman and other Committee members who raised the matter accordingly. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone hinted at one possibility, but who knows? We shall wait and see what the figures are.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I do not accept the suggestion of the hon. Member for Basingstoke, who said that the proposal would take positive discrimination too far, too soon. He should have that argument with my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. I said previously that the issue is threat-dependent.

<P>
I hope that Committee members understand why we drafted the Bill in this way: it is consistent with the direction, purpose and intention of Patten. It is the Government's intention to achieve the objective which the Chief Constable identified during a fundamental review of the full-time reserve. I hope that that will become a thing of the past at some point in the future, because that would suggest that the threat, in response to which the reserve was formed, no longer existed. A strong and measured approach is needed: the Chief Constable needs to assess the threat level and to make an operational assessment at a given time, and the Government should take full cognisance of that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Does the Minister agree with me-he would underpin his argument if he did so-that if we did not have the full-time reserve now and, so far as we can conceive, for a considerable period into the future, there would be a breakdown in the way in which policing in Northern Ireland is carried out? In the current circumstances, which I discussed earlier, there can be no immediate acceleration of the removal of the full-time reserve.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the importance of the full-time reserve. In terms of our horizons and the future, we foresee nothing that would encourage us to move rapidly into the arena that he described. However, this is a changing environment, and we cannot predict with certainty what the security climate will be three, six or nine months, or a year, down the road. If those who had previously signed up to paramilitarism or terrorism and the use of violence desisted, for whatever reason, from such practices in an obvious way-there are many ways in which they could do so-and if everything else was working well, a new climate would be created. That might not remove the threat of violence because there would still be dissident organisations out there, although we should not know whether they were as important as they are today.

<P>
We are in an uncertain environment, but our objective is consistent with Patten and the Chief Constable's fundamental review. I hope that the aims of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down can be achieved within the Bill's framework. That would help us to realise a society in Northern Ireland that is different from and better than that which has existed for the past 30 years or even longer.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I listened with great interest to the debate, especially to the contributions of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and the Minister, who explained the rationale that lies behind his approach.

<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made two main points: that the amendment is contradictory-I fail to see that-and that, even with his ``limited knowledge'', as he put it, of the internal workings of the RUC, the aim was not necessary or achievable. I refute both of those suggestions. His first point related to the on-going security situation. The amendment takes full account of that in new subsection (4), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may  extend the<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
four-year period
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>mentioned in subsection (3) if he is satisfied that there are compelling reasons related to the protection of public safety and public order.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That covers the principal argument made by both the hon. Gentleman and the Minister. The amendment would give the Secretary of State the power to amend the four-year period, so it would not jeopardise security in an unpredictable and unforeseen situation. That should allay the fears that have justifiably been expressed.

<P>
This is one area in which the Government are not being consistent with Patten. The only reference in the whole Patten report to ``disbandment'' is in relation to the full-time reserve. The Bill cannot be compatible with Patten if it does not refer to the permanent or other basis of the full-time reserve and does not provide a timetable. Surely, that is an essential factor. The Minister said that there is no relationship between the existence of the full-time reserve and recruitment to the part-time reserve. Surely there must be a ceiling of personnel, depending on the security situation. It is not logical to have an unnecessary part-time reserve when a full-time reserve exists. To say that disbandment of the full-time reserve, required specifically by Patten, can be achieved within a reasonable time by non-renewal of full-time contracts is pie in the sky.

<P>
We need a positive course of action. The amendment would provide a target of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>four years after the entry into force of this subsection<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but that is heavily qualified by the Secretary of State's ability to intervene if security and public safety demands require that it does not happen. That is reasonable. The third requirement is that the Secretary of State shall consult with the Chief Constable. I have heard no arguments this afternoon to refute the logic of translating the amendment into the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Let me try to explain our position. My hon. Friend has based his case on what Patten said about disbandment of the full-time reserve. That phrase is also used in relation to the fundamental review by the Chief Constable in paragraph 12.17 of the report. However, Patten did not say what my hon. Friend is saying-that in four years that disbandment should be total, subject to a mechanism by which it could be adjusted or modified. My hon. Friend has not been consistent with Patten, but has gone further. The difference between us is whose interpretation of what Patten wanted to be the way forward is best. Patten also recognised the threat-dependency of the future of policing in Northern Ireland; equally, he could not predict the nature of that. However, he proposed enough possibilities in the report, and they must be taken into account.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Is the Minister saying that the Patten recommendation regarding the disbandment of the full-time reserve should not have a perceptible timetable or target? If the Government are saying that they have in mind a target, and that they have an idea of when these events should take place-given the circumstances of security and public order-the Minister should share that opinion with the Committee. Such information does not appear in the Bill or in the implementation plan, and we know nothing of the Government's mind on the matter of the timescale.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have tried to explain that the time frame is indeterminate. It is difficult to make qualitative judgments on that issue, and I cannot read the minds of Patten and the other commissioners to find out why they left a degree of uncertainty surrounding the matter. If they were so certain-as has been argued by my hon. Friend-I would have expected the Bill to contain the provision that this measure should be taken within four years. However, it does not.

<P>
The Patten report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We recommend that the future police service should not include a Full Time Reserve.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and goes on to outline the basis on which the reserve could be phased out over a three-year period. However, no definitive time frame is included-wisely, because a much more difficult security environment pertained when Patten was drafting and presenting his report. If circumstances continue to improve, the objectives that Patten envisaged and that the amendment seeks-an early phasing-out-could be delivered. We must, however, base that judgment on the operational assessments of the Chief Constable and other security advisers.

<P>
I do not operate on a basis of suspicion on this matter; this is not a covert, or even overt, attempt to retain the full-time reserve. That is not the wish of the Chief Constable, as he made clear in his fundamental review. The driver behind this measure is the highest ranking officer in the police service, who envisages that desirable time when the full-time reserve is no longer required. No time frames are attached to that, but the desire and the objective are clearly there.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Is the Minister saying that the only way in which the full-time reserve is to be phased out is-to use his own words-through the non-renewal of contracts? Is that the only mechanism that will be used?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not know whether my hon. Friend is asking me to sack all the reserve officers, or to introduce a provision whereby we could simply dismiss them. Clause 45 makes provision for severance arrangements.

<P>
Earlier, I was unable to give figures on turnover-and I am not sure whether this will now answer the question raised by the hon. Member for Basingstoke-but the current strength of the full-time reserve is 2,650, which is 500 below strength. That represents the natural wastage in the process. The Chief Constable makes judgments all the time as to how his police force should be constituted. Some aspects of those judgments may relate to budgets, and I shall not enter into a debate on that. However, he must balance the resources allocated in terms of the best and most effective form of policing. The fact that the full-time reserve is 500 officers below strength is indicative of some qualitative change taking place within that body of constables.

<P>
I am not sure whether I shall be able to convince my hon. Friend the Member for South Down of our views. I have tried to explain the rationale behind the approach to this issue, and I ask him to reconsider his position. It is clear that the objective is the creation of a new type of police structure and a new body of police officers to serve the people of Northern Ireland. Patten envisaged that that would be a regular force, along with a reshaped, reformed part-time reserve of different dimensions.

<P>
New figures on the comparative strength of the full-time reserve over the years have suddenly come into my head, Mr. Malins. We have a system of osmosis, whereby my officials try to ensure that I put the relevant information on the record, so that they do not have to write any letters. In 1995, there were 3,100 officers in the full-time reserve; in 1997, the figure was 3,000; in 1998, there were 2,950. As of May this year, the figure was 2,650. So, there has been a reduction in numbers over that period, and there has been no recruitment to the full-time reserve in the past two years. It is not just a question of disbandment by non-renewal of contracts over three years; there is a natural wastage process.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Chief Constable faces some difficult decisions. Even though the police service in Northern Ireland is larger, by a factor of at least two, than that in any other part of the United Kingdom, hon. Members from Northern Ireland complain regularly to me that they never see a police officer, or that police officers do not respond to calls. However, even the 7,500 officers envisaged in the Patten report represent a police strength twice that to be found anywhere else in the United Kingdom.

<P>
Hon. Members also constantly ask me to discuss with the Chief Constable the reasons why the police are not in evidence as much as they would wish. The reason is that officers are tied up in heavy security duties, which prevent them from carrying out normal policing duties. At this time of the year, the public order activity undertaken by officers puts them right in the firing line. We need not go into the history of it, but the strain on police officers and their families during the marching season is especially onerous. We should all recognise that; I know that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down recognises it and wishes that it were otherwise. Such policing requirements are not dependent on the security threat, but are natural features of society in Northern Ireland. Public order considerations place heavy pressures on the police. Such considerations can be related to the security situation, but they may also focus on a particular parade or march or a dispute at an interface, which is not necessarily related exclusively to security matters.

<P>
The Chief Constable must take all such issues into account. I have a difference of opinion with my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. I have tried to set out my reasoning clearly, and I know that my hon. Friend does not suspect that there is some covert reason for our decision. Others, however, will suspect that we are attempting to keep this body of constables in place for evermore: that is not the Government's intention. If it were, the figures that I gave about the reduction in numbers would not apply, for we would have kept that group of constables up to strength.

<H4><center>Clause 36</center></H4>

<H4><center>Attestation of constables</center></H4>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 17, line 39, after ``individuals'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and their traditions and beliefs'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: amendment No. 9, in page 17, line 39, after ``individuals'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and their traditions and beliefs consistent with a free and democratic society governed by the rule of law'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Government amendment No. 250.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The clause deals with matters relating to the ``oath''. I shall use that word because it is the common parlance, but, strictly speaking, it is a declaration rather than an oath.

<P>
We have given considerable thought to how best to meet the requirements of Patten and we have listened to the various representations that were made. We believe that our amendments take account of Patten and the draft oath prepared by the Association of Chief Police Officers for the Home Secretary's review of the England and Wales attestation. We have chosen this wording because we did not want to bind constables to upholding individual traditions and beliefs that are disreputable, or that encompass illegal acts. For example, a paedophile might believe in child abuse, but it would be wrong to require a constable to respect that view. However, the concern was expressed that our wording does not reflect Patten's closely enough. We have re-examined it, and I hope that the revised version will meet with Committee members' approval. In a sense, it is a compromise between Patten and our desire to ensure that officers will not be required to accord respect to unlawful traditions and beliefs.

<P>
I contend that Government amendments Nos. 249 and 250 will ensure that officers will uphold the traditions and beliefs of all. However, amendment No. 250 will make it clear that they are under no such obligation where those traditions and beliefs are incompatible with the rule of law. I think that that meets the objectives of amendment No. 9.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I have no objection to the amendment, but given that a declaration must be made, why cannot we insert the phrase ``their lawful traditions and beliefs''? Given that it is the officer who will make the declaration, which is supposed to be of some significance, why do we need to add a later, qualifying subsection?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Again, we are benefiting from the hon. Gentleman's free legal advice. The way in which we draft such amendments is usually in line with advice received from parliamentary counsel. I am sure that close attention will be paid to what is said, but I doubt whether it will prove necessary to return to the matter. The hon. Gentleman says that he does not disagree with our intentions-he wants simply to apply the same principles through a different wording. However, our amendments will meet his requirements, although perhaps not in the precise terms he envisages.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 249 and 250 will meet the objectives set out in amendment No. 9, which is in the name of the hon. Member for South Down, his colleagues and friends.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I seek your guidance, Mr. Malins. We are considering Government amendments Nos. 249 and 250 and amendment No. 9. Will amendment No. 10 be considered separately?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes. When we have finished our consideration of this group of amendments, we shall have a separate debate on amendment No. 10.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> My party tabled amendment No. 9, which refers to the need to recognise ``traditions and beliefs''. Patten said that police officers should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>accord equal respect to all individuals and to their traditions and beliefs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was a crucial statement-Patten declined to ban persons who belonged to secret and sectarian organisations from membership of the police force. He did not make such a recommendation because, if he had, police officers would be required to make a declaration that would override all other allegiances, including those owed to a secret or sectarian organisation.

<P>
The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland also supported the use of the phrase ``traditions and beliefs'' because such a commitment that would help to promote the inclusive and neutral working environment of the police force. I listened to the Minister's comments on the Government amendments. There is sufficient compatibility to enable me to decide, graciously and, I hope, helpfully, not to press amendment No. 9.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Although I understand the Minister's intentions in this context, and I do not object to the principle of trying to reflect the Patten report by referring to ``traditions and beliefs'', I am, frankly, amazed by the convoluted way in which we have embarked on this process. The provisions-I hope that I shall be forgiven for saying this-are symbolic. We have discussed in detail the fact that the people who take up the office of police constable-I shall return to that matter when we consider amendment No. 10, which relates to the nature of the office-should make a ringing declaration that can be heard publicly, that he can inwardly digest, and that will be binding on his conscience. The idea is that that should show him what he is supposed to be doing.

<P>
The Patten commission said that that declaration should be capable of being embraced by the whole community. I have no dispute with that. The argument has been that the proposal is not sufficiently inclusive and that the declaration should refer to ``traditions and beliefs''. I have no difficulty with that either, although I fully understand why the Minister and his advisers were initially reluctant in this regard. They were anxious about the fact that some-paedophiles, for example-have traditions and beliefs that may be incompatible with the rule of law. There are currently many hon. Members, who sit mainly on the Government Benches in this Committee or on the Treasury Bench in the House, who want to criminalise the hunting fraternity and make their traditions and beliefs unlawful.

<P>
I return quickly to my argument, Mr. Malins. The only way to get round the problem-the only way to ensure that the declaration has any meaning-is to refer to the fact that a police officer's job is to uphold lawful traditions and beliefs. If there is to be some resonance when a police officer stands up and makes this declaration at the start of his career, such a commitment should jolly well be contained in the attestation. The alternative appears to be for the poor officer to stand up and make the declaration, after which the sergeant who is in charge of the attestation will ringingly say, ``Everyone should bear in mind that the phrase, `traditions and beliefs' does not include beliefs that are incompatible with the rule of law.'' I cannot think of anything more absurd. I hope that the Minister will go away and think about this again. The proposal makes a mockery of the process of attestation, caveats included. We can do better than this. The hon. Member for South Down may feel that the wording is innocuous, but it sounds like bureaucratic, gorgeously governmental gobbledegook. The use of simple English could make it perfectly clear and in conformity with Patten, and provide the inclusiveness that the Minister understandably wants.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): Like my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, I pay tribute to the Minister for listening to the points that were raised on Second Reading. I also pay tribute to the Committee on the Administration of Justice, which has provided many of us with helpful briefings. The core of the clause concerns a fundamental issue-not only of policing and jurisprudence, but of human rights, specifically, the rights of the individual. The CAJ picked up on precisely the point that the Minister raised about the rights of paedophiles. I like to think that it informed the Minister's response.

<P>
I too have wrestled with the wording. I think that the attestation will be administered by a justice of the peace, not by a police sergeant, although I am not sure whether that makes an enormous amount of difference. We are in the realm of the symbolic, which is partly why paragraph 15.15 of Patten specifically refers to the dichotomy between police officers attesting when they are already members of other oath-bound organisations. I think that this matter is beyond symbolism. I am in no way critical of the selection process, Mr. Malins, but it is a shame that amendment No. 10 has not been included in this group of amendments. They are linked, and would fall together easily.

<P>
As a signatory to amendment No. 9, I have been told that the reason why I put my name to it was to tease out the Government's reasoning, and then, obviously, to vote with them. As I said on Second Reading, these are matters of considerable concern. The points that we debate here will not resonate in a vacuum of intellectual purity and idealism-they will be discussed in the most heated circumstances possible. Far be it from me to imply that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) occupies a rarefied plane above the concerns of mere mortals, but the north of Ireland is a long way from Lincoln's Inn. When these matters are dealt with, as they must be, different prerogatives, priorities and precedents will apply.

<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that there is something clumsy about the attestation, but I can live with clumsy, or with awkward. I can even live with bad grammar, and what I consider to be two missing commas. What I cannot live with is the possibility that one of Patten's most fundamental prescriptions may be lost. The Government amendments address that, and the words are not as important as the principle.

<P>
The Government have responded to the amendment, to the Committee on the Administration of Justice and to many people who have raised the matter. I am therefore happy and confident to support them, although I wish that we could have discussed the matter in the context of amendment No. 10.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I oppose the addition of the words to the oath. The whole idea of the Patten commission is based on the fallacy that there are two warring communities in Northern Ireland-Protestants and Roman Catholics-each with their own different traditions and beliefs. In reality, life is not that simple. Many people in Northern Ireland are neither Roman Catholic nor Protestant, and there are others who belong to different communities.

<P>
The addition of the words in the amendment will be meaningless, because the constable will affirm that he will deal with everyone, giving equal respect to all individuals, so what difference do people's beliefs and traditions make? Similarly, how are a person's tradition and beliefs to be determined? If a policeman meets someone and discovers that he is breaking the law, how is he to determine, there and then, that person's tradition and beliefs? The whole idea is nonsense. It compounds one error with another, and should be removed. The remarks made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield have shown how ridiculous the amendments are, and I certainly oppose the inclusion of these words.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> This is one of the worst clauses in the Bill. One could describe it as supererogation. The idea that we should have an oath, as the Minister calls it, that emphasises the traditional differences within our community and asks our police force to do the same contradicts everything in which most of us believe.

<P>
If the oath had read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hereby do solemnly and sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of constable, with fairness, integrity, diligence and impartiality-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and then left out the middle section, concluding-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and that while I continue to hold the said office I will to the best of my skill and knowledge discharge all the duties thereof according to law-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I believe that it would have formed the basis for an ideal commitment from any police officer. However, we are asking police officers to make an assessment of people's traditions and beliefs. You may not realise this, Mr. Malins, but if one happens to have the name Maginnis in Northern Ireland, one is not immediately presumed to be a member of the Unionist or Protestant tradition. If one happened to have the name Grainne Maginnis, as does my daughter, one would certainly not be deemed a member of that tradition. I wonder how, in 15 or 20 years' time, someone is going to decide the tradition of two of my grandchildren-Naoise and Cillian Webster.

<P>
Ordinary people such as myself-I come from an ordinary background and grew up in an ordinary, mixed community-do not want a hotch-potch to be imposed on our police service that will perpetuate the differences that have created and added to the turmoil of the past 30 years or even longer. I ask the Minister to consider, between now and Report, what the clause is intended to do, if it is not to pander to the baser instincts of those on either side who want to perpetuate existing differences in our traditions. That is what the Minister must decide. He should not try to placate those who do not want to bring together society in Northern Ireland. Such people do not want a police service that can properly reflect society without tearing itself apart over the question of traditions.

<P>
When the Minister tries to pay lip service to Patten, he faces a dilemma, but he should deal with it now, because it denigrates those people from both traditions whom the Minister hopes to attract into the police service. The police service should cease to be aware of whether its members attend a Roman Catholic chapel or a Protestant church on a Sunday morning.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I anticipated this debate in relation to amendment No. 10, and no doubt we shall repeat certain points then. In a sense, I thought that the issue had been laid to rest before Patten, when the Scottish oath was adopted by the RUC under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. If I remember correctly, the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone argued against that oath, but the Government's wish prevailed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister is right, up to a point. I argued that changing the oath denigrated members of the police service. That oath was properly based on principles that the first and last sentences of the Minister's proposed oath would enshrine, and its core was the giving of fair and impartial treatment to individuals, according to law. My problem with the change that he made then was that it was unnecessary. This proposed change is less necessary and more harmful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not want to enter into an old debate on the 1998 Act. We tried to simplify matters by applying to Northern Ireland an oath that applied to a highly respected body of constables in Scotland. In a sense, we tried to appeal to the hon. Gentleman's Ulster Scots background. I failed to convince him then of the rightness of change that was taking place, and it is clear that he remains unconvinced by that oath.

<P>
Of course, the debate changed substantially after Patten's examination, and many representations were made about this very issue. Patten and his commissioners had to take various opinions into account and find a way through. Indeed, in respect of other issues-such as that raised by amendment No. 10-certain recommendations were made that the Government do not accept. A balanced judgment must be made: we realise that a reference to beliefs and traditions could be wrongly interpreted, so we have listened to the various representations and tried to reflect them in this part of the Bill.

<P>
Officers need not determine people's traditions and beliefs; they are simply asked to accord equal respect to the traditions and beliefs of all. The provision may seem clumsy, but it ensures that police officers have a useful and healthy approach. I could argue that any responsible police officer would act in that way at all times, but people want such matters to be stated in legislation and our amendments are based on an assessment of the best way of dealing with it.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I said in response to an earlier intervention from the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that people listen to our contributions and he may wish to table an amendment on Report. I am not encouraging that, because there will be enough to discuss, but if he wishes to do so, we shall take full account of his reasoning and if his wording is better, we shall accept it. However, we believe that the present wording is most appropriate.

<P>
We shall have another healthy debate on amendment No. 10, which is fundamental to the issue. I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down is not pressing his amendment No. 9 because Government amendments Nos. 249 and 250 cover it, so I ask the Committee to support our amendments.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) Every member of the police force already attested as a constable shall make the declaration in subsection (1).<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would require all existing and future police officers to subscribe to the concept of human rights. Contrary to Patten, the Bill exempts existing police officers from that requirement. That was criticised by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland which referred to the importance of the human rights declaration in creating an inclusive culture. It has also been criticised by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and other bodies such as the Committee on the Administration of Justice. Indeed, the matter is of concern to everyone in Northern Ireland who is interested in ensuring that we have a new beginning for policing and the creation of a human rights culture in a police force that has had problems in that respect.

<P>
It has been argued in debates elsewhere that serving officers have already made an attestation and cannot be required to made a second attestation. I cannot accept that argument, for there is little logic in it. There is nothing to prevent us from obliging serving officers to make a declaration without their having to re-attest. That is what the amendment is designed to accomplish. It empowers the Secretary of State to make provisions relating to officers who refuse to make the declaration. I assume that a police officer who refused to make a declaration to uphold human rights would have no part to play in the policing of Northern Ireland or any other country.

<P>
I would like the Minister to confirm some details. Will the Policing Board include a requirement to uphold fundamental human rights in the code of ethics? That would be a reasonable way forward. Is it the Government's intention that a refusal to uphold the code of ethics will be an offence under future disciplinary regulations? Finally, can the Minister confirm that officers-including those currently serving-will be required at least to sign an acknowledgement that they have read the human rights requirement and accept it? If the Minister's answers to those three questions are positive, we might reconsider our intention to press the amendment. At this stage, however, I will say that the amendment is appropriate if we are to create a police service based on a new concept of human rights.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As I said earlier, there is a fundamental issue at stake: what is a constable? A constable is a person who holds an office under the Crown, and there will be no change to that in Northern Ireland for as long, I suppose, as it remains part of the United Kingdom. There are lots of office holders in this country-judges or Queen's counsel, for instance-who must take an oath on taking up that office. The form of the oath or attestation is largely irrelevant, but it represents the point at which they assume office. As the hon. Member for South Down has acknowledged, police officers will not, suddenly, on the change from Royal Ulster Constabulary to the new Northern Ireland police service, lose their status as constables before being re-engaged. That is not the purpose of the Bill. Therefore, on what basis should they be required to make a new oath or attestation?

<P>
There is a certain delicious irony in all this, because, for the past 300 years, this country has set itself rather firmly against the notion of requiring people who do not wish to take oaths or attestations for the purpose of fulfilling a job to take such oaths and attestations. That was not always the case, as the hon. Gentleman will remember. In the 16th century, various people went to the gallows and were executed for refusing to take oaths. St. Thomas More refused to take an affirmative oath in respect of the royal supremacy and the divorce of King Henry VIII. There have been several other martyrs connected to this issue.

<P>
We in this country have developed the rather straightforward notion, which I greatly commend, that it is not our business to pry into the secrets of men's hearts, as long as they observe the law. When a man or woman is attested or takes the oath of a constable, they are expected to behave as a constable and to discharge their duties as a constable. It is not a matter that requires reaffirmation after the time that they were first subject to those duties.

<P>
I have no objection to the idea that, in future, constables who attest in Northern Ireland should make the form of attestation that we have discussed. That form has been described as cumbersome or purely symbolic, but if it will make people happier and is broadly acceptable, I have no difficulty with it. However, I have great difficulty with the idea of requiring people who hold an office and are busy going about it quietly and correctly suddenly to come forward and make new attestations. We could go on for ever like this. There could be no stopping. We could have new forms of attestation every year, according to what perceived political correctness at the time.

<P>
The proposal would set a very undesirable precedent, and there is an issue of principle involved that I cannot ignore. I do not see how one could require someone who had taken the necessary oath or attestation to fulfil an office and who was still in that office, discharging it competently and properly, to take a new oath in order to be allowed to continue in it. That would be pointless. Symbolism and practical, legal reality should not be made to jar, but the amendment would accomplish that. It contains the implication that those who have not been through the process to which the hon. Member for South Down wishes to subject existing constables are occupying an inferior or imperfect office. They are not; they hold an office under the Crown. That is how our constitutional system works, and they should not be required to make new oaths or affirmations.

<P>
I accept that there are sometimes grey areas. When I was in the Territorial Army, we seemed to be required to make an affirmation that we had no live rounds or empty cases in our possession every time we came off a live firing range. All sorts of other mantras are recited from time to time. However, when it comes to the question of holding office, people should not be required to make this kind of attestation twice, even if the second form is different from the one that they originally took.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> The hon. Member for Beaconsfield is, as ever, interesting. However, by raising the spectre of political correctness in this context, he both demeans the discussion that has taken place so far and dilutes his own argument to destruction.

<P>
The amendment is not about political correctness. In many ways, it deals with one of the most fundamental issues that we shall consider in Committee. I am sure that I do not need to remind hon. Members that Patten states in paragraph 4.7:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the importance of human rights as the very purpose of policing should be instilled in every officer from the start.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That point was made in connection with the oath. We could argue about whether Patten intended ``from the start'' to mean from the start of the term of service of a new officer, or, as I see it, from the start of new policing arrangements for Northern Ireland. I am personally convinced that Patten meant from the start of the first day of a new, inclusive police force in Northern Ireland.

<P>
If other oaths had not been taken, there would be no problem with the proposed form of attestation. It is essential that all serving officers of the police service, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, take that oath for no other reason than that we must finally get to grips with an issue that has engendered so much emotion that objectivity is almost impossible to achieve. However, I shall attempt to achieve some tonight. The issue that I am talking about is the widespread assumption that the Royal Ulster Constabulary is the Orange Order in uniform.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I accept that that is not so. In fact, one of the most telling statistics that I have read in any of my research resulted from an attempt by Aoghan Mulcahy to discover how many Orangemen served in the Royal Ulster Constabulary. He gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in November 1997 and the question is dealt with in an appendix. The importance of the question is, as hon. Members will not need to be reminded, that part of the Orange oath requires every member of the Orange Order to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>strenuously oppose the fatal errors and doctrines of the church of Rome.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When Aoghan Mulcahy tried to estimate the number of Orangemen in the RUC, the only way he could proceed was from the fact that since 1969, 39 of the officers killed on duty had been recognised as such by the Orange Order. They had been claimed at the time of their funerals. That is in some ways a tribute to the dedication and devotion of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and a commentary on the tragedy. That number of officers being claimed by the Orange Order produces a figure of about 13 per cent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I shall give way in a moment, to an hon. Member who I suspect knows more about the subject than I do. The figure of 13 per cent. implies that between 1,650 and 2,000 Orangemen are members of the RUC at present.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman define what he meant by using the word ``claimed'' as he did? The implication seemed to be that the Orange Order is like a paramilitary organisation and that if a member is killed he is claimed. The Orange Order is a perfectly lawful, legal organisation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I apologise sincerely if by the use of the word ``claimed'' I in any way implied a comparison with what happened in Long Kesh, when prisoners were claimed by one paramilitary group or another. I most certainly did not mean that. What I meant was that at those officers' funerals, the Orange Order was represented. Orangemen provided the guard of honour at the funeral and the men were acknowledged and proudly recognised as serving, attested members of the Orange lodge. I cannot believe that that would cause offence, and that was the basis of Aoghan Mulcahy's estimate, which I think is valid.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I am not aware that the Orange Order ever gives a guard of honour at anyone's funeral and I cannot recall any funeral of a Royal Ulster Constabulary man where such a thing happened.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman. In the interest of clarity perhaps I may quote from the document submitted to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, headed ``Composition, Recruitment and Training of the RUC''. On page 249, Aoghan Mulcahy stated that the Orange Order
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>acknowledges 39 of the officers killed since 1969 as having been its members.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The quotation that you have made clarifies the situation. The fact is that 39 of more than 300 murdered officers were members of the Orange institution. I am proud that they were.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> My point is that even if we accept the figure provided in the appendix, which is one of the lowest possible, between 1,600 and 2,000 men-presumably they are men, I do not suppose that there are many women-have sworn an oath in the Orange lodge that they will strenuously oppose what they call

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the fatal errors and doctrines of the church of Rome.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The significance of that fact in the context of amendment No. 10 is that many of those present may belong to organisations that could be described as sectarian, but without ever having sworn to oppose another faith. I belong to any number of Roman Catholic organisations, from the Knights of St. Columba to the Westminster Celtic supporters club, but I have never signed up to oppose any other group-except possibly Glasgow Rangers. The point is that the relevant officers in the RUC have sworn to oppose another group of people who constitute nearly 50 per cent. of the population.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that I have, sadly, probably been to more funerals of members of the RUC than anyone in this Room and that I have only ever been aware of guards of honour being provided by comrades of those people who gave their lives in the service of society and the fight against terrorism? In so far as that is the case, if the hon. Gentleman pursues his argument to its conclusion, he must accept what was obvious at those funerals-that, whatever the obligation on members to uphold their Protestant faith above all others, the men's primary loyalty in carrying out their duty was to their comrades in the police force. If the hon. Gentleman admits that, he must also admit that his argument is fallacious and dangerous.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I agree with many of the hon. Gentleman's points, but I do not think that my argument is fallacious or dangerous. People can be members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary as well as belonging to the Apprentice Boys, the Royal Black Preceptory or the Freemasons. The problem arises when the core of membership involves swearing an oath to oppose the fundamental beliefs of nearly 50 per cent. of the population of the six counties that they are supposed to protect. Opposition is the key word. How on earth, in the context of human rights, can you possibly talk about egalitarian policing when you have sworn an oath to oppose the thing by which you define nearly 50 per cent. of the country's population?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am not a member of the Orange Order, but there is a flaw and a misrepresentation in what the hon. Gentleman says. There is no obligation on any member of the Orange Order, to my best knowledge, to oppose Roman Catholicism, except within the way members live their Christian lives. They are under an obligation to eschew those things that are deemed in their religion to be flawed. That is entirely different from bearing antagonism to members of other religions. I think that you exaggerate your case in a fallacious and dangerous way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pound rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Occasionally hon. Members-I do not wish to refer to a particular individual-occasionally slip into the habit of using the word ``you'', thereby referring to the Chair. It would be helpful if they did not do that unless they meant to refer to the Chair.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I understand what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is trying to do and I respect him for his skill and expertise. However, I must tell him that it will not wash. We are not talking about a theological argument; nor are we having a discussion at the end of the shift about transubstantiation. We are considering an oath sworn by people to oppose strenuously what they describe as the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>fatal errors and doctrines of the Church of Rome.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is grossly insulting and demeaning to Roman Catholics. You cannot be objective about any statement that says that someone is opposed to you.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Again, the hon. Gentleman inadvertently refers to the Chair. Would he please try not to?

<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I apologise sincerely, Mr. Malins. We could continue the debate but, although it might be of interest to one or two people, we might lose some of our audience if we continued.

<P>
I do not accept or contend, and would not support anybody who did contend, that the Royal Ulster Constabulary is the Orange Order in uniform. That is simply not true, although some might say that. Some might say that the RUC cannot be called on or trusted because it is not their police force. It is important that all serving officers attest to the new oath so that that ghost will be laid to rest and the problem will be solved. We could then say that there were not two categories of people in the police service-the new ones who recognised civil rights and the old ones who might not. In the darkness and in the absence of proof and knowledge, that would give room in which the fantasies and fears of malicious or mendacious people could flourish.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I do not want to revive the argument, but I must say, first, that I am not a member of an Orange Lodge. The hon. Gentleman might already have guessed that that was likely to be the case. Secondly, I appreciate that there might be arguments about people being worried about organisations. However, the bit of the oath that he read out cannot be faulted. On that basis, a bishop of the Church of England who subscribed to the 39 articles would be ineligible for service and would be required to take further oaths and attestations. He gave the words meanings that, on their face, they do not have.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> In my limited experience of policing in the north of Ireland, I have not seen many bishops in uniform or many who were especially anxious to join up. However, I understand that congregations are falling and alternative methods of employment might be under consideration. Some of the sisters who taught me would have been far too hard for any police force that I have come across.

<P>
If there is a small group of malicious or mendacious people, and I entirely accept that the majority of people are neither, we must consider whether that group will be used as a hook on which to hang mendacity and prejudice. At the cost of simply requiring all serving and new officers to attest, we can address and solve the issue. I repeat: this is not an abstract theological discussion. The words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>strenuously oppose the fatal errors<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are not open to misinterpretation. Those words are chillingly straight in their substance and mean precisely what they say. They cannot be bent; they are words of steel and we know exactly what they mean.

<P>
I bring to an end what has been an unintentionally discursive contribution, for which I apologise to members of the Committee, by supporting the amendment in the name of myself and other hon. Members and the statements made by the hon. Member for South Down.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I gently remind the Committee to keep remarks in the confines of the amendment. We are not having a general debate on the Orange Order. I am sure that hon. Members are aware of the importance of keeping in order.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Until I heard the contribution of the hon. Member for Ealing North (Mr. Pound), I had not intended to speak on the amendments, but I am afraid that I have been tempted to do so by the partisan way in which he presented his case, which was aimed specifically at the Orange Order.

<P>
I have already said that I probably know more policemen and have been to the funerals of more policemen that anyone else in the Room. The one thing that I have heard neither in private conversation nor in barrack room banter is any allusion to the Orange Order or to any of the loyal institutions. I tell the hon. Gentleman from my experience that the subject does not predominate in the thoughts of a significant number of policemen.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman supports the idea that policemen who have served and who have taken the oath will uphold the law. The law embraces human rights. It does not have to state that it embraces human rights-the law is the law. If we could remember that during the debate, we would not get into such detail which is misleading and leads to bad feeling.

<P>
I repeat: I am not a member of the Orange Order. However, I am offended by the idea that members of the Order, many of whom are my friends, including members of the police, will participate in an inquisition because of their membership. That is not the case. It is grossly insulting even to suggest that honourable men and women who have taken the oath and attested that they would uphold the law should be asked to parade and to make a new attestation.

<P>
Let me pose a question. An oath taken in respect of an organisation might conflict with the oath to be taken as a constable. If a person is prepared to take the latter oath, whether in the new form or in an amended form of the old oath, what counts as trust, honesty and integrity? Where does one make the judgment? The reality is that we live our lives to some extent in segments. We give allegiance to this, that and the other organisation, whether a rugby club, a loyal institution or another body. For each and every one of us, whether we are constables or not, the important thing is that our overall approach to life and to the community that we serve demonstrates full integrity. If the hon. Member for South Down is endeavouring to create a conflicting oath, he dismisses that concept of integrity. The greater number of people, thank God, are people of integrity who try to do what is right not because of an oath but because of their conscience and their responsibility to society.

<P>
I hope that no one will be tempted to press the amendment. I hope for a degree of appreciation and understanding that the ordinary men and women who serve in the police have dedicated themselves to society. I hope to hear no further talk of it-unless of course it is meant to demonstrate something else. Perhaps it is intended to humiliate those who have served because of tradition, or to demonstrate the cut-off and that what used to be policing will no longer be policing. If I am right, those hon. Members who support the amendment should state their intention clearly. We can then dispense with the debate about the Orange Order and so on, and talk instead about what the amendment really seeks to achieve.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Temple-Morris </B>(Leominster): I could sympathise with the amendment in a perfect world, but it is not a perfect world. I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North. He and I place the same emphasis on these mattters and have done so for many years. It is not a perfect world but a world of directed change. I said earlier, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter), that we do not want to get dug in at any stage of the debate, but it has begun to creep in on this exchange. With respect, my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North was entrenching. To use a word that he loves, it would be surplusage to bring the Orange Order into the debate; we have quite enough difficulty already.

<P>
Gradual directed change means that elements of what is now the RUC will be needed in the police service for Northern Ireland, whatever it is eventually called. If that change is to be successful-it will take several years-more people will take the attestation, but to ask officers of many years standing to attest with new constables in the manner described will not help. Indeed, if Northern Ireland gets into an anti-Orange Order spirit, particularly at this time of year, large elements of a force that we very much need there might refuse to attest, and that could lead to the failure of what we all want to achieve.

<P>
Disbandment is a sensitive matter. There is no disbandment here. The best way to emphasise that to the RUC, which will inevitably have to change its name, is that it does not have to take this attestation. We have to decide many delicate matters, but the amendment does not help.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I oppose the amendment because I know that many serving members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary were deeply annoyed when it was suggested that they would have to take a new oath. The implication of a new oath is that, in some way, they did not keep to the original oath. That is the feeling of many members of the RUC. I have listened to the hon. Member for Ealing, North, who has now left the Room. He took a little part of the oath of the Orange Order, but he did not dwell on the many other issues.

<P>
Human rights will soon be the law of the land. Members of the RUC have taken an oath to maintain the law, so the oath automatically covers human rights. I believe that the amendment should be rejected.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I do not want to add to the inevitable tensions that have been growing in the Committee. Much as I respect and admire and am entertained by the hon. Member for Ealing, North, it was a parliamentary discourtesy to leave the Room while his remarks were still warm and were open to comment by the hon. Member for West Tyrone.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but as he knows it is not a point of order for the Chair.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We have had a passionate debate because it is a passionate subject. I would like to sum up as my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster did, because he got the balance right. Unfortunately, I have to deal with the detailed arguments that have been advanced and explain what the Government propose.

<P>
This is one of the most vexed issues that we have had to deal with, primarily because of Patten's recommendation but also because of the strong views expressed, and most strongly articulated by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North, who has returned to the Room.

<P>
We are dealing with a broad spectrum of strongly held views, and we need to strike a balance. In Northern Ireland, there is a visceral hatred of the RUC. Many people want to see it disbanded. That may be a minority view, but the spectrum goes from that extreme, through those who make knee-jerk criticism of everything done by the RUC, to those engaged in a constructive debate who say that a heavy body of opinion is suspicious or critical of the RUC. I think that Patten tried to take that dimension into account in order to recognise that reality.

<P>
On the other side of the debate are those who will hear no criticism of the RUC. I am not saying that that idea was advanced by the Committee, but some people will hear no criticism whatever of the RUC. They believe that everything that the RUC does is correct and proper and that no one should call its actions into question. That is equally wrong, because there is no such thing as a perfect police force. Mistakes must have been made and lessons will have been learned. However, the RUC is one of the most respected police forces anywhere in the world, as it has to tackle one of the most difficult environments.

<P>
RUC officers carry out their duties with the highest integrity and pay the greatest respect to all citizens, irrespective of their opinions, background or ideology. That assessment was not made by me as the Minister responsible for policing in Northern Ireland, nor by anyone who could be deemed to be partial. Senior police officers in the United States speak highly of the RUC and the way in which it carries out its duties.

<P>
I do not want to spend too long justifying the point, but it was brought home most forcefully to me when I visited the RUC officers who are serving in Kosovo as part of the UK contribution to the UN policing force in Kosovo. The RUC was the only body of police officers from the UK who could meet the requirements needed to deal with those difficult interfaces-the ethnic differences and deep divisions that exist in that troubled country. Every other officer to whom I spoke-they were from every part of the world-said, ``Send us more RUC officers.'' I hope that those who criticise the RUC will bear that in mind. America, Denmark and many other countries held those RUC officers in the highest regard. They did not see them as carrying prejudice in their hearts or heads, but as highly trained and professional officers who were prepared to risk their lives in defence of others. That is manifested in all the jobs that the officers do in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I ask those who seek a different approach to the attestation to put themselves into the minds of RUC officers and think about how what they ask would impact on them. RUC officers know that they are held in high regard, and they hold themselves in high regard, because they know what they have contributed to efforts to maintain peace and develop a peaceful environment in Northern Ireland against difficult odds. When they hear such criticisms, they must ask, ``Why are people saying that about us? Why do they want us to attest again? We uphold those principles.'' That is what will go through officers' minds as they go into the marching season over the coming weeks. The way in which they approach their duties on the front line will not be unbalanced, no matter where that line may be.

<P>
The new oath evolved because Patten's report reflected the body of opinion that there was a need to deal with the subject. We debated some of the background in our previous sitting. We do not believe that it is appropriate for existing officers already attested as constables to be required to take a new oath that embodies attestation as a constable. That is our starting position as a Government, and I shall set out some of the reasons and background to it. We believe that, in their minds and in the Government's assessment, to require officers to do that would be perceived as disbandment of the RUC. Patten said that that should not happen.
 
<P>
I intend to introduce an amendment that will tackle some of the concerns that have been raised, because we must ensure that serving officers carry out their functions consistently with the terms of the declaration. There is nothing wrong with that; it does not stand against the principles that I propose. The Government fully endorse the prominence given by Patten to a human rights-based approach to policing in Northern Ireland. The Bill puts human rights to the fore.

<P>
Clause 48 provides a code of ethics to instil the European convention on human rights into police practice, which will be a major step forward. I imagine that it will incorporate the same values and similar commitments to upholding and respecting human rights as are contained in the new oath. All police officers must have regard to those commitments under clause 30(4).

<P>
The hon. Member for South Down asked three questions, which were whether the Policing Board would include a requirement in the code of ethics, whether the Government intended to make a breach of the code of ethics a disciplinary offence, and whether officers would be required to sign a declaration that they had read and understood the code of ethics. The Policing Board will approve and issue the code of ethics, and will determine and agree the contents of the code. The Government intend to reflect the code of ethics so far as is practicable in police discipline and conduct regulations. However, the more tightly and practically drafted the code is, the easier it will be to reflect that in regulations. Officers will be obliged to sign a statement confirming that they have read and understood the code of ethics. There is nothing unusual about that. Other police services-not necessarily in the UK, but elsewhere-apply similar codes of practice. Such an approach can apply where there is a dispute and where a body of opinion in the wider community is suspicious, unsupportive or critical of the police service. Some hon. Members may think it wrong that that view should prevail, but it does, and the Government must take it into account and tackle it, as we are trying to do.

<P>
I was tempted to enter into a theological debate with my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North. He said that he has a particular religious view; I do not. I do not claim that that makes me neutral, but I hold neither to his philosophy nor to the counter-philosophy. I listen with great interest when people of religious beliefs toss arguments around with great passion, condemning each other. I wonder where it all comes from. People have the right-which I will defend to my death-to hold their religious views but they should then respect everyone else's right to hold other religious views. The interpretation of the phrases that he expressed lies, one might say, in the eye of the beholder. He is entitled to his conclusions but I ask him whether he has ever considered for a moment that he may be wrong.

<P>
Is it right to damn all members of the Orange Order, for example, by putting them all into a particular group by saying that they all have the same attitude and march to the same discipline? They do not; they are made up of ordinary human beings-ordinary working-class and middle-class men and women, professionals, artisans and the unemployed-and they constitute about 60,000 people, which is a sizeable proportion of the community in Northern Ireland. Their views may not be accepted by everyone, but it behoves everyone who is a democrat to try to understand their motivation, background, history and traditions. Hon. Members must have the right to argue against points of view, but they should equally respect others' points of view.

<P>
My hon. Friend for Ealing, North gave the background to evidence on the number of Orange Order members in the RUC gathered by the Select Committee. Patten also carried out research on the issue and found some reassuring evidence, which is set out in paragraph 15.14 of his report. In the cultural audit of the RUC, fewer than 1 per cent. of officers said that they were members of the Orange Order. Patten's conclusion was instructive; he said that, of the large sample of 6,267 officers who responded to the survey,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it would appear that the number of Orange Order members in the police service is small.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that lays to rest many of the arguments about the connection between the RUC and the Orange Order. I do not know whether there are any members in the RUC of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Opus Dei or any other religious grouping adhering to a strict code of religious views and principles; I doubt that there are many, but maybe, in the name of balance, the question should also have been asked.

<P>
In an attempt to tone down the passion, I shall not take on the many arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the member for Ealing, North; we will, no doubt, discuss the issues elsewhere.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It occurs to me that, from the figures given by the Minister, the Orange Order is totally under-represented in the RUC. I wonder whether the Minister will introduce special measures to ensure that a proper representation of the order is able to enlist in the new Northern Ireland police service.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his contribution; I do not know whether it was helpful or unhelpful, so I will call it a contribution and leave it sticking to the wall. I suppose that the answer is ``No''-I have no intention of doing so, and it would take a lot of argument to convince me to consider the matter, let alone to move forward on it.

<P>
I will deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North about the human rights issue. It is important for us all to understand the intention behind the measure. The Government have taken several steps to instil human rights. The code of ethics will be based on the ECHR and the training and development strategy will include human rights training. The wording of the declaration or attestation that is in the Bill also alludes to that issue. In addition, the Government's implementation plan sets out that the RUC will have a new human rights lawyer and that there will be reviews of the appraisal system in the light of Patten's human rights recommendations. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill, when enacted, will give effect to Patten's recommendations 39 to 41 that policing be compatible with the ECHR.

<P>
We have taken on board all the arguments and brought a balance to the treatment of the matter. I have tried to define the broad spectrum that exists. The Government, in taking such action, have accommodated strongly held views as far as they can. More importantly, they have responded to the large body of respectable opinion from both traditions in Northern Ireland-those people who want to see a different approach being taken. On that basis, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down does not ask the Committee to support his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the Minister for his reply. I do not want to delay the Committee further, but I should say that I have been astounded by some of the avenues that we have explored during the debate. I should tell the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that the purpose of the amendment was to centralise the importance of human rights in the new policing service. He may not understand-I do not want to put it more bluntly than that-that human rights is an important issue in Northern Ireland, and there is no reason why the police should be divorced from it. Whether we like it or not, the RUC has a history of human rights infringement, which may be exaggerated. However, that is the reality of the perception or, perhaps, the perception of the reality. The amendment would enable existing police officers to subscribe to a fundamental human rights requirement and avoid creating two sets of members in the new police service. Newly recruited officers will formally subscribe to an attestation of human rights while the existing members will sign a declaration of understanding, not a new attestation. Again, with reference to the comments made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, I must say that the proposal is not a trivialisation of human rights or an attempt at political correctness; it represents a genuine issue in Northern Ireland that must be addressed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I never suggested that the proposal was a trivialisation. I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve, the reasons behind it and the importance of human rights in Northern Ireland. However, for the reasons that I gave, I think that it is wrong to require serving constables who have taken the previous attestation or oath to take a new one.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he had no objection to future members making such a declaration, so why is he opposed to existing members doing so? There is no difference.

<P>
I was somewhat surprised by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, who implied that I was trying to establish a conflicting oath. His argument did not follow, and in fact I was trying to do the opposite, by making the attestation universal to existing and future officers.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Given the descriptions that the Minister gave in response to the three questions that I posed to him and his undertaking to table an amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I apologise to you and the Committee for being absent from the Committee Room for the first moment of the Minister's response. I was handing my notes to a member of Hansard staff and I meant no disrespect.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point for the Chair, but I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for what he said. I know full well that it is often important for hon. Members to pop out for a moment or two.

<P>
Clause 36, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clauses 37 to 40 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 41</center></H4>

<H4><center>Contracting-out of certain recruitment functions of Chief Constable</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit Öpik (Montgomeryshire):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 244, in page 19, line 19, after ``Constable'', insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We have now reached what I hope is the slightly less contentious issue of recruitment arrangements. Subsection (2) lists the organisations and individuals whom the Secretary of State must consult before making regulations on recruiting people for the police service under subsection (1). The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland is missing from the list. The amendment would simply add that.

<P>
Given the enormous importance of effective outreach measures and a proactive recruitment strategy to attract those from under-represented groups, the regulations should be matter for wider debate. The commission is the best body to ensure that the strategies provide proper equality of access to the police, because that was part of the commission's original purpose. I hope that the Government will see the common sense of the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was hoping for a heated debate so that I could say at the end that I had always been prepared to accept the amendment. I do not need to set out the justification for that, as the amendment's objectives are clear. I ask the Committee to accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I feel wobbly again. I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 41, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 42</center></H4>
<H4><center>Recruitment arrangements</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 20, leave out lines 20 to 33.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 237, in page 20, line 20, leave out subsection (3).

<P>
No. 238, in page 20, line 24, leave out subsection (4).

<P>
No. 239, in page 20, line 28, leave out subsection (5).

<P>
No. 11, in page 20, line 30, leave out ``10'' and insert ``2''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I am sure that this will pass through in the same smooth way as the previous amendments, but it may not. I always feel bad about making contentious points, but I will overcome my shyness on the matter. Amendment No. 86, together with amendment No. 88-which we shall come to later-and new clauses 6 and 7 all relate to the central issue of quotas. With your leave, Mr. Malins, I shall read out the new clauses because they are central to my point. New clause 6 seeks to insert the words:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) The Board shall establish targets for the recruitment to the police of Roman Catholics, women and ethnic minorities and other persons from under-represented sections of society.

<P>
(2) The Board shall monitor applications and recruitment to the police to ensure equality of access.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
New clause 7 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Chief Constable or any person appointed under the terms of section 41(1) shall pursue an active programme of affirmative action to target the recruitment of persons from under-represented sections of society.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I read those out, having previously checked with you, Mr. Malins, that I may do so because the points that we are making under clauses 43 and 44 all relate to quotas.

<P>
We recognise and fully support the need to make the police service more representative of the Northern Ireland population, especially in relation to Roman Catholic recruitment. However, the imbalance in the proportion of Roman Catholics applying for work in the police will not be fixed by demanding that an equal number be recruited from the qualified pool of candidates. Quotas are essentially a public policy tool for tackling discrimination at the point of selection, rather than the underlying problems of under-representation within the pool of applicants. I stress the distinction between recruitment and application.

<P>
In essence, trying to equalise at the recruitment end of the process is trying to cure the symptoms, and in our judgment, one has to tackle the underlying cause of the problem, which occurs at the point of application. The solution, therefore, lies in the community's attitude towards the police and that cannot be handled by using quotas at the stage envisaged by the Government. Use of quotas at that point misses the fundamental issue of why there is so little Catholic representation in the RUC. It is not because Catholics have not been accepted into the force or because they have been treated unfairly within the recruitment process once they have sought to apply. Rather it is because they have not had sufficient confidence in the police force to apply in the first place.

<P>
It is important to ensure that the police are seen to be fair and impartial. That has not been the case in the past and consequently some members of the community have not had enough trust in the police to consider it as a choice of career.

<P>
Of all the debates that we have had, this is the core inaccuracy in the way in which the Government are seeking to re-balance membership of the police service. Among those aged 18 to 30 in Northern Ireland, which is probably the predominant source of new recruits, there is already a balance between Protestants and Catholics. The figures are roughly 45 per cent. Catholic and 44 per cent. Protestant. If reform works, the natural rate of recruitment should be balanced. If there is a natural rate of applications and if I am right in my assessment that the recruitment process within the RUC has not unfairly discriminated against those Catholics who have sought to apply, we do not need a quota at the other end. Quotas will be unnecessary and will serve little more than a cosmetic purpose, perhaps as a psychological guarantee of fair treatment at first sight.

<P>
The problem is that if Catholics make up more than 50 per cent. of the pool, 50 per cent. of Protestants and others still have to be employed and the police will have to turn down Catholic recruits. That is a ham-fisted way of trying to re-balance the force.

<P>
The Minister may reply that those quotas can be changed as we move forward, but why create a system that needs constant correction? We could instead build into the Bill a process that ensured that the Catholic population applied in reasonable proportions. If the Catholic population does not apply to the police service for whatever reason, the use of quotas will not overcome that underlying problem. It is essential to get the legislation right at this stage to ensure that people from all sections of the community have sufficient confidence in the new reformed police service, which is open and accountable, to see it as a viable career option.

<P>
It would be more beneficial to initiate a strong programme of affirmative action to encourage more Catholics to apply to the police. That is more difficult, because Catholic community leaders must formally support the police service as a career option. There are other under-represented groups, such as ethnic minorities and women, and the same applies. New recruits from the pool of qualified candidates should be monitored to ensure equity in recruitment opportunities. That is the core issue.

<P>
A huge amount could be said about the system of quotas, but I will keep my remarks short-I do not want to take up undue time. I fear that we may want to return to the issue on Report, unless the Minister sees the light now and accepts our amendments.

<P>
I will deal with the potential consequences of recruitment quotas and the legality of the process. The service might have to scratch around for recruits, because of the 50:50 quota. It might have to recruit Catholics, or people who define themselves as such, who have not achieved the current recruitment criteria. That goes against what the Secretary of State has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I attach particular importance to Patten's recommendations for action to transform the composition of the police service. They are essential to gaining widespread acceptability. I endorse the proposal for 50:50 recruitment of Protestants and Catholics, from a pool of candidates, all of whom-I stress this-will have qualified on merit.-[Official Report, 19 January 2000; Vol. 342, c. 847.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The problem is that a sufficiently large pool of Catholics who have qualified on merit cannot be guaranteed, unless the underlying issue of the percentage of Catholics who apply in the first place is tackled. Therefore the recruitment quota is a hostage to fortune. The target should be to get people to apply. The Secretary of State's aim is undeliverable, if we do not solve the problem of the percentage of applicants from the Catholic community.

<P>
The Bill proposes amending current fair employment legislation to make room for quotas, which will set a dangerous precedent. In fact, I have asked whether such legislation is even permissible under European law. Patten admits that the use of quotas for gender is illegal. In chapter 15.11 of his report, he says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have consulted the Fair Employment Commission about the proposal above and we have taken an opinion from counsel on the legal position. We are advised that, although the proposal would require an amendment to domestic legislation, it is not incompatible with European legislation, so it is possible to make the requisite amendment to the law. Regrettably, the legal position is not the same in respect of recruitment of women, where European legislation clearly rules out such a proposal.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That means that the proposal would be regarded as discriminatory if it were imposed on the gender balance of the police force. By natural justice, the same must apply in relation to religious discrimination. The only reason that the proposal has not been applied to date is that the Commission has not got round to doing so. However, it plans to introduce such legislation. Article 13 of the Amsterdam treaty states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty and within the limits of the powers conferred by it upon the Community, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That, coupled with other directives, shows that by about 2002, discrimination of the sort necessitated by this part of the Bill could be outlawed. That is a serious matter.

<P>
I mentioned some human rights aspects of the measure; another, which is even more important, is that the Government concede the point that to solve one injustice, the Bill will introduce another. The Irish News on 15 June reported that the Secretary of State said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am implementing Patten's 50:50 recruitment scheme despite the fact that it will mean changing the law and persuading our European partners that this is a special case of reverse discrimination.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In Committee, on 20 June, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are aware that a draft directive on employment is being considered. The United Kingdom Government are seeking an exception in negotiations with our European Union partners, which would enable a 50:50 recruitment programme to achieve a police service representative of the community in Northern Ireland.-[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 20 June 2000; c. 86.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Once again, the Minister accepted that an exception is needed, which in itself concentrates the Government's position at the Lisbon European Council on 23-24 March 2000. The joint London-Dublin statement, which is official Government policy, stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we look for agreement at Lisbon that Member States should  combat all discrimination and make early progress on the Commission's Article 13 anti-discrimination proposal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The central tenet of my argument is that it is wrong to introduce one form of discrimination to resolve another. No one disagrees that the police service needs rebalancing, but to do so by introducing another injustice is as counter-productive as doing nothing.

<P>
The cause of the problem is nationalist and republican reluctance even to apply for a career in the police service, but that is also the solution. The problem can be solved not by looking at the recruitment end of the process, but at applications. Equal numbers applying probably means equal numbers recruited, without the need to drop the requirement for candidates of a certain quality. We should ask what must be done to increase the number of applications from Catholic communities. The solution may be far more difficult to implement than positive discrimination, because it will involve building trust in the community with the support of community leaders and the general public, but it will also be more lasting and it will not create resentment in either community. The Bill will have to be fit for the job and we are making good progress in that and other respects. I praise the Ministers, not least for having accepted two of my amendments in one day.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lewisham, West): What do we get in return?

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> What they get in return is the advice that I am giving now, at no extra cost.

<P>
Whatever else we do, we should not monkey around with human rights in a Bill that seeks to uphold them in Northern Ireland in a new and positive way. Rebalancing must be based on merit, not expedience. We oppose quotas; that is the reason for the amendment, and for others that tackle the same issue. The Bill is generally on the right track and it would be disappointing to take a short cut into the long grass of discrimination that the Bill tries so hard to eliminate.

<P>
This is not a theoretical debate because the proposal will have practical consequences; it has not been framed with evil intent but it mixes two important principles and uses one injustice to cure another. That cannot be right in a Bill of such importance.
