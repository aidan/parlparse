<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 637, in page 69, line 30, after `conclude', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`following arbitration under section 50,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. I am sorry to have interrupted my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) as he was getting into full flow, but during a spirited exchange while your esteemed colleague was in the Chair, the Minister for the Environment asked me if I would put together some examples of interference by some of the wretched organisations that meddle in the countryside and the environment generally. I draw to the Committee's attention, since I have been asked for this, the refusal by the Environment Agency to allow a Dunkirk veterans memorial at Teddington lock to contain any reference to the word ``victory'', on the ground that it might be offensive to foreigners. That has led to a grovelling apology in The Times today from the chairman of the agency, for offence caused by the intervention. My point is that the right hon. Gentleman would not accept what I said. However, while I am sure that the chairman of the Environment Agency is as repelled as we all are by some of his officials' behaviour, the petty interference that I described clearly occurs and would not be known to the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is, I am sure, important, and I was not present during the heated exchanges, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that it is hardly a point of order. It is a point of information and one would expect it, having been transmitted to the Minister, to be fully taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I was about to remark, Mr. Stevenson, in wishing you and the Committee good morning, that the initial letters of the greeting are GM—something that is no doubt on the Minister's mind now. However, I am glad that he has found time to join us this morning. I hope that he does not escape—but we shall try to pin him down.
<P>
By coincidence, the point of order raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) has a tangential link to amendment No. 637. Under the schedule, the new section 28I(2) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 would provide that English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may not serve a management notice unless they are satisfied that they are unable to conclude, on terms appearing to them to be reasonable, an agreement with the owner or occupier as to the management of the land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>appearing to them to be reasonable<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
gives me and many observers cause for concern at the possibility that English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales might be tempted to offer agreements with derisory levels of payment, on the basis that those seemed reasonable to them at the time. The most obvious occasion for that might be that one of the organisations had run out of funds. We know that various figures have been bandied about with respect to costs, but there is widespread concern about whether the bodies will have enough money to achieve all that is required of them. The scenario that I have outlined is realistic, so we have tabled amendment No. 637, which would provide for arbitration at the request of an owner or occupier who did not think that the terms offered were reasonable.
<P>
Why has the phrase been included in the provision, if not to save money? According to our research, such wording is unprecedented in legislation covering management agreements. It does not appear in section 15 of the Countryside Act 1968, which is the basis of all SSSI management agreements in the past 32 years; in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949; in the Environmental Protection Act 1995, which contains the enabling powers for agri-environment scheme agreements; or in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which contains the enabling powers for local authorities to enter into agreements with owners for conservation purposes.
<P>
The absence of such wording in any other legislation causes me to wonder why the Minister has added the phrase to the Bill. It is unprecedented to insert a condition that management agreements must be made on terms that the offering body considers reasonable. It will create a suspicion that English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales are trying to get away with conservation on the cheap. The suspicion may be unjustified, but if we are looking for genuine consensus and genuine agreement, we do not want to cause such suspicions.
<P>
As it stands, the clause will undermine the trust and positive partnership we want to foster between the agencies and owners and occupiers of SSSIs. We propose arbitration. Section 50 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 provides for arbitration over management agreements at the request of the person being offered the agreement. It is essential that that provision should apply in the case of any management agreements under the Bill. Owners and occupiers can expect to be fairly rewarded for the work they carry out on behalf of the public in maintaining SSSIs. We should ensure that trust exists between the agencies and the owners and occupiers.
<P>
I refer to the point of order from my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex. If we are honest, there are unreasonable people in every walk of life and there will be unreasonable owners and occupiers, but there may also be unreasonable officials. If the question of what is reasonable is left to the judgment of an official alone, we will only be creating difficulties for ourselves. I hope that the Minister will accept our intention, which is to remove a potential thorn in the Bill and to ensure that agreements are genuine rather than imposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I support the amendment. It is reasonable and would strengthen the Bill. Any agreement necessitates an offer by one party and an acceptance by another, both being at arm's length, and both adopting the well-known European principle of equality of arms. If there is no mechanism in place by which the sum involved can be considered by an independent body, a purported agreement will in fact be a unilateral imposition, not a true agreement between two sides.
<P>
For the Bill to work, we need both partnership and balance. Without the amendment, there will be a glaring omission. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is unprecedented not to have a longstop to judge whether one side or the other is being reasonable and whether the agreement is accepted by both sides as fair. If it is not, that bodes badly for the future. People could say that the agreement was forced on them out of the blue and that they will not, therefore, observe the rules. They might not have been able to argue their case reasonably.
<P>
Nowadays, the bottom line for agencies is their budgets. Many will be tempted to offer as little as possible. They will be under budgetary pressure and will be encouraged to run their departments as a business. They will want to cut down on overheads and, I suspect, offer only a small amount, knowing that it has to be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I support exactly the sentiment expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. I want the Government to consider carefully what he and the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) said about reasonableness. I have spoken to the Minister outside the Committee and I know that he is trying to be helpful, but we are worried about the high-handed attitude of some agencies to the people with whom they deal.
<P>
We are giving agencies additional exceptional powers. The Minister asked me to produce chapter and verse of the interference by English Nature. I have a vast number of complaints to give him about the extraordinary high-handed behaviour of that agency towards landowners and people who are responsible for looking after the land. The complaints are legion. They include English Nature telling someone who wanted to undertake work on land that it owned to employ health and safety officers to produce a hazard assessment report of working on moorland. It is bureaucracy gone bonkers.
<P>
Conservatives, naturally, have little faith in bureaucracies. The matter of the Environment Agency and the memorial plaque to the Dunkirk veterans is a case in point. I am sure that John Harman, the chairman of the Environment Agency, did not wish to slight the Dunkirk veterans, but some official in the agency took it upon himself to decide that mentioning victory, the war and what happened at Dunkirk on the plaque might offend some foreigner who visited Teddington lock—if, indeed, any foreigners ever do visit Teddington lock. That outrageous, foolish, idiotic, fatuous and irresponsible decision humiliated the Environment Agency in the national press and elicited a grovelling apology from its chairman, who rightly said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The agency is delighted to have the plaque at our lock, marking the department point for those boat owners who took part. We have nothing but the greatest respect for those who risked their lives to rescue the Army by crossing the Channel in small riverboats.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was not the attitude of the wretched official towards the people who wanted to erect that small plaque. He told them that they could not do it because it might offend foreigners.
<P>
I know that the right hon. Gentleman would have a sensible view of such an application. I like to think that he would understand the point of it and would agree to erect the plaque with a suitable inscription. However, he must understand that working away in those bureaucracies are many people who do not share his good will and generosity of spirit. They work to an entirely different agenda and are, when it comes to the countryside, thoroughly unhelpful, obstructionist and, above all, ignorant.
<P>
I once met someone who worked for the Environment Agency who asked me, when we were walking through a field of oilseed rape, why the fields had gone yellow. He was, however, a mere youth who had only recently joined the agency—he was what it politely calls an officer, although I cannot think why. I told him that I had noticed the same thing myself and that it seemed to have gone yellow after the Chernobyl disaster, whereupon he ran like a good'un. He did not know what a field of oilseed rape looked like. That, incidentally, happened while the Conservative party was in power.
<P>
We must acknowledge that the agencies are stuffed with some good people and a lot of foolish and ignorant people. It is all vety well for us in Committee Room 9, taking part in the process of lawmaking, but Ministers should remember that we are handing to people who know little about the stewardship of the countryside, or about how it works, very big powers indeed over those who own and run it, and who have responsibility for it.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy that there must be a partnership and that everyone must work together. Some landowners do not react as well as they should to the authorities, but most of them are incredibly reasonable, sensible people, who show unbelievable patience in the light of overweening officialdom and bureaucracy. As I did last Tuesday, I beg the Minister to understand that, unless the Bill gives sufficient consideration to those who will bear the burden of the rights—these laws and draconian power will be visited against them by people who rarely have a great or profound knowledge of what they are meant to be doing or why—we shall have passed a law that is invidious to the countryside, to the people who live there and, above all, to the owners of the land who are responsible for keeping it and ensuring that it stays looking as it does.
<P>
The Minister knows that the land does not look as it does by an act of God or because it is tramped over by ramblers. It is kept as it is by landowners who love the land, who employ people to look after it and who provide the stewardship that creates the sort of landscape that we hold dear and love so much. It does not happen by magic. A proper balance in the Bill is essential, which is the reason for the amendment. Those two words, which we tried to include last Tuesday, would acknowledge that the landowner has some rights in the matter, including the right to be fully consulted.
<P>
I know that the Minister thinks as I think, and I hope that when tasked with this business, decent reasonable officials will approach landowners in a proper manner. We all hope that it is done properly, and we know that it is meant to be done properly, but I promise him that time after time it is not. Those people take unto themselves powers, duties and obligations against landowners to which they have no right whatever. I ask the right hon. Gentleman, who is a courteous, decent and honourable man, to accept that the balance should redressed a little, and that landowners and those responsible for the land should be acknowledged and seen to have rights of preservation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Good morning, Mr. Stevenson; it is good to welcome you back to the Chair.
<P>
Our debate on amendment No. 637 brings us back to Government amendment No. 457 to clause 35. The point is a little technical, and I want the Minister fully to understand it. The wording of that amendment and the wording of the Bill are almost identical. In schedule 9, Proposed new section 28I(2) of the wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 states that the Nature Conservancy Council
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may not serve a management notice unless they are satisfied that they are unable to conclude, on terms appearing to them—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
those last two words are important—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to be reasonable, an agreement with the landowner or occupier as to the management of the land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government moved a similar amendment on 9 May. Government amendment No. 457 would have required the access authority to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>satisfied that they are unable to conclude, on terms of appearing to them to be reasonable, an agreement with owner or occupier of the land for the carrying out of the works.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister for the Environment said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The drafting of the amendment is consistent with the wording of new section 28I(2) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which is inserted by schedule 9, and provides that English Nature may not serve a management notice unless it has been unable to conclude an agreement with the owner or occupier on terms that appear to them to be reasonable.—[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 9 May 2000; c.535.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the schedule repeats the same type of provision as that which was proposed by Government amendment No. 457, which was subsequently withdrawn. Under the schedule, landowners will have no right of appeal to state why it is not reasonable for the authority to serve the notice. We argued about that during discussion of amendment No. 457, and after some little while, we managed to persuade the Minister to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
I should refer to my own remarks on that occasion. I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I, too, find the amendment somewhat curious because it seems to disturb the delicate balance of reasonableness and a light-handed approach that the Minister has been so careful to portray throughout our discussion of the Bill. It would be best in normal circumstances if there were agreement.— [Official Report, Standing Committee B, 9 May 2000; c.538.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Minister and every other hon. Member would agree with that. A high-handed approach that ensures that the authority will serve a notice, come what may and irrespective of what the owner or occupier of the land says, gets us into the realms of high-handed and overbearing officialdom. The Minister was reasonable in respect of Government amendment No. 457, which he offered to withdraw and reconsider. I hope, at least for the sake of consistency, that he will undertake to consider our amendment, so that the almost identical provision contained in schedule 9 is dealt with. As I remarked on 9 May, the provision repeats the mistakes made in the 1981 Act. I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are constantly being told that the 1981 Act did not work very well in protecting SSSIs partly because the mechanism for coming to an agreement was cumbersome, yet that mechanism is repeated in the Bill.—[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 9 May 2000; c.541.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Schedule 9 imposes exactly the same mechanism that I was talking about. The Minister is proud of this part of the Bill, which is designed to protect wildlife and SSSIs. I ask him in all sincerity to reconsider the provision, as it seems necessary to introduce an arbitration mechanism such as that which the amendment proposes. There should at least be some means of saying to the authority, ``This is what we think. You want to serve a notice because of A, B and C, but we can cite reasons D, E and F, which show why you should not serve it.'' A mechanism should be in place to require in law that the representations of the landowner or occupier must be considered by the authority before it issues a notice.
<P>
In the interests of consistency and realism, I hope that the Minister will consider my remarks careful. If we will not accept the amendment, I hope that he will give an undertaking to consider the matter before Report and to find a way of ensuring consistency between clause 35 and the schedule.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> Amendment No. 637 would add a requirement for arbitration on a management agreement made under section 50 of the 1981 Act to occur before the conservation agency can serve a management notice.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex said, we need to look at the process that might move towards a management notice with some sense of balance. We have tried throughout the Bill to strike such a sense of balance. Indeed, we have been accused even by some Labour Members of going too far in that respect. For example, we have been criticised for allowing a right of appeal to landowners when no such right exists for walkers. We defended that point earlier and I am not resiling from it. I am simply saying that we have gone out of our way—I offered the example by way of illustration—to exercise responsibility and to recognise that landowners are losing a property right.
<P>
Management notices will be used only in exceptional circumstances. The conservation agency will want to protect the special interest and, at the same time, ensure that the owner or occupier is treated equitably. The Bill already provides that the agency will have to be satisfied that it is unable to conclude a management agreement on reasonable terms. Section 17 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 is the precedent for that provision.
<P>
During the debate on chapter III, my right hon. Friend the Minister referred to section 17 of the 1949 Act as having appeared in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It is, of course, an amendment to the 1981 Act as introduced by the Bill. Under both the 1981 Act, as it will be amended, and part I of the Bill, if the owner or occupier objects to the notice, he or she has an opportunity to appeal to the Secretary of State against the terms of the notice. That is a key point. There are no immediate consequences of a failure to agree. Opposition Members may have overlooked that point. The matter is complicated and I do not blame them for missing it.
<P>
The authority must serve an order and the landowner can appeal against it to the Secretary of State. We will issue appeal regulations to govern those proceedings. With regard to terms, it will be in the interest of both parties to conclude a reasonable agreement. The conservation agencies are encouraging the use of informal dispute resolution procedures. If concerns about the financial aspects of an agreement cannot be resolved, there is a statutory right under section 53 of the 1981 Act to seek arbitration. That issue is separate from the management notice, the works involved and any appeal against the requirements of the notice.
<P>
By adding a further obligation to conclude arbitration under section 50 of the 1981 Act before a management notice may be served, there is a risk of delay allowing further deterioration of the special interest. The balance would be tipped against its protection and potential restoration. That is why we are concerned not to introduce unnecessary delay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Under-Secretary has come to the point. That is exactly what happened under the 1949 and the 1981 Acts. The cumbersome nature of notification led to the damage of so many SSSIs. If the Under-Secretary is saying that an appeal to the Secretary of State, involving cross-appeals and the presentation of evidence, is quicker than going through a little local arbitration, he is wrong. In the interests of consistency, he should consider what the Minister said with regard to clause 35 when he withdrew the Government amendment. He should accept that argument now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Agreement can be reached in the overwhelming number of cases. If an agreement cannot be reached, there is a right to appeal. Much of what the hon. Gentleman has said has been predicated on the belief that there is no right to appeal, but there is a right of appeal to the Secretary of State. He is now making a slightly different point, saying that going to the Secretary of State is too cumbersome and that the matter could be resolved at another level. I disagree because only a few cases are likely. There is already a statutory right to seek arbitration if there is a dispute about financial aspects.
<P>
The difference between us is marginal. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire shakes his head. Most of the concerns to which Opposition Members drew attention during the earlier part of their contributions are met by our proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Is the Under-Secretary saying that a landowner dissatisfied with the compensation offered has a right to have the sum evaluated by an independent body?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I suggest that that body might usefully be the Lands Tribunal. It is an independent body fully qualified to deal with such matters. If the tribunal had that role, it would be a step forward.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I cannot immediately tell the hon. Gentleman what the independent body should be. I can confirm, as I did in my original contribution, that a statutory right to seek arbitration arises under section 50(3) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex made some powerful points. We all understand that there is merit in his points. There can be a tendency in all branches of officialdom for people to abuse or misuse their powers. As he rightly acknowledged, landowners can be unreasonable, too. I am happy to repeat what my right hon. Friend the Minister said to the hon. Gentleman. If he can provide us with examples—he mentioned a particular upsetting case—we will be happy to pursue them with the chairman of the Environment Agency.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Soames:</B> The case involving the Environment Agency has merely cropped up in the past 24 to 48 hours and is now a national issue. The concerns about which I spoke were in respect of English Nature, in particular, and the other busybody agencies that interfere with the proper stewardship of the land. I do not ascribe bad faith to such organisations; they are staffed by many well-meaning good people who clearly have an important job to do. The problem comes in the interpretation of what we do here. We ask Ministers only to acknowledge that there is a problem. The case that I raised involves a problem that slaps one right in the face. An official clearly went completely over the top. That happens all the time lower down the chain. I ask for the additional protection of a couple of words in a couple of clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the undertaking that we will study the case seriously in the light of the evidence. However, I might not be able to go as far as him. As he acknowledged in his opening remarks, the question is not simply of officialdom sometimes being difficult. Landowners can also be difficult. We are trying to strike a balance and, on the whole, we have achieved that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way on the point of balance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I have one or two other things to say.
<P>
I repeat that most of the concerns to which the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex referred early in his speech are met by our proposals. There might be an argument about what the best mechanism for appeal should be, but let us be in no doubt that a right to appeal exists.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy suggested the Lands Tribunal. Section 50(3) of the 1981 Act, which covers the system already in place, refers to the appointment of an independent arbitrator, and that should meet his concern. The key word is ``independent'', as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will accept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On the basis of balance and fairness, even if the Under-Secretary will not accept the amendment, will he consider amending the clause in the following manner. The Bill states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on terms appearing to them to be reasonable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That gives no opportunity for judicial review, when the owner's or occupier's views could be heard. Perhaps the Under-Secretary would consider changing the wording to,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on terms that appear to be reasonable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would allow a judicial review. That it is a small, but reasonable change to consider on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall certainly reflect on the hon. Gentleman's point. However, a right of appeal does exist, albeit to the Secretary of State. We are meeting most of the hon. Gentleman's concerns, but I will reflect on that particular point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for attempting to placate my concerns. However, there is no mention in the section of the word ``independent'', and the arbitrators will be appointed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I have given the advice that I was as offered. Should I receive any further advice, I will inform the hon. Gentleman. I will examine the clause that he mentions and come back to him. A rather yellowed document is being handed to me. I apologise if I misled the hon. Gentleman. The section refers to merely the appointment of an arbitrator by the Secretary of State, although it is intended that the arbitrator should be independent. There are other instances where the Secretary of State appoints somebody who is accepted as independent. I apologise for misleading the hon. Gentleman, although it was not intentional.
<P>
I ask that amendment No. 637 be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The longer the debate went on and the longer the Under-Secretary spoke in reply, the more convinced I became of the need for the amendment and the less convinced I was by the Under-Secretary's remarks. It is accepted that there is a right of appeal, albeit without the word ``independent'', for financial aspects. I told the Under-Secretary that when I introduced the amendment, and I specifically referred to section 50 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It is accepted that there is a right of appeal to the Secretary of State. However, there are still arguments for our proposals.
<P>
First, the Secretary of State is the nominal head of the agency in that he appoints its officers, so he can hardly be construed as wholly independent. Secondly, the Under-Secretary bases his argument on the possibility that long delays in arbitration—if he refers to his words later he will see that he did say this—may cause damage to an SSSI. If the Under-Secretary reads the Bill, he will find that proposed new section 28J in schedule 9 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a management notice does not take effect until . . . the expiry of the period for appealing against it; or . . . an appeal is brought, its withdrawal or final determination.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Anybody who knows anything of appeals to the Secretary of State will know that they take months, if not years. My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) suggested a local arbitrator as a quicker way of resolving problems.
<P>
There is also the question of what arbitration covers. As the Under-Secretary rightly said, if the financial implications are taken out of the argument, only the management implications remain. A disagreement about management may involve relatively minor issues, such as how many times a year a meadow must be mown or what stock can be put on a meadow. The Under-Secretary proposes that an owner or occupier will have to go to the Secretary of State to argue for permission to put cattle on his land, for example. That is the ludicrous result of his approach. I stress the need for local arbitration in what he is right to say will be the few cases of disagreement. They may happen because the landowner is intransigent or the official overly bureaucratic. Who knows? However, a local, quick arbitration system is needed. The Minister has twice told my hon. Friends the Members for Cotswold and for Mid-Sussex that he will examine the matter, but I am not sure what he will focus on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the matter brings us back to what we have argued throughout our scrutiny of this important Bill—that the landowner must have confidence in the process? How could any landowner have confidence in what has been described by the Minister and by my hon. Friend, given the lack of any provision for independent inquiry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> That point about the necessity of building confidence is one that I was trying to make earlier. I am the first to accept that some awkward people own or run SSSIs, but also, as my hon. Friend has said, officials can be overly bureaucratic and awkward and personalities can clash.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> It was precisely such wrangling that led to so much damage to SSSIs following the 1981 Act. It would be a tragedy if the same mistakes were repeated with the Bill. I am sure that the Minister, who wants the arrangements to work and SSSIs to be protected, could not conceive that the mechanism will remain in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I wanted to conclude by asking the Under-Secretary to clarify what he is offering to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Our desire, in which we are probably at one with the Opposition, is to short-circuit the process as far as possible. We do not want long delays while, as the hon. Member for Cotswold says, further damage can be inflicted on the SSSI. I expect that we would all agree that disagreement about financial aspects can be sorted out later.
<P>
Opposition Members have made two points that we shall consider. One is that the words ``to them'' should be removed and the other is that the appeal to the Secretary of State could take too long and that another quicker approach might be available. If we can be convinced of that, we shall change the provision, but I make no commitment now. Opposition Members have made powerful arguments, which we shall think about, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No. 637.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful for what the Under-Secretary has said and it would be churlish not to accept his offer with good will. I merely draw his attention to the fact that, as he and I have both made clear, a system of arbitration exists with respect to financial matters, so such a system for management would be perfectly possible. Also, English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales do not necessarily have a monopoly of wisdom about how to manage a SSSI. Sometimes, the landowner will have just as good an idea. In the light of the hon. Gentleman's offer, and looking forward to the results of his deliberation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I beg to move amendment No. 638, in page 69, line 43, at end insert,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and in all cases where the Council serves such a notice the Council shall defray any costs necessarily incurred by the owner or occupier in complying with the notice'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 639, in page 71, line 42, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The Council shall make one or more payments to any owner or occupier of land in relation to which a management notice under section 28I is in force who necessarily incurs costs by reason of undertaking the work or other things specified in the notice.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> We have been discussing, tangentially, financial affairs. The amendments deal with one aspect of that subject. They are probing amendments about payments for works required under management notices—if, given what was said in our last debate, any are ever agreed. Advice has been given that owners subject to notices will be offered payments to cover the costs of the work. The only costs that they could face would be any incurred by the countryside bodies, over and above the actual costs of the work, if those bodies had to exercise their powers to enter the land and do the work. That advice has been given to interested landowners, but it is unclear whether the Bill will achieve that. Amendment No. 638 would remove any doubt and make it clear that payments will be offered not only to cover the cost of work in relation to a management scheme, as paragraph 28K(2) provides, but to cover the cost of work involved in complying with management notices. The danger is that public conservation benefits might be secured at the expense of owners or occupiers who comply with a management notice. That would penalise owners who comply.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would clarify that and also say whether the right of appeal against management notices will include the right to appeal on the following grounds: that the payments offered to undertake the works are inadequate; that the agencies have failed to offer payments to cover the costs necessarily incurred; that the works required by the notice are unnecessary, inappropriate or impractical; or that any specified time scale for carrying out the works is inadequate.
<P>
There is a puzzling reference in paragraph 28J(2), which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An appeal may be on the ground that some other owner or occupier . . . should pay all or part of their cost.—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is, the cost of the works. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary would explain what that means. The schedule should focus on the agencies' actions in paying or not paying the costs of conservation management, not on making the owners pay those costs.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I have listened with some sympathy to the arguments. However, the Bill already indicates that a management notice will not be served unless the agency is satisfied that it is unable to conclude an agreement on what it regards as reasonable terms. I take that to mean that, in every case, it will calculate the costs to the owner or occupier of undertaking the work required and will offer an agreement that will meet those costs.
<P>
The amendment would require the agency to pay any costs necessarily incurred, but there will be circumstances—hopefully, not many—in which that is inappropriate; for example, where the land manager has breached the terms of the management agreement and a management notice is necessary to conserve or restore special features. As hon. Members know, we have already published draft guidance on payments under the management agreement, which will provide the basis for the calculation of payments under individual agreements. If any further reassurance is required, it would be more appropriate to include it in the guidance and we shall listen to suggestions from hon. Members. On that basis, I hope that the amendments will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am slightly unsure about the hon. Gentleman's point that if costs are incurred because a landowner has breached an agreement, it would be unfair for the agency to defray those costs. It seems to me to be unlikely that the amendment, which includes the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>necessarily incurred . . . in complying with the notice<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would have covered that situation. Clearly, if someone breaches a notice, he is not necessarily incurring expenses, so that is a circular argument. However, I take the point that those matters can be dealt with in the guidance notes, which we shall consider carefully and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will receive numerous helpful suggestions on how the guidance notes can be improved. Bearing in mind what he has said, unless he wishes to say something about the piece of paper that he has just received—
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, it might add to the sum of human knowledge.
<P>
The agency may serve the management notice on the occupier, who may be a tenant with a limited interest, and who may be responsible for the works. The provision will enable the owner to be brought into the equation. The difference between us revolves around the word ``any''. As I made clear in my opening remarks, we expect that in most cases the costs will be fully reimbursed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that clear reassurance, in the light of which I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I beg to move amendment No. 489, in page 72, line 3, after `interest' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or land which in the opinion of the Council would be desirable for the purpose of securing the special interest of a site of special scientific interest, conserving species listed in Schedules 1, 5 or 8 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, or conserving species and habitats which in the opinion of the Secretary of State are priorities for action under the Convention on Biological Diversity'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with the thorny issue of compulsory purchase. The Bill provides for powers of compulsory purchase, but they extend only to areas that form part of an SSSI. The amendment would provide, as a matter of last resort, a means of purchasing land that does not form part of the SSSI but which impinges on the wildlife interest for which the SSSI is notified. We have already discussed the effects of actions on land adjacent to, or at some remove from, an SSSI. For example, a remote aquifer might have a substantive effect on the habitat of an SSSI.
<P>
In many cases, compulsory purchase orders are not a satisfactory solution. They should be used extremely sparingly because such an order is seldom the way in which to progress relationships between any public body, be it a conservation body or local authority, and a private landowner. However, when all negotiations break down, there is a stark choice, and the interests of the SSSI or priority area under the convention on biological diversity or protected species will be lost if an effective provision is not introduced. In such circumstances, a compulsory purchase power may be of value.
<P>
Such a power is not necessarily against the interests of landowners. I can envisage that such cases could happen in my constituency, where there are important wetlands. For example, several different owners might be not only willing but anxious to enter into agreements to raise the water level, but might be unable to qualify for higher tier payments because a single landowner in the catchment or drainage area was not prepared to enter into such an agreement.
<P>
There are other circumstances to consider. Conditions of management orders might make it so difficult for a landowner to further his business or to make efficient use of his land that purchase would be more satisfactory. The power is not necessarily a blunt tool to be used to hit the head of a landowner who will not play ball, but it is a means of securing a satisfactory end for all involved. Local authorities often use it for that reason.
<P>
I understand that the Under-Secretary might say that the amendment provides too great a power to the conservation bodies. However, I would not object to receiving a qualification of the principle to clarify the circumstances in which it can be used. As a reserve power—a power of last resort—it is worthy of consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We accept that the intention is to protect threatened species in countryside that is outside designated sites. However, the decision to accept the amendment is intimately tied up with amendments that have not been discussed. The best route for dealing with the issue is to use the current biodiversity action planning process, which prescribes the action needed for each species on a case-by-case basis. Many of the difficulties of conserving priority species outside designated sites stem from the fact that the species are wide ranging or thinly dispersed. Compulsory purchase of land would not directly deal with the needs of such species because it could be applied only to clearly defined areas which, where appropriate, should be SSSIs.
<P>
Amendment No. 489 would extend the power of compulsory purchase to any land that contains a priority species. The hon. Gentleman was right to anticipate that the Government consider compulsory purchase to be a draconian measure. It should be preserved for areas of land that are sufficiently distinct and important to be SSSIs. However, conservation agencies have the power to purchase land voluntarily and to receive and hold land for the purposes of nature conservation. We will have a wider debate on biodiversity later in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> The Under-Secretary may recall that on Tuesday I mentioned that the European Union was not happy with the Bill's framework with regard to biodiversity and other matters. A friend of mine complained to the EU about the Government's action in light of the EU directive. The response from the head of the unit at the EU said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The European Union has decided to make an application to the EU Court of Justice for the UK having failed to propose a complete list of areas for protection under the Habitats directive.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but I should remind him that we are supposed to be discussing the widening of compulsory purchase powers. I suspect that there will be an opportunity to discuss biodiversity later during our consideration of the Bill, so I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would pursue his argument then.
<P>
Has the Under-Secretary finished his remarks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I had, but I should perhaps provide an answer to the hon. Gentleman. I think that we said the other day that not only the United Kingdom had been found wanting, but virtually every country in Europe. We are taking steps to resolve the matter, although I realise, Mr. Stevenson, that is not strictly relevant to our discussion.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I take it that the Under-Secretary would like me to withdraw the amendment. Before I do so, however, I should like to make it clear that I understand the difficulties of widening compulsory purchase orders to cover species protection and biodiversity. As was correctly pointed out, we will consider those matters in further detail later during our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
The arguments are clearer in respect of land that has an intrinsic relationship with an SSSI but which is remote from it. Such land can have the capacity to destroy or damage the interests for which the SSSI notification was made, and there is currently no power to allow compulsory purchase in such circumstances. As I said, such a power would be used principally in respect of water management, which can be crucial to habitat areas. It might also be used to deal with pollutants that are having a direct effect on a piece of land. Damage might also be caused by pollen drift and the resultant contamination, which can occur over considerably larger distances than Ministers would have us believe. That matter is of very current debate in relation to the controversy over genetically modified crops, which has been breaking over the past day or so.
<P>
It may be necessary to ensure the integrity of an SSSI for conservation purposes in a variety of circumstances by ensuring that land that is either adjacent to or remote from the site is carefully managed and controlled. It is worth considering whether compulsory purchase orders might be an appropriate sanction—although I repeat that they should be a last resort—to enable agencies to secure an objective that everybody shares.
<P>
In the hope that Ministers and officials will reflect more deeply on those matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 640, in page 72, line 6, leave out `on terms appearing to them to be reasonable,' and insert:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`following the exercise of its powers under sections 28H and 28I and the hearing of any appeal under section 28J,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment goes back to the debate that we had a moment ago about terms that appear to be reasonable, so I do not intend to delay the Committee for very long. I trust that the Minister's comments on amendment No. 637 will also apply to this amendment. The schedule provides for the powers of compulsory purchase to which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) refers, but it again covers circumstances in which the council is unable to conclude an agreement
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on terms appearing to them to be reasonable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to remove those words. It would make the compulsory purchase order apply to circumstances in which:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Council are satisfied that they are unable to conclude, following the exercise of its powers under sections 28H and 28I and the hearing of any appeal under section 28J, an agreement with the owner or occupier as to the management of the land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is intended simply to probe the Government and to gain an assurance that the powers of compulsory purchase will or would be used extremely sparingly as a measure of last resort and after all other options have been explored, including the contention about appeal that was referred to earlier. Perhaps the Government will clarify whether the agencies will have a voluntary land purchase power. In the case of a landowner telling an agency that it had better buy the land if it requires the management work to be done, will the agency have the power to do so? Voluntary land purchase should be a precursor to compulsory purchase, which should be the last resort. The principal issue is that before a compulsory purchase order is made, all avenues of appeal should be properly exhausted. The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>appearing to them to be reasonable,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should be removed.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I can immediately say to the hon. Gentleman that the intention is that compulsory purchase orders should be used sparingly. Let me briefly outline the background to that.
<P>
While the compulsory purchase order power is generally a power of last resort, there may be circumstances where the agency is dealing with a landowner who will not co-operate. Though the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex has temporarily left the Room, I repeat that the majority of landowners are co-operative. They realise why they are asked to manage the land in a particular way and in most cases they co-operate with English Nature. Where there is a refusal—for whatever reason—to cooperate and it is clear that the landowner has no intention of preserving features of special interest, the management scheme and the management notice process should not be used as a means of delaying early action.
<P>
While it may appear reasonable to require that a management scheme should be in place before such powers are exercised, it is possible that there will be circumstances where the land manager refuses to consider perfectly obvious measures necessary to sustaining a site in good condition. Compulsory purchase powers will be used exceedingly rarely. To put that in perspective, I am assured that English Nature has used its existing powers only once since it was established. So it is clear that such cases are exceptional. However, the Bill must provide the capacity to respond to all possible circumstances. We need to retain a degree of flexibility about the circumstances in which the power would be invoked to that degree and no further. It would be an exceptional power used only in exceptional circumstances. It is no more than that and will not be used otherwise. I hope, therefore, that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman and he will now withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I hoped the Minister would make some reference to the appeal issue that was debated earlier. However, we understand that the power will be used rarely and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 490, page 73, line 3, leave out `or damages' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, damages or disturbs'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 491, in page 73, line 5, after `interest', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or the habitats or species upon which the notified interest depends'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 467, in page 73, line 5, leave out from 'interest' to end of line 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The two amendments in my name relate to the offence of intentionally or recklessly destroying or damaging the flora, fauna or other physiographical features of an SSSI. They address the problem of defining what constitutes damage. Destruction can be easily construed and the destruction of wildlife or any other interest can easily be proved in a court of law. Greater difficulty arises in the case of disturbance, which, while possibly being intentional or reckless, cannot be suggested to cause damage to the relevant species, but which undoubtedly damages the wildlife interest of the SSSI. In the case of birds, for instance, that might happen because they moved to an alternative habitat.
<P>
I anticipate the difficulties that might be suggested. Disturbance might be construed too widely as involving simply walking over a site and inadvertently disturbing invertebrate life, but that is a reductio ad absurdum and I do not think that any competent authority would bring a prosecution in such a case. However, I accept that the potential would exist. The disturbance that I have in mind is more substantive and I shall use an absurd case to explain. If the reason for notification of an SSSI was that rare birds nested there, and someone decided to contribute to nature conservation by setting off bird scarers at 10 minute intervals in the breeding season, the birds would not be damaged intrinsically but they would certainly be disturbed. That would eventually ruin the SSSI and the reason for notification.
<P>
That is an extreme case and not what would usually arise. Simple unthinking use of adjacent land or the skies above the land would be more likely. For example, Otmoor SSSI includes a range of important grassland habitats, with rare plants such as the downy-fruited sedge and greater burnet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> The Liberal Member of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The greater Burnett—that is true, he is a fine Member of Parliament.
<P>
Other species at the site are the forester moth and breeding birds such as redshank, snipe and grasshopper warbler. Those are often disturbed by low-flying civilian helicopters. The people flying them probably do so in complete ignorance of the fact that they are above a SSSI, but if there were a clear pattern of disturbance and it could be established that the pilots had been advised of the problems that they were causing and nevertheless intentionally and recklessly continued to fly low over the site, it might be held that there was a reason to stop them. However, that would be difficult as things stand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Under the enlightened regime of the Ministry of Defence, when I was Minister of State for the Armed Forces, a good deal of work was done on aircraft noise. The hon. Gentleman may not realise it, but there is little evidence that birds are substantially disturbed by it. They are much more disturbed by dogs. One of the enigmas of the Bill is the failure to provide for dogs to be shackled up on walks. Low-flying helicopters do not disturb birds and the sheep are rarely seen to look up when Harriers and Tornados fly over in the Lake district.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> In the halcyon days when the hon. Gentleman had control of such things I am sure that that was so. I accept that there is evidence that noise disturbance is not a problem for wildlife, but down draft from helicopters—
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Dandruff?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> No. If I may correct the hon. Gentleman, down draft from helicopters may cause considerable disturbance to a habitat and it certainly is not conducive to the birds' welfare. I do not want to discuss the relative disturbance of various types of aircraft on bird life. I mention it merely as an illustration of the sort of problem that might occur.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 491 deals with the habitats on which species depend. At present, the offence is to destroy or damage the species themselves. Again, it may be difficult to establish the causal relationship between an act that does not directly affect a species but which affects its habitat and therefore can affect the welfare of the species. That difficulty is not encompassed in the Bill, and a case can be made for extending the provision so that it would be an offence intentionally or recklessly to destroy the habitat on which a species depends. That may be easier to prove in court, because a direct link can be more easily constructed between cause and effect on damage to the habitat than on damage to the species.
<P>
The amendments seek to amplify and support what the Government propose. If the Minister is not happy with the precise wording—I foresee that various interpretations can be made—I will happily consider an alternative wording. I ask the Minister to take the amendments seriously, because they are meant to improve the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): I wish to speak to amendment No. 467, which is in my name. It would allow prosecution if it could reasonably be assumed that a person knew that the damage that he was causing to a site of special scientific interest was wrong.
<P>
Under the existing provision, for instance, someone who intends to do damage who enters a site at a point away from the signs showing that it was an SSSI might do that damage but avoid prosecution by claiming that he did not know that it was an SSSI. That seems to run counter to the reckless damage provision. Damage caused by unauthorised fires, such as the 73 fires on Exmoor heath in 1997, which destroyed 2,000 hectares, could fall outside the Bill's provisions. The person who lit the fire could claim that he did not know that it was an SSSI. In such circumstances, the only course of action open to English Nature, a much-„maligned body, would be to prosecute under section 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971.
<P>
Deleting paragraph (b) of proposed section 28M(5), as suggested in the amendment, would ensure that if someone damaged an SSSI, and if it was reasonable to expect that he knew that he was in an SSSI, a case could be made against him.

<P>

<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I speak in support of amendments Nos. 490 and 491, in the name of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. They go to the heart of the Bill. They deal with habitat and the disturbing of species. One of the birds mentioned by the hon. Gentleman was the snipe. The snipe is a beautiful small bird that inhabits wetlands and bogs and is delicious to eat. As someone who prefers rare species grilled, I can assure the Committee of that fact. The point is that much of the habitat of these birds is located within SSSIs, as many bogs and other wetland areas are important SSSIs. The Bill does not require dogs to be tied up and allows them to roam free on such land.
<P>
I hope that Ministers will understand what they have been told by Game Conservancy, in clear and demonstrable terms: the most dangerous disturbance to birds is caused not by ramblers, but by dogs. Dogs that are running unrestrained across a wetland bog where snipe are nesting will cause serious damage to the species nesting in that habitat. I therefore support the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, which involves an actual, tangible example, from which Ministers cannot escape, of the proven damage done by dogs to nesting bird life. Such damage can affect many types of birds, whether game or not, and whether on moorland, wetland or wherever else. Dogs damage not only habitats, but the species that live within them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I shall comment briefly on amendment No. 467, which appears to be based on an assumption that a guilty person will have known that the damage that he was causing to a site of special scientific interest was wrong. However, it would achieve exactly the opposite, as it would create an absolute offence. If it were agreed to, it would not matter how much knowledge the person had or whether he or she knew, did not know or merely assumed. It is therefore a dangerous provision to impose on the Bill, as it creates an absolute offence into which knowledge does not come. I am wary of introducing such an offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am grateful to hon. Members for raising such important issues.
<P>
Conservation agencies have been especially keen to deal with damage by persons other than owners and occupiers and the Bill tackles those concerns. Hon. Members will know that schedule 8 deals with the use of motorised vehicles off road, which unquestionably causes considerable damage. Amendment No. 490 relates to the new general offence of intentionally or recklessly destroying or damaging special features, which will apply to all SSSIs and which will bite especially on persons other than owners and occupiers of land.
<P>
The amendment adds the offence of disturbing the special features. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome mentioned two examples of such disturbance. First, he spoke about someone who set up bird scarers that were set off regularly for some malign purpose. It is not for me to say whether that would constitute reckless disturbance, although I should have thought that it could fall within that category. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman caused some amusement around the Room by talking about helicopters. Not all helicopters will be conveying friends of the hon. Member for Mid-„Sussex between their adjacent estates and the provision could apply to low-flying helicopters, perhaps from the Ministry of Defence. I do not believe that helicopters cause significant disturbance or that flying them is a reckless activity.
<P>
The Bill includes an offence of reckless disturbance that applies in particular circumstances to species specifically included in the schedules to the 1981 Act. To that extent, where those species are found within SSSIs, they will be protected by that separate legislative provision. My primary concern—the hon. Gentleman always anticipates my reactions—with applying disturbance to the general offence is that people who are enjoying recreation in the countryside and are causing no damage may none the less be accused of disturbing the features for which an SSSI is notified. As the general offence attracts a fine of up to £20,000, I question the reasonableness—
<P>
