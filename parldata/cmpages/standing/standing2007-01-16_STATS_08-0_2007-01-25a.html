							<b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): As we have been
talking about the need to share data and the clause is among a set that
deals with devolved bodies, I wanted to ask how we deal with the
fragmentation of statistics and what co-operation exists with devolved
Administrations. We know that the census agreement for 2011 has been
signed by the three Registrars General of England and Wales, of
Scotland and of Northern Ireland. None the less, the Treasury Committee
report &#147;Independence for Statistics&#148; raised a concern
that the fragmentation of some statistics across the UK was continuing.
One of the report&#146;s recommendations was to review the concordat
on statistics. It states that the Select
Committee</div>
					<a name="070125104000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;welcome the
Minister&#146;s commitment, on behalf of the Government, to review
the Concordat on Statistics, particularly in light of his suggestion
that, while this fragmentation has been an issue for some time because
of differing local circumstances and requirements, devolution has led
to an inevitable intensification of the
problem.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070125104000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to
recommend</div>
					<a name="070125104000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the
Government negotiate a revised Concordat with the devolved
administrations, that the National Statistician, in consultation with
the chief statisticians for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, be
given responsibility for drafting a revised Concordat and that the new
independent board be given responsibility for monitoring the
implementation of the revised Concordat.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070125104000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taking into account that
recommendation and the evidence of witnesses who believe that recent
experience has provoked the need to review the issue now, surely it
makes sense for a review and renegotiation to take place. I am asking
for the Minister&#146;s commitment not only to review the concordat
but to renew it. What plans does he have to update
that?</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000253"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):
						</b>
						<b class="B">
</b>If the hon. Lady looks at the official record of our discussions on
Tuesday afternoon, she will see that we had quite a good debate on
devolution and concerns about the coherence, comprehensiveness and
co-ordination of statistics. I will not reiterate the detailed points
covered by the Committee, but I will say 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 266</div>one thing about the Treasury Committee and then deal specifically with
the concordat, as I accept that we did not deal with it in particular
detail on Tuesday afternoon. The hon. Lady will find that the Treasury
Committee report was published before I could announce the full
participation of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the
Bill&#146;s provisions. She will also probably find that that
participation was welcomed by members of the Select Committee as well
as by Opposition
Front-Benchers.</div>
					<a name="070125104000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Lady said, I made it clear when I gave evidence to the
Treasury Committee that we had begun work with the devolved
Administrations to take a fresh look at the concordat and see where it
needed updating and strengthening. The concordat is an important and
useful arrangement that cannot be replicated or imported into primary
legislation, so it has an important part to play alongside the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="070125104000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
will appreciate that producing UK statistics, and doing so in a
combined way when those statistics relate to devolved matters, relies
on the co-operation of the devolved Administrations rather than on
legislation. All Administrations expressed their commitment to
co-operation in the concordat, which was annexed to the memorandum of
understanding on devolution in 2001. Given that it set the overall
framework for co-operation and was supported by other non-legislative
bilateral agreements between the Administrations, that framework had
the full support of the devolved Administrations. The framework
document described in detail how the framework for national statistics,
which we introduced in 2000, would operate in each Administration.
There is clearly more to do, and that is probably the reason behind the
hon. Lady&#146;s concern. I strongly welcome the decision of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to sign up to the legislation. It
will give the board a role working with all four Administrations. I
expect the board&#146;s objective of promoting and safeguarding the
quality of official statistics, which includes coherence with other
statistics, as stated explicitly in clause 7(2)(b), to give it a role
in promoting consistent statistics throughout the United
Kingdom.</div>
					<a name="070125104000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">To further
our aim for improvement in the consistency and coherent co-ordination
of statistics, we are working with the devolved Administrations to see
whether other, non-legislative mechanisms may be needed to support the
Bill, including the possible revision of the concordat on statistics
between the UK Government and the devolved Administrations. I hope that
the hon. Lady is reassured that we are working on those non-legislative
matters with the commitment of all four Administrations, although the
work that we are doing on the legislation may be more
obvious.</div>

								John
Healey:
						</b> I think that the Committee may wish for a brief
explanation of the clause, as it is an important part of the Bill. It
sets out a mechanism that allows the board to use information that is
received from a public authority, by creating a power for the Treasury
to make regulations to authorise the use of that information, where
there is an existing legal barrier to the board&#146;s using it. The
power may be used to allow the board to use for additional purposes
information that it has already received, which could allow it to
improve the quality of statistics. That in turn could improve policy
making, resource allocation and the delivery of public services. The
power may also be used to reduce the burden on data providers, such as
requests for businesses and individuals to fill out surveys, by
removing the need to collect information that is already held by the
board.</div>
					<a name="070125104000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
uses the same mechanism as that in clauses 44 to 46. Regulations must
be made with the consent of another Minister of the Crown who, together
with the Treasury, must be satisfied that the disclosure is required
for the board to carry out the functions for which the disclosure is
authorised, and that the disclosure is in the public
interest.</div>

							<b class="B">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): I wish to speak
briefly on the clause, which envisages the abolition of the Office for
National Statistics and the Statistics Commission. I take this
opportunity to pay tribute to the work of both those
organisations.</div>
					<a name="070125104000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the ONS, the key problem that we have focused on is the
treatment by Ministers of statistics. Of course it is important to
consider the methodology and quality of the production of statistics,
but there is consensus that they are of high quality. The problem that
we are trying to address is political interference, or the perception
of it, in the fruits of the labours of statisticians. I pay tribute to
the high quality of the work of Government
statisticians.</div>
					<a name="070125104000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
congratulate the Statistics Commission on its excellent work since it
was founded in 2000, and I give credit to the Government for setting it
up. It has been a fearless defender of statistical integrity and a
fearless critic of ministerial activities in a number of instances. As
we have stated, it is a weakness of the Bill that it merges the
activities of the Office for National Statistics and the Statistics
Commission. That was why we tabled a number of amendments to separate
responsibility for the production of statistics from the responsibility
to scrutinise their production and release. There would have been a
much more effective structure if the Bill had kept those functions
separate, as illustrated by the effective role played by the Statistics
Commission in the past few
years.</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="070125104000256"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Michael Fallon</b> (Sevenoaks) (Con): My hon. Friend the
Member for Chipping Barnet is absolutely right to single out the
clause. It is contained in a part of the Bill entitled
&#147;Consequential&#148; but it is not entirely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 268</div>consequential. We are, of course, replacing the ONS with the statistics
board, but we are abolishing the only watchdog that we have, the
Statistics Commission. I, too, as the chairman of the Sub-Committee to
which the commission was accountable, wish to pay tribute to its work
under first Sir John Kingman and then Professor David Rhind. They had a
small budget and a small staff, which has contributed in no small
measure to the proposed
improvements.</div>
					<a name="070125104000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask
the Financial Secretary for more detail on the timetable for the
abolition of the two bodies. As I understand clause 71, it refers to
different commencement orders being laid for different provisions. I am
not sure whether the abolition will have to come into force as a whole
or whether it will be possible to delay the commencement of clause
52(b)&#151;the abolition of the commission&#151;until we are sure
that the appropriate replacement scrutiny functions are in place. I
understand why the board will take on the existing functions and staff
of the ONS&#151;that is quite clear. It does not necessarily follow
that within a week or so of the Bill being passed the Statistics
Commission, our only watchdog, must be swept away. Given the pace with
which change is implemented in the House, it is wholly possible that
the House willnot have come to a conclusion on the scrutiny
arrangements that it wishes to make to replace the Statistics
Commission.</div>
					<a name="070125104000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that it is not for the Financial Secretary or the Government
to prescribe the new scrutiny arrangements. Indeed he has emphasised,
if I am right, that that will be a matter for the House as a whole or
probably for both Houses of Parliament. However, it is in the gift of
the Financial Secretary to decide when the existing watchdog will be
abolished under the clause. Can he confirm that it will be possible for
him to delay the commencement order in clause 52(b) if he
wishesto do so?</div>
					<a name="070125104000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister give the
Committee further illustration of the proposed timetable? Is it
intended to abolish both bodies swiftly after the Bill is passed, or is
there to be a longer implementation period? He will understand that a
large number of staff not only of the ONS but of the commission will be
affected. It would be helpful if he indicated the timetable for the
replacement of the two bodies that are being abolished.

							<a name="070125104000257"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I shall begin by replying to the hon. Member for
Chipping Barnet, and then I shall turn to the questions that the hon.
Member for Sevenoaks asked.</div>
					<a name="070125104000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause provides for the
Office of National Statistics and the Statistics Commission to cease to
exist as administrative entities. &#147;Abolition&#148; of the
Office of National Statistics, as the hon. Lady put it, is rather
misleading and inappropriate, because its functions and service will be
carried out under the legal remit of the board, which will become the
legal entity.</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000258"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I concede that the use of
&#147;abolition&#148; was infelicitous.</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000259"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I have trouble saying that word, let alone
understanding its proper application. However, I accept the hon.
Lady&#146;s point.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 269</div>
					<a name="070125104000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The board
will assume all functions that the Office of National Statistics
undertakes, with the exception of the civil registration duties. I am
not sure that &#147;abolition&#148; is entirely appropriate or that
it pays due recognition to the role of the Statistics Commission. Its
work has paved the way for the Bill, its responsibilities will be
assumed by the board, and the commission has contributed a great deal
to our understanding of how important it is for the statistics system
to evolve.</div>
					<a name="070125104000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I join in
paying special tribute to the chairmen who have served the Statistics
Commission and to their work. Over the seven years of its existence,
they have consistently produced high-quality, wide-ranging research and
reports, which have greatly added to our understanding of how the
system has worked, and have given us ideas about how to fashion it in
the future.</div>
					<a name="070125104000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
made it clear before that the property rights and liabilities of the
ONS will transfer to the board. Any statutory references to the ONS
will be amended after Royal Assent so that they refer to the
board.</div>
					<a name="070125104000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the questions that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked, I have in
earlier discussions about the Bill been clear that at an appropriate
point during its passage, I shall consider the appointment of a
chairman to the shadow statistics board, allowing him or her to start
without delay preparations to put the board in place. I shall do so
without offending any propriety of this House or of the other place.
However, all hon. Members will agree that the current shape of the
statistics system will not benefit from undue delay, and if we can move
properly to ensure that the transition is as rapid and as smooth as
possible, we should.</div>
					<a name="070125104000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have also been clear that if
Parliament assents to the Bill, we want the board in place and in
operation from April 2008. The Statistics Commission has already
undertaken some useful work to prepare what it believes could form the
basis of a code of practice. It will be one of the board&#146;s
responsibilities, and central to the operation of the new statistical
system. The commission is undertaking important work with us to prepare
to hand over its responsibilities to the statistics board.</div>
					<a name="070125104000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The short answer to the second
question askedby the hon. Member for Sevenoaks is that it is
theoretically, legally and technically possible to delay the
implementation of paragraph (b). However, it is probably most
appropriate to ensure that the changes are implemented together, not
least because the commission&#146;s responsibilities will become the
board&#146;s and there is no obvious sense or gain in having two
competing bodies with the same responsibilities. I hope that that is
helpful to hon. Members who have contributed to this debate and I ask
that the clause stand part of the Bill.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary first of
all for what he said about the Statistics Commission and secondly for
making it clear that different parts of this section could in fact be
brought into effect on different
dates.</div>
					<a name="070125104000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
that he has gone as far as he can on the point about the watchdog. I am
not sure that he fully appreciated what I was saying and perhaps I did
not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 270</div>put it as fully as I should have done. If the new board comes into
operation in April 2008, Parliament cannot set up a fresh scrutiny
process. It cannot scrutinise a board that does not exist. If the
Statistics Commission is abolished, therefore, in its watchdog
function&#151;I appreciate that some of its functions are
transferring to the board&#151; once the board begins its legal
existence, as he hopes, in April 2008 there is going to be a gap in the
scrutiny arrangements before new arrangements are put into place. I
urge him, if he to reflect on that point. Parliament can scrutinise the
statistics board only once it gets going in April 2008 and I still
suggest there may be some merit in continuing the life of the
Statistics Commission at least for the rest of this year so that we are
not left with a gap when no one is scrutinising what is being
proposed.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman puts his finger, not
uncharacteristically, on quite an important point, but I think he would
accept that it really cannot be for me to propose or set the terms in
which Parliament considers how it wants to play its proper role of
scrutinising and holding the new system to account or indeed the pace
at which Parliament considers that. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope, and
I know from the interest that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the
House takes in these matters, that such discussionsand any
decisions that may be appropriate will not be left until the statistics
board is up and running inApril 2008.</div>
					<a name="070125104000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also seems to me, although
the hon. Gentleman may have greater experience and be able to
contradict me on this, that Parliament can set itself up in any way
that it chooses to scrutinise whatever it chooses. If Parliament
decides that certain arrangements are appropriate for the new system, I
can see no immediate reason why it should not set such arrangements up
whenever it wished. Perhaps I am tempting fate, but it may well be
that, if Parliament does that, it will take an active interest in
scrutinising and holding to account the preparation that Ministers and
others are making for the full operation of the new system that will, I
hope, come into force, in April
2008.</div>
					<a name="070125104000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see
the problem that the hon. Gentleman points to. Although it is not
within my authority or remit to solve this, I hope that he will play
his part in Parliament in making sure that scrutiny and accountability
arrangements are in place in good time. I do not see the strength of
his argument for prolonging the existence of the Statistics Commission
when we will have in place a statistics board taking over the
responsibilities of the Statistics Commission, with a much wider and
more powerful remit to
boot.</div>

						</b> Clause 53 deals with the legal transfers from the
ONS to the board and may include the current property of the ONS. That
gives us the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 271</div>opportunity once more to be clear about the property that will be
transferred. We touched on this issue obliquely last
Thursday&#151;under your chairmanship, Mr.

the London office, currently in Pimlico, will be retained.</div>
					<a name="070125104000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume from the clause that
the ONS headquarters in Pimlico will be transferred to the board, but
there is uncertainty about how much of the London office will be
retained. I understand that, at the time of the Lyons and Gershon
reviews, the assurance was given that a London
presence&#151;presumably, a London property&#151;would be retained
after the move to Newport. However, I am not entirely clear whether
those assurances still stand and whether the 100 or so staff will
remain there after 2010. Will the Financial Secretary clarify whether
the lease&#151;or whatever it is&#151;on Drummond Gate will be
transferred formally to the new board and, if not, whether the new
board will retain a London
property?</div>

out from beginning to end of line 16 and
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) Subject to the
provisions of this section, the expenses of the Board shall be paid out
of monies provided by
Parliament.</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(2) The Chairman of
the Board shall, for the financial year ending immediately after this
Act has been passed and for each subsequent financial year, prepare an
estimate of the six year rolling use of resources by the Board; and the
Commission for Official Statistics shall examine that estimate and lay
it before the House of Commons with such modifications, if any, as the
Commission thinks fit.</div>

					<a name="070125104000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is linked to an issue on which my hon. Friend the Member for
Fareham commented earlier. It deals with the crucial matter of how the
new arrangements put in place by the Bill will be funded. We propose to
put the funding decisions in thehands of a parliamentary
commission of the sort that was described and discussed in relation to
earlier amendments. Two other bodies are funded in a similar way: the
Electoral Commission and the National Audit Office.</div>
					<a name="070125104000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is obvious why the clause
and the amendment are important: it is possible for funding
arrangements to undermine measures that ensure genuine independence
from political control. Therefore, the problem to be addressed is how
to ensure that there are proper limits on and scrutiny of the budget,
while preventing the ministerial interference that the Bill is designed
to deal
with.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="070125104000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We in the
official Opposition believe that the best way to tackle that conundrum
is to put the fundingin the hands of Parliament and have a
direct parliamentary vote on it. That would create the necessary
independence from the Treasury, while securing value for money for the
taxpayer. Doing so would give the board the opportunity to work closely
on its funding arrangements and have them scrutinised, agreed and
determined by the commission that we want to set
up.</div>
					<a name="070125104000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern about
funding arrangements possibly undermining true independence for
statistical services was addressed by a number of stakeholders who
contributed to the consultation and, probably, to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 273</div>evidence taken by the Treasury Sub-Committee, which is chaired by my
hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks. Certainly, the British Society
for Population Studies emphasised
that</div>
					<a name="070125104000213"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Arrangements
should be made to avoid concerns about political

					<a name="070125104000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
British Urban and Regional Information Systems Association stated
that</div>
					<a name="070125104000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the initial level
of funding should be determined by a joint review involving
Parliament&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070125104000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">A similar
comment was made by the fire and rescue statistics user
group.</div>
					<a name="070125104000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We tabled the
amendment to answer the concerns of the stakeholders in the statistical
community, who want greater parliamentary involvement in the funding
process. Essentially, there is concern that the Treasury&#146;s
involvement in determining funding will lead to the Government
determining the scope of additional work done by the ONS. The Economic
and Social Research Council, for example, was anxious that the
Government might push funding for statistical series that they wanted,
but not emphasise funding for statistical series that they were not so
keen
on.</div>

of the hon. Lady&#146;s ideas are based. Does she accept that
statistics, as a general public good, should be principally funded by
general taxation? If so, does she not accept that the Treasury, as the
Government&#146;s finance Department&#151;particularly with its
responsibility for value for money and accounting for the public good
use of that money&#151;should be involved in setting the budget,
albeit on different terms than those suggested by the hon. Lady, as I

out?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000266"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I do not accept that the Treasury is exclusively
qualified to carry out that task. The powerful joint commission of both
Houses of Parliament that we propose could be equally tough in
safeguarding value for money for the taxpayer. The Bill leaves such
questions unanswered. It does not tell us about the special funding
arrangements&#151;to which the Financial Secretary referred on Second
Reading&#151;that should be determined by Parliament.</div>
					<a name="070125104000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the Financial
Secretary has made it clear that he is not prepared to accept our
overall parliamentary model for the whole scope of the new structures,
would he be prepared to consider other alternatives to increase
Parliament&#146;s involvement in scrutinising the funding and budget
process?</div>
					<a name="070125104000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
importantly, the Financial Secretary has an opportunity to clarify how
the five-yearly review to which he referred on Second Reading will
operate. He could also reassure us that measures will be taken to avoid
the politicised interference in the budget that, for example, the ESRC
fears. We need a clear indication of how the new arrangements will work
and how they will secure the genuine independence of the statistical
services.</div>

of funding and scrutiny arrangements proposed in the amendment?
Secondly, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 274</div>she said that politicised interference in the budget process is a risk
that she is concerned about and that the amendment is intended to
address it. Has the ONS or the Statistics Commission, to her knowledge,
ever complained about such politicised interference in the setting of
their
budgets?</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): At a time
when senior politicians of all parties are trying to rebalance the
relationship between Parliament and the Executive, the amendment would
give the Financial Secretary yet another opportunity to make his name
in history as a great champion of the rights of the legislature by
giving greater powers to Parliament. That would achieve the objective
of rebalancing that relationship set out by the Chancellor in his
recent interviews. Given that the Financial Secretary has let other
such opportunities slip through his grasp, I hope that he might take
it.</div>

support the amendment, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping
Barnet. I will be interested to hear what the Financial Secretary
believes is wrong with the proposal, because increased parliamentary
scrutiny can only be a good thing in increasing public confidence in
statistics. What is wrong with removing such powers from the Treasury?
Unfortunately, whether the Financial Secretary likes it or not, there
has been a perception in the past 10 years that the Treasury tends to
be somewhat meddlesome. Would it not be good to increase the
public&#146;s confidence in the new body by supporting the

						</b> It has been a long time since the Green Paper, but
all that we have heard so far is thatthe budget will be set
according to a five-year programme&#151;that is pretty sketchy detail
to go on. For example, we do not know what will happen if the
statistics board is unhappy with its budget. It is not clear who would
negotiate with the Treasury on its behalf. That is one of the
weaknesses of the Treasury retaining residual responsibility. The
Financial Secretary could virtually argue with himself, rather than
give authority to a different Minister to argue on the board&#146;s
behalf.</div>
					<a name="070125104000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
statistics board is unhappy with the budget allocated, it will be
unhappy for the next five or six years&#151;or for whatever the
duration of the budget&#151;during which time it will have little
recourse. It might also be unhappy more generally, as we have indicated
in earlier amendments, with the budgetary resources allocated to
departmental statistical work. The Financial Secretary rejected our
amendments that would have given the board more direct oversight of
funding and staffing within different
Departments.</div>
					<a name="070125104000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
support my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet, but I would not
have do so if we had not been given such thin detail on how the

what was wrong when we discussed the matter in detail earlier. His

satisfied by the provisions in the Bill. They give Parliament the

that at some
length.</div>
					<a name="070125104000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the idea
of a parliamentary commission for official statistics, I have said
before that statistical production is essentially an Executive function
and most appropriately located within Government, rather than
Parliament. Statistics are a public good and serve a wide range of
users. That view was supported during consultation and by the Treasury
Committee report earlier this year. In addition, we considered and
rejected the proposals published by the Conservative party. We looked
to international experience and systems, and the only country in the
world that we could find where the statistics system is the
responsibility of the legislature, not the Executive, is
Mongolia.</div>

						</b> In 1995, we had virtually no system for securing
the quality and independence of statistics, nor any reform of the
system for decades. It was only in 2000, as part of this
Government&#146;s reform process, that we created a basis on which to
build. In fact, that was the most thorough reform of the statistical
system for nearly 30 years; it completely changed the system and the
views of the way in which it needed to develop. If the hon. Lady wishes
to take the matter up with the current Leader of the House, she will
find that he is one of the strongest supporters in the Government of
the Bill and its
provisions.</div>

Marris:
						</b> My hon. Friend mentioned Mongolia. Quite often in
the Committee the evidence of the chief statistician of Canada to the
Select Committee has been prayed in aid. Is my hon. Friend aware of any
of the 14 legislatures in Canada employing a model akin to the one
proposed in the
amendment?</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000277"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I well know my hon. Friend&#146;s expertise and
experience. He has lived in Canada and may even be a British and
Canadian dual citizen, so he may know Canada better than any other
member of the Committee. He is quite right that Canada has a distinct
federal structure, but the federal responsibility of the statistician
in Canada is quite different from the central statistical service
function in the United Kingdom. As I have explained to the Committee
before, there is no appropriate universal model when considering the
reforms. Any country, with its different circumstances, history, forms
of government and policy, will rightly and inevitably require a
statistical system suited to itself. In the legislation, we are setting
up an innovative system that is breaking new ground, and there is
simply no automatic precedent anywhere else in the
world.</div>
					<a name="070125104000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
proposal of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet, we have discussed why
both the National Audit Office and the Electoral Commission in
principle are not appropriate comparators. I did not merely refer to
plans for a new way of funding the statistics board in the future, as
she suggested, but gave a commitment on how the Government would do
that. I gave a commitment to the House on Second Reading, on the Floor
of the House.</div>
					<a name="070125104000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Sevenoaks rehearsed again for the Committee the view on
funding taken by the Treasury Committee. He will accept, I think, that
the proposals for funding as they stood when the Select Committee
undertook its inquiry, the Canadian chief statistician gave his
evidence, the Committee reported and the Government gave their formal
response are different from the ones that we have before us. Only on
Second Reading, after the Committee reported and the Government
formally responded, was I able to set out in more detail the
commitments on
funding.</div>
					<a name="070125104000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
benefit of the Committee, I shall clarify those commitments. To meet
the key requirementsof the new statistical system of
independence, transparency and flexibility, we will guarantee the board
funding certainty over periods of five years, in direct contrast to the
normal spending review period and process of setting such funding
commitments. In addition, that certainty will be guaranteed through the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 277</div>setting of a transparent formula, so that annual resources are given to
the board in each of the five years. Furthermore, funding for the
census will also be set for a five-year period and integrated into the
overall budget of the board. Parliament must then hold the board to
account for the way in which it allocates and controls its resources,
in the same way as Parliament holds the Government to account for
decisions such as resource allocation. As I said, the role of
Parliament in scrutinising the new system will be central, including in
matters of funding and resources for the board. On that basis, I hope
that the hon. Lady will not press her amendment to a
vote.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000278"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I shall turn first to the questions asked by the
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West. As I said in my opening
remarks, I believe that the nearest funding parallels are the Electoral
Commission and the National Audit Office. The parallels are not exact,
but they are useful precedents, having something in common with what is
proposed here.</div>
					<a name="070125104000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether I could give specific examples of alleged
political interference using the budget process. No, I do not have such
examples and I made it clear that I was referring to the anxieties that
people had expressed about the potential for such interference. My hon.
Friends may come up with such examples, but I have not heard of any,
although my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks is right to make it
plain that the Treasury Committee and many people who gave evidence to
it were very anxious about the issue. Again, it is a matter of
perception; if people believe that there is potential for interference
using the Treasury&#146;s powers over the budget, it will diminish
the strength of the Government&#146;s proposed reforms.</div>
					<a name="070125104000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful for the
Minister&#146;s comments, but he still has not responded to all the
concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks, particularly about
what the board will do if it is not satisfied with its budget, how the
negotiations will take place and who will speak up for the board in
negotiating with the Treasury. The Minister says repeatedly that
Parliament will have the strongest scrutiny role in respect of the new
structures. I welcome the rhetoric but I cannot see how
Parliament&#146;s role will be different in that context to scrutiny
of any other non-ministerial department.</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000279"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The case for a greater role for Parliament in
scrutinising the operation of the new system is not just rhetoric; it
is contained in and provided for in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000280"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:

explain again how Parliament&#146;s role is different in that context
from its scrutiny of the activities of any
department.</div>

							<a name="070125104000281"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> We have rightly heard much from the Financial
Secretary in praise of the tremendous leadership of my hon. Friend the.
Member for Sevenoaks in the Treasury Sub-Committee. My hon. Friend
raised a number of pertinent points and recommendations made by the
Sub-Committee, on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 278</div>which a number of us served, on this issue. Hasthe Financial
Secretary followed up any of those
recommendations?</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000282"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I, too, look forward to hearing the
Minister&#146;s response to that
question.</div>
					<a name="070125104000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s final point to counter the amendment was that
statistics are an executive function of government. They are certainly
important for the operation of government, but regardless of whether
one sees them as strictly part of an executive function, that in itself
is no reason why a parliamentary Committee cannot be in charge of the
budget, whether or not statistics are part of the executive functions
of government. How is that relevant in deciding which organisation
should determine the budget and what the structure should
be?</div>
					<a name="070125104000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister was
disdainful of the model we propose, which he said had no precedent
anywhere in the world apart from Mongolia. Although the Leader of the
House advocated that model, a couple of minutes after referring again
to the Mongolian example, the Minister went on to say that he is
breaking new ground. When we challenged him on the structures proposed
earlier in the Bill about the mix of executive and scrutiny functions
he said that there was no parallel and that the Government were doing
something completely different. International models to match our
proposal may be limited, but he was unable to find any other model,
either in the UK or across the world, that matched the structure that
he proposes.</div>
					<a name="070125104000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
still disappointed that we have not had more detail on how the
five-year funding formula will work. The Minister said that there will
be a transparent formula, but who will set it? When will Parliament
know what it is? Will it be subject to variations and modifications?
Will it be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and, if so, what sort of
parliamentary scrutiny? Many questions are left unanswered, and I shall
seek to divide the Committee on the amendment.
</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000283"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> The longer the debate continues the more important
my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment appears. She has been making the case
that it is not apparent how Parliament&#146;s role will be
strengthened by the Government&#146;s proposals. Indeed, it is fairly
evident that Parliament&#146;s role in the statistical function of
the budget process could be weakened.</div>
					<a name="070125104000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament&#146;s job is not
only to scrutinise the money; it is to vote the money. We will be
confronted with a proposed sum that is fixed for five years. It is not
clear how that will be increased year by year, but we have been told
that there will be some form of indexation. Parliament will therefore
have no role at all in modifying the amount to meet any new
requirements that might emerge, to respond to the unhappiness of the
board about its funding for the discharge of a particular function or
to implement recommendations that might be made from one year to the
next. The purpose of Parliament is to vote the money. If the Minister
is proposing that that expenditure is taken outside the normal process
of parliamentary approval and locked away for five years, it is
incumbent on him to give us more detail as to how the budget will
change year by year.</div>

we were able to cover.</div>
					<a name="070125104000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said on Second Reading,
we are using the Bill as an opportunity to establish, finally, proper
employment rights for registration officers in England and Wales.
Currently, they are appointed and paid by a local authority, but can be
dismissed only by the Registrar General. They do not, therefore, enjoy
the rights and protections afforded to other staff, such as access to
an employment tribunal. That has for some time been a great concern for
my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East. The provisions in
this part of the Bill are in no small measure due directly to his
continuing efforts on the subject. He may well wish to add his own
comments on
that.</div>

officers provide a vital service that benefits all of us in the
community. Almost all of us will come into contact with the
registration service at some point in our lives&#151;normally at the
most important moments in our lives and the lives of our families. It
is only right and proper that this group of workers is given for the
first time the rights and protections that are already available to
others.</div>
					<a name="070125104000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Registration Service Act 1953, the Registrar General for England and
Wales is currently a statutory office holder, appointed by Her Majesty,
with functions set out in statute. That has been the position since the
post was created in 1836. The Registrar General has statutory functions
relating to the civil registration service, but also has other,
statistical, responsibilities such as conducting the census. Under the
Bill, the Registrar General&#146;s current statistical functions will
become the responsibility of the statistics 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 280</div>board. The Registrar General will remain as head of the General Register
Office and will retain his or her responsibility for civil registration
in England and
Wales.</div>
					<a name="070125104000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 65
modernises the position of the Registrar General, who is head of the
civil registration servicein England and Wales, by
establishing him as a corporation sole. I concede that that does not
sound very modern, but a corporation sole is an office occupied by one
person that has a separate legal identity from the office holder. Also,
the office continues to exist even if the office holder retires and is
replaced, or if there is a vacancy in the post. Currently, the rights
and liabilities of the Registrar General are personally held by the
office holder on behalf of the Crown. Establishing the Registrar
General as a corporation sole means that the rights and liabilities of
the office of Registrar General are separated from the office holder
and the rights and liabilities become the responsibility of the office,
rather than the office holder. That means that in the future the
Registrar General could enter into contracts in his or her own right
and such contracts would be the responsibility of the office, rather
than the office
holder.</div>
					<a name="070125104000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Separating
the Registrar General from the National Statistician, and the General
Register Office from the Office for National Statistics, will reinforce
the ability of the Registrar General to operate independently, while
still allowing the General Register Office to be incorporated into a
wider structure if that is what is determined. I hope that the
Committee will accept that that flexibility is sensible and desirable,
given that the location of the General Register Office has still to be
finally determined. It has been considered as part of potential
machinery of government changes. On that basis, I hope that hon.
Members will agree that clause 65 should stand part of the

							<b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): It is strange how
one gets involved in business in this place. In the mid-1990s, I was a
director of the city challenge in Bolton and we were looking around for
flagship schemes. I proposed to the then leader of the council, Bob
Howarth, that we should bring back into use an old hall on a hill
overlooking Bolton that was in a rather attractive park. The hall had
been boarded up for several years. It had previously been a mill
owner&#146;s house. I proposed that we move the registration service
in Bolton out of dreadful premises in the town centre&#151;where the
brides came out into patches of oil on a taxi rank&#151;to that
lovely old hall set in a beautiful park. That cost &#163;1 million,
but it was achieved.</div>
					<a name="070125104000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The registration service there
today supports a community centre, a hospitality suite with bars, and
so on. I was pleased to hear that it celebrated its 10th anniversary
last week and that Oliver Barton, who was the principal officer at the
time, returned and helped 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 281</div>them celebrate. I was pleased in one way, but not so pleased in another,
when my eldest daughter, Sally, chose to get married in Mere
hall&#151;the lovely old hall that I am talking about&#151;right in
the middle of the election campaign, which brought me to the House in
1997.</div>
					<a name="070125104000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">When Joyce
Quin, the former hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West
was promoted to the other place as Baroness Quin, the Society of
Registration Officers was casting around for a new patron for England
and Wales. It was no surprise, therefore, when my name popped up. I was
initially pleased to be invited, because I thought that it was a great
honour, but it soon dawned on me that the society was giving me a huge
responsibility, because it was seeking to achieve what the Bill will,
hopefully, bring about. It has taken 10 years of campaigning. I have
lost count of how many Ministers I have met, both at the Department of
Trade and Industry and the Treasury, with officers of the Society of
Registration Officers and, latterly, Unison to try to bring about this
measure.</div>
					<a name="070125104000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is odd
that registration officers are appointed, housed and paid by local
authorities and that their pensions are arranged by local authorities,
but only one person&#151;the Registrar General in Pimlico,
London&#151;has the right to dismiss them. When I began this campaign
there was no right of appeal against dismissal. At least in the early
days of the campaign we won the right of appeal, but appeals had to be
heard by the Registrar General in Pimlico and he could hear them only
on the basis of new
evidence.</div>
					<a name="070125104000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">During my
time as the society&#146;s patron at least 18 members of the service
have been dismissed&#151;some of them under bitter circumstances that
I do not want to
relate.</div>

thought that it was very considerate of the House authorities to sound
the wedding bells right in the middle of my speech.<i class="I">
[Laughter.]</i>
					</div>
					<a name="070125104000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
clause 66 will do is transfer the employment of superintendent
registrars and their colleagues to the employment of local authorities,
which is what we have been campaigning for all this time. The Society
of Registration Officers&#151;SORO&#151;tells me that it has
historical records to suggest that this campaign has been going on for
60 years. I have documentary evidence to suggest that it started at
least in 1985 in the House when an efficiency scrutiny was published
which recommended this transfer of
employment.</div>

							<a name="070125104000305"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has been very helpful in
explaining the genesis of the campaign, which has resulted in this
measure. As patron of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 282</div>Society of Registration Officers, can he tell us what proportion of
registration officers are members of the society and what other
consultation took place with registrars who were members of Unison or
other groups to ensure consultation across the whole
profession?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000306"></a>The

						</b> Order. The hon. Lady should not be tempting my
colleague into talking about something that is not actually in the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000307"></a>Dr.
Iddon:
						</b> I will give a brief answer. I cannot give a
percentage, but I know that the figure is extremely high and that the
consultation has been going on for as long as I have been involved with
the campaign. There are one or two members of SORO who still recognise
that the status of being a statutory officer is rather special, but
frankly I think that it is an outdated status, and it causes problems.
What we are doing in clause 66 is the correct way
forward.</div>
					<a name="070125104000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another difficulty in the transfer in that statutory officers, as
registration officers are, do not have any official employer and
therefore on the whole do not come under employment legislation. This
area is a bit grey and rather complex, as the Library research paper
suggests. Under some of the employment legislation they could be
classed as workers, but there have not been many court cases to test
this. Myself, Unison and SORO have campaigned on two parallel tracks,
one of which has resulted in clause 66, and we have also campaigned
with the Department of Trade and Industry to bring in section 23 of the
Employment Act
2002.</div>
					<a name="070125104000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">This clause is
a better way forward, as the Library research paper suggests. To apply
section 23 would have left registration officers in that grey area and
there would have been some court cases before it was illustrated that
employment rights could be protected under the Employment
Act.</div>
					<a name="070125104000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Financial Secretary for taking on board what is essentially my
ten-minute Bill from the last Session of Parliament. He has listened,
and I am grateful for that, as are all the people concerned.</div>
					<a name="070125104000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have mentioned, clause 66
and part 2 have the support of SORO and Unison. They also have the
support of the Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services and
the employers&#146; organisation as well. One problem remains;
because registration officers have no legal employer, the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 do not apply
to them. Therefore, I am very pleased that the Government have seen
their way to build into clause 66 protection of all the employment
rights of that group of workers. Incidentally, there are 1,700
registration officers&#151;not a large number, but a significant one.
The clause protects the employment and pension rights of those people
when they are transferred. Their service will be seen as continuous, so
that their pension rights will transfer into the schemes of local
authorities, which in any case already organise their
pensions.</div>
					<a name="070125104000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
be inappropriate of me not to thank Karen Knapton this afternoon. She
has worked with me for many years as the honorary secretary of the
Society of Registration Officers. She has now retired, and she 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 283</div>would have liked to have seen this campaign bear fruit today. I am now
continuing my work with Julie Hole, the present honorary secretary. I
thank those people. I will be able to go to the conference this spring
and give my 10th and valedictory speech&#151;as Members know, I am
retiring. Instead of trying to find excuses for the Government, as I
have done at all my annual presentations in the past nine years, I will
be able to go out on a high note. Bearing in mind what you said at the
beginning of this part of the debate, Mr. Olner, I thank you
for your
patience.</div>

							<a name="070125104000308"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I welcome the chance to say a few words
about the employment status of registration officers in England and
Wales. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the
important work undertaken by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East on
the issue. As we have heard, he has been campaigning tirelessly for
many years and he deserves a huge amount of credit for the
measure.</div>
					<a name="070125104000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition welcome the changes. We would have been happy if the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s private Member&#146;s Bill had proceeded a few
years ago. That did not happen, thanks to the late great Eric Forth.
He, of course, had firm opinions about the use of private
Member&#146;s Bill time for Government business. We are delighted to
see that the Government have used their own business time to propose
the measure to regularise the employment position of registrars and
superintendent registrars. It is clear that the law needs changing, and
I would like to join the Financial Secretary in paying tribute to the
work done by registrars at important and sometimes stressful ceremonies
in people&#146;s family lives. They deal with the public with great
care and sensitivity. I would particularly like to single out the
registrars working in my constituency in Chipping Barnet for their
valuable work.</div>
					<a name="070125104000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
support the move to make registrars local authority employees and to
provide them with employment rights and protection. It seems not only
sensible but just and consistent to bring the employment of
registration officers into line with that of employees of local
authorities. I am sure that the change will be welcomed by
organisations that have long campaigned for it, such as SORO, Unison
and the other organisations to which the hon. Gentleman
referred.</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000226"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
					<a name="070125104000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is one
point on which I seek reassurancefrom the Minister. I have
received a representation from one registration officer who is unhappy
with the Government&#146;s proposals. She fears that the changes
could remove one of the safeguards relating to the registration of
deaths. Registration officers decide whether to refer a death to the
coroner. The registrar in question is concerned that if registration
officers and coroners become local authority employees, that will in
some way interfere with the freedom of registrars to take a decision in
the public interest. Since I have not heard from any other registrars
on the point, it is reasonable to conclude that that is a minority
concern, but because it has been raised with me it would be useful to
hear the Financial Secretary&#146;s view. Is he confident that the
Bill will ensure that sufficient 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 284</div>safeguards are still in place on the registration of deaths? Have such
concerns been brought to his
attention?</div>
					<a name="070125104000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to the Association of Registration and Celebratory Services, some
concern has been expressed that registrars would suffer a loss of
independenceif they became local authority employees. My
understanding is that such concerns seem largely to have been laid to
rest and that the reform is broadly welcomed not just by members on
both sides of the Committee but by a significant majority of
registration officers. We welcome the proposals and would be grateful
for clarification on the points that I have
mentioned.</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000309"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Bolton, South-East, on the wonderful work that he has done on this
matter. Will the Financial Secretary clarify one point? Clause 66(8)
defines a local authority. Will a unitary authority such as
Wolverhampton, where my constituency is located, come under the rubric
of paragraph (b), which includes in that
definition</div>
					<a name="070125104000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a district
council in England for an area without a county
council&#148;?</div>
					<a name="070125104000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Wolverhampton
city council is not commonly described as a district council, and a
number of other authorities are in the same
position.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000310"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> I join everyone else in welcoming the
proposals and congratulating the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East on
his work in bringing them forward. It makes sense to deal with this
matter at the same time as changes to the statistics
system.</div>
					<a name="070125104000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
raise one issue&#151;the possibility of a registration officer
simultaneously holding theposition of deputy registration
officer. I have had correspondence, I suspect from the same person as
the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet. I believe that this person holds
the post of registration officer and is also deputy officer. Deputy
superintendent registrars and deputy registrars are already local
authority employees, so what impact will the clause have on people who
hold deputy as well as main registrar posts? That relates to
subsections (2)(c) and (d), which may well be clarified in subsections
(5)(a) and (b), but it is worth putting the matter on
record.</div>
					
					<a name="070125104000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070125104000311"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I shall first respond to the substantive
contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East.
He gave an eloquent and rather moving account of his work and what has
motivated it over the years. The progress that can be made through
private Member&#146;s legislation and the dividends that can come
from persistent pressure are a testament to the role of Members of the
House. His work on the matter is in the best traditions of the House
and the role of Members of
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="070125104000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will give about 1,700 registration officers status as local
government employees. For the first time, they will have access to the
tribunals, rights and protections that others have had for some time.
My hon. Friend is right. I made sure that clause 66 ensured that
registration officers&#146; existing terms and conditions were
retained after the formal transfer of employment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 285</div>status. Not least as a result of his work, the proposals command the
support of all bodies in this rather densely-populated field of local
government organisations. I listened to him carefully, but am not sure
whether he mentioned that Unison was strongly supportive of his Bill
and his campaign to secure this new status for registration officers.
When he goes to the annual conference of the Society of Registration
Officers later this year, he can give it the good news and, I hope,
convey the Government&#146;s and the Committee&#146;s good wishes.
The society provides a vital service and the change in the clause is
long overdue.</div>
					<a name="070125104000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concerns raised by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet have not been
brought to my attention before. The registration officer who contacted
her was concerned that registration officers&#146; important
discretion to refer a death to the coroner for further examination
would be affected. I see nothing in the legislation or the intention
behind it to suggest that that would be the case. However, I shall
double check and if I am wrong, shall let the hon. Lady and other
Committee members
know.</div>
					<a name="070125104000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to
my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, I should say
that the provisions in clause 66 include a comprehensive list of all
local authorities with registration functions. I think, therefore, that
his concerns are covered. In answer to the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne, deputies, like registration officers, will indeed become
local authority employees. In light of our debate, I hope that both
sides of the Committee will give a good loud shout in support of the
clause.</div>

Healey:
						</b> On a point of order, Mr. Olner. May I
pay tribute to you and your co-Chairman, Sir John? You have chaired our
Committee flexibly and firmly and have helped to guide us in giving due
scrutiny to all the provisions in the Bill. I am particularly grateful
to the Clerks for the advice that they have given to you,
Mr. Olner, to us and to the officials. I pay tribute to the
Official Reporters; some of the technical points that I have made might
have been a bit obscure and hard to follow&#151;as I daresay some of
my arguments have been&#151;but they have done a marvellous job. The
same is true of the police and the staff of the House, who have ensured
the smooth running of our proceedings during the past two
weeks.</div>
					<a name="070125104000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also pay
tribute to the Opposition Front-Bench spokespeople: the hon. Members
for Chipping Barnet, for Fareham, for Twickenham and for Falmouth and
Camborne. I also thank the hon. Member for Dundee, East, who represents
both his Front Bench and his Back Bench in the Committee. Minority
parties do not always take their place in legislative Committees. He is
not in his place this afternoon, but he is particularly assiduous in
carrying out the duties for his party on the Treasury brief, and I
welcome his interest in serving on the Committee, not least because of
Scotland&#146;s decision 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 286</div>to be a full part of the Bill, which is equally strongly supported by my
hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire, who is in his place this
afternoon.</div>
					<a name="070125104000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
grateful to all Back-Bench Members of the Committee. They might not
make the Minister&#146;s job easier, but I welcome the contributions
from both sides of the Room to the scrutiny of legislation in
Committee. At the profound risk of singling some out but not
others&#151;it is like judging a beautiful baby competition&#151;I
must say that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks has brought to our
proceedings his usual forensic examination of the Bill. He chaired the
Treasury Committee&#146;s inquiry, has spoken widely at conferences
and to interest groups, and is therefore highly knowledgeable on the
subject.</div>
					<a name="070125104000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must also
mention my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth.
He has brought to our deliberations the passion that he showed in
government for the people responsible for policy and public services
locally. He has been clear in insisting that we use the new statistical
system to recognise their role and to help them play it
better.</div>
					<a name="070125104000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East has worked for so long and
pursued so many paths&#151;and Ministers&#151;to put the employment
of registration officers on a proper footing. I am pleased to be the
Minister who is finally able to do so, not least because it will save
so many of my colleagues from his assiduous attention. My hon. Friend
the Member for Portsmouth, North, has played a necessarily low-key role
in the Committee&#146;s proceedings, but one that is vital and
appreciated by any Minister.</div>
					<a name="070125104000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West has contributed with his usual attention to
detail, both of the Bill and of debates, and is a lesson to us all in
providing active Back-Bench scrutiny of legislation. This is the first
such Committee on which he and I have served together in which he has
not mentioned the explanatory notes accompanying the Bill, except when
I mentioned them first. If he wants to correct me, I will check the
official record to see whether I have made a mistake&#151;on second
thoughts, I will not, but I guess that he
might.</div>

acceptable use of a word as a noun rather than an adjective for the
contents of the sewers of Slough. The hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire broke new ground too, when he proposed incorporating two
minutes on the naughty step as a sanction for board members. I have
persuaded parliamentary counsel to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 287</div>have another look at the concept of misbehaviour, but they regarded that
as a step too far. <i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Laughter.</i>

described this part of our proceedings as Oscar-winning stuff. In that

mother-in-law or, indeed, Mrs. Gauke. Finally, the hon.
Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford and the Lord Commissioner of Her
Majesty's Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West have
done an excellent job of keeping us on track, in making sure that we
have given due scrutiny to the Bill but in an efficient way. I have
particularly valued the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for

thank, in his absence, my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham for
handling the Bill from the Front Bench for me, as well as the team
behind me: my hon. Friends the Members for Braintree and for South-West

the Financial Secretary got there

welcome and agree warmly with the tributes paid by the Financial

Government&#146;s.</div>
					<a name="070125104000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to the Financial
Secretary, much of what he has told us in Committee has provided
welcome clarification. As he will be aware, there are a number of
points on which we will continue our campaign to

Mr. Olner. On behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for
Twickenham and myself, I thank you for your support and for ensuring
both that we got through the Bill in a timely way and that sufficient
scrutiny was undertaken. At times, debates on some groups of amendments
became complicated, and we appreciate your guidance, which was
essential in ensuring that we kept in order. We also appreciate the
effort that the Clerks made to keep up with our ramblings. I also thank
the Official Reporters for their help, and I thank the police and staff
of the House for making sure that everything proceeded
smoothly.</div>
					<a name="070125104000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it were
a beautiful baby competition, everyone would have gone home with a
prize for their contributions. We have had some interesting debates and
we have covered a wide range of issues in the past couple of weeks. The
Financial Secretary has been helpful and productive in dealing with the
matters that Liberal Democrat Members have raised. That may be why my
hon. Friend the hon. Member for Twickenham was so moved; it sounds as
though he gave something akin to an Oscar acceptance speech. I am sure
that he treasures his amendment being agreed to more than he would
treasure an Oscar.</div>
					<a name="070125104000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the hon. Members for Chipping Barnet and for Fareham for being so
co-operative. This has been a fairly smooth Committee. We have
discussed some serious matters, but they have all been dealt with well.
