witnesses that we are bound by the internal knives that we agreed this
morning. That means that the first evidence session this afternoon must
end at no later than 5.15 pm, the second must end no later than 6.15
pm, and the third no later than 7 pm. I hope that I do not have to
interrupt either hon. Members or witnesses in the middle of their
sentences, but I will do so if necessary. We must stick strictly to
that timetable. It would be helpful to the <i class="I">Official Report</i> if
hon. Members would remember to speak into their microphones.</div>

general point, I am conscious of the number of pieces of legislation
affecting your job at the magistrates court. What level of consultation
have you had in relation to the Bill and what is your level of
confidence that it will see an improvement in the magistrates
court?</div>

						</i> We have been aware of some, if not all, of
the provisions because this particular Bill could have been another
one. A lot of things have been hanging around for a long time,
particularly the youth justice provisions. From the point of view of
consultation, we are aware of it now and have put in a briefing,
whether or not it will produce an improvement. There are some things
that we welcome and, as you can see from the briefing notes, there are
some things that we have concerns about. I think that we have a neutral
position.</div>

disadvantage. In some ways it is a welcome tidying-up because it brings
the youth provisions closer to those in the adult court. Having said
that, there are some concerns about whether they will confuse people.
Of course, everybody gets used to a change in legislation, but this

through the areas about which you have concerns. You mentioned the
flexibility in sentencing, which you welcomed, but one of the things
that has been taken away from you is the possibility of a suspended
prison sentence for summary offences. It was suggested to us this
morning by one of the officials from the Ministry of Justice that far
too many people are getting these sentences, breaching them, and then
having to go into custody to serve the custodial aspect of the
sentence. I suggested to that official that perhaps one of the reasons
why they are getting suspended sentences for summary offences is that
they are persistent offenders and the courts have come to the ends of
their tethers and there is no other option than to give them a
custodial sentence, but the courts check it by making it a suspended
sentence. Is that your
experience?</div>

						</i> That is certainly one way in which you can
end up with a suspended sentence. It need not only be a question of
ends of tethers and persistence. The offence can be so serious that a
custodial sentence is justified. Certainly, the option to step back
from that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>and to impose a suspended sentence is one that has been used, we
understand, in larger numbers than was originally

						</b> One of the things that the Government appear to
be fearful of is that, for good reasons or bad, they seem to be losing
control of the numbers of people in prison when there are not enough
places to put them in. They are looking for ways to reduce the number
of people being sent to prison by people within your association and
from the Crown court. Do you think that the abolition of your power to
give a suspended custodial sentence will have any bearing on the number
of people that magistrates send to
prison?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Cindy
Barnett:

						</i> There is an argument for saying that it
might possibly increase them because obviously before we impose a
suspended sentence we have to be certain that a custodial sentence is
appropriate and that we cannot step back to a community-based penalty.
Then if it is going to be custody, it cannot be suspended. So, if there
are cases in the future where we come to that conclusion and we cannot
suspend, it will mean an immediate custodial sentence. I definitely
cannot forecast the precise numbers.</div>

Bill dealing with youth justice that is a matter of
concern&#151;whether everybody in the Committee shares that concern
is neither here nor there&#151;is the compulsory fostering of
people&#146;s children by the state. This is apparently designed to
improve the chances of reducing reoffending, particularly among
children from what I would loosely, and rather pejoratively, call
dysfunctional families. Do you, as a magistrate, and you, as a
probation board chief executive and someone who has been a probation
officer, have anything to say about the sensible nature of that
disposal and the ability of the state&#151;be it a local authority or
a foster parent appointed by a local authority&#151;to see this as a
good

						</i> I can only give you a personal response. Our
association would not have an official view on that. It feels like a
good thing to do, but I would be sceptical about whether it will have
the sort of impact that people expect it to have. You would have to
take each case on its own merits, and there is a danger of the state
wanting to step in too quickly to intervene in people&#146;s lives.
But I think it is a very difficult issue, because each case is very
individual and has its own particular merits. I suppose personally,
based on my experience as a probation officer, I feel slightly
uncomfortable about the state taking more and more powers away from
individual people to manage their own lives. It is extremely difficult
and there are individual cases where children really ought to have been
taken away and fostered more quickly. I can see both sides of the

this: on the one side the Government say that if we abolish the

						</i> I do not think that I will produce a
particular offence, but let us say that an offence has been committed
that is obviously serious and we are considering what to do about it.
We must assess the seriousness in terms of both culpability and harm.
We add those two together, with culpability being the driving force,
and we come to the conclusion that the offence is so serious that a
custodial sentence is the only one that can be justified&#151;nothing
lower can be justified. That is a provisional view.</div>
					<a name="07101666000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then you reconsider and you may
hear personal mitigation and there may be further information. Whatever
it is, you are still considering after your provisional sentence and
you consider&#151;this is not only in the Act, but in guidance from
the Sentencing Guidelines Council&#151;whether or not you can step
back over the custody threshold and impose a high-end community
sentence. You may then come to the conclusion that, no, the offence is
so serious that only custody can do. Therefore, you are prepared to
commit the person to immediate custody.</div>
					<a name="07101666000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then the next question that you
ask yourself is this: can you suspend the sentence? Again, that is
stepping back, and it is very close to&#151;it looks very close
to&#151;a high-end community sentence. The guidance is that the
requirements that you attach to a suspended sentence order should be
fewer or less onerous than those that would be attached if it were a
high-end community order itself, because there is the threat of
prison&#151;because you have imposed a custodial sentence&#151;and
because the consequences of breach are liable to be different, with the
immediate sentence being activated upon breach as opposed to more

suspended sentence order is a custodial sentence&#151;we cannot get
away from that. We cannot make it a community sentence by virtue of the
fact that the custodial sentence is not going to be served immediately.

sentence order would have been imposed. The difficult with that is that
all cases are different, however, so it is extremely difficult to
confirm that impression. We have said that because of the importance of
the principle that a suspended sentence order cannot be imposed unless
the custody threshold has been crossed, we certainly accept that an
element of refreshing in training is always valuable. That is an
important lesson that we should have firmly before us on every
occasion.</div>

						</b> May I briefly move on to clause 58, which
concerns the extension of powers of non-legal staff&#151;designated
caseworkers&#151;in court? Obviously the objections to it come,
principally, from the trade unions for lawyers, or the professional
bodies, as they are otherwise known. I was interested that the

the role of non-professional-body staff in court. I wondered if you

						</i> That is a very practical point. We have
experience of designated caseworkers who are not able to continue with
a case in court because a particular legal point has arisen or there
has been a change in the circumstances which they are not able to deal
with owing to a lack of qualification, or some other reason. In that
circumstance, there is a delay. In some cases it matters less, if you
can swap a prosecutor in one court with a DCW in the other; but if
there is only one person in a court who is not available to switch
over, then a list may simply be shut down, which is absolutely
absurd.</div>
					<a name="07101666000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our main
concern is that anyone who presents a case to us in court should be

to withdraw because of practical difficulties or lack of qualifications

near-custody, it is extremely serious but we strain every nerve in the
youth court not to send young people in to custody unless it is
inevitable. If it is a first-timer who has pleaded guilty, our option
is a referral order and that simply seems far too far down the scale.
Even with promises of it being beefed up and made much more serious, we
are still handing the case over to another group of people. That is
what our court order entails: we make a referral order and it is sent
off for a contract to be drawn up and reparations and things like that.
We do not think that the referral order covers it, and we think that if
there was more flexibility at the top end, so that there could be a
serious high-end community sentence, it would reduce custody figures in

sort of people that these kinds of cautions are likely to be applied to
are the sort of people that we deal with anyway, and by and large they
tend to be unskilled and inexpert in dealing with those kinds of
engagements. They are very used to dealing with the police, but they
cannot make judgments about whether they are in a situation where
perhaps they ought to be pleading not guilty and going to court. They
may be putting themselves in a position where they allow themselves to
be cautioned, when perhaps they should not.</div>

						</i> I would say that there is a common-sense view
that&#151;as you see with motoring offences, for example&#151;as
offences become just one of the risks of life, people start to take
them less seriously. There is an issue of principle about whether you
hold the line and say that certain things are so serious that they must
be dealt with by a court. It is not just about ensuring that the
offender goes through a proper process in their own interests, it is
also about the way in which society deals with misbehaviour and
offending in general. You are right, there is a risk that you gradually
erode that barrier between what is serious and what is not so serious,
in the wrong direction. A lot of the people that we deal with would
start to see a caution as just one of things that perhaps you get on a
night out. I might be paraphrasing slightly, but there is a risk that
you start to erode things in the wrong
direction.</div>

that</div>

					<a name="07101666000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the principal

						</i> It came out of certain evaluations. I am not
sure whether they were final evaluations, but they were certainly
preliminary looks at adult conditional cautioning schemes. In some
cases, putting the conditions in place took more time than if somebody
came to court. Conditional cautioning is a more complicated process
than a fixed penalty of whatever sort. In itself, it has more time
built in.</div>
					<a name="07101666000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going back
to the previous point, we would also say that there is an element of
confusion and a lack of boundary, particularly for young people in
these provisions, because you can go through so many forms of pre-court
intervention before you end up in front of a court. That can have two
negative effects. First, wild confusion for the young person, who may
not take seriously what they ought to take seriously. Secondly, it
ratchets up so much by the time the case gets to court a person may not
be in a very good position. That is entirely wrong. There are already a
great number of pre-court interventions that are not formal. Youth
offending teams and police get involved with young people. There are
many things, such as acceptable behaviour contracts, that are not
criminal sanctions, but voluntary contracts. There is an enormous
amount of good work, which we support as much and for as long as
possible.</div>
					<a name="07101666000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">When you
get to a conditional caution, you are dealing with behaviour that is
deemed serious enough to be dealt with&#151;with strings attached,

to court. We would say that that is wrong.</div>

being a probation officer 25 or 30 years ago. Then it was reasonably
common for prostitutes to be placed on short probation orders for about
six months if fines had not worked. My experience of those days is that
such a measure had very little impact on them at all. However, times
have moved on. We know that there are a lot of young women, as you just
described, who are dependent on prostitution because of their drug
habit, and there may be quite a lot of coercion behind that. My feeling
is that the sessions are generally a good thing. We want to bring those
women into contact with somebody who could offer them some help. In the
course of doing that, you will pick up a lot of women who choose to be
prostitutes and do not want to be helped. That is their lifestyle
choice. However, if you can start to reach women who are afraid, need
help and do not know how to get it, then that would be a good

to your powers which is dealing with people who are not before the

because of concerns about doing that, which seems a very major step to
take when somebody is not there in front of you, the provision might be
underused and there might be an adjournment. And, as we pointed out,
there is a provision in the Bill. It is not a question of someone being
stopped on the streets and hauled off to prison; they have to come
before a court. We are not sure that it would save a great deal of
time. For that reason we are not in favour
it.</div>

bench warrant or you make inquiries about the absence of the defendant.
The problem is not in the court process; the problem is finding a
police officer to bring the man or woman in. There seem to me to be
practical policing measures which could probably solve the issue rather

						</b> There is that and other measures in the earlier
part of the Bill on tariff setting. Clause 12, &#147;Indeterminate
sentences: determination of tariffs&#148;, is rather complicated. It
obviously could have a bearing on the release date if there were
sufficient courses for the offenders to get on to so that they could go
before the relevant release authority and could come out before you had
to supervise
them.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Christine
Lawrie:
							</b>
						</i> As you are probably aware, there has been a
marked trend towards large numbers of indeterminate sentences, much
more than anyone could have expected. That has had an impact that we
did not expect in respect of &#147;silting up&#148; the prisons and
creating a demand on both the prison and probation services. We are
particularly concerned not so much at the sentencing point, because we
accept what we are given by the courts, but on the recall and release
from prison after recall. As well as the opportunity to appeal, at the
moment there is the gate through which all recalls go, which is the
assessment by the Parole
Board.</div>
					<a name="07101666000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make
two points: one is an issue of principle, while the other is a
practical issue of demand and resources. The proposals will hinge
heavily on the risk assessment that is made by the probation staff
member at the point of recall. I understand that that will be the only
risk assessment and it will determine whether people fall into the
automatic release category, or whether they have to take the additional
assessment route. Presumably, most prisoners who feel that they have
been unfairly categorised at that point will choose to go through the
appeal process. That will put an increasing demand on probation staff
to do the paperwork and attend oral hearings when such matters will be
contested. That is my understanding of how the system will
work.</div>
					<a name="07101666000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be a
particular training and development issue for us to make sure that we
get those risk assessments right. It is a skill, but it will also
require an element of judgment. We are worried about the demand that it
will place on our staff to attend oral hearings and deal with the
appeal processes. That demand and resource issue worries us because of
sheer demand and making sure that people are absolutely well trained to
undertake the right assessments and make the right
decisions.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07101666000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come now to
the wider issue of principle. A few years ago, there was a drive to
make sure that the probation service recalled everyone who ought to be
recalled. There was a feeling that we did not recall sufficient people
swiftly enough. That was a fair criticism; we were a bit too relaxed
about matters. Over the past few years, one of the success stories of
the probation service has been getting our recall practice right. When
I was a chief officer two years ago, we were recalling maybe 20 per
cent. of prisoners who were eligible, and I think the number has risen
since then.</div>
					<a name="07101666000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
then, I think in order to try to control the prison population, we have
moved gradually towards more of a revolving door approach, where
prisoners are recalled but come out again to continue to serve their
licence period in the community. This is a further move in that
direction, as the recall becomes automatic except for the most
dangerous prisoners.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>
					<a name="07101666000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The probation service originally
would have been quite uncomfortable about the idea of recall being such
a central part of our professional work, but it changed its views over
time. It gave a real credibility and impetus to that supervision in the
community on licence. There was a real threat&#151;if people did not
comply, they knew that they were going back&#151;and that helped the
work of probation officers in making their relationship with that
prisoner stick. Our concern is that although I would not go so far as
to say that it will become a game, prisoners will now know that it
almost does not matter&#151;that you can behave badly or reoffend
when you are on licence and have a 28-day window of opportunity when
you can maybe persuade the parole board to let you out, and you will
certainly be out within 28 days. That makes it more difficult for
probation staff to have an authoritative relationship with those
offenders.</div>
					<a name="07101666000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I feel
uncomfortable about a situation where, apparently to control the prison
population, we are doing something that will&#151;perhaps not
immediately, but over time&#151;erode the authority that probation
staff have over the people who they supervise on licence. Our ability
to protect the public hinges on that authority, and it worries me that
we are making that a weaker authoritative relationship for another
reason.</div>

						</i> Obviously, various checks and balances are
built in and there is the chance of further recall. Apart from the
additional resource implications of the extra burden on the probation
service&#151;there will be an extra demand&#151;it gives a
particular message to offenders. Until recently, it was clear-cut. The
licence was the prison sentence served in the community, and there was
little argument about it. That was a healthy environment.
Notwithstanding the fact that what you say is right, and that people
can be re-recalled, it creates a kind of ambiguity, and that is a bad
message to give, particularly to habitual and serious offenders. If we
are going to do things about the prison population, which we need to
do, from a probation point of view there are other things that it might
be better to do. Recall has been such a success story and such a public
protection success story that I do not like to see it watered
down.</div>

Bill being driven by the need to deal with the prison population. One
of the other things that the probation boards and probation services
have to supervise, in addition to those who are released early on
licence, are those who are released from custody on licence under the
ECL system. At the moment they are released 18 days early, if they
belong to a certain category of prison, and most of these people are
relatively short-term prisoners. Could you explain what the probation
service does in the last 18 days of a custodial sentence to help
resettle the prisoners in the outside world?</div>

done. We would try to find accommodation and try to help them find

best, because that is what we are paid to do, but we would feel
uncomfortable about picking up the fallout from trying to chip away at
the prison population, which is a good thing. There is clearly an issue
that needs to be resolved, but we would say that it is a bigger problem
than can be resolved simply by taking small slices of the prison
population and giving them to the probation service in a variety of
ways. We would argue strongly for looking at it as a whole problem. It
could perhaps be solved more imaginatively and sensibly by looking at
it as a global problem, not constantly carving out a few prison places
here and there by small bits of release and other activity through
early

they understand it, on the apprehension of illegal immigrants at large
in the United Kingdom. I want to ask about that because it seems to me

should encourage those three people to make their own way to the

have pointed out, while we agree with many of the aspects of the Bill,
there are a number that will have significant resource implications for
the police service. We will start to become the first point of call,

						</b> My second question on immigration issues is
based on evidence submitted by your colleagues in the Police Federation
who have recommended the creation of legislation that would allow a
constable to demand of a person proof of identity when the constable
had grounds to believe that the person in question intended to enter or
leave the United Kingdom. In their evidence, they say that, currently,
officers only have the right to request to see passports, and that many
individuals&#151;for example, those subject to a football banning
order&#151;are acutely aware of that and decline. Is that a concern
that you
share?</div>

						</i> Yes, we have proposed that particular change
on several occasions. Unfortunately, it has not been taken up and
included in a Bill. Sometimes I think that Bills going through do not
have the time for additional clauses to be added. In some
cases&#151;particularly with football banning orders&#151;we do not
have the power to demand a person&#146;s passport, even when we
suspect that they might be wanted on warrant. It seems absolutely
ludicrous that we have automatic licence plate recognition systems
going in and out of all of our ports and airports these days and that
we can tell whether the vehicle has a certificate of insurance or an
MOT and who the keeper is, but we cannot ask for their passport. Well,
we can ask, but we cannot demand, and I think that that is the
important
word.</div>

receive rehabilitation and the support that they need within the
community.</div>
					<a name="07101666000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that a conditional caution provides more opportunities than a severe

it, but it does keep that young person out of the court system for a
little longer. I do not think that it is suitable for every young
person, but it is an option that has been made available to adults and
it is an alternative sanction that will keep people out of the courts
and therefore speed up other court proceedings. However, I do not think
that it is the perfect solution for adults and I do not think that it
is the perfect solution for 16 and 17-year-olds

makes a mockery of speedier justice. Therefore, our view is that, as in
many situations, if you can get the person to a magistrates court

offending team works effectively&#151;there are areas in which they
do not&#151;it is vital that they are part of the decision-making

extremely unlikely that the team have not met such a person&#151;they

conditional cautioning is that you could have a situation in which a
person fails to comply with the conditions and ends up before a court.
Under the Bill, the CPS will decide those conditions. A person might
never appear before a court for the original conditional cautioning
offence, because the decision has been made by the CPS and the police
enforce its decision. If there is a failure to comply, a person could
end up before, and receive a sanction from, the court, without the
court knowing of their substantive original offence. In such a case,
the court would be dealing with the cautioning, which is why we would
like a move toward making magistrates the people who set
conditions.</div>

of interpretation would need to be applied to homophobia, otherwise you

extent, because you are allowing it to continue. But, again, I do not

anything else, if you are going to close premises down, depending on

						</i> It depends on what type of premises we are
talking about and where they are, but if they were in a residential
area and were a substantial hall or something like that, depending on
how many people were there, you would probably need in excess of 200
officers to close them down. It really depends on the nature of the
premises. A couple of years ago, when we had one of the terror threats,
there were lots of comments about how many police officers were either
at the scene or in the vicinity. If we had literally to close off a
whole area, 250 police officers would go nowhere, so we should not
underestimate the resource implications. If you have to close an area
or building down, you need a number of officers to protect people going
in and prevent people going out. You need to have people to deal with
every single person in there, so there is an audit trail of everything
that takes place. When you are making these rules, these are not
actions that we will take lightly, because we will need to ensure that
we have got the resources to deal with them. Otherwise, we could make
the situation worse by attempting to close down premises when we do not
have the resources to deal with the implications of that.

think that this is more directed at protecting NHS staff. What it does
is to make a separate offence, so that if a person refuses to leave,
having been asked to do so, it provides us with not an aggravating
factor, but certainly an actual offence. I think it sends an important
message to NHS staff, who face the most awful circumstances, and not
just on Friday and Saturday nights, that we care about them. We have an
offence of assaulting a police officer, which I would not want to
disappear from the statute books. I think that all public sector
workers should be properly protected by the law, because they perform
extremely difficult tasks, and it would send an important message to

describe. It is even less simple to interpret. Again, although my

the amount of violent images in society at large. One of the
justifications for bringing forward this very worthy set of clauses is
the fact that people looking at violent pornography could commit
violent acts&#151;there could be a link between looking at that
pornography and committing a violent act. I think that when you
answered the question, you said that more general violence can have
implications. For example, we know that there are many hugely violent
video games in which casual murder is glorified. Do you see that as an
area of concern as well? Huge numbers of young people are being knifed
and gunned down on our streets. Do you think that there is a link

people within society who are more susceptible to watching something
and then going out and doing it. There is a whole host of other people
who can watch exactly the same programme and it will not make any

people throwing stones off motorway bridges; the following day, there

						</b> I want to pick up on the responses to the
Minister concerning the homophobic hatred proposal. You expressed
support for an additional law in relation to homophobic hatred. Could
you give specific examples from police members about the type of
incident that are not presently covered by legislation that would need,
and indeed would justify and form the basis for supporting, an
additional law on homophobic
hatred?</div>

								Jan

							</b>
						</i> I do not think that I can give you very many
examples, other than to say that I think that this is another area
where the law can be seen to support particular people. There are
probably hundreds of pieces of legislation whereby, if a person is
inciting hatred, there would be an offence somewhere that would cater
for that. Somehow, however, when it is inciting hatred around race or
around homophobia, it adds another dimension to that particular hatred
and I think that the law has to recognise that. Particularly with many
aspects of homophobia, it is not something that is easily seen by the
eye and therefore it can have a greater effect on the person who is on
the receiving end of it.</div>

it.</div>

						</i> We have two ways of dealing with this. I have
been a police officer for too many years now and I can remember when
homophobia was not outlawed in the way that it is today, and where
sexual orientation was outlawed, and where police officers spent far
too much time enforcing laws around sexual orientation. Today that does
not happen, so there has been a sea change in how police deal with this
particular area, and rightly so. A lot of my members are gay and the
type of treatment that they are given, sometimes within the service and
hopefully we are resolving that, but more importantly outside, where it
is known that they are gay, is outrageous. They have to deal with
enough difficulties without that being added on top. I think that those
are some of the examples that we would give.

have been used very sensibly and sensitively. I think that some of that
is because people are scared to use them, because they are not quite
sure how to deal with them. For that reason, I think that they have
been used sensitively. That might be, if you like, reverse logic. So,
whatever power that you give to the police service, you must be very

sensitive areas.</div>

it is not written in such a way that removes discretion from the police
officer. Police officers must be allowed to deal with situations as
they present themselves. If there are too many guidelines, the
officers&#146; hands are tied as to how they should deal with the
situation and that level of discretion is removed. Police officers need
to be allowed to make decisions using common sense and discretion,
without fearing that their decision will be finely examined and
criticised afterwards. That is why police officers stop doing certain
things.</div>

						</i> I am grateful for the question because the
Police Federation has worked very hard with ACPO and all partners,
including the Home Office, to draw together rules and regulations which
have the development of officers as their basis. Of officers who do not
do their job properly, 99.9 per cent. of them want to be able to do so.
So this is about reviewing how to do something and how to do it
properly. There has been much comment about lazy and incompetent police
officers, but those I have worked with are neither lazy nor
incompetent. Yes, like anyone else, we can make mistakes. The rules and
regulations should identify that, giving one the opportunity to
improve&#151;and if one does not take that opportunity one may in the
fullness of time become a liability. That is when one&#146;s service
should be dispensed with. I hope that ACPO uses these new regulations
in the way that is intended, allowing us to get on with the job but
also encouraging people to develop and to
learn.</div>

It might be a safe house if there are two or more, but if there are

have concerns over that, as we did with the original consultation,
which was quite a while ago. The consultation papers were feeling for
ideas on how to make what these women were doing safer, and suggested
that putting two or three together would help. Our biggest concern was
the knock-on effect for residents and neighbours, with calls to the
police and how to deal with people taking it upon themselves to deal
with matters. That was our main concern, but the consultation was some

women&#151;and children, for that matter&#151;legislation is not
the only solution. It is about what provisions can be made for such
people. From the policing point of view, it raises the awareness of
officers and of how they would know that they were dealing with
trafficked women. It is not something that they would come across every
day, although they do so increasingly often. Many police officers will
look at a woman who appears to be enjoying herself and think that she
is doing exactly what she wants to do. It is only when you look into
the circumstances of that particular woman that you find an underlying
tragic story. Legislation can do some things, but the first thing that
you must do is to have an awareness programme and an acknowledgment
that that is going on. Then you have to provide solutions for where you
are going to house people and what support services you will provide.
You do not go into that without having some understanding of the
resource implications required by the

protection around racial and religious hatred, there is no such
protection for gay people, and we are mindful that there has been an
increase in the incidence in recent years of what seem to us to be very
obvious examples of incitement to hatred that would not otherwise be
caught by the criminal law. One key area is in the creation and
distribution of what is quite often reggae music. If you will indulge
me, I would be happy briefly to share with the Committee some examples
of the sort of thing that we think should be caught by the law. It is

homophobic element. That is not what is sometimes characterised as
cranky complaints, or cases that might not have resulted in a
conviction; that is 600 offences. The Home Office acknowledges that the
vast majority of cases of homophobic violence in this country may well
not be reported. Only yesterday we marked the second anniversary of the

view also, as was expressed at the time, was that people are entitled
to make fools of themselves and say things of that sort. Indeed, no one
connected with Stonewall in any way whatsoever called on Sir Iqbal to
be arrested or investigated by the police for an instant. His views
were factually inaccurate and offensive, but no one suggested that they
should be caught by a law that involved inciting people to

						I want to explore a little further why
the existing law does not address your concerns. In particular, I want
to look at section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 and the case of
Mr. Harry Hammond, with which you may be familiar.
Mr. Hammond was a 69-year-old pensioner engaged in street
preaching in Bournemouth. He was holding a sign that included the words
&#147;Stop homosexuality&#148;, &#147;Stop lesbianism&#148;,
and &#147;Stop immorality&#148; when he was surrounded by members
of the public, some of whom knocked him to the ground. Mr.
Hammond was arrested under the Act and eventually found guilty of a
section 5 public order offence. His conviction was upheld in the High
Court, which held that the magistrates had been entitled to find that
relating homosexuality to immorality was
insulting.</div>
					<a name="07101669000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
decide whether a change to the law is necessary, and I suggest that in
many respects the order goes further than you are asking. You are
asking for the incitement of hatred to be a crime, when it seems from
that case that existing legislation provides that even relating
homosexuality to immorality is already against existing
legislation.</div>

						</i> The circumstances of the case you
outlined are very different from those that would be caught by this
offence because to be caught by the Public Order Act a complainant must
be present at the time. A converse or contrasting instance that would
be caught as an incitement offence, but not by the Public Order Act,
might be a poster on a wall. If someone was not present to say that
they were offended or insulted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>by it, the police would not have grounds to proceed under the Public
Order Act, although that poster could, depending on its content,
encourage incitement to hate in the wider
community.</div>

Committee by Christian legal groups that says that it is not necessary
under current incitement laws to show that anyone was persuaded by, or
violently acted on, homophobic song lyrics. They are telling us that it
is not necessary to demonstrate that there was a specific victim, and
that the only test is to demonstrate that there is incitement to
violent

evidence or opinion is, but under the Public Order Act there must be a
complainant and someone must be insulted or abused and present at the
time or the police cannot act. I do not think that those groups would
be the first to elide the various issues, but the distinction with this
offence is that the person or community to whom insult and, indeed,
detriment is caused is not necessarily present at the moment that the
offence is
committed.</div>

Criminal Justice Act 2003, which I understand includes
provisions better to deter homophobic crime by providing tougher
sentences for offences motivated by hostility based on the sexual
orientation of the victim. Are you saying that that law is not tough
enough?</div>

						</i> No. With respect, I am not saying that
it is not tough enough. We helped Members of the House to draft the
amendments that were introduced into that Bill, but that provision
created the possibility of an aggravated sentence for anti-gay hate
crime on the street, so it enables courts to give a higher sentence to
someone who is convicted of an assault on the street. It is actually a
different area of law from incitement and, indeed, from the completely
differential protection in the Public Order Act some 20 years
earlier.</div>

view, seems to us to be an act that should be caught by the law. One
might also want to look at the context in which any expression is made
that people should be killed or put to death because they are
homosexual&#151;members of the Committee will be mindful that that is
from chapter 20, verse 13 of Leviticus. One might want to inquire
whether that person was pursuing and articulating what is said in verse

temperate expression of incitement is much more effective than the
intemperate. If part of your case is hung on the mood in which the
words are uttered, you are cutting yourself short. Are not you and I
able to persuade each other all the more effectively by being polite
and temperate? Whereas, if I started ranting, you would think,

the thing to do would be to move away from Hyde park corner. If I said

received from others have suggested that. I have never suggested that
one should defend temperate incitement. We have referred carefully to
temperate expression of religious opinion, which seems to us to be the
critical distinction. At the end of the day, if something is incitement
to hatred, whether it was expressed temperately or intemperately would
almost be immaterial. You make the extremely good point that you could
express incitement to hatred in a hugely damaging way that might appear
on the face of it to be decent and straightforward and thoughtful.
However, as far as I am aware, I have never said that temperate
incitement to hatred that leads to violence on the streets is somehow
okay.</div>

in the human rights framework in which many people feel we now live,
there are many sensible people who say that that, nevertheless, does
not mean that everyone has human rights to do or say whatever they
wish. Human rights should be applied proportionately and with
responsibility and we do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>accept that where there are robust protections for some communities,
there should not be similar protections for others where there is clear
evidence. I have cited some evidence and the Chairman asked me to

talk about hatred, and for many traditionalists who practise within the
criminal law what they look for in a criminal law is protection against
injury to the body or injury to property: murder; assault; arson.
Although hatred is ignorant and unpleasant, especially when it is
irrational, it is much more difficult to legislate against because it
goes on inside people&#146;s heads and does not necessarily lead to
an outward expression of physical consequences. Would it be helpful to
frame the law so that it said that people should not be required or
forced by other people&#146;s misconduct to live in fear, rather than
trying to outlaw hatred? I accept that I only just thought about this

think that a framework has been in place around race for 30 years that,
in spite of the difficulties that you have just outlined, has provided
protection and significant deterrents. It has been a framework whereby
the Attorney-General has had to approve prosecutions and juries need
carefully to consider the outcome of those prosecutions. We are
