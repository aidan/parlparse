<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000122"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. For the
convenience and comfort of hon. Members, if they wish to remove their
jackets, they may do
so.</div><a name="09042942000006"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09042942000123"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Cheryl Gillan</b> (Chesham and Amersham) (Con): I beg to
move,</div><a name="09042942000096"></a><div class="hs_brev">That,
if proceedings on the Autism Bill are not completed at this
day&#146;s sitting, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at
2.30 pm when the House is
sitting.</div><a name="09042942000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
offer you a warm welcome to the Chair, Mr. Gale. I am
delighted that the Autism Bill has been allocated to such a senior
member of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel and I look forward to serving
under your chairmanship. I hope that we will not keep you long, but
these deliberations are most important. I hope that the sittings motion
will be agreed by the Committee.</div>
<a name="09042942000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
grateful that so many hon. Members have come forward to serve on this
private Member&#146;s Bill Committee. The proposal is that the
Committee sit at 2.30 on a Wednesday afternoon. No time is given for
concluding the deliberations, but I anticipate that two hours on a
Wednesday afternoon will probably be appropriate. Looking at the Bill
and knowing the seriousness of the subject matter, I hope that it will
involve no more than three or four sittings before we can bring it back
for Report and Third Reading. However, the best laid plans of mice and
men, and private Members&#146; Bills, often go awry.</div>
<a name="09042942000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is my
first private Member&#146;s Bill, Mr. Gale. I have no
experience in this regard, but I hope that you will guide me and the
other members of the Committee. I am therefore pleased to propose the
sittings
motion.</div><a name="09042942000099"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.31pm</div><a name="09042942000010"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000124"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Phil Hope):</b> I
understand that I shall have the opportunity to speak later, so on this
occasion I rise just to welcome and support the sittings motion. I hope
that we can proceed with the Bill in due
course.</div><a name="09042942000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
put and agreed
to.</i></div><a name="09042942000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000125"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we begin, I have to make two preliminary
announcements. First, I remind hon. Members that adequate notice, which
is three sitting days, should be given of amendments. As a general
rule, the Chair will not call starred amendments. I remind hon. Members
that amendments need to be tabled by the end of tomorrow to be
selectable for next
Wednesday.</div><a name="09042942000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
hon. Members may be aware that a money resolution is required to be
agreed by the House before the provisions of the Bill that impose a
charge on public funds can be considered by the Committee. Such a
motion stands on the Order Paper under &#147;Future
Business C&#148;, but it has not yet been agreed by the
House. Clauses 2, 4 and 5 impose significant charges on public funds. I
am, therefore, bound by the rules of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>House governing our financial procedure to decline to propose the
question on those clauses and the amendments to
them.</div><a name="09042942000100"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.33
pm</div><a name="09042942000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000126"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I beg to move,</div>
<a name="09042942000097"></a><div class="hs_brev">That further
consideration be now
adjourned.</div><a name="09042942000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to take the opportunity to say a few words on the reasons why I
propose an adjournment. We have in the Room a group of MPs who are
extremely experienced on the subject of autism, and I hope that will
lead to a fully constructive and fruitful debate on the Bill. Things
always happen in threes, and today three things have come together for
us. First, we had the headline in the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i>: &#147;Have
we found key to autism?&#148; Secondly, we have had the advantage of
a written statement on the consultation document published by the
Minister. Thirdly, we have started the Bill on its passage through
Committee.</div>
<a name="09042942000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as
you rightly said, Mr. Gale, we have yet to get the money
resolution, which inhibits somewhat discussions on the Bill. I am also
proposing that consideration be adjourned because the consultation
document for the strategy has been published only very
recently&#151;within hours&#151;and it would be good for the
Members who are bringing their expertise to the Bill to have a chance
to study that document as
well.</div><a name="09042942000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been delighted by the cross-party support that the Bill has been
given. It is a testament to the co-operation that I hope we shall
see&#151;particularly if we get a chance to put the money resolution
through next week by virtue of the Government&#146;s will&#151;that
we have no Whips on the Committee at all. The promoter of a private
Member&#146;s Bill is allowed to choose or to invite people to join
the Bill Committee and I contemplated inviting Whips from all our
parties, but I decided that was not at all in the spirit of the Bill;
quite the reverse. I hope that we will not need to be whipped in any
way whatever.</div>
<a name="09042942000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
adjourn because the matter is of such great importance. There are some
500,000 people with autism in the UK. Since I agreed to take on the
Bill, I have been particularly touched by all the communications that I
have had with families across the board. Continuously&#151;almost
daily&#151;I receive information and items from families and
individuals with autism, wanting to make a contribution to the
discussion of the Bill. Adjourning for a further week will give us time
to gather in some more of those
comments.</div><a name="09042942000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
all of us, the matter is important in all our constituencies. I think
it is fair to say that every one of us, whether Ministers or not, has
the opportunity, as the Bill is starting on its way, to go back to the
people in our constituencies who have been exhorting us about it. I
hope that the adjournment until next week, to discuss clause 1 onwards,
will be advantageous to us.</div>
<a name="09042942000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09042942000127"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I apologise for
interrupting the hon. Lady. I wonder whether she has had discussions on
the monetary implications of clauses 3, 4 and 5 in relation to the
monetary implications of the Government&#146;s proposals. Are they
similar or vastly
different?</div><a name="09042942000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000128"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention. At
this stage, as we are talking about the adjournment, I do not want to
get into the details of the Bill. I can see by the nodding of your
head, Mr. Gale, that I would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>incur your wrath. You will allow me latitude, but I am sure you will not
let me go into that detail. However, it is something that we will get
on to eventually, when we get into the body of the
Bill.</div><a name="09042942000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is important about looking at the matter and putting off the discussion
until next week is that there has been a genuine warm intention from
the Government, not only in publishing the consultation, but in coming
forward with suggestions that are a direct response to the Bill. I am
particularly impressed by the fact that it was not difficult to get two
Ministers on the Committee, which shows the Government&#146;s
intention to try to find a way through so that we have protection in
legislation for this group of people. I hope that if we can agree on a
modus operandi at some future date, it will not be necessary to tie up
both Ministers, because I am well aware from previous responsibilities
that to tie up two Ministers is a great privilege. None the less, I
think that is the sort of attention that autism should be receiving and
is now demanding, not particularly through any of my actions, but
certainly through those of the National Autistic Society, and through
the way in which it put the Bill together with officials from both
Departments.</div>
<a name="09042942000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to
take longer on the Bill, not least because I know that we are expecting
a National Audit Office report relating to autism. If we have a
breathing space, we may have some more information that can inform our
debate, which is so important. The NAO report has been promised for
some time, but I gather that it has been delayed, so an adjournment
will give us an opportunity perhaps to find out about the delay, or to
inform our discussions
better.</div><a name="09042942000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will have a moment to indicate his intentions, but in
proposing the adjournment to the Committee, I hope I am not causing
inconvenience, but arranging our affairs so that we have a better
debate in the future. The Government&#146;s intention is obviously
strong because they have tabled the money resolution. We hope that the
usual channels&#151;I have had some indication it could be
possible&#151;will allow the resolution to go through in time for us
to meet next Wednesday and start on the substance of the
Bill.</div><a name="09042942000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Committee passes the motion to adjourn, I anticipate that we shall
try to reach some agreement about which clauses we will discuss on each
day, because that may also be helpful to Members. We have to keep
quorate with six, but such an agreement might enable Members to move
freely in and out of the Committee, although not too far away in case
we need to vote. That is important. Given my explanation, I hope that
members of the Committee will agree to adjourn further consideration of
the Bill until next
Wednesday.</div><a name="09042942000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000129"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The motion is debatable. If hon. Members wish to
make a contribution, they may do so. However, as the hon. Lady said, we
are debating the adjournment motion, not the Bill itself. If members of
the Committee wish to make opening remarks, that is fine by me, but
they must confine what they say to the need for an adjournment, not the
Bill, which we hope very much will be debated next Wednesday
afternoon.</div><a name="09042942000101"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.40
pm</div><a name="09042942000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000130"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> I rise to speak to the Adjournment  motion
proposed by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham. It will be a
pleasure to be under your  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>stewardship, Mr. Gale, during the forthcoming sittings of the
Committee. Even though we are adjourning, the Bill will give us a good
opportunity to discuss an absolutely crucial and central
issue&#151;the needs of people with autistic spectrum conditions and
services for
them.</div><a name="09042942000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
of the Committee are knowledgeable and experienced. The fact that my
ministerial colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Children,
Schools and Families, the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North, and I are
here to debate the Bill demonstrates the Government&#146;s commitment
to the issue. Former vice-chairs and the existing chair of the
all-party group on autism and members of the group have been
magnificent in keeping the concerns and needs of such people in the
forefront of parliamentary minds.</div>
<a name="09042942000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000131"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> One member of the Committee has successfully taken
a private Member&#146;s Bill through in the
past.</div><a name="09042942000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000132"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> Indeed. The hon. Member for Tiverton and
Honiton&#151;</div><a name="09042942000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09042942000133"></a><b class="B">Angela
Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con):
No.</div><a name="09042942000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000134"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> I realise that it was not the hon. Lady. My right
hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill was
successful, but I also wanted to acknowledge the hon. Lady&#146;s
ten-minute Bill, which was a precursor to much of what we shall be
debating. There is talent in depth in the Committee to discuss the
issues.</div><a name="09042942000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reference
was made on Second Reading to the fact that our proceedings will be an
opportunity for members of the Committee to interrogate the Government
about our plans, announced before that debate, for taking forward
measures for children, young people in transition and adults with
autism. We had the chance through the Bill to talk about the
Government&#146;s proposals and measures and the broad welcome that
they received at the time throughout the House, as well as from
organisations such as the National Autistic Society, which has been
mentioned this afternoon. The NAS said that much of what we have
already announced achieves some of the intended outcomes of the Bill. I
am delighted that we are meeting
today.</div><a name="09042942000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000135"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> An adjournment may give us the opportunity to look
particularly at the timetabling of the whole exercise. That is one of
the areas that we need to explore, and putting off our proceedings
until next week might also give the Minister and his hard-working
officials an opportunity to consider such matters, because timetabling
is of great concern to audiences outwith the
Committee.</div><a name="09042942000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000136"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> I am trying not to stray into talking about the
clauses of the Bill, but the point has been made.</div>
<a name="09042942000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.
Lady, I am especially delighted that the first sitting of the Committee
is today because, this morning, I had the pleasure of launching the
Government&#146;s consultation on our adult autism strategy, which is
now available for people to use. Indeed, I met members of the external
reference group who are working with us to develop that strategy. They
made proposals about how 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>to proceed, and I now look forward to a major debate during the next 20
weeks out there with the public. I hope that Members on both sides of
the House will take the opportunity to meet groups locally to discuss
the strategy, which I shall say more about in a
moment.</div><a name="09042942000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
strategy will be a cornerstone of the developments and improvements
that we all want to see. I cannot think of a better day for the
Committee to begin its work. I am looking forward to spending the next
few Wednesday afternoons elaborating on our commitment to delivering
real change for people with autism. There will be much to
cover.</div>
<a name="09042942000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said on
Second Reading, autism cannot be considered in isolation, but must be
within the context of what else is happening throughout the wide range
of social care services, and health and education as a whole. That
includes improvements to mental health services and better support for
people with learning disabilities, for both of which I have ministerial
responsibility, and the reform of local social
services.</div><a name="09042942000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the adjournment of our proceedings and while we contemplate future
sittings, we will be able to examine the delivery of public sector
services that are increasingly personalised&#151;I believe,
rightly&#151;to address the varied needs of people with autism. I
pick up the point that the hon. Lady made about the research that has
come out today about a possible understanding of one of the causes of
autism. That research is welcome and gives us a deeper understanding of
the condition. It is important that we continue to develop our
understanding of autism. We are investing in research to improve the
evidence base. I realise that is not the subject of the Bill, but it is
important to acknowledge the work that is being done outside the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09042942000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been considerable efforts already to reform the system for adults with
autism to make sure that local services respond better to the
individual needs of the most vulnerable in our society. I want to use
the Committee sittings to set out in detail how the reforms will meet
the needs of people with autism. For example, our &#147;Putting
People First&#148; strategy sets the whole tone for adult social care
for the next decade. Our independent living strategy focuses on how we
can help people with disabilities to live independent lives. Our recent
strategy on learning disabilities, &#147;Valuing people now&#148;,
will help people with autism who also have a learning disability to
ensure that they get a fairer deal across health, housing, employment
and community care services. We will come back to all those matters
when we discuss the measures in the Bill and how we will deliver real
transformation for people with autism.</div>
<a name="09042942000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although my
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families is present, I want to say, &#147;As with adult services, so
with children&#146;s services&#148;. We know that the picture for
children&#146;s services is also one of tremendous reform, activity,
and real commitment to change things for the better for vulnerable
children, including those with autism. We were discussing the child
health strategy just before the Committee sat. My hon. Friend and I
co-chair the Aiming High for Disabled Children board, which looks at
such matters. Our child health strategy sets out comprehensive plans to
improve local services to deliver more targeted specialist support for
children with complex needs, and it makes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>specific reference to children with autism. I am sure that my hon.
Friend is looking forward to setting out for the Committee, when we get
to the relevant clauses, all that is being done for children and young
people with
autism.</div><a name="09042942000042"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000137"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for being so
generous in giving way. As he is laying out the sort of information
that will be available, could he let every member of the Committee have
a detailed letter specifically on the meetings that he held with his
colleague that sets out exactly what those discussions and proposals
were in time for next Wednesday&#146;s sitting? I am sure that that
would be a great help and assist our
understanding.</div>
<a name="09042942000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000138"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> Yes, I hope to provide the Committee with the
relevant information as and when we reach those points in the Bill.
Officials from the Department have been in regular contact with the
promoter of the Bill&#151;the hon. Member for Chesham and
Amersham&#151;and her advisers to discuss how best we can take
forward their concerns in ways that give the degree of certainty that
action will happen in responding to the needs of children, young adults
and adults across the country, while retaining the flexibility that we
need to ensure that local needs and circumstances are taken fully into
account. I hope that we can have meaningful discussions to achieve a
mutually satisfactory
outcome.</div><a name="09042942000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
starting point for the sittings will be to try to convince the
Committee, as I said on Second Reading, that there is no need for the
legislation that we are going to consider. Like the hon. Lady, I am in
an unusual position on a private Member&#146;s Bill. It is unique for
me and I dare say for many other Members, because this is not a
Government Bill. It is not a Bill that we feel able to support in its
current
form.</div><a name="09042942000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a point that was raised about the money resolution, we expected that
the promoter of the Bill would undertake the assessment of costs
associated with her proposals that we need to inform decisions on the
scope of the money resolution. However, we have not had that
information, although I wrote to the hon. Lady and my officials met her
team only last week. Inevitably, that has meant a delay in tabling the
money resolution. I hope that we can resolve those
issues.</div><a name="09042942000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000139"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Indication was given to my team of advisers, who
met the ministerial team of advisers last Tuesday, that a money
resolution would be tabled in time for today&#146;s sitting. I cannot
table that, as the Minister knows. Also, when it comes to an
assessment, I am but an hon. Member promoting a private Member&#146;s
Bill that was suggested by outside charitable organisations. I do not
have the resources available to him or to his ministerial colleague
nor, individually, the expertise or skill to provide the Minister with
those assessments. However, the Minister does, and if the Bill is
delivering everything that he says of it, he must per se have already
carried out those calculations. I hope that now he is well aware that I
do not have the resources to provide the financial information that he
is asking for&#151;something he could so easily do, if he wished to
encourage the Bill
forward.</div><a name="09042942000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally&#151;I
apologise for the length of my intervention&#151;I am sad to hear
that the Minister is still seeking to persuade us that the Bill is not
necessary. When the Bill came to me, it had already been the subject of
discussions between officials in his Department and outside 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>organisations. Therefore, it is rather sad that an indication might have
been given to an outside organisation that such a private
Member&#146;s Bill would receive a good hearing in the House. I hope
that that was not the case, because that would be a sad way for a
Department to conduct
itself.</div><a name="09042942000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000140"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> On the hon. Lady&#146;s point about the money
resolution, that is why I said that we are in this rather unique
situation&#151;this is not a Government Bill&#151;hence the issues
about money resolutions and so on. We shall do what is needed to get to
the debate on the clauses that have financial implications. We have
tabled the money resolution, but there are the procedures of the House
to get through. None the less, because the Bill may have financial
implications and as yet the hon. Lady does not&#151;is unable to, as
she rightly said&#151;have the resources to spell them out, the
Government would have difficulty in agreeing to clauses for which we do
not know the cost. When we get to individual clauses, we shall have to
explore the issues and what it all might mean. I tried to signal
earlier that we have been in regular contact with the hon. Lady and
have asked questions. I hope that we can work collaboratively to find
our way through the difficult issues, because that would be in
everyone&#146;s
interest.</div><a name="09042942000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
repeat what we said about the Bill on Second Reading. We know that
legislation can be a blunt and crude instrument for driving change,
especially when the end that we seek is better awareness and better use
of the expertise and resources already in the system. We must preserve
for councils the freedom and flexibility necessary to meet the complex
web of local needs, giving them the scope and skills that they need to
zero in on the specific needs of people with autism. Hence, for which I
make no apology, I expect to return again and again in our sittings to
the fact that rigid legislation ties the hands of those making such
efforts and will do more harm than
good.</div><a name="09042942000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we can all recognise that the Government&#146;s work on
autism&#151;whether with children, young people in transition to
adulthood or adults&#151;is significant, far-reaching and the first
to have ever occurred. We shall discuss whether the clauses are flawed,
unnecessary or have financial costs, and if there is a way forward and
the disadvantages can be resolved, I hope that we can find mutually
satisfactory solutions. However, that is not the case with the Bill, as
I said on Second Reading and repeat now, so that the Committee is fully
aware of the
issues.</div><a name="09042942000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000141"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Yes, the Minister did and he has. We are
in some danger of having another Second Reading debate, which I am not
prepared to
permit.</div><a name="09042942000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000142"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> When the Minister wrote to all Members just
before Second Reading, he outlined in some detail, on a point-by-point
basis, the Government&#146;s alternative strategy, indicating how
they felt that they were meeting the Bill&#146;s general
requirements. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and
Amersham, will the Minister assist the Committee by making available
the costings associated with that letter and the point-by-point list of
the proposals that the Government have introduced? He has appreciated
what my hon. Friend said about producing the exact costs for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>the Bill, and his making those Government costings available would be a
good starting point for discussion in
Committee.</div><a name="09042942000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000143"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> My dilemma is that this is not my Bill, and it has
costings attached to it that its movers have not been able to provide.
We have tabled the money resolution, and it will be passed, so that we
can move into clause-by-clause examination. We need information about
the Bill&#146;s costings, not about my proposals and what the
Government are doing&#151;that will come up as we debate the clauses.
The issue is what the clauses might cost the taxpayer and to what
extent they are the right way forward in delivering better outcomes for
young people, children and adults with autism. It is the Bill that we
are debating, and it might have financial implications. Although this
is an opportunity to interrogate the Government&#151;I think that
hon. Members said as much on Second Reading&#151;and I would happily
find time to respond  to questions from Members, we are
actually debating  a Bill.</div>
<a name="09042942000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000144"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Actually, we are not; we are debating an
Adjournment motion, and I would like to come back to
that.</div><a name="09042942000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000145"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09042942000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000146"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> I was about to give way to the hon. Member for
Tiverton and
Honiton.</div><a name="09042942000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000147"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> I appreciate what the Minister says about the
Bill&#146;s costings&#151;I take that point&#151;but if I were to
table parliamentary questions based on the list in his letter, asking
what the costings were for each item, I would assume that his
Department would most certainly answer. That is not an unreasonable
request. In the spirit of co-operation, it would help if he made
available those costings to the Committee. In his letter, his argument
was basically that we do not need this or that in the Bill because the
Government are already going to provide an adequate service through an
alternative route. If we at least have those costings, that might help
us to develop any potential additional costings incurred via my hon.
Friend&#146;s route&#151;the Bill&#151;rather than via the route
proposed in the Minister&#146;s
letter.</div><a name="09042942000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000148"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> I am trying to keep in order, Mr. Gale.
You are giving us a great deal of latitude. When we arrive at
discussions about the clauses that relate to the announcements that the
Government have made, I will happily discuss those issues. However, it
is the clauses that will be before us, and we will need to consider the
extent to which the Bill has costs and whether those costs are
reasonable when we get to that debate. The money resolution would
enable us to do that. I have explained the cause of the delay: we would
be tabling and supporting a money resolution without knowing what
moneys were involved, as the Bill&#146;s movers failed to provide
information to the Government on the Bill&#146;s costs. I hope that
we can discuss all that when we get to those clauses. Although I will
take interventions, Mr. Gale, I am trying to keep within the
strictures that you have laid upon
me.</div><a name="09042942000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000149"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am grateful to the Minister for giving
way. Perhaps we do need to adjourn until next week, because I tabled a
question to the Minister simply about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>the costs of local authorities identifying the numbers of disabled
children and adults with autism in their areas. The response was that
no costing had been made, and that costing is being worked on for a
prevalence study that was promised last year, so 12 months later the
costings are still being worked on for promises made last year. I
support my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton&#151;we
are all friends here, it is an all-party Committee, I hope&#151;in
saying that if the Minister&#146;s proposals fulfil the Bill&#146;s
aim, it would help to have the Department&#146;s full costings. I was
surprised by the answer that I got on my birthday, on 21 April, that no
costings had been carried
out.</div><a name="09042942000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000150"></a>Phil

Lady&#146;s, which makes us the same star sign. I am not sure whether
that is a good or bad thing.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000151"></a>Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000154"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> It would appear that I am on the right side of the
cusp, but let us not go there, Mr. Gale.</div>
<a name="09042942000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is for the
movers of the Bill, not the Government, to provide the costings.
Perhaps we will discuss that later when we get into the
clauses.</div><a name="09042942000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000155"></a>Angela

<a name="09042942000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000156"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> I think that I should make some progress or I shall
get into difficulty with you, Mr. Gale.</div>
<a name="09042942000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today, we
have started an important conversation across the country on how to
transform services and support for people with autism. I am sure that
we will use the Committee to discuss the proposals in detail. I want to
use these sittings to set out how the strategy will have real bite, be
comprehensive and far-reaching and have a deep impact, as I try to
persuade the Committee that ours is the right approach, as distinct
from that in the
Bill.</div><a name="09042942000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will describe in more detail the five themes that we set out in the
consultation: health, guaranteeing the highest standards of specialist
and mainstream care for autistic patients across all settings; social
exclusion, removing the everyday barriers that autistic people face;
giving people with autism more choice and control over how and when
they interact with services; better awareness-raising and training,
ensuring that we have a highly skilled and knowledgeable work force;
and, most importantly, supporting people with autism to take advantage
of training and employment opportunities. As I learnt today, only 15
per cent. of adults with autism are in employment, yet we know how
important a job is to people with any form of mental health issue or
disability and to those on the autistic spectrum. I want to explain how
the adult autism strategy and the measures covering children and young
people will fully meet the Bill&#146;s stated aims.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div><a name="09042942000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
address the question that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham
raised about the prevalence study and the importance of better data. A
great deal of work is already going on for both adults and children,
but I know from the way that the hon. Lady raised the issue and from
the debate on Second Reading that there was concern about the adult
prevalence study. I will welcome the opportunity to reassure the
Committee during its sittings that we are absolutely committed to
delivering that study. Getting this right is crucial for local
authorities and primary care trusts to have a robust picture of the
number of people with autism in their areas to commission the right
services to meet people&#146;s needs. We have commissioned the NHS
information centre to manage the study and are about to appoint a
scientific adviser to write the research specification and ensure that
we get the best study that we
can.</div><a name="09042942000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have demonstrated that we will have our work cut out in
carrying out detailed scrutiny of the Bill. I am looking forward to
devoting my Wednesday afternoons for the next few weeks to reassuring
the Committee that the actions that the Government already have in hand
will achieve everything that the Bill seeks to do and will do so more
quickly and effectively. Moreover, by preserving freedom and
flexibility at local level, they will give us a strong base to make
further improvements for the care and support of people with autism in
the future. I support the Adjournment motion moved by the hon.
Lady.</div><a name="09042942000102"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.3

Brooke:</b> On behalf of my colleague, the hon. Member for
Romsey, who unfortunately cannot be here today, I would like to say
that we both look forward to serving under your chairmanship,
Mr. Gale. We are particularly interested in getting into
detailed debate next week, because the issue is of such importance that
members of the public will not want to see any game playing. I hope
that we are doing the best for all our constituents; many parents of
all ages are deeply concerned and are sometimes in dire circumstances
because of the lack of support. I look forward to the detailed
debate.</div><a name="09042942000103"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.4

Richard Bacon</b> (South Norfolk) (Con): I am pleased to speak
briefly on the Adjournment motion. I should like to address the money
resolution as I understand that we are adjourning because it is not in
place.</div>
<a name="09042942000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
carefully to the Minister, who has had several opportunities to answer
the question as to what the costs of the Government&#146;s proposals
are likely to be. His reply on several occasions has been that this is
a private Member&#146;s Bill and it is for the private Member, my
hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham, to provide those
details and that she has not done so. Of course, it must be true that
it is for my hon. Friend to provide costings for her Bill, but it is
also the case that the Government&#146;s attitude to the
Bill&#151;the Government have made it clear that they do not think
the Bill should go ahead&#151;is intimately related to their own
proposals, and their own proposals must have a cost.</div>
<a name="09042942000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said a minute ago that he thought his proposals were more effective and
that they would be quicker. I think of the National Audit
Office&#146;s mantra of economy, effectiveness and efficiency. The
Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>must also have a view on whether his proposals are more economic. If he
has such a view it can only be because he has some numbers. All my hon.
Friends were asking him to do was to share those numbers with the
Committee. For him to say in response that it is for my hon. Friend the
Member for Chesham and Amersham to come up with numbers for the
proposals in her Bill is not an answer to the points that my hon.
Friends were making. It is an answer to a different
point.</div><a name="09042942000076"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000159"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I, too, was led to believe from discussions that
my advisers had with Department officials that the money resolution
does not require costings&#151;it merely states that the costs
arising from the Bill will be covered. As the Minister knows what those
costs must be, because the Bill so closely mirrors his own proposed
activities, it would be a generous and noble gesture&#151;would it
not?&#151;if the Minister made his costings available for the
Committee.</div><a name="09042942000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000160"></a>Mr.
Bacon:</b> I agree; it would be generous and noble. The
Minister looks to me like a generous and noble fellow, so I hope that
he will reflect on
that.</div><a name="09042942000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000161"></a>Phil

adjournment debate, Mr. Gale, and trying to answer the
question.</div><a name="09042942000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000162"></a>The

order.</div><a name="09042942000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000163"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale. The hon. Member for
South Norfolk is absolutely right&#151;there are two different
things. There are the costs of the Bill, which are a matter for the
promoter of the Bill. The money resolution is a general resolution to
find the money to pay for the costs of the Bill. When we come to debate
the money resolution in the House&#151;it has been tabled but it
needs business time to debate it&#151;I will make clear my concern
that we will be passing a money resolution to enable us to deal with
clauses in Committee without knowing what the costs are. That is very
unusual in terms of parliamentary business. We have a private
Member&#146;s Bill; we want to facilitate the debate and we want
things to happen, but for the Government to encourage everyone to vote
for a money resolution without knowing how much they are voting for is
fairly important, given the demands upon the public purse. I will be
expressing that concern when we debate the money resolution. In the
meantime, we have our proposals, the consultation that we have launched
and the strategy that will come at the end of the year, which will have
an impact assessment in due course. Those issues will get flushed out
during the Committee
process.</div><a name="09042942000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000164"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That was another very long
intervention.</div><a name="09042942000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000165"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr.
Gale.</div><a name="09042942000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000166"></a>Mr.
Bacon:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. The
central point seems to be the Minister&#146;s contention that the
Bill is not necessary because the Government are coming forward with
proposals that meet all the aims of the Bill, and yet more. If that is
the case, there must be a cost attached to all those proposals, and yet
more. The cost must be known or knowable and should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>have been worked out already or certainly should be worked out pretty
soon. As for the Minister&#146;s point about proposals for which the
cost is not fully known, I have to say that based on my hon. Friend the
Member for Tiverton and Honiton&#146;s experience and mine, and that
of other members of the Public Accounts Committee, it is commonplace
for the Government to come forward with proposals for which they have
no idea of the costs, or for which the end costs turn out to bear no
relation to what the Government originally
said.</div>
<a name="09042942000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000167"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> The proposals in the Bill and the
Minister&#146;s proposals seek to rectify something that has a huge
impact on the public purse at the moment. The costs of not putting in
place adequate reforms, particularly in relation to services for adults
with autism, are quite considerable. The recently published Knapp
report addressed the cost of not reforming services for people with
autism, and although the NAO has yet to report, the cost of reform is
also within its scope. Those two important documents, one of which we
have seen and another that we have yet to see, might actually conclude
that it is not so much that more money needs to be spent, but that by
reforming the services there will be a saving in leaving things as they
are&#151;the status
quo.</div><a name="09042942000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister should take heart from what has been, until recently, a blank
piece of paper in terms of what it costs when things go wrong for the
autistic community without support. We have now started to see some
figures in that regard, which will certainly inform the
Committee.</div><a name="09042942000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000168"></a>Mr.
Bacon:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that
point and I shall conclude my remarks. In parenthesis, I have often
heard Ministers make points under the general rubric of invest to save
where they have not whistled inwardly as the Minister just appeared to
do, so my hon. Friend&#146;s argument is not inherently fallacious.
In fact, it is quite the contrary, because it is relevant to the money
resolution and to the reason why we are
adjourning.</div><a name="09042942000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
on the issue of employment, which the Minister mentioned earlier, I too
heard on Second Reading that only 15 per cent. of people who have
autistic spectrum conditions are in employment. I declare a personal
interest, because my wife&#146;s brother is diagnosed with
Asperger&#146;s syndrome and has been in employment throughout his
entire adult life. He is very proud of the work that he has done, and
his employers have always been extremely proud of him as he has been an
unusually diligent and conscientious worker in the jobs he has
had.</div><a name="09042942000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
only employers looked more widely and laterally, and did more in terms
of work placements to assess people rather than basing the process on
interviews, which people with such conditions are not necessarily
likely to be very good at, there are huge opportunities to improve the
finances connected to the issue. My hon. Friend&#146;s point about
saving money is therefore
relevant.</div><a name="09042942000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000169"></a>Phil
Hope:</b> I entirely agree. That is why the whole theme of the
national strategy that we launched today centres on employment and
training. They are absolutely essential. I hope that over the next 20
weeks the whole community of people with autism, as well as carers, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>families and professionals working with them, have the opportunity to
feed examples into the consultation from across the whole autistic
spectrum&#151;not just adults with Asperger&#146;s. There are real
opportunities, which I hope will result not only in better quality of
life, but in financial savings
too.</div><a name="09042942000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
scepticism was related to the level of needs of people with
autism&#151;the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham mentioned
500,000 earlier&#151;and the amount of transformation that needs to
take place. Let us wait to see what the NAO has to say about the
issue.</div><a name="09042942000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09042942000170"></a>Mr.
Bacon:</b> It is dangerous to underestimate human potential
and the energy that can be generated when people are given the
opportunity to help themselves, as Rod Hackney, the architectural
adviser to the Prince of Wales, once said. That remark is apposite in
this context.</div>
<a name="09042942000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
delighted with the Minister&#146;s clarifications and  I hope
that he will reflect on what has been said about the figures that must
exist for the Government&#146;s own 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>proposals. Sharing those figures with the Committee at the appropriate

Chairman:</b> Before I put the question to the Committee, I
wish to make a gentle observation myself. I have allowed a certain
amount of leeway this afternoon, because Members on both sides of the
House have been good enough to make time available and it seemed
reasonable to allow some opening remarks. I have allowed that in the
hope and expectation that when we come to the debate on the Bill, those
remarks will not be made again and we may therefore win a little time.
I also do not propose to be quite as generous in future with the length
of interventions; in other words, if you think you have got away with
it, you have
not.</div><a name="09042942000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
