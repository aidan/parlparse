<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, everyone. Before we consider the first amendment, I must inform Committee members that this Room is used for sittings of Grand Committees, that the Welsh Grand Committee will meet on Tuesday 16 May and that we shall therefore have to move to another Room. Since we began our consideration of the Bill, another Bill has completed its Committee stage and Room 12 has become available. From next Tuesday, we shall therefore meet in that Room, which I believe is less cavern-like. The Committee Office will send out cards to Committee members notifying them of the change. I hope that that is agreeable to everyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 2, line 43, leave out ``as he considers appropriate'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and justify his subsequent decision to them.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 43, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Any guidance issued under this section shall be regarded as advisory only'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Good morning, Mrs Michie. My wife will testify to the fact that I do not normally communicate with anyone at this time of the morning. Communicating with many other people-I was about to say a roomful of people, but that would be overstating it-is a bit of a strain, but I shall do my best. I am delighted to hear that we shall move Rooms, but I was rather hoping that we should move to an even bigger Room. Apparently, we, and all of the members of the public who take a close interest in the Bill, will be squeezed into a smaller Room-never mind.

<P>
The thrust of clause 3 is to hedge around with restrictions and limits this brave new power that the Government will give to local government. That is made clear in the clause's title, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Limits on power to promote well-being.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment's purpose is to rein in the Secretary of State's power to restrict local authorities' freedoms to use the new power. As the Bill is drafted, it will enable the Secretary of State to issue guidance-that is one of the Bill's common themes-which will severely curtail the way in which local authorities can use the new power. The clause states that councils will be placed under an obligation to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have regard to any such guidance-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in other words, they will not be able to act outside such guidance. I believe that that is the legal position. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), who on Tuesday gave a dissertation on the phrase ``have regard to''.

<P>
If our amendments are taken together with Government amendments Nos. 100 and 101, which we shall presently debate in detail, and with the relevant provisions in the Bill, including clause 3(3), a triple lock will be placed on councils' ability to use the new power. The only person who has a key to that triple lock is the Secretary of State. Again, there is a trend for power to creep upwards to the Secretary of State and the Department and for it to be taken to the centre.

<P>
First, councils will have to have regard to the guidance in preparing their community strategy, by which they will be bound. Secondly, they will have to have regard to further guidance about the way in which they will use the power. Our amendments are intended to deal with that matter. Finally, the Secretary of State will have the apparently arbitrary power to prevent an individual local authority from using the power for any specific activity.

<P>
The amendments would remove some of the chains from local authorities and give them greater discretion about the way in which they can use the new power without feeling the constant heavy hand of central Government on their shoulder. The provision is typical of the control freakery from which the Government suffer. I should have thought that they would have learnt their lesson from the recent local elections. The Government's approach may lead them into trouble. Many nice people are coming to the Committee Room twice a week for several weeks to learn about the powers that local government will be given. Why on earth not let local government exercise the powers? The Government are giving a new power and saying, ``This is how we want you to exercise it.'' There should be much greater local input into the power and the exercising of that power and the amendments go some way towards dealing with that.

<P>
Amendment No. 9 proposes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any guidance issued under this section shall be regarded as advisory only.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are very keen on guidance in relation to local government and many volumes of draft guidance are being produced almost on a daily basis. Opposition Members believe that, although it would be appropriate for the Secretary of State to advise councils, those councils should, after careful consideration, be able to reject his advice in the light of their own local circumstances. In doing so, they should be safe in the knowledge that being in contradiction of the advisory guidance from the Secretary of State would not render them vulnerable to challenge or judicial review of their decision for that reason only.

<P>
A constant theme in this Committee has been that, in trying to improve the Bill, Opposition Members have tried to save councils a great deal of pain and cost further down the road, in potential legal challenges. That is why we are trying to plug some obvious gaps in the Bill and that is what is behind the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> I am somewhat confused by the hon. Gentleman's comments. He made wide-ranging and critical remarks about clause 3 and about the fairly standard provision in subsection (3), which gives the Secretary of State the power to prevent
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>local authorities from doing  anything which is specified  in the order.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, he has tabled no amendments to those parts of the clause. Instead, he seeks to refine, in his terms, the provisions for the Secretary of State to consult and to amend the status of the guidance. I shall, therefore, deal with those matters.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Under-Secretary should understand that these are probing amendments. We do not have the impressive resources at our disposal that Ministers have. I do not see why she cannot deal with the more general issue raised by the amendments. They are designed not to win prizes for draftsmanship, but to raise issues. That is a fundamental role of a Standing Committee. Will the Under-Secretary and her colleagues please approach the amendments in that light?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> No doubt we all feel great sympathy for the difficulty in which the Opposition apparently find themselves in addressing the provisions of the Bill. However, if they are concerned to raise what they feel are the most important points in particular clauses, I would expect them to direct their limited resources to tabling amendments that probe the issues that they consider most important. The hon. Gentleman raised matters on which he could have tabled probing amendments to subsection (3). Instead, he has tabled amendments that arguably deal with less fundamental issues.

<P>
Amendment No. 74 attempts to remove the Secretary of State's discretion over whom he should consult before issuing guidance and to require him to justify any decision that he may make in respect of guidance issued under clause 3. If the amendment were accepted, the Secretary of State would have to consult representatives of local government and ``other persons'', but the amendment leaves open the question of who would decide and the basis of the decision, if it was not the Secretary of State's own judgment. I have made the same point in relation to the hon. Gentleman's comments about the draconian powers in the clause and control freakery. He knows that our approach to consultation and subsection (3) are normal provisions in such Bills; they are nothing new.

<P>
In justifying the final form of guidance, the Secretary of State is already accountable for his decisions to Parliament and to the electorate. The hon. Gentleman said that it was a probing amendment, but I hope that I can assure Opposition Members that the Government take these responsibilities seriously. For example, we have taken on board the recommendations in the Sixth Report of the Neill Committee on Standards in Public Life, which called for stronger rules to be set out in a consultation code and for greater consistency. He will be pleased to know that we are now consulting on a consultation code.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Carry on consulting.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes another jibe about consulting, but it is one of the Government's hallmarks and we make no apology for it.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): They do nothing else.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The right hon. Gentleman says that we do nothing else. Everyone knows that that is not true. The Government's record in decision making and new legislation, much of which Conservative Members have opposed, is there for all to see. However, we believe that it is right to consult first and get a range of views before we take final decisions. Conservative Members were never comfortable with that when they were in Government and probably would not be again. Perhaps that is why they find consultation so difficult to understand. As I say, we make no apology for it.

<P>
In relation to amendment No. 74 and subsection (3) these are normal provisions. The Secretary of State should not be open to the type of litigation that could occur were they not in the Bill. Indeed, such provisions appeared in legislation enacted by Conservative Members when they were in power.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): The Minister mentioned subsection (3). Could she give the Committee some examples of activities undertaken by local authorities that would require the Secretary of State to make an order preventing them?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Hughes:</B> We do not expect there to be any such activities. As the hon. Gentleman will know, this is a standard provision to allow the Secretary of State to take any action, should he need to. We expect local authorities to use the power of well-being sensibly and wisely and in a wide-ranging way. We do not want to restrict that power, as I shall make clear in my comments on amendment No. 9. This is a sensible and normal provision and, as I said, it is similar to provisions in legislation enacted by the previous Government. In relation to amendment No. 74, for example, a similar provision appeared in the previous Local Government Bill, now the Local Government Act 1999. Also, if the hon. Gentleman looks at the Housing Act 1996, which was taken through the House by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, he will find that, under section 17(6), the Secretary of State is required to consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such bodies appearing to him to be representative of registered social landlords as he considers appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not because this sort of provision is wrong or draconian, but because it is standard procedure to give Secretaries of State those powers, should they be necessary. Conservative Members had no difficulty with that phrase then and I fail to understand why they are having such difficulties now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I just want examples.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> We could go on giving examples all day. I think that one example should be enough to make the point.

<P>
Amendment No. 9 attempts to make any guidance issued by the Secretary of State merely advisory and there are good reasons why we cannot accept that. In fact, the amendment is at odds with the spirit of the argument of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) about the need for clarity about the use of the power. As he knows, there are significant differences between statutory and non-statutory guidance. The guidance that we propose to issue would have to be considered by local authorities and they would have to be aware of its contents before taking decisions. However, the guidance proposed in the amendments would be merely advisory. Local authorities need not have regard to its contents-indeed, they need not even read it before taking a decision.

<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The power in clause 2 is broad and should be seen in the context of the far-reaching changes that we are introducing to local government. Those changes include the new constitutions and best value, as well as a broader agenda to tackle problems by encouraging more effective working between local bodies and central Government.

<P>
I think that the hon. Member for Eastbourne said that the guidance would severely curtail what local authorities can do under the power, but I can reassure him that that is not the case. The limitations on the power are set out in the Bill and the guidance will not try to set further limits on local authorities' activities. On the contrary, the guidance is intended to enable them to make maximum use of the power's potential. Such limitations as apply are already set out in the Bill. The guidance may attempt to express them in a more accessible way, but it will not add to them.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): Perhaps the hon. Lady should clarify the meaning of subsection (3), which appears to provide a quite draconian power. Although local government is being told that it has freedom of action, one need only to read the draft guidance to recognise that guidance is to be found when the covers are lifted. I am talking about merely the early draft guidance-there will be further guidance for subsequent years.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The guidance will not seek to add or elaborate on the limitations in the Bill. It is true that subsection (3) provides for the Secretary of State to prevent local authorities from doing anything by order by virtue of clause 2(1). However, as I have said, that is a standard, overarching provision that has appeared in earlier legislation. The hon. Gentleman must understand where the Government are coming from: we want to enable local authorities to use the power as widely as possible. We must remember that it is this Government who are giving the power to local authorities. That is in stark contrast to the activities of the previous Government.

<P>
It is right and proper to include in the clause a provision that will enable the Secretary of State to intervene if necessary. That does not contradict our general and important aim to help local authorities to use the power as fully and widely as possible for the benefit of local people. The two approaches are not inconsistent; they are the two necessary elements of a responsible attitude on the part of central Government. In the main, we take a strong, enabling approach to local government, which is nevertheless bottomed by the power for the Secretary of State to intervene. That is the way in which central Government ought to act, and most local authorities will appreciate that we need to act in that way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I think that the hon. Lady said ``bottomed''. For the benefit of those who are older than she is, could she translate that into English?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman does not comprehend my north-west colloquialisms. It means that there is a floor and that the Secretary of State's power is underpinned. My answer is serious, but the intervention was facetious.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am just defending the English language.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Oh dear. The Opposition are really struggling.

<P>
The response from local government is that it welcomes such guidance and is co-operating with us in producing it. Local government wants it to be as helpful as possible and to have the status of statutory guidance, which means that local government must have regard to it. Therefore, I ask the hon. Member for Eastbourne to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> As I said, it is early in the morning. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary at least for expanding our vocabulary. I intended to speak only briefly and then to seek leave to withdraw the amendment, but I shall now speak at greater length because the hon. Lady has raised a panoply of issues. They are germane to the amendments, but have more general implications as we grind our way through the Bill.

<P>
The Minister said several times that the provisions are normal, but normality is not sufficient justification.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The amendments must be justified.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I shall come to that at the bottom of my speech.

<P>
Normality is not sufficient and the Under-Secretary will have to do a little better. She referred to guidance. We are awash with promises of guidance and some has actually appeared, but when and where shall we receive guidance on these specific issues? The Under-Secretary claims that local government is crying out for guidance. She seems to be suggesting a masochistic tendency in local government-I have not noticed it-to demand guidance on how to exercise the new power. There will be no money to exercise it, but there will be help to do so.

<P>
On ``bottoming'', the Minister seemed to be saying that there is a sort of glass floor, or perhaps a glass ceiling, on the exercise of the power. That is exactly our point. A new power is being provided to local government, but that is rather like handing a shiny new gun to local government with no ammunition. It will either receive blanks or ammunition will be doled out bit by bit as Ministers see fit.

<P>
I turn to the drafting and the Under-Secretary's criticism of our amendments, which was rather sharp at this time of the morning. Compared with the resources at her disposal, ours is what the Americans would call a mom and pop operation. We are doing our best to produce amendments that are designed not to win drafting awards but to raise issues.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I should not be tempted by the hon. Gentleman at this hour of the morning because I know that he has problems. We have more experience than he has of trying to draft amendments in opposition and in recognition of that the Government supported a substantial increase in resources for the Opposition so that they can do their job better. Let us have no more bleating.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am not bleating. The Minister should know that bleating is not in my nature. I was responding to the Under-Secretary's bleating.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am intrigued by what the Minister said and would like to ask my hon. Friend why we have not seen any of those resources. This is an internal squabble.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am not going to get into an argument about how short the Short money may be. In the wonder of the civilised world that is the British parliamentary system, oppositions are kept sufficiently short of resources in comparison to Ministers that they develop a deep hunger and lust to get over to the Government side of the Committee Room. [
Interruption.] It is the Minister's fault for raising the matter. In response to her intervention, I am prepared to concede that her party became an exceptionally good Opposition, having had 18 years in which to hone those skills. We have no intention of becoming that good at it.

<P>
I am sure that the Under-Secretary will say, as happens all too often, that the amendment would not achieve the desired result or that it is inadequately drafted. We take that in good part. It is not our job to be spectacularly great parliamentary draftsmen. When Ministers accept the thrust of our amendments, they should let their officials and draftsmen get on with drafting the necessary provisions in such a way as to achieve our intentions. Often, the reason for Ministers' waspishness about the inadequacies of amendments is that they do not like to stray beyond their written briefing material.

<P>
The Under-Secretary was right to say that consultation ``is one of the hallmarks of this Government''. It is certainly one of the hallmarks of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. I do not have the figures to hand, but I know that it has engaged in a staggering number of consultations and similar exercises in the past three years. However, sooner or later, Ministers must make the necessary decisions and the Bill must be licked into its final shape. We shall do our best to help with that.

<P>
I remain convinced that the issues underlying the amendments are sufficiently important to merit serious consideration by the Government. If they are not prepared to do so, there is little that I can do about it this side of the next general election. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I shall be brief. Clause 3 establishes which restrictions will apply to the use of the new well-being power. The framework that the Government have adopted reapplies all the prohibitions, restrictions and limitations in existing legislation to the use of the well-being power. It is right that we should start from that point. Those restrictions were placed on local authorities by the express will of Parliament and will continue to apply.

<P>
Subsection (2) limits local authorities' powers over expenditure, prohibiting them from raising money on the basis of the power of the Bill. Subsection (3) includes a reserve power for the Secretary of State to prohibit authorities from doing anything that is specified in that order. That is a sensible approach.

<P>
While the spirit of the guidance is to enable local authorities to use the power as fully as possible, there may be circumstances in which the power under subsection (3) needs to be used. As was mentioned earlier, a local authority may wish to do something that affects another local authority, or an area or body that is outside its boundaries, in a way that the Secretary of State believes to be inappropriate. It is therefore right to include the power in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Clause 3 is an important part of the Bill. The attitude of Ministers towards the powers that they intend to give to local councils reminds me of a true story about the Duke of Wellington's first Cabinet meeting. I am sure that hon. Members are familiar with it. He was extremely angry after the meeting and a friend asked, ``What's the matter, Arthur?'' His reply, which reflected the fact that he had come out of the Army to enter politics, was, ``It is quite extraordinary. They all came in, I gave them their orders and they wanted to stay behind and discuss them.'' That epitomises the Government's attitude. They are saying to local councils, ``Here's a new power, and this is precisely how you are going to exercise it.''

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Are we consulting too much or are we ordering?

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Both, actually, which is quite an achievement. In different parts of the Bill and in different respects, the Government are doing both, which is an achievement by any standards. Both those features display graphically the Government's nervousness about this power.

<P>
It is important to remember the history behind the provisions. The process began with long discussions in local government circles about having a power of general competence for local authorities. There was then a great debate about whether it should be a straightforward duty, as opposed to a power. Now, there is to be a power that will be hedged about with restrictions.

<P>
Before I develop some of those points in detail, let us look at the clause. The power is to be restricted in several ways. We discussed the insertion of the word ``express'' into subsection (1). Even that modest word did not find favour with Ministers. The first provision in the clause covers things that councils cannot do because of existing enactments or prohibitions. Secondly-this is the real killer-councils will neither receive money from central Government for the new power, nor be able to raise the money in the local community.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Not true.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister says that that is not true. I read in Hansard that she also said that the other day. However, she has not been good enough to expand on that. I shall be happy to give way if she would like to do so now.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We made it clear that the restriction will mean that councils cannot introduce new taxes. I am interested that the hon. Gentleman persists in arguing that he wants new taxes. I made it clear in our first sitting that councils will be able to use the existing finance system, but that that will mean no new taxes. Is the hon. Gentleman arguing for new taxes?

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am not arguing for anything. I am trying to turn this camel of a Bill into something a little more elegant and fleet-footed.

<P>
The Minister is simply repeating what she said before and what Lord Whitty said in the House of Lords, which was that councils can have more money as long as they take it out of existing budgets, or, perhaps, raise it through council tax. I suspect that the response of most local councils will be, ``Thanks a bunch!'' because, in the ever-growing cupboard of big sticks, there remains the big stick of capping powers. The Government have not abolished those powers, but have kept them in good repair. That is a key point in relation not only to clause 3 but to the whole Bill.

<P>
The Government reserve their capping powers so that councils know that they cannot exceed certain limits, yet the Minister tells them that they can take a chance by raising council taxes to fund activities instigated under the new powers. However, the big stick of capping is still there and is now to be joined by the various big sticks contained in clause 3.

<P>
As I said, there is to be no specific extra money for this power. Furthermore, just to be on the safe side, the Secretary of State will have the power to prevent local authorities, by order, from doing certain things. My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) intervened a moment ago to ask for specific examples, but none was forthcoming. Again, just to be on the safe side, the Government will issue guidance-another big stick. Lest there be any doubt about that stick, the guidance will not even be advisory. There will be a large arsenal of instruments to ensure that the power is a paper tiger, as the Minister for Local Government and the Regions described it in the previous sitting.

<P>
That is not just what we think. The Local Government Association has said that it remains
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>concerned about the extent of the limitations imposed by clause 3.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The association also says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>authorities should be able to levy charges for activities undertaken.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If Ministers will not provide resources in any other way, why should we stop local authorities making sensible charges for certain activities, or at least having the ability to do so? We were told that something might be done in two or three years' time, and we were treated to another reference to the current review of local finance.

<P>
There will be no more resources and there will be substantial limitations on the use of powers. I shall not risk boring the Committee by going through the famous letter from Lord Whitty to my noble Friend Lord Dixon-Smith in detail. However, it is clear from that letter and from the debates in the House of Lords and, so far, in Committee, that that is the position. Lord Whitty-no doubt, with his tongue firmly in his cheek-put it thus:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there is no limit on what authorities can spend under the well-being powers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The restrictions in clause 3(2) merely-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``merely'' is an interesting word-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>prevents them from using the well-being power itself as the means of raising that money.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government, of course-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
he says, ``of course''-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>retains reserve powers to step in and protect the local taxpayer if that is necessary-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, capping and that means check mate for most councils. How on earth are they to make anything of the new power?

<P>
Given the Government's approach to local government, it is axiomatic that councils will be starved of the resources to allow them to make their own decisions. We have seen that trend in the massive growth-50 per cent.-in the number of specific grants, made available only for a particular purpose. Ministers, not local authorities, make decisions about local priorities. There are other pots of funding, here and there, for which authorities must compete and which are, again, for specific purposes.

<P>
We know that there is a debate about the ``Front Line First'' proposals, whereby substantial funding may be diverted from local councils altogether. Then, we wonder why people do not turn out to vote in local elections. Last week, we saw turn-outs of 30 per cent. Even in London, where the great concept of having a directly elected mayor was supposed to improve the turn-out, the figure was just 33 per cent. That is not much of an improvement.

<P>
It all comes back to the funding issue. The point has been well made by Sir Jeremy Beecham, the Labour head of the LGA, in his passionate attacks on the Government for their attitude to funding. From one point of view, the wording of the clause is entirely in line with the Government's general approach to local authority funding. Despite what the Minister said, there will be no extra resources. The clause is a subtle reminder that capping powers remain and it places in the Bill a series of new restrictions on the use of the new power, which will ensure that it has no attraction whatsoever for most local councils. To add insult to injury, we are told that councils are crying out for guidance about how not to operate the new power. Broadly speaking, we agree with the Minister-this is a paper tiger.

<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): We agree with many of the points that were raised by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. The clause gives with one hand and takes with the other. The Government want to free up local government but, in view of the powers that will be given to the Secretary of State, they are strangling it with regulations and clarifications that restrict rather than liberate its efforts to meet community needs. It is possible to increase consultation, to limit local government's powers and to fail to act on the results of the consultation.

<P>
The new general power will be introduced without an accompanying power to charge. Despite that power, not allowing local government to take greater fiscal responsibilities will have an inhibitory effect on authorities and the way in which they develop their community leadership role. We hope that section 150 powers will be used to provide a temporary solution during the interim period while we await a local government finance Bill. It is regrettable that the clause, which will give so much power to the Secretary of State, lies uneasily with the Government's statement that they wish to free up local government. We are not happy with the clause and if there is a vote on it, we shall vote against.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 100, in page 3, line 6, leave out ``is to have power to'' and insert ``must''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 91, in page 3, line 6, leave out ``is to have power to'' and insert ``shall''.

<P>
No. 108, in page 3, line 6 after ``prepare'', insert ``and keep under review''.

<P>
Government amendment No. 101.

<P>
Amendment No. 97, in page 3, leave out line 7 and insert ``the sustainable development.''.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 102 and 103.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I apologise for the fact that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales has had to go next door to attend the Committee that is considering the Learning and Skills Bill. He had hoped to move the amendments, some of which resulted in part from representations from the Welsh Assembly and I am sorry that he is not here to do so.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 100 to 103 will create a coherent approach to community planning. We listened carefully to the views that were expressed in another place, in the Welsh Assembly and by wider interest groups, and we tabled the amendments in response to those views.

<P>
Government amendment No. 100 and amendment No. 91 would achieve the same objective, namely, to place authorities under a duty to prepare community strategies. We listened carefully to the arguments and agree that such a duty is the best way to encourage councils to tackle local problems more effectively.

<P>
Amendment No. 102 will add to that approach, so that community strategies will contribute at the local level to achieving sustainable development in the United Kingdom. In preparing strategic plans setting out local priorities and the actions that will be taken to address them, authorities should now ensure that such plans are consistent with the aims of sustainable development.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
In a sense that is nothing new for local authorities, many of which have been leading the way internationally on sustainable development. They are already preparing sustainable development strategies as part of Local Agenda 21 and we expect most authorities to have a strategy in place by the end of the year. Indeed, Sir Jeremy Beecham told me yesterday that more than 90 per cent. are already well on the way.

<P>
The clause provides a statutory basis for bringing sustainable development into the main stream. Placing sustainable development alongside the words ``economic'', ``social'' and ``environmental'' makes it immediately clear that the community strategy must encompass all an authority's functions, whether related to the local economy, the environment or social welfare. That is why we cannot accept amendment No. 97, which would remove that clarity.

<P>
Each of the three elements-economic, social and environmental-has a part to play in sustainable development. Drawing them together through a community strategy will provide a clear framework for local action which, in turn, will contribute to achieving sustainable development throughout the United Kingdom. We believe that that is a reasonable and achievable objective, as do local authorities.

<P>
The new well-being power in clause 2 will be an important tool in ensuring that authorities can deliver sustainable growth in their areas. As we said earlier, our amendment No. 99 now links councils' use of this power with the contents of their community strategies. The question that the chief executive of Craven district council would need to ask before using the well-being power is how the activity fits with the priorities and actions that it has agreed with its partners and the local community in setting out the strategy. That, again, seems to us to be a reasonable and practical consideration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her explanation so far, but does she share any of the concerns of the Local Government Information Unit that this linkage to which she has properly referred can increase the chance of legal challenge for councils?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I considered that carefully and I suspect that it was one reason why it was not in the original Bill, but I have been satisfied by the legal advice that I have received that it would not increase the possibility of legal challenge. I have been concerned about that throughout the Bill. That is why it is a power rather than a duty of well-being, but a duty to prepare the community plan on the advice not only of Government lawyers but of others. As I say, it has been pressed on us by the Local Government Association.

<P>
A community strategy will not cover every possible area of activity. That would defeat the point of the exercise. Therefore, the use of the power will not be confined to actions already set out in the community strategy. That will help to lessen the possibility of legal challenge. However, it is appropriate for councils to take into account the broad goals of their strategy and the objectives for local well-being and sustainable development when deciding how best to use their new well-being power. In other words, the linkage does not exclude other activity; it simply means that, in exercising power, local authorities should have some regard to their strategy, consultations and the partnership working in which they have been involved.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> To pin this down before the Minister moves on, the LGIU is concerned that challenges could be made when issues arise that fall outside the community strategy. I appreciate her argument about flexibility and life not being fair, but this is a genuine worry. Even the LGIU, which remained unpersuaded as recently as a couple of days ago, has greater resources than we do to enable examination of these matters. I realise that this is a somewhat sensitive subject, but will the Minister allow members of the Committee to see the legal advice that she has received?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, that is not the practice of Governments; indeed, it was not the practice of the previous Conservative Government. As a lawyer, he will also know that lawyers try to undermine legislation in any way possible and it is not in our interests to give them the necessary ammunition.

<P>
We are confident that the provision makes it clear that one does not have to dot every ``i'' and cross every ``t'' in the community strategy. In exercising the power, one should think about the priorities expressed by others, but it is perfectly legitimate for one to deal with an issue in a way not outlined in the community strategy. The framing of the legislation will allow for that.

<P>
The world is not as neat and tidy as some people would like, particularly those who want to pursue a legal path. We are obliged to create legislation that deals with the real world and the way in which people act and that is what we are trying to do.

<P>
Amendment No. 108 would impose a statutory requirement on local authorities to keep their strategies under review. We would of course expect local authorities and their partners to do that, but we do not believe the imposition of a further duty to be necessary.

<P>
This morning, we heard much from the Opposition about the Government's seeking to give local authorities a broad power only then to constrain it. However, the Government are being pushed to place further, burdensome responsibility on local government. We expect sensible and straightforward authorities to review their community strategy and responsibilities for the community plan. However, we do not want to include such a requirement in the Bill, because we would then have to provide guidance on the precise way in which authorities should review their strategies. As a result, we might establish a programme that met the needs of some authorities but not others.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): If I catch your eye in a minute, Mrs Michie, I shall perhaps develop the following point. Will the Minister nevertheless confirm that the establishment of a statutory requirement on local councils to produce a community plan will give them the ability to draw other local partners into the process? Does she further accept that only by establishing a review process will local councils be able to draw in local partners on a statutory basis?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not agree with that. I agree that councils should be able to draw on other views as part of the community strategy, but the hon. Gentleman's proposal might not have the effect that he intends. If a timetable were imposed on a review by central Government, which is what we would have to do were we to include such a provision in the Bill, other bodies, such as health authorities, would have to respond at a time that was out of synch with their normal timetable. Therefore, they would be unable to participate fully and effectively. Review and assessment are necessary and we shall give authorities guidance to ensure that that happens. Indeed, the best value Act-that is, the Local Government Act 1999-will also ensure that. However, we are not keen to prescribe the timetable in the Bill. That should be a matter for local discretion because it will be necessary for the review to be carried out at different times and in different ways by different authorities to reflect local circumstances.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I want to congratulate the Minister on her sudden change of position. Having listened to her speaking on the best value Act, I hope that she will ponder what she has just said and go back and look at what she said previously.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We are talking about different things. Best value has a clear timetable-something for which the hon. Gentleman suggested that we were not pushing strongly enough. That timetable is for the delivery of quality services to local people. It was right to be clear about timetables and the reporting of matters relating to best value, but we are now talking about something different. Different legislation requires different approaches. I am not ashamed of that because it is a coherent position. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), who tabled amendment No. 108, will realise that we are simply trying to find the most effective way to meet the needs of local government while ensuring that we adopt a sensible approach towards sustaining a community strategy.

<P>
The nature and timing of any review should be a matter for local discretion. That is why amendments Nos. 102 and 103 provide a discretionary power for authorities to modify their strategies as and when local needs require and to sort out arrangements for doing so. That will be backed up by guidance, which will emphasise the importance of monitoring, reviewing and reporting progress back to the community.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> May I say from the outset that I accept the Minister's advice about amendment No. 91. As she said, that amendment and Government amendment No. 100 would achieve the same purpose. I shall not go so far as to say that great minds think alike, because the pressure to make such an amendment came from the Local Government Association and other bodies representing local councils. Although we were delighted to table the amendment, we are more than happy to accept the Minister's formulation.

<P>
The need for the amendment has not been thoroughly explored by the Minister. I am sure that she will be happy to confirm the reasons, some of which have not yet been mentioned. One of the most crucial is that local councils are required to produce as many as 42 plans and they would think it wonderful if that number could be reduced. Without the proposed changes, the Bill would add to that number.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Of course, I give way to the expert in these matters.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman, although I shall ignore his sarcasm. I am intrigued by amendment No. 109-we shall debate that next-as it seems to take a different position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for that intervention, although I assure the hon. Gentleman that no sarcasm was intended. I believe that he has considerable expertise and experience in the matter. I look forward to his contributions as the Committee's deliberations continue-over many weeks, no doubt. I expect to learn a great deal from him. However, with your agreement, Mrs Michie, I shall not respond to his comments about amendment No. 109. First, I suspect that you might rule me out of order. Secondly, I may catch your eye and deal with that matter later.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will intervene to confirm whether I am right, but I believe that making the production of the community strategy a statutory requirement will make it possible to incorporate some of the requirements placed on local councils for the production of other plans, thereby reducing the burden on them.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is our intention to proceed in that way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful. It was important to place that on record. We shall be more than happy to withdraw amendment No. 91 and accept Government amendment No. 100.

<P>
The Minister sought to convince me that amendment No. 108 would be counterproductive. She tried to persuade me that she and I share the same view on the way forward and that all sensible councils will want to keep their plans under review. I accept that Government amendments Nos. 102 and 103 will allow local authorities to change their community strategies and plans from time to time. That is sensible, but I return to the purpose of including in the Bill a reference to keeping strategy plans under review-a subject that I raised during an intervention on the Minister.

<P>
Government amendment No. 100 does not only have the advantage of helping to reduce the burden on local councils by enabling them to incorporate into the new plans some of the other plans that they must produce. It will also give a much higher status to councils' work, enabling them to bring in other local partners, who will now be forced to get involved in the planning process. The same ability to draw other groups in during any local council review given statutory backing surely applies.

<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford), the Minister said that different approaches were taken in different pieces of legislation; that is sometimes right. I would be interested to know what has brought about the change of heart about placing reviews on a statutory basis since 1998, when the Government introduced the Bill to create the National Assembly for Wales. During the passage of that legislation, it was thought important to do so. The reasons that I have given were the reasons expressed then.

<P>
The Minister hoped that I would be prepared not to move amendment No. 97. She argued-

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am a little bemused by what the hon. Gentleman has said. I had understood that there was only one National Assembly for Wales.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If by a slip of the tongue I referred to more than one, I apologise. I hope that the Minister will not use that argument to suggest that the rest of what I have said has no relevance. I am certainly aware that there is only one National Assembly for Wales-innovative and exciting body that it no doubt is.

<P>
The Minister sought to persuade me that amendment No. 97 might create problems, because the requirement for involvement in sustainable development might be seen as not applying to all other council activities. If that was what she has been advised, I would be more than happy to accept it. Our intention and, I suspect, the Minister's desire as well, is that all local council activities should, wherever possible, contribute to sustainable development.

<P>
The Minister did not touch on one point, relating to Government amendment No. 102, that had been raised in an earlier discussion. In that amendment, we return to our old friend sustainable development in the United Kingdom. The Minister might help me-as I have asked her before-with what would happen when it could be argued that one local council helping sustainable development in its area was not helping UK-wide sustainable development.

<P>
Given the challenge from the hon. Member for Mole Valley, I look forward to debating amendment No. 109, which would further add to the community planning process. The Minister and I are not far apart. We are both keen to see the plans given a statutory basis and for them to become a duty. That will have the enormous benefit of reducing the number of other plans and of bringing in other local partners. The change will also do something that local government has been asking for.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If you wish to remain seated, Mr. Curry, you have my permission to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> That is kind, Mrs Michie.

<P>
I do not feel able to join the wonderful emerging consensus. I do not know whether any hon. Members have seen the film ``The Road to Wellville''. I mention it because it is almost a film version of what the Minister is trying to achieve in the Bill. The film is about the founder of the Kellogg empire, who set up a spa in the mid west. The activities in the spa were based on the forcible feeding of roughage. It turned into a sort of asylum, and I cannot help feeling that the Bill is doing the same thing to local government with all this well-being business.

<P>
Earlier, the Minister basically said ``We love local government; the Bill is wonderful because we are using it to give local government freedom, in contrast to the previous Administration, which was all for tying local government up in chains and imprisoning it.''

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I did not say that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The right hon. Lady's colleague, the Under-Secretary, clearly expressed those views and made great play of them.

<P>
The indicative little word ``must'' appears constantly in the Bill and gives it its prescriptive tone. The Minister says ``We are going to give local government freedom, but we are going to tell it how it is to use its freedom, how it will structure itself to discharge its freedom, to whom it will report its freedom and who will have the power to intervene in its freedom.'' That is prescriptive. The idea that the Bill is a liberation measure is baloney from start to finish. The Minister tells us that local government wants such legislation and that it wants to be bound. That assertion does not surprise me-local government has spent years and years moaning about wanting to be free, but all the time it loves to be in chains. It suffers from Munchausen's syndrome and loves inflicting pain on itself. The Bill is yet another example of local government's attitude. Instead of believing that it might be able to do something itself, it wants to be told to do it.

<P>
That is why the Bill uses not only the magic word ``must'', but another wonderful word, ``community''. Like the word ``empowerment'', ``community'' is one of the great buzzwords of contemporary politics and means nothing at all. My constituency contains a thousand communities. The idea that there is a community of interest across the whole of Craven is nonsense. Let us consider Lambeth, where I live. How should Lambeth, which is just across the road, identify the community for which it is supposed to draw up a strategy? How should Camden identify such a community? All such words are part of the political parlance that is currently in vogue, but they mean nothing in practice. All the partners are self-appointed, so a nice little oligarchy of people will sit in local authorities, talking to each other and writing reports. They will then have the progress reported back. It will not amount to a row of beans.

<P>
In the final Government amendment, Banquo's ghost is back in the form of sustainable development. I thought that we had seen Banquo murdered in one of the earlier clauses, but he is coming back to haunt us. How will the provision fit into the United Kingdom? Let us consider the dear old chief executive of Craven. Hon. Members will be delighted to hear that she is a lady-a real lady-[Laughter.] That is one of the few features that she shares with the Minister. How will the chief executive of Craven report to her members that a strategy is consistent with the sustainable development policy of the United Kingdom? It is daft to introduce requirements that are expressed in such terms. A certificate will be awarded to say that the strategy conforms, although nobody will have the faintest idea how to test whether it does, and this provision, too, will not add up to a row of beans.

<P>
Requiring local government to spend its time drawing up strategies and plans is a wonderful policy. One day, however, local government will be allowed to do something. One day, it will be allowed to concentrate on emptying the dustbins on time, which is what local people want local authorities to do. I do not care a hoot whether my council has a community strategy. I want to know that the dustbins will be emptied on time. I want to know that in my old age I will not fall over cracks in the paving stones. I want to know that people are parking where they are supposed to park and not blocking meals on wheels and emergency vehicles trying to reach pensioners. I want to know that there are proper disposal facilities for refuse, which is difficult in Craven because of the local natural geography. Quite frankly, they should put all their community strategies in a combined heat and power system and use them to heat Craven. That would do more good than the Government's constant imposition on local authorities of the requirement to draw up new strategies, which are all part of the modern modish politics.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government amendments are wrong. The Liberal Democrats-not surprisingly-agree with the Government because they also want to impose new duties on local governments. I shall be surprised if I take a different attitude to amendment No. 109. Can local government not be allowed to make some of its own decisions? Can local government not decide how to do something? Can local government not decide what it thinks is right in the circumstances without having the whole wretched business imposed upon it as a duty. If the LGA wants the duty, then, I am sorry, the LGA is being silly and short-sighted. I wish that it had more confidence in its members. I regret that the amendments have been tabled and-if the Minister is right-I regret the fact that they have been sought by local government. Occasionally, people have to be saved from themselves. I hope in a moment to be given the opportunity to make a, no doubt failed, attempt in that regard.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his interesting speech. Although we have enormous sympathy for his current condition, it does make it difficult to know when he has finished speaking. [Laughter.] But in a tour d'horizon of modern British film, we have heard about Munchausen's syndrome, which I assume has something to do with Baron Munchausen. I was not taken by the idea of forcibly feeding roughage to people, although it does sound as though it might be similar to serving on a Standing Committee. The way in which my right hon. Friend kept referring to the special needs of Craven was reminiscent of the film ``Passport to Pimlico''. Perhaps they ought to do things by way of a unilateral declaration of independence.

<P>
We should return to what the Minister said. It is easy to forget what the hon. Lady said, partly because it was some time ago. She made two points which were extraordinarily worrying. The Minister said that lawyers want to undermine legislation and that the world outside is neither neat nor tidy. Certainly, that appears to be the case in Craven. The Minister should understand that it is our job to try and defeat those wicked lawyers. It is our job-as far as is possible-if not to make the world neat and tidy, at least to avoid legislation that is untidy. Again, guidance is a problem. Where is it? What is it likely to say? Those are important questions.

<P>
The gravamen of the amendments is much as we have already discussed. The rest of the debate can be fairly short. The amendments would impose on local authorities an obligation to prepare a community strategy. Previously, the Bill gave them a permissive power to produce such a strategy. Now, apparently as a result of pressure from the Local Government Association and others, we have a sorry compromise. My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon touched on some of the contradictions produced by that compromise.

<P>
The real efect of the amendments is that local authorities will be forced to justify themselves to the Secretary of State rather than to the local electorate. It is difficult to discuss the issue sensibly without some clue as to the guidance that is lurking in the background. That is another big stick waiting to be unveiled.

<P>
I referred earlier to the attitude, particularly with respect to amendment No. 100, of the Local Government Information Unit-not exactly a paid-up branch of the Conservative party. It is worried and wants the matter to be clarified in debate. All I can say is that its staff obviously do not attend many debates.

<P>
The unit argues that amendment No. 100 changes the original balance of the Bill and could link the use of the power to the community plan. It is worried that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>possibility of challenge will arise over an action that was not foreseen in the community strategy, or over something that might be argued as conflicting with or undermining the community strategy, or which diverts resources from it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the risk of an adverse judicial interpretation<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and states that doubts could arise
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>over the legality of the exercise of the well-being power, which is particularly regrettable since one of the aims of the well-being power has been to reduce legal uncertainty.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Bizarrely, therefore, what apparently started as an attempt to reduce lawyers' ability to undermine the Bill, to paraphrase the Minister's earlier comments, could produce exactly the opposite effect. The Local Government Information Unit states that it wants
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to avoid wasteful and unnecessary challenge-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
an aspiration that we share. It has made drafting suggestions which the Minister has apparently discarded.

<P>
On balance we consider the amendments to be an unhappy group. I am delighted to say that I cannot claim proprietorship of any of them. In a sense, it is impertinent of me to intrude in a private squabble between the Government and the Liberal Democrats, but I do not think that either party has achieved what they intended or produced improvements to the Bill and we do not support the amendments.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am intrigued that the Conservative party, with all the legal advice that it has available to it, if only from Members of Parliament, now uses the Local Government Information Unit as its source. I shall report back on that. The unit's staff will be much encouraged, since right hon. and hon. Members on the Conservative Back Benches would not in the past have considered them experts on Conservative policy and local government. Many transformations and U-turns are going on. The problem is that there is a Bench dividing the Opposition Front Bench from the Back Bench, and I suspect that Conservative Back Benchers wish that there were more. The differences are substantial.

<P>
I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Bath and I think that our views on this topic are not as far as usual from those of the Liberal Democrats. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the Government are aiming for the right balance. In making my point about the National Assembly for Wales, I had in mind that, because there are so many different local authorities, they will need different ways of doing things. It is possible for guidance to specify when the National Assembly for Wales will be expected to conduct reviews. There is only one National Assembly for Wales. However, there are many local authorities, and the timetables and demands that affect them will involve different periods. I was arguing that it is over-burdensome to lay on every local authority the same timetable and strictures in terms of using the power, and the duty on community strategies, effectively. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that.

<P>
I was fascinated by the intervention by my friend, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. He often seems to become frustrated when trying to find ways of expressing the relationships between people at a local level, which, as I am sure he agrees, go beyond simple relationships between individuals. I accept that it can be difficult to give the full picture in that respect. At one stage, I thought that he was trying to undermine my whole career, during which I worked as a community worker and taught community and youth work. I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman's comments would not go down well in those circles.

<P>
Nobody claims that community is a simple concept; it is not. That is because of people's strengths in relating to one another in a series of ways. No council can go about its business effectively without trying to work out how people in different organisations respond to council services, in terms of what they deliver and whether they meet local people's expectations.

<P>
I shall give the right hon. Gentleman an example from housing, which is no longer part of my responsibilities-nor his, although he too has had responsibility for it in the past. When we reach a later part of the Bill, we will discuss attitudes to supporting people-for example, through housing for the disabled and the elderly. Groups of carers have told me that the Government, and councils, should take account of their views when developing policies on that. Carers are now joining together in such a way that they form part of the community with which the local authority will have to engage. It will have to ensure that their interests are considered in developing its community strategy and specific service programmes under best value. One cannot possibly list every single group with which it may wish to have contact, nor the generality of those groups. I am therefore happy to use the word ``community''. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman can suggest an alternative.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does the word ``community'' in the Bill refer to all the people within the territory that is covered by local authority? Does it have to produce an area strategy covering its own bailiwick? Let us leave Craven for a minute and go to Harrogate. Harrogate, with Knaresborough, is an urban authority. Pateley Bridge is light years away from Harrogate in terms of its needs-it looks to Upper Nidderdale. Is the Minister proposing a series of local strategies based on self-contained areas, or will the local authority produce one area strategy that will necessarily have to be divided into a series of sub-areas to have any real meaning? Does the Bill use a modish word for the simple concept that a local authority has to produce a strategy for its area?

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The problem to which the right hon. Gentleman refers affects local government generally. The areas for which local government is responsible contain many different communities. There are probably as many differences in my constituency as there are in his. A village that abuts the city of Durham is very different from one that is at the top of the north Pennines, but the local authority is responsible for all of them. If it dealt only with the main town in which the town hall is situated, it would not serve all of the area's needs. It may produce its overall strategy by drawing on local plans and consultations.

<P>
It is not for the Government to determine such matters, although we can say, ``You cannot effectively discharge your duty as a local authority unless you engage with the electorate in various ways.'' It is rather silly to continue to argue about that-I suspect that we are all in the same boat in this regard. The right hon. Gentleman never shared Baroness Thatcher's view that there is no such thing as society. I hope that we can approach this matter with common sense-that, after all, is what the Leader of the Opposition always urges on his party members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister should consider this matter from the citizen's point of view. We talk about community in the same way that the French talk about les administrs, which involves the way in which people happen to be governed. The idea that the people of Ripon, for example, think of themselves as being in a community with the people of Harrogate is nonsense. They do not-they cannot stick Harrogate at any price. The Minister will be aware that such local particularities are important. Will she use terminology that reflects the way in which people think about themselves? When people think about community, they think of something that is, on the whole, very local-a small village or a street. They do not use the term with the meaning that the Bill gives it.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Amendment No. 104 introduces a requirement for local authorities to consult and seek the participation of such persons as they consider appropriate when preparing a community strategy. Amendment No. 10 has a similar aim, and I trust that Conservative Members will not press it to a vote.

<P>
We have said many times that community strategies are not plans for the local authority only. Effective community strategies will depend crucially on the participation of other local organisations and agencies from the private, public or voluntary sector that can contribute to improving the quality of local life and the participation and engagement of local people. Amendment No. 104 provides the legal underpinning for that consultation and participation, while leaving each authority to decide the details of the arrangements.

<P>
Amendment No. 76 would remove that discretion from local authorities. Conservative Members presumably believe that local authorities cannot be trusted to consult properly and want to compel them to consult and seek the participation of every conceivable local body and individual without considering whether it is beneficial to do so. We could not support that. Although we want authorities to consult widely and to involve all the community representatives in preparing the community strategy, we accept that it will not always be appropriate to involve some groups in the most detailed way. What better way is there to decide than by requiring authorities to prove that they have considered the appropriateness or otherwise of all the local bodies?

<P>
As I made clear on the previous amendment, in some strategies it may be appropriate to include carers. I am sure that every member of the Committee could think of examples of what would and would not be appropriate in a certain instance. Therefore, I expect the hon. Member for Eastbourne to say that amendment No. 76 is a probing amendment.

<P>
I do not wish to pre-empt anything that the hon. Gentleman may say on amendment No. 75, but it may be helpful if I make it clear that the term ``person'' used in subsection (2)(a) is well-established legal shorthand. It is defined in the Interpretation Act 1978 as including a body of persons corporate or incorporate. Therefore, local authorities will be required to consult relevant partnerships as well as relevant organisations, bodies, authorities, or whatever one calls them. Like the earlier amendment No. 74, amendment No. 77 would remove the Secretary of State's discretion over whom to consult on draft guidance and would require him to justify the final content of that guidance.

<P>
I shall spare the Committee a detailed re-run of our earlier arguments on guidance issued under clause 3 on the use of the well-being power. Suffice it to say that the new code of written consultation provides for the transparency of decision making that Conservative Members seek.

<P>
Finally, amendment No. 11 attempts to make guidance on community strategies issued by the Secretary of State advisory only. We explained on earlier amendments to guidance on the well-being power why we believe that statutory guidance is appropriate. The same arguments apply here.

<P>
While we do not want to prescribe in legislation the content of community strategies or the way in which they should be prepared, we believe, as do most Opposition Members, that authorities should be required to consider issues and principles, such as health, equality or opportunity, tackling social exclusion and so on. Such principles should underpin the preparation of community strategies by basing those strategies on a proper assessment of local needs, engaging all sections of the community in their development, reviewing them and reporting progress to the community.

<P>
Such guidance is likely to be welcomed by local government and other organisations that operate at local level who will have a clear idea of what to expect from the process and the importance that the Government attach to it. I ask hon. Members to vote for amendment No. 104 and not to press their amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> As you know, Mrs Michie, my life's aim is to avoid being thought churlish, and it would be churlish to pursue our amendments, not least because the Government's amendment includes the thrust of our amendments. It was helpful of the Minister to explain her objection to our amendments and their purpose. It was decent of her to do part of my job. The amendments refer to the whole consultation process and the seriousness of it.

<P>
The Government's amendment is a welcome admission that local authorities should have an obligation to consult widely within their communities when preparing a strategy for the promotion of well-being. The Government's amendment and the Bill do not go far enough and our amendments would ensure wider participation in the consultation process. We want to downgrade the significance of the Secretary of State's guidance, but local authorities should be in a position to take heed of it or not, as they choose, based on local circumstances. I hope that that explains our position and I shall not move the amendments in my name.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 92,
in page 3, line 13, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) All local non-departmental public bodies shall have regard to the strategy in their area produced under subsection 1 above'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 112, in page 3, line 16, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) A local authority may require other public bodies, whether statutory or voluntary, in its area to comply with and to participate in its strategy for promoting or improving the economic social or environmental wellbeing of their area.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> This is a unique occasion on which there appears to be agreement between the Opposition parties, so I look forward to the full support of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. The Minister has made it clear that the amendments that we have just discussed will enable the greater involvement of other local partners in the community planning process by a local authority. Placing a duty on local authorities to initiate a community planning process will raise the status of that process but amendment No. 92 would ensure that there is an opportunity to bring other organisations into that process. Unfortunately, the Government recently rejected the recommendations of the Select Committee on Public Administration. In its report on quangos it recommended that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>funding bodies should make it a condition of funding agreements that local bodies in receipt of funds should be willing to appear at least annually before a scrutiny committee of the appropriate local authority (if one exists) to present its Annual Report. NHS Trusts should be obliged by the-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Department of Health to do the same.

<P>
In rejecting that proposal, the Government cited the concepts of community planning and community strategies, saying that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>this process will increase the accountability of all local bodies to the communities they serve.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is difficult to see how that could be achieved if local bodies did not participate in the process.

<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that those bodies participate in the process, which would provide the opportunity for some genuinely joined-up thinking about the issues affecting the community, or the range of individual communities within the community at large.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Member for Bath points out that amendment No. 112 is similar to his amendment, although we think that ours is more elegantly drafted, despite the limitations on our resources, and a little more clear cut. As he said, it is worrying that great minds seem to have thought alike on this occasion. I am sure that it is a random process; it had to happen sooner or later and I dare say that it will not happen again. I endorse several points that he made.

<P>
This issue concerns community leadership, a buzz phrase bandied about by the Government on these occasions. We are in the business of trying to help the Government produce joined-up government. There is not much point in a local authority pursuing the economic, social and environmental well-being of its area if other public bodies do not embrace the strategy, or are pulling in a different direction.

<P>
This seems to be a case of the Government's nerve failing at the last minute. The narrow point that I am trying to make is that, if they are trying to deliver so-called community leadership-this may or may not find favour with Conservative Back Benchers-they will surely need to augment this part of the Bill by means of one or other of the amendments. The thrust of both amendments would be widely welcomed by all the councils that are to be lead councils in their areas-those that are supposed to deliver community leadership.

<P>
The Local Government Association has expressed concern about getting quangos and others to co-operate with community planning. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although the new duty  will raise the status of this approach, there is no requirement on other public sector organisations to participate in the process. It has been a longstanding concern of the Association that quangos, in particular, may undermine community planning by refusing to co-operate in the process.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a lot of good sense in that. Similar sentiments are reflected in a recent article in the Local Government Chronicle by Professors Jones and Stewart, about the way in which the Bill has been diluted from the original thoughts on a number of issues set out in the White Paper. They conclude their article by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We do not doubt that most councils will seek to develop community planning. The issue is whether all other public bodies will co-operate.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I am no lover of quangos. The Government seem to be developing them at a rapid rate, be they regional development agencies or other bodies. They have no democratic basis. If we are meant to be pumping credibility, interest and-dare I say it?-excitement back into existing local government structures, why on earth are we risking siphoning off some of the power and influence involved into non-elected local bodies? I understand the frustration felt by the Local Government Association and the councils that it represents. Those councils are being asked to adopt a community leadership role while having to work with a great many bodies that do not share their democratic legitimacy, pull in different directions and have their own agendas. That is why we support both amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I should like to clarify the practical implications. I assume that the regional development agency is one of the bodies in the sights of my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Bath. RDAs have a regional remit. Their job, which they have done fairly well, is to draw up a strategy, which necessitates making some hard choices. It has always been emphasised that RDAs are not supposed to sprinkle benefits across an entire region. They must adopt hard-headed strategies and isolate issues that they want to pursue. That necessarily involves identifying areas that are more likely than others to receive benefits immediately.

<P>
How does a requirement for an RDA to comply with, or have regard to, a strategy developed by a number of local authorities marry with its own broader strategy? How will that requirement affect the ability of the RDA to develop an overarching regional strategy? I understand what my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne is seeking to achieve, but I am concerned about the implications.

<P>
We should consider the local citizens advice bureaux. Strictly speaking, they are not quangos, but they play an important role. They receive public funds, but the funds are insufficient. All bureaux report that they are under pressure. Many people are approaching them with financial difficulties and debt management problems. As a recipient of public funding, would the CAB be required to be part of a local strategy? That issue needs to be addressed.

<P>
Some national quangos none the less have an impact at a local level. For example, proposed Environment Agency charges for the disposal of sheep dip sounds picturesque, but it is a serious issue in the uplands of the United Kingdom. Although the Government's action plan includes proposals to try to limit the charges' impact, they will affect the well-being of the agricultural community.

<P>
I understand entirely what my hon. Friend is seeking to achieve, but I would like reassurance that the provision will work in practice. I am slightly suspicious of the constant repetition of the word ``planning''. I look at economies that have been planned, and none seems to have been successful. Before we impose a major planning responsibility and oblige all manner of agencies to conform to a strategy, we should exercise caution. Perhaps such agencies are efficient precisely because they are not subject to an overarching strategy, and are free to pursue local issues as they arise. I am sure that there is a way in which to marry together those factors.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I shall make a few brief comments. We have always said that, to be effective, community strategies must be co-operative ventures that involve not merely public bodies, but a wide range of other bodies from other sectors. However, that needs to be worked at, for many of the reasons outlined by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon.

<P>
In terms of the relationship between councils and other public bodies, and the formulation of community strategies, the element of compulsion in amendment No. 112 is neither feasible nor desirable. If those strategies are to work, they have to be worked at and owned, and people have to be brought together in that common ownership. That is being done effectively in those councils that already work in that way. That is why amendment No. 112 is different from amendment No. 92.

<P>
On amendment No. 92, we recognise the need for central Government to support the development of community strategies through their own activities and the efforts of non-departmental bodies, and we are considering carefully the best way to do that. As the right hon. Gentleman suggests, if public bodies are to be effective, we must accept that they will be engaged in the development and implementation of community strategies.

<P>
We cannot accept the amendment's wording, and there may be additional problems with it. We need to explore with the Parliamentary Counsel Office the feasibility of stating that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>public bodies shall have regard to the strategy in their area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the hon. Member for Bath will withdraw the amendment, I give the undertaking that we shall explore further that approach. We may be able to bring forward an appropriate amendment on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I note with considerable interest the questions that the right hon. Member for Skipton
and Ripon asked the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for Eastbourne, and the fact that the amendment about which the right hon. Gentleman raised queries was tabled in his name and those of his hon. Friends.

<P>
On a more sympathetic note, I also note that the right hon. Gentleman is still suffering the difficulty of having to stand to get permission to sit down. Perhaps we should find another mechanism by which he could display his desire to participate-or to stop participating-in a debate.

<P>
I sympathise with some of the points that the right hon. Gentleman raised. He flagged up a slight difference between amendment No. 92 and amendment No. 112.

<P>
I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, who appears to understand our intentions in this regard. I take on board her suggestion that the amendment's wording may create difficulty. She gave the assurance that she will consider an alternative formulation, and that she may return to the matter at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 105, in page 3, line 16, at end insert-

The amendment makes it clear that the provision of guidance on community strategies in Wales will be a matter for the National Assembly for Wales.

I hope that the Committee agrees to this straightforward amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> In view of the time, I shall try to deal briefly with the amendment and those that are grouped with it. The amendments straddle clauses 5 and 6, so I will deal with issues raised by both clauses. It would be sensible to deal with them all together. The amendments all refer to the Secretary of State's powers to amend, repeal, revoke or disapply enactments in pursuance of the new power.

<P>
The Bill appears to imply that the Secretary of State must decide off his own bat to exercise this power. It must be common sense that those who are in the best position to know whether an enactment is preventing them from using the new power properly are the councils affected rather than civil servants or Ministers. We therefore want it to be explicit that local authorities can apply to the Secretary of State for him to exercise his powers.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Liberal Democrat amendment, No. 98, reflects the same desire, although, again, we think that it lacks elegance in its drafting. But that is a matter for them. A more substantive criticism of their amendment is that it does not provide for the Secretary of State to consult representatives of local government before using the power. The process will be a valuable check, not only against the risk of the power being abused but also to ensure that neighbouring local authorities are not harmed by the disapplication or amendment of an Act relating to another authority. Our amendments, in particular Nos. 13, 14 and 12, would put those mistakes right and make this common-sense proposal workable.

<P>
We note the use of the Henry VIII power. On the whole this is a deregulatory proposal, which we always support. I note in passing that it is ``strongly supported'' by the Local Government Association.

<P>
Local authorities already face a mountain of paperwork as a result of the Government's policies. Matters such as best value and so on already put tremendous burdens and costs on local authorities. It seems absurd to require them to keep their strategy under continuous review and also to produce an annual plan. Common sense dictates that this plan and the best value performance plan should be combined to save time and money.

<P>
We welcome to some extent the fact that, under the clause, the Secretary of State can revoke or disapply requirements to produce and publish any of the seemingly constant stream of plans and strategies required from local government. Once again, the thrust of most of our amendments is to include in the Bill the right of local authorities to initiate the process and apply to the Secretary of State for him to use his powers under the clause. The thrust of the Liberal Democrats' amendment is similar, but it falls slightly short of the mark. That is hardly surprising as, in some of their earlier amendments, they seem to be in favour of local authorities producing yet more plans and strategies.

<P>
The Local Government Association's comments on the clause are informative. It rightly says that there is a Henry VIII power, which is aimed at reducing the burden on authorities to produce dozens of separate statutory plans when instead they should focus on developing an ``holistic community plan''. It would not be a sitting of the Local Government Bill if we did not get in the word ``holistic''. The LGA says that clause 6 gives the Secretary of State exclusive discretion to make orders to disapply certain statutory plans. It says that it would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>support a procedure that would allow authorities, by declaration, to state that all or some of their statutory plans were covered by their community strategy.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We have tried to oblige the Local Government Association by our amendments, and in that spirit, and apparently with the support of the spokespeople for
the local government community, I commend the amendments to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> It is interesting that the hon. Member for Eastbourne makes much of his disagreement with the Liberal Democrats and then finds that we are trying to do the same thing with our amendments. In this instance he is right: we are trying to achieve the same objective. The purpose of the amendments is to provide for a process that does not exist in the Bill, whereby an individual council may apply to the Secretary of State to request the exercise of the power under subsection (1).

<P>
Clause 2 will give councils greater certainty and flexibility in their decision making. It should also promote broader thinking and innovation, subject to the limitations in clause 3. In the long term, clause 5 will effect real change through the application of the powers of the Secretary of State to lift restrictions where they are found to prevent or obstruct local authorities from exercising the new power.

<P>
It is important that the Bill should stipulate a process, which should be bottom-up, rather than top-down, as is so common elsewhere in the Bill. We do not question the importance of change being explored between central Government and local government and we are broadly sympathetic with many of the measures that the Government are trying to implement. However, we are concerned about some of their methods. Apparently, the making of orders under clause 5 will be crucial to the long-term development of the well-being power, in terms of introducing greater flexibility in a considered way and in response to local needs. Reliance on an informal process tends to undermine that opportunity. At all times, the onus is on the Secretary of State, not local authorities.

<P>
A bottom-up process is required in addition to the generation of initiatives by central Government in co-operation with local government representatives. That would enable a council to take the initiative in making an application to the Minister, or groups of councils with a common interest, or within an area, to develop their own proposals for change within a transparent and widely recognised framework. [
Interruption.] If some members of the Committee have a problem with the phrase bottom-up, perhaps bubble up might be more appropriate.

<P>
A formal process would have other positive consequences. It would be necessary to monitor and evaluate successful applications. Such evaluation could lead to general relaxations, if experience justified it. It would also be important to keep track of the changes that have been made and where they apply.

<P>
We propose a formal process for the reasons that have been outlined by the Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Eastbourne, and hope that the Under-Secretary will respond positively.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> The amendments reflect the desire of Opposition Members to ensure that every local authority has the opportunity to put forward proposals for action by the Secretary of State and to ensure that such proposals are given the fullest consideration. We share that desire. We want a process that will inform the discussion on how the powers in the clauses should be exercised.

<P>
However, the mechanisms for that already exist and nothing in the Bill prevents individual local authorities, or their representatives, from making proposals to the Secretary of State. We are actively encouraging them to do so through the health action zones and the new commitment to regeneration. We are discussing with the LGA whether we might set up formal arrangements for regularly examining the use of the powers. The Government have established the central-local partnership, a regular and formal meeting of local government representatives and Ministers not only from my Department, but across Government. That is the proper vehicle through which the experiences of local authorities can be discussed and brought to the attention of the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan </B>(Cardiff, North): Will my hon. Friend explain how clause 5 will operate in relation to the National Assembly for Wales, because subsections (4) and (5) do not make that clear?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> My hon. Friend knows that under clause 5 the Secretary of State will consult with the Assembly and she is asking what that means. In fact, we are still discussing the provisions with the Assembly. The clause provides the power to amend primary and secondary legislation. There is a concordat between the Government and the Assembly and the clause is being discussed within the terms of the wider concordat.

<P>
I remind the Committee of the procedures in clause 8, which will require the Secretary of State to explain any proposals to both Houses of Parliament. Local government and Parliament will have the opportunity to consider the appropriateness of any regulations.

<P>
Clause 6 is a deregulatory power and amendments Nos. 15 and 16 would remove the limits that have been placed on the use of that power and give the Secretary of State a free hand. The clause as drafted provides the necessary power to remove planning burdens.

<P>
We agree with the spirit of the amendments to assure local authorities and their representatives that a mechanism exists for bringing forward their experience in the way those powers should be exercised, but more appropriate mechanisms exist in the channels that we have with local government and their representatives.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> As you will expect, Mrs Michie, I am not entirely happy with that explanation. Such matters should be in the Bill, but, as we are constantly reminded in the Committee, we are not living in an ideal world. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Certain aspects of the Bill raise a smile and even a sigh of relief. I was hoping that at last we would see some light in clause 6, but that hope was dashed a little earlier.

<P>
We argued at length, on best value, that local authorities have been loaded with forms, reviews, documents and consultation. Most local authorities with which I have had contact have found that the level to which they have been burdened has been ludicrous.

<P>
I read the clause with some delight and I should be grateful if the Minister would explain it in more detail. Presumably, it will be implemented by order with a negative or positive resolution in the House. Will she also tell us briefly how broad the provision is? We are delighted with the provision, having sat through the best value legislation wondering whether it could be applied to that legislation under the next Conservative government?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As the hon. Gentleman hinted, clause 6 provides the Secretary of State with the power to amend, repeal, revoke or disapply any enactment that requires a local authority to prepare, produce or publish any plan or strategy. It will allow the Government to tackle some of the problems that have been created by the steady accretion of plans and planning requirements on local councils. I confirm that it will require an affirmative order in both Houses.

<P>
Evidence is emerging that the sheer number of plans that authorities must produce can sometimes obstruct their efforts to integrate services. For example, evidence from health action zones has identified planning burdens as one of the key elements that frustrate successful partnership. One health action zone identified more than 60 planning deadlines that must be met by the various partners and I had that in mind in relation to an earlier clause and an earlier amendment from the hon. Member for Bath.

<P>
Statutory plans are not introduced without good reason. The Government require authorities to produce plans for a variety of reasons: to satisfy themselves that national priorities for which local councils receive funding are being met, or as a basis for the allocation of funds. It is inevitable that, in time, some will be seen to have served their original purpose or will have been superseded by other policy priorities. The requirement to prepare an economic development plan has outlived its usefulness and now gets in the way of a sensible approach to economic development. That will be repealed by clause 94 and schedule 4.

<P>
Problems with other requirements are only now becoming apparent. As local authorities and other agencies work more closely together and attempt to integrate their services, it is likely that we will want, at least, to streamline some planning requirements. We will want the flexibility to work with local strategic partnerships and try out new approaches to planning.

<P>
The clause will make a real difference to the way in which local authorities can work with others. It is an essential part of the modernising framework.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bil.

<H4><center>Procedure for orders under section 5 or 6</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister would explain the order-making procedure set out in the clause. Will it be the affirmative or negative resolution procedure? It is important that we should be sure of the possibility of a debate, and the only way to do that is to provide for affirmative resolution.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The clause sets out the procedure to be followed by the Secretary of State when exercising the powers conferred by clauses 5 and 6. The Government recognise that the clauses confer broad powers, and that Parliament will, rightly, expect to have every possible opportunity to scrutinise any orders made. The clause provides for that scrutiny. Clause 8(1) requires the Secretary of State to consult local government and other bodies, before preparing an order. Clause 8(2) requires the Secretary of State to bring before Parliament a document that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) explains his proposals,

<P>
(b) sets them out in the form of a draft order,

<P>
(c) gives details of consultation <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An order may be laid before Parliament only after a period of 60 days. The Secretary of State must take account of any representations made during that period. All orders must be accompanied by a statement giving details of any such representations and any changes made to the proposals.

<P>
The Government believe that the additional procedures, combined with the affirmative resolution procedures, will ensure that sufficient information is available to Parliament, before it approves any orders made under clauses 5 or 6.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
