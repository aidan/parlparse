<P>
Government amendments Nos. 32, 33 and 57.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> The amendments are sensible. The Government's suspicion of the motives that underlie them is unwarranted and their hurried and dismissive rejection of them is unwise. On some of the amendments at least, there was a welcome consensus between Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members on Tuesday; sadly, it did not extend to Labour Back Benchers or, to Ministers.
<P>
I want to focus briefly on two amendments that are of the essence. The first relates to the need to take account of differences between various areas; the second relates to small businesses. Much has been said about those differences and I do not want to dwell overly on the arguments. However, the Opposition's central contention is that the Government are in danger of making a serious mistake.
<P>
Labour Back Benchers have rushed to defend the Bill, not least on the ground of equality. I refer in particular to the contribution of the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber). Twice during her stimulating speech on Tuesday night, she referred to the objective of increased equality. The problem with that argument is that it requires the Government to treat equally areas that are not equal. The effect of the policy will not be equal--it will be unequal and will damage some of the most disadvantaged areas of the United Kingdom. On that basis, and with good motives, Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members believe that the Government are mistaken and should reconsider their position.
<P>
The hon. Member for Amber Valley referred to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``spurious arguments about flexibility with different pay rates.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 20 January 1998; c. 169.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She said that a differential policy according to region would detract from the attack on inequality and the attempt to achieve equality. That is fundamentally misguided.
<P>
Conservative Members are taking account of the reality of different circumstances throughout the country--let there be no doubt about those. In Wales, for example, 17.3 per cent. of the work force earn less than &#163;3.50 an hour; the figure is only 9 per cent. in London. No matter how much we try to wish that difference away, we will not be successful--it exists and public policy must take account of it.
<P>
Some Labour Members have said that it would be difficult to devise a formula for differential rates. Conservative Members do not deny that, and there could be problems. Devising a formula will not be simple, and thought will be required. However the Government's policy has created a difficulty that requires attention. It is no good Ministers and their supporters on the Back Benches saying that it will be difficult to get around the problem--it is the result of their foolish policy making in the first instance.
<P>
Similarly, the effect of a national minimum wage on job losses will be different in areas. The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry is a London Member I am not, but I am, by origin and background, a Londoner. The hon. Lady and I know that the effect of a national minimum wage in London will be nothing like as great as in other areas. The figures are there for all to see. In the north-east, a &#163;4 national minimum wage with no regional variation and a half restoration of differentials would cut jobs by 6.1 per cent. Conversely, the figure would be only 1.7 per cent. in London. The fact that the north-east would be hardest hit by the unconsidered application of the uniform minimum wage policy might explain the legitimate anxiety of the Minister without Portfolio who has made representations on that point. I have looked through the record of our proceedings and must say, as much as a warning as anything else, that Labour Back Benchers should be careful in their use of language when they dismiss the notion of regional variations. They came close to suggesting that the idea was mad. The Minister without Portfolio would be greatly offended by that. He raised a legitimate concern and I hope that the Minister will respond to it.
<P>
The simple question is, how much would differential and national rates add to the pay bill? We contend that the latter rate would be more severe in its effect and damaging to business, industry and jobs. How many jobs would be lost? Ministers must answer that question. We have put forward our thoughts. They have been rubbished by the Government--rhetorically, but not backed by alterntive evidence. I invite the Minister to submit that evidence now.
<P>
We are concerned about small businesses. The arguments have been well made, but they bear repetition and elaboration. There is a tendency--I do not believe that it is deliberate-- to regard small businesses as the add-on extra, to which we refer from time to time. We debate industry and commerce, then someone says, ``I should like to say a few words about small businesses'', as though they are secondary. The reality is that small businesses are the majority of businesses in the United Kingdom.
<P>
It is a tribute to the effectiveness of their campaigning that the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors are often regarded as the authentic voices of British industry and commerce. In truth, they are not. They have an argument to put, but they are not representative of the overall pattern. The Federation of Small Businesses represents 104,000 members, and the Forum of Private Business, which is much the smaller, has 23,000 members.
<P>
I do not know whether Labour Back Benchers are conscious of the scale of small businesses in the United Kingdom: 97 per cent. of all businesses employ fewer than 20 people and account for 50 per cent. of the private sector work force. Their job creation record--2 million in the past 15 years--is highly impressive. We have lessons to learn and advice to heed when they talk to us.
<P>
There is an unstated belief among Labour Members that, on the whole, owners of small businesses are wealthy and exploitative, which is untrue. I do not know how many Labour Back Benchers are conscious--I confess that I was not until fairly recently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): Barely conscious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I was not conscious until relatively recently, but I doubt that the hon. Gentleman is conscious now. If he is able to prophesy what I am about to say, I shall happily award him a bottle of champagne--but I doubt that he can do so. The hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) represents a north-east constituency, which would suffer disproportionately if a national minimum wage were applied uniformly; frankly, she should contain herself and learn from better sources than her own speeches.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) should be aware that 60 per cent. of small business owners take home less than &#163;11,000 a year. The Federation of Small Businesses provided a recent example: a business owner, having paid his or her workers, can be worse off than those workers. Some owners depend on benefits. They should not be regarded as greedy ogres who are unwilling to part with the few extra pence which they can afford. It may be that the card-carrying, colour-coded sheep representative of new Labour 1998, the hon. Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett), could well afford the increment that she wants to oblige others to pay, but there are many owners of small businesses who could not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): Exactly those people to whom my hon. Friend refers are less likely to be able to afford such an increment because of the implications of changes to pension arrangements introduced by the Chancellor which will increase the contributions to personal pensions that they must make from their earnings. Many will find that they are paying 50 per cent. higher premiums for their pensions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely correct--those changes will increase the burden on small businesses. There is no reason to do so further by the application of a uniform national minimum wage that does not take into account their ability to pay. In their former roles as Opposition Members, Ministers often spoke in other contexts about the ability to pay. That factor is relevant here.
<P>
The Federation of Small Businesses has submitted to the Low Pay Commission an extremely cogent, well-argued paper of which Ministers should take account. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The minimum wage level suggested must take account of small businesses and the impact it would have on unskilled occupations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have not done so.
<P>
The United States has been prayed in aid, but the Minister of State who spoke in the previous sitting, did not refer to the exemption from the national minimum wage in the United States for firms that do not make sales or trade in turnover to the tune of $500,000. If the American example is so good, why will not the Minister at least allow the Low Pay Commission to consider the application of that exemption in the United Kingdom?
<P>
I conclude with the evidence of a constituent--we all like to quote our constituents--in support of the amendments on regional variations and exemptions or variations for small businesses. My constitutent worked in a large, private sector company for more than 40 years and has written to me to express his
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``grave concern at the damaging effect the minimum wage will have on the economic growth and particularly on the creation of new jobs at the lowest skills level.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This concern is based upon over 40 years' experience with a large national company operating in several employment sectors in all parts of the country. In order to compete''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I invite the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown), in particular, to pay attention to this point--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in each sector and location it was necessary to have wage levels which reflected the different conditions in both the cost of living and the local labour markets.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He goes on to say that it is his contention that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the area of low skill jobs there will be fallout and less new jobs created as a result of this legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He says that different economic conditions in different locations, business types and sectors should be taken into account, but to date, regrettably, it appears that they have not been.
<P>
The hon. Member for Dumfries, with breath-taking naivety, put to me the other day the notion that one should pay the same wage for a given job, regardless of the part of the country in which the work was undertaken. He is not operating on this planet if he believes that that should be the case or that it is the case at present. Of course companies take account of different circumstances, different purchasing power, different prices and different costs of housing and transport in different parts of the country.
<P>
The hon. Member for Amber Valley who, as I said before she came into the Committe this morning, made an extremely stimulating speech on Tuesday evening, attended to our argument in greater detail than did the hon. Member for Dumfries. Nevertheless, she managed to slip into her speech a reference to the fact that there was not that huge a difference between different parts of the country. The hon. Lady is right. However, the difference does not have to be huge for it to have a relevance to the chance of a job being kept or created. It is precisely at the margin that those factors are relevant. Of course labour costs are only one factor in production, but they are an important factor.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) eloquently illustrated in an earlier sitting, labour costs are particularly important in labour-intensive small businesses. Unfortunately, the Under-Secretary cannot get away with claiming that her brief and dismissive reference to there being no huge differences justifies the Government maintaining their dogmatic ideological stance. That argument has been put forward and the position is understood. To date, Ministers and Labour Back Benchers have disagreed.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Without doubt, the Under-Secretary is one of the most reasonable Ministers in the House. She is unfailingly courteous in debate, and she has a well-earned reputation for trying to respond, and for responding, to Opposition Members' points. I ask the hon. Lady simply to consider the possibility that the Government may be wrong, whether the Low Pay Commission could be invited to consider the Opposition's alternative proposals, and whether, sooner or later--before the passage of the Bill through Committee--Ministers could inform hon. Members of their opinion on implications for jobs and on differentials in the national minimum wage. I rest my case, and I invite the Committee to support the amendments. I look forward to the hon. Lady's reply.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): I shall speak to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, with particular regard to regional variation. I do not wish to revisit ground that the Committee has covered at some length. The debate has revealed key issues that must be addressed in our consideration of the national minimum wage.
<P>
The first whether significant regional variation in wages exists. The Committee has examined that question at some length. It can be said with all integrity that figures from the new earnings survey, from Government Departments and from the Trades Union Congress show that the north-east and the south-west have proportionally more low-paid workers than south-east England.
<P>
Secondly, what disproportionate impact would a national minimum wage throughout Britain have on regional employment costs and on regional economies? Economic analysis shows that, for small firms with fewer than 10 employees, the national minimum wage could increase employment costs by as much as 14 per cent. in the south-west, in contrast to 7 per cent. in the south-east. That variation is important.
<P>
Thirdly, the Committee has considered at length the whole thrust of the national minimum wage. The policy seeks to establish fairness and social justice and to lift people who earn low wages out of poverty and off benefits. I endorse those aims. I share the anxieties that Government Back Benchers have expressed about the need to end exploitation through low wages, and to end exploitation of taxpayers who currently support cowboy firms that pay poverty wages, which are topped up by benefits that are also paid for by taxpayers.
<P>
Hon. Members must recognise that a rigidly imposed national minimum wage, at a rate that will help the low-waged across the country, will pose a serious threat to small businesses in less prosperous regions. That is not to say that I subscribe to the purist economic theory that states that any rise in wage rates automatically leads to rises in unemployment. A wealth of empirical evidence shows that the introduction of a floor under low wages--a minimum wage--would not have such effects.
<P>
The evidence shows that increases in minimum wages can filter back into local economies, as local spending power increases at the margins. That would increase employment opportunities. The salient factor is that those local effects are heavily dependent on the level at which the minimum rate is set.
<P>
That is the real dilemma, not just for the Committee, but for the Low Pay Commission and, in due course, for Parliament.
<P>
There is wide variation in the proportion of people who earn low wages in different regions of Britain, and wide variation in the prosperity of those regions. Given that fact, how can a national minimum wage rate be set to achieve what appear to be the mutually exclusive objectives of removing social injustice while at the same time protecting small firms and employees from the consequences fo business failure?
<P>
In this invidious position, the responsible action should be to proceed with care and caution. The uncertainties must be investigated, examined and tested, and the body best placed to undertake such tasks in the Low Pay Commission. Therefore, I urge the Minister to widen the commission's remit, permit it to examine the impact, or otherwise, of regional variations on the national minimum wage, and allow the Bill to proceed with some degree of reassurance and certainty. I urge the Minister to consider the amendments seriously.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> We have had a good and wide-ranging debate which has covered a number of important issues. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have raised important points and I shall attempt to respond to them.
<P>
First, however, I should like to mention Government amendments Nos. 32, 33 nd 57. They deal with the fine detail of the Bill and are designed to ensure internal consistency of drafting. Amendment No. 57 to schedule 2 is purely technical and brings the amendment to the Agricultural Wages (Scotland) Act 1949 into line with those for the Agricultural Wages Act 1948 in England and the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977.
<P>
I shall begin by making some general remarks about the group of amendments before us. I appreciate that the debate has wandered far and wide but that has been with the indulgence of both you, Mr. Atkinson, and Mrs. Dunwoody, because we are dealing with a number of key issues that were raised on Second Reading. I believe that the Opposition's amendments conflict with the purpose of the Bill which is, as I remind the Committee, to provide a single national rate of the minimum wage. The amendments open up the possibility of a whole range of different rates. A national minimum wage would not be possible if that were the case. The exception is amendment No. 81, which would add to the limitations listed in clause 2(7). I will deal with that later in my remarks.
<P>
I should, for the sake of accuracy, point out that the majority of the amendments refer to clause 2, which deals with how to calculate the rate at which a worker is paid for the purposes of determining if that is at least the minimum rate. We have had a number of comments supporting the amendments, but those have been largely on the basis of varying the rate. Both you and Mrs. Dunwoody have been indulgent on this point, Mr. Atkinson, and I shall endeavour to deal with the amendments when the time comes.
<P>
The Government explained on Second Reading, and in background documents such as the regulatory appraisal, why a single national rate is the only sensible solution. It is simple and straightforward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond (Runnymede and Weybridge):</B> In view of what the Minister has said about the importance of a single national rate, would she like to see the Government, as an employer, paying a single rate for the same job across the country? We saw plenty of evidence during Tuesday's debate that that is not the case.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I was going to deal with that later, but let me do so now. There has been a great deal of misunderstanding on this point. We are talking about a floor below which wages must not fall. We are not setting exact amounts or talking of exact high amounts to be paid by the Government or any other body. We are talking about a minimum amount.
<P>
The same point was made by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey). He was diligent in asking parliamentary questions about pay rates in Government Departments. I admire his hard work. I became a Member of Parliament in 1992 and spent much of my parliamentary life asking questions of Ministers. I am now a sinner who has repented of her ways and who regrets all the ministerial time that my questions consumed.
<P>
I answer all parliamentary questions as fully and honestly as I can, but the hon. Member for Eastleigh raised the same point as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). Of course different scales and rates of pay will be available, but the important fact is that the national minimum rate will be the level below which pay does not fall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Many of the answers that I received showed that the lowest rates of pay in Government Departments outside London were far below any expectation of what the rate for the national minimum wage might be.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman tempts me but he knows that the Low Pay Commission is considering all the relevant information. I am sure that he does not want to get me into any trouble with my parliamentary colleagues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alasdair Morgan (Galloway and Upper Nithsdale):</B> Does the Minister agree that the Government's case would be stronger if they had not provided for a separate rate for people under the age of 26?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The Bill puts in place the proper enabling legislation that will allow us to take into consideration the comments that the Low Pay Commission will make. We had a very good debate on these matters last week, and we are keen that the commission takes them into consideration.
<P>
The Trades Union Congress and the CBI agreed with us about regional differences in pay rates. In its evidence to the commission, the CBI stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The CBI understands the attractions of a single national rate in terms of simplicity and practicality.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
CBI members believe that a simple, well-publicised national minimum rate will make enforcement much less problematic. That shows the CBI's practicality in realising the effect on employers of variations in the minimum rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I will, but first let me say that the hon. Gentleman seemed a little hard on the CBI and on the Institute of Directors. I am sure that he knows that the CBI has an enterprise council covering small and medium employers, and I would not write off that organisation. Also, I visited the IOD yesterday: its members might be rather offended that the hon. Gentleman did not mention the close attention that they pay to small and medium companies, given that so many of them are involved in just those enterprises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister need not worry, as her enthusiasm for the IOD will never equal mine. However, does she agree that, in contrast to the views of the IOD and, possibly, of the CBI, more than 70 per cent. of those who responded to the survey conducted by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce believed that there should be regional variations in the national minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</b> Clearly, there are different views about that question. However, small business organisations want the rate to be sensible and reasonable and to reflect the country's economic position. I shall deal with that when I discuss that important sector.<P>
<P>
The Government want people to know the minimum rate to which they are entitled. Enforcement must be effective, so there has to be a national rate. That is what the Bill is designed to achieve, and clause 1 establishes the single hourly rate as the Bill's cornerstone. It reinforces the underlying principles of universality, clarity and simplicity. If we adopted the amendments, we would end up without the national minimum wage for which the electorate voted. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) asked why we did not let the Low Pay Commission make the decision. I remind him that the Labour party went to the electorate with a manifesto commitment to a national minimum wage, and I know that he would not want to disagree with the voice of the electorate.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Not only do we believe that regional variations to the national minimum wage are wrong in principle, they would not work in practice. The system would become bureaucratic, unwieldy and, I would argue, open to abuse.
<P>
Opposition Members argue for regional variations, but they do not argue for a similar variation in benefits, which are paid nationally. It is clear that housing benefit and council tax benefits are not regionally based--they are based on rents and the council tax charge respectively.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> In the absence of either an exemption for small businesses or a variation in the rate of the minimum wage, what is the Minister's estimate of the number of jobs that are likely to be lost?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Again, I am anxious to come to small businesses because it is, as the hon. Gentleman will know, a subject dear to my heart. If he can curb his impatience, I will be dealing with that issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister is trying to think up a number of job losses.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, not at all. I was trying to think of a polite way of saying that the hon. Gentleman's intervention was spurious. We are committed to setting a sensible rate that the country can afford, so the hon. Gentleman's question is irrelevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister said that social security benefits were not varied on a regional basis, but does she accept that housing benefit, which is a large and growing component of the social security budget, is in effect varied on a regional basis because of the way in which it is set to cover rents in local markets?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, that is not the case. There is no regional element.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> De facto.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that there is a de facto regional element, but that is not the case. Housing benefit is set nationally, but of course it takes account of local rents. I am a London Member of Parliament and, like all other London Members, I deal with housing benefit cases. Just in my constituency, I see a tremendous variation in rents. The Opposition's argument needs to be thought out in greater detail.
<P>
The regulatory appraisal that we published shows that regional rates would mean that people doing the same job, possibly for the same firm, but working a few miles apart could be subject to different minimum rates. That would be a bureaucratic nightmare for employers, particularly for some of the small employers whom Conservative Members claim to support.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton) made a passionate speech about her area of Cornwall in our previous sitting. She said that regional variation of the rate would entrench poverty in that area. She is ambitious for her constituency and for her region: so are the Government. I have visited my hon. Friend's area several times, and I, too, want to see it grow and prosper. I thought that she made a convincing argument for that.
<P>
Moreover, regional rates would mean having to identify regional boundaries. As I said, we would also have to cope with employees who work in more than one region and the need to fix regional rates of in-work benefits. The practical problems with workers who cross regional boundaries would dwarf the difficulties with Scottish children working in England, which so exercised the Opposition on Tuesday. I understand the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)--he was right to express them--and hope that we managed, at least in part, to quell his anxieties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Referring to the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, the Minister talked about the attack on poverty. Is she aware that figures in research conducted by the Rowntree Foundation suggest that less than 3 per cent. of non-pensioner households in poverty will be assisted by the national minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That is a selective quotation. I could provide many others to the contrary.
<P>
The other difficulty is that regions are not by themselves a good basis for fixing pay rates, because there will often be pockets of low or relatively low pay. The hon. Member for Buckingham talked about London and made kind remarks about me, which will cause me immense political difficulty. I am sure that he did not mean anything of the kind. I have been searching for something nice to say about him to live up to his opinion of me. I have found it difficult, but, although he does not represent a London seat he is a fellow Londoner; indeed--this weighs much more in his favour--he is a fellow north Londoner. The number of low-paid workers in London is similar to that in other regions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I anticipate the Minister's argument, which we have already heard from Labour Members. Does she concede that, while numbers are similar, the proportion of people employed in greater London compared to certain regions is significantly different?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I do not accept that. The same number of low-paid people will be helped by a national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am almost tempted to be severe to re-establish the Minister's political reputation, but it is not in my nature.
<P>
Is not it slightly disingenuous to compare the number of people on low wages in London and elsewhere? I made the point in my opening remarks that we should be concerned about the effect of the proportion of people in low-paid work on the buoyancy of regional economies.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand, but the point is not disingenuous. We are talking about the effect on individuals. Let us consider the number of vacancies in, for example, the hospitality industry in London. Some employers pay very low wages, so a national minimum wage would be beneficial. I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
About 87,000 workers in London earn less than &#163;2.50 per hour, the same as in the south-west and east midlands. In fact, London and the south-east has more low-paid workers than any other region. In terms of fairness and equality, it is difficult for politicians to justify that differential. We should consider that matter carefully.
<P>
There has been discussion about the difference in sectoral rates. They would be complex, as the old wages council system proved. We want to have one single figure, which everyone in the country is aware of, rather than a multitude of rates reflecting special pleading by various groups. That is important.
<P>
There was discussion about various industries, including the textiles industry, and the effect that the minimum wage might have on imports. I found a second point on which I agree with the hon. Member for Buckingham, namely that my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley made a stimulating speech. Her speech was excellent and if she were still the chairman of my constituency party, I would say that it was the best speech that I had ever heard in any Committee on which I have served. To paraphrase Disraeli, when dealing with royalty--he was referring to Queen Victoria--or chairmen of constituency Labour parties or Conservative or Liberal Democrat associations, lay flattery on with a trowel.
<P>
In referring to the way forward in the textiles industry my hon. Friend made a pertinent point because companies in that sector have survived by investing in modern technology. They compete not by seeing who can pay the lowest, poverty wages--this country can never compete on that basis--but by ensuring that they use the skills base of our people. My hon. Friend made her points very well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> At this point it might be useful to know, from the Minister's knowledge of the textiles industry--
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): And Disraeli.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> And Disraeli. I am sure that the Committee will agree that it is true that low pay is not the method by which the textiles industry will respond to growing competition. None the less, does the Minister agree that to maintain lower costs the industry has reoriented its geographical focus towards areas where lower pay persists? Has the Minister seen any evidence of that which has been submitted to the Low Pay Commission? Will she reflect on the fact that companies that have many plants across the country often operate different pay rates according to the plants' location?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Let me first welcome the hon. Gentleman's reasonable point about the way forward for the textiles industry which, as he rightly said, is not about poverty wages or low pay, but about high skills. I appreciate his point. I have spoken to employers in that industry and found that the companies that are succeeding are those that are looking to increase productivity and investing in high technology. I visited a company a few months ago which is competing with companies in the rest of the world on the basis of the quality of its product and the skills base of its employees. That company is paying high wages because its investment in high technology has enabled it to increase its productivity and it needs to attract highly skilled workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> Will the Minister reflect on the fact that her last few remarks make our case extremely eloquently? The way in which the market operates, even in industries such as textiles, which are traditionally low-paying, means that the fact that British companies are now competing in a global market is driving up wages. The last thing that industries such as textiles need is an artificial constraint such as a national minimum wage. The market is already doing what Members on both sides of the Committee want--allowing British workers in competitive industries to be paid higher wages.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The argument is too simplistic. If we consider what happens in some of those industries, we find that there are several different factors. Of course the hon. Gentleman is right to say that those industries increasingly want skilled, highly-qualified people. In all sorts of industries, many traditional jobs are now governed by computer-aided design systems, and firms need skilful people to operate them. Clearly, the market operates to push wages up in those cases. At the same time, if we are to have a framework that aids competition, we need a floor below which wages should not fall. There is no reason why those aims should be contradictory; in fact, they operate side by side.
<P>
Before the interesting intervention of the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green), I said that I wanted to deal with small firms--a subject that is dear to my heart. I should say right at the start that I am sorry that Opposition Members do not share the Government's ambition for that sector, about which they have spoken in terms of difficulty. I, however, look on our small and medium enterprises with great ambition and hope--they are the engine that drives the economy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford said that while Ministers may be committed to the small firms sector, Labour Back Benchers were not. Nothing could be further from the truth. Labour Back Benchers write to me regularly in such numbers about small firms issues in their constituencies that I wish that they were not so interested in them. They know--as does every Member of the House--that, that if small and medium firms were not working in our constituencies, we would be unable to enhance them and to compete with the best in the world.
<P>
I should not be surprised by the fact that the Opposition take the view that they do. They have already admitted that they do not really understand small firms. On 30 November 1997, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), who speaks for the Opposition on small firms, was quoted in an article in the Sunday Times under the headline,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Tory apologises to small firms''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The article said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Cheryl Gillan, shadow small firms minister, has attacked her own party for losing the small-business vote at the general election. In an extraordinarily candid interview with the Federation of Small Businesses she admitted the Tory government got its small business strategy wrong.''<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>

She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There will be little policy coming from the Conservative party in these initial stages . . . as is understandable because we got it wrong''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To defend my colleague in her absence, I should ask the Minister whether she thinks that it is good practice to learn from setbacks? Will the Bill that she prescribes, which provides for no variation or afterthought, preclude such revision if the Government get it wrong? Does she think that everything that appears in the Sunday Times is a full and accurate report of events? If so, some of us may have to draw some of its remarks to the attention of the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other of the Minister's colleagues.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises the important point about exemptions, with which I shall deal later. He is courteous and gallant, and I predicted to myself that he would come to the defence of the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham. As they say in those wonderful cooking programmes, to which I am addicted, here is something I prepared earlier. I have the interview with the federation's magazine, which is headlined
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``OK, we got it wrong.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister has made a strong defence of the principle of universality. Throughout the debate, Labour Members have set their faces like flint, as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham would say, against any breaching of that principle. Will the Minister assure us that having made that case, the Government will not come back to the Committee later with amendments that would exclude groups by virtue of the class of their employment, for example, the armed forces?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will know if he reads the Bill, clause 34 caters for the armed forces.
<P>
The story of small firms gets even more interesting. You will remember, Mr. Atkinson, as will many hon. Members, Sir Robert McCrindle, who was a distinguished Member of Parliament from 1970 to 1992. He is now the distinguished City correspondent of The House Magazine. He wrote in that magazine in December:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The sector of businesses the Tories used to call their own has been absorbed into Labour's business friendly approach. Little wonder the Conservatives spokeswoman on small firms has admitted that in office the party got it wrong''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The hon. Lady is rehearsing history. She may recall that for a couple of years under the previous Government, I was the representative of one of the small firms organisations which made points to that Government. It is undeniable that too many small businesses were unhappy with the previous Conservative Government during the recession of 1992, 1993 and 1994.
<P>
More relevantly, as this relates to the Bill, does the Minister accept that the business community, including the small business community, will begin to revise their opinion of the Government and the Conservative party when they see the arguments that are being made in this Committee about the way the Bill will impact on the small business sector?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I do not agree. I pray in aid of my reply the recent Office World quarterly small business survey, which was produced in association with the small business research centre at Kingston university in December. It is an interesting and bulky survey, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will know. He has much experience with small firms and made an honest admission about the previous Government's rather sad record on small firms. He will know the work that has been done by Kingston small business research centre on voting intentions. The survey states that it is the Labour party that now has most of the small business vote and has the confidence of the small business community, leading both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister is filibustering her own Bill with remarkable eloquence. Clause 34 suggests that the national minimum wage will apply to the armed forces, but Ministry of Defence officials and probably supporters of the Secretary of State for Defence are briefing journalists that it will not. Which interpretation is correct?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman has such--[Hon. Members: ``Answer.''] Conservative Members are such eager little beavers that they cannot wait until the end of my reply. They need to calm down.
<P>
I do not know why the hon. Member for Buckingham has such great faith in what journalists write. He should read clause 34, which we shall discuss in due course.
<P>
It is clear that what Conservative Members say about the needs of the small firms sector is somewhat open to doubt, given the record of the previous Conservative Government and the present opinions of people in that sector. The Government's principle is to protect every worker from exploitation through low pay. People who work for small firms are entitled to the same protection as people who work for large companies.
<P>
Of course we recognise the importance of small firms to the economy. The Department, of which I am proud to be a member, is responsible for small business support. Indeed, last November we enhanced the structure of the support for business links in that vital sector. We have specifically asked the Low Pay Commission to have regard to the possible impact of the minimum wage on small firms when recommending a rate.
<P>
I spend much of my time travelling around the country talking to small businesses. We know that they want to operate in a competitive climate. Many are sick and tired of being undercut by low-paying employers in certain sectors, who thereby make those sectors uncompetitive. Not only employers suffer as a result: consumers supplied with inferior goods and services and the skills base of the industries involved suffer too.
<P>
The Office World quarterly small business survey stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The belief that small business owners are against a minimum wage is clearly not supported.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Of course I give way to the hon. Gentleman for whom, having been a Whip myself, I have great fellow feeling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I take delight in rising to intervene on the Minister, who is quite the most talented of the Ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry. [Hon. Members: ``Ah.''] I wish to make it clear that that was intended as a compliment, even though all the other Ministers are a shambles. [Laughter.]
<P>
Will the Minister say how she defines a small business?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That is a good question. I thank him for his compliment, even though it is not true. However, I am the shortest of the Department's Ministers, and my only complaint about my hon. Friend the Minister of State is that he shamelessly seeks to grab a title that rightly belongs to me--I am the small business Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> What is the answer to my question?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall be honest: I am always slightly reluctant to give that definition, especially to other Minsters in my Department, as I always want to make my empire as large as possible. The hon. Gentleman is a former Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, so he will know that the matter is a little difficult. A number of definitions of what is a small business exist. There is one in the Companies Act 1989, but the European Commission uses a different definition. Definitions of what constitute micro-businesses have been made, often according to the numbers of employees on the payroll.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman would probably agree that it is becoming increasingly difficult to arrive at a definition. The new creative, high-tech companies, for example, have comparatively few people, especially in the early stages, but their turnover, even in the first three years may be &#163;3 million, &#163;4 million or &#163;5 million. It is a difficult question to answer and, as the hon. Gentleman knows, it is defined differently in different pieces of legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> In my borough of Solihull, the structure of business is such that the number of businesses employing between one and four people is 52.9 per cent. and the number employing between five and 10 people is 19.4 per cent. Allowing for the fact that in Solihull, businesses employing between one and 10 people constitute virtually three quarters of the economy, I have long held the view--admirer as I may be of the Department of Trade and Industry--that it cannot get its sights as low as that. I invite the hon. Lady to agree with me that three quarters of the economy is invisible to the DTI.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman raised that point. I do not dispute his figures. However, he is talking about the DTI's operation under the previous Government, when it did get it wrong. It set up the business links network based on an idea in our 1992 mainfesto. I do not criticise the Government for that. I am a dreadful plagiarist myself, do I appreciate other people having the good sense to do the same when it comes to good ideas.
<P>
The great mistake that the Government made, which the hon. Member for Solihull--who was a Minister at the DTI himself--will know, was to attempt to exclude firms with less than 10 employees from using those business links. The document that I published in October on enhancing business links says that any business, whatever its size, can use the business links. I know that that has been warmly welcomed.
<P>
I was quoting the Office World survey which showed that more than 70 per cent. of managers expected the minimum wage to help their business or to have no effect. On the practical difficulties, there is the fact that differentiation according to size of business could potentially distort the structure of competition. It might well lead to the fragmentation of businesses into smaller units simply to avoid paying the national minimum wage. That danger was recognised at our first sitting by the hon. Member for Ashford who talked of employers attempting to find ways to circumvent the regulations by considering becoming partnerships or sole traders.
<P>
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare mentioned the Low Pay Commission and its experience on small business. One member of the Low Pay Commission comes from an organisation representing small firms, and all the commission's members have a wide range of experience and expertise, including an understanding of this sector. The small business sector features strongly in the commission's wide-ranging consultation exercise.
<P>
Mention has been made of the Federation of Small Businesses and the Forum of Private Business. All such organisations, including the chambers of commerce, the confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors do excellent work in this area. At the 1997 annual conference of the Federation of Small Businesses, a majority of 57 per cent. of members voted in favour of a minimum wage ``sensibly negotiated'' as opposed to 43 per cent. who voted against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Is it in order for one of the Minister's colleagues to be reading a magazine while the hon. Lady is making her most stimulating speech?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. As it is a magazine from which I quoted a left-wing academic with approval on Tuesday, I have some sympathy for the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) in his perusal of that excellent document.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The rules are clear: to read newspapers, books or magazines in Committee is frowned on--if the Chairman sees it. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Before I deal with two other points, I shall give way for the last time, for one point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Minister mentioned that the Low Pay Commission has consulted widely with small firms. Has the Minister received any feedback from the Low Pay Commission about what number and proportion of those small firms raised the issue of regional variation?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That is a matter for the Low Pay Commission. As far as I am aware, that issue has not featured heavily in the consultation. The Government will wait for the report. It would be wrong to comment in detail about findings in the commission's preliminary work.
<P>
I shall deal briefly with two other points. The debate has been good, and I am anxious to respond to points made about various sectors. Questions were asked about low pay in sectors such as hospitality and catering. I remind the Committee that, according to British Hospitality Association surveys, 65 per cent. of employers thought that a minimum wage should be introduced. A survey of top and middle managers in the catering industry, carried out by Mayday Staff Services Ltd., found that a majority of respondents support the principle of a minimum wage.
<P>
Employers are responding, not only because they--hopefully--think that a minimum wage is socially just, but because, as forthright and practical business people, they know that it will aid their industry's competitiveness.
<P>
During the debate, much has been made of the United States, which has been used as a model. The hon. Member for Buckingham raised the issue of exemption in the United States. It is interesting that opposition Members are now so in favour of exemptions for small firms. During the passage of the Bill that became the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, under the previous Government, Labour members tabled an amendment that sought an exemption concerning the recording of employers' checks, to apply to small employers with fewer than 10 employees. The amendment was moved on the Floor of the House, and the previous Government voted against it. I should imagine that the hon. Members for Daventry and for Solihull voted against it, as they were Ministers at the time. They ought, perhaps, to reflect in detail on the fact that they cannot have their cake and eat it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The hon. Lady will recall those matters better than I can, because I was not a Member of Parliament at the time. Surely, however, the example cuts both ways. If Ministers do not now support an exemption, but at that time argued that it was desirable and practical, why does the Minister not follow through her logic, and why is she opposing that of the Opposition?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> We did not support the view now being discussed--the Committee is talking about a national rate. I used the example to show that the Opposition's claim to be the friend of small firms is fatally flawed. As a Government, they had the opportunity to exempt small firms from requirements that the sector overwhelmingly said that it did not want, and they did not use it and carry the proposal through.
<P>
In relation to small firms, great play has been made of America, and of its exemption that applies to businesses with an annual turnover of less than $500,000. The hon. Member for Buckingham mentioned that. He did not mention--I am sure that it was a slip of memory--another aspect of that example. The exemption applies only in cases that do not involve interstate commerce. The definition of interstate commerce includes the production of goods for such commerce, and includes specifications such as transportation and communications. It covers cases in which employees regularly use the mail or telephone for interstate communication. In practice, the definition of interstate commerce used in the United States is so broad that few firms, even small ones, could claim that they were not to some degree involved in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I must make progress.
<P>
In the United States, therefore, exemption is rare.
<P>
Amendment No. 81, which is in the names of the hon. Members for Eastleigh and for Weston-super-Mare, is, as I said earlier, different from the other amendments in this group in that it would add new limitations rather than remove existing ones. The amendment does not make sense in the context of clause 2. I fear also that the proposed wording for clause 3 has been suggested without sufficient thought.
<P>
Clause 2 will give the Secretary of State flexibility to make regulations reflecting the many, varied types of pay and working arrangements. By forbidding differentiation on the grounds of different hours or patterns of work, the amendment would destroy that flexibility. It would rule out, for example, treating home workers' hours differently from those worked by people with other work patterns. Conservative Members have tried to introduce exactly the same effect through amendment No. 75. The amendments arise from a misunderstanding of clause 2.
<P>
I understand the concern of the hon. Member for Eastleigh about part-time workers and I can reassure him on that point. The national minimum wage will be an hourly rate and will apply to all workers regardless of how many or how few hours they work. No amendments are necessary to ensure that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I am about to conclude my remarks. I hope that I have shown that the single rate is a fundamental requirement of the Bill and that regional, sectoral and occupational variations and variations by size of business and nature of work are unfair, complicated and unworkable.
<P>
I urge the Committee to support the Government amendments and reject all the others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> No, it will not do and we will want to press the amendment to a vote. In view of the Minister's assurances about her technical amendments, even if there is a degree of formal inconsistency, we shall not seek to divide the Committee by opposing them.
<P>
This has been an extraordinarily interesting and full debate, ranging over core issues in the Bill. That is why it has been considerably long and the Minister has, in spirit, responded at length. I shall be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend when he has not really begun. Does he agree that, notwithstanding the Minister's relatively full reply to the debate, it was disappointing that she did not consider specific instances such as the relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom or specific occupations such as clergy, who work long hours for relatively low pay? Those are specific, albeit rare, examples--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be short.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. I have made my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend has indeed made his point, and with the degree of ingenuity and persistence that characterise him, it will be possible to make that point in forthcoming discussions.
<P>
I will compress my remarks in the interests of the Committee. I hope that the Minister will forgive me for saying that her speech was sound, entirely predictable and straight out of central casting. She introduced no new arguments but she did at least attempt to set out the Government's position.
<P>
I also commend--if it is not invidious to do so--the speech made by the hon. Member for Amber Valley in an earlier sitting. She made some interesting points based on her own experience and mentioned flexibility. There will be piece-work issues to talk about which may trouble us. In light of her wish and the express wish of the President of the Board of Trade for overall flexibility, I should say that the way in which the clause will constrain matters is a poor contribution to the advancement of flexibility.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want briefly to comment on one or two of the Minister's remarks. She had a jocular exchange with the Minister of State about their height. It would be possible to discriminate on the basis of height in the Bill--I notice that the Minister of State is now taking a closer interest in our amendments. The Opposition do not intend to do that and nor, I imagine, does anyone else. The point about height discrimination is that it depends on the case. It makes no difference to the discharge of his duties whether a Minister is 5ft. 6in. tall--or the metric equivalent--or whether he is 6ft. tall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The one occasion on which the issue might arise is basketball. Outside that, however, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that there is no case for discrimination on the grounds of size.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is interesting that the Minister makes exactly the point that I was going to make, although I was not going to use the example of basketball, but that of Guards. The Minister may be offended by that. There is a distinction between a height test for recruitment to the brigade of Guards--for which I can understand the justification--and an ethnic test. That is the subject of a later amendment, so I shall not dilate on it. There would, however, be no justification for ethnic discrimination. So circumstances alter cases. Ministers can be perfectly good Ministers when they are short. I was about to say to both Ministers that the ability of Ministers in their Department is in broadly inverse correlation to their height--I add the word ``broadly'' to avoid invidiousness. However, we would not seek to embody such a criterion in the Bill, although it would be right to consider whether we should.
<P>
When discussing differences, the Minister mentioned housing benefit. She said that the essential point about housing benefit was that it takes account of differences in cost. The Opposition's objection to the way in which the Government have structured the Bill is that they prescribe the wage element, but are silent on all the other elements that make up the remuneration package and which contribute to quality of life and the ability to do things. Those elements might include mortgage costs, housing benefit or costs of living in the region concerned.
<P>
The Minister also spoke at length about small firms, and I concede that her interest is genuine. I did not like her somewhat arch reference to the quotation by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham. It is a sign of strength, not of weakness to admit that certain things were not perfect under the previous Government. It is also a sign of flexibility and not of narrow-mindedness. Reflecting on what the Minister said, however, I am sure that she will be prepared to return to the House in a few years when we know what the national minimum wage rate is--that has been vouchsafed to us--and if it turns out to cause significant difficulties or unemployment among small firms and, accidentally and in a way that the Minister did not intend, to have a down side for them.

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> While my hon. Friend is on the subject of small businesses, does he agree with me--as someone who has had the privilege of employing every number of persons between one and 11 over a long period and on an ascending scale--that what small businesses think of Governments of all persuasions is, ``Sod off''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My only answer to that is that, in the interests of parliamentary propriety, I could not possibly comment. It would, however, be fair to say that, taking one thing with another and seasonally adjusting, Ministers and the small firms sector would differ in their interpretations of the quality of Government policies for the time being.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Far be it from me, Mr. Atkinson, to breach parliamentary courtesy, but I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull was suggesting something along the lines of Walter Lippmann, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In a free society, the state does not administer the affairs of men; it administers justice among men''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and he ought to have said ``and women''--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who conduct their own affairs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is another consideration, but I shall hasten on.
<P>
The debate has made it clear that there are different cases in different places. There will be different pay rates: different sizes of business will have different labour and cost profiles, so the imposition of a single rate will have differential consequences. There are differences in the types of employment, in their organisation and in the way that payments are made. The whole complex of variables is called the market economy and it is driven by the decisions that people make.
<P>
It is not unprecedented for Governments to intervene in the market economy, but the question is how they do it and whether the sort of distinctions that we discussed in connection with heightism are appropriate. Strangely enough, it is the inflexibility of the Government's approach with which we take issue.
<P>
It is extraordinary that the Bill gives the lie to the hard front of a single national minimum wage rate that the Government have put forward. The mirror is crack'd: it cannot be put back together. The Government say that they want one rate, but clause 3 provides for the possibility of a separate rate for young people. As my hon. Friends have noted, there are equivocations later on in the Bill offering the potential for savings in the armed forces. That depends on the outcome of the row going in Whitehall, and there are also problems to do with share fishermen and others.
<P>
The Government present no absolute, monolithic front. They do not contest the principle advocated in the amendments that provision may have to be made for special cases. I am worried about the static nature of the debate. The available figures describe the present situation, and we can speculate about the information going to the Low Pay Commission and about how that is being dealt with. However, no one knows what will happen in the future, when circumstances could be very different.
<P>
For example, the adoption of the euro, the European single currency, would widen the context into which the national minimum wage would be introduced. It would also sharpen the distinction betwen pay rates in Britain and in Italy, say, or Greece, or Germany. A different set of considerations about competitiveness would apply.
<P>
The Bill makes it impossible to reopen any element of the debate, even if there were to be regional consequences. That is one of the most striking differences between the two sides of the Committee. There is interesting evidence to suggest that the regional impact would be significant, but the Bill does not permit Ministers to reconsider the matter.
<P>
The Government's approach is foolish in the short term and even more so if economic developments expose difficulties in the operation of the proposals. If enacted without amendment, the legislation could not be amended without much recrimination and further primary legislation.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not mind if I say that I see her as Goldilocks--she can cast either herself or Porfessor Bain in the role. She is trying to produce a golden scenario in which the bed is not too big and not too small, but just right. She wants the porridge to be not too salty and not too sweet, not too hot and not too cold, but just right. The economy is so complex that she cannot get the proposals just right. If the Government will not provide themselves with the opportunity for variation and flexibility beyond the limited flexibility that they prescribe for young people--if they will not consider the possibility of other such cases--there is the potential for problems.
<P>
I have one other analogy. The Government have been trying to find a fairy-tale solution but they will remember that, in ancient mythology, there is another, less pleasant story. The Greek robber Procrustes got hold of his victims and--I apologise to both Ministers--assessed them on the basis of their height in a rather unpleasant way. He put them on a bed, not for any malicious purpose but to decide on their length as against the bed's length. If they were too short, he put them on the rack to lengthen them, and if they were too long, he cut their legs to fit. Of course, he achieved a universal solution--everybody ended up the same length--but it was not a happy outcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am not speaking from the vantage point of personal self-interest, but has my hon. Friend read the excellent tome by Professor Antony Flew on that very subject? The book is called ``The Politics of Procrustes'' and describes in detail, across a range of policy areas, the socialist attempt to apply equal treatment to unequal things.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is an extraordinarily perceptive intervention. The short answer to my hon. Friend is no, I have not read that book. However, I am aware of a student who is reputed to have excused himself from a lecture at Keele, where Professor Flew used to lecture, with a short sicknote that read, ``Sorry, in bed with flu!''
<P>
The Government are trying to fit the entire economy into one template, which is a Procrustean bed called the national minimum wage. With one exception of principle, it is to be a universal rate.
<P>
Our amendment makes an amazing offer: it offers the Government the power to set more than one rate. They do not have to do it, but they could consider doing so. The amendment would provide them with greater flexibility. It is not unusual for this Government to assume flexibility and to want to do things even when we do not want to give them the powers but, in this case, we make a free offer.
<P>
The Minister is a well-brought-up lady and has no doubt been taught that she should not take sweets from strange persons, particularly persons of the male sex. However, we have had a long debate and I think that she knows us well enough. We are making a modest offer, which goes to the heart of the Bill. I hope that she will accept our argument and therefore our amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The amendment sets parameters to the national minimum wage rate--figures above which such a rate should not apply.
<P>
For the convenience of the Committee, I shall state two things that the amendment does not suggest and one intended effect. First, it does not indicate that we favour the indexation of the national minimum wage rate. However, if a rate above which the national minimum wage should not apply were not indexed--
<P>
[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am having difficulty hearing the hon. Gentleman because so many conversations are going on. I should be grateful if we listened to what is being said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend has just said that we have no commitment to the indexation of the national minimum wage. For the avoidance of doubt, does he share my view that we do not agree with the national minimum wage at all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The amendment does not show that we agree with the national minimum wage rate, but tests the parameters within which the rate is to be set. We remain opposed to a national minimum wage rate.
<P>
The amendment probes the Government's intentions. It does not state that we favour indexation; quite the opposite--the rate should not be indexed. Many representations, which we can debate later, have been made to the Low Pay Commission on that subject.
<P>
Secondly, the amendment is not intended to second-guess the Low Pay Commission's view on what the national minimum wage rate should be, but to add to the debate on the parameters of the national minimum wage. We have been fond of talking about the architecture of the Bill, but it is the gilding on the national minimum wage rate. The Government have often expressed their intention in previous debates that the national minimum wage should set a floor under wages. The Government believe it perfectly possible to establish such a floor in the Bill. However, they are not telling us whether there is also a ceiling--not for wages as a whole, but on the level which it is right to apply as a national minimum wage on a universal basis. After all, the Government are fond of stressing the universality and national character of a national minimum wage. Do they believe it right to have not only a floor but a ceiling?
<P>
I ask this because it is clear from what Ministers have been saying that they have a concept of what the national minimum wage rate should be. The Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that he has from time to time referred to a ``sensible rate'' in the light of economic circumstances. The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry talked in our previous debate of a sensible level which the country can afford.
<P>
There is a sense that Ministers believe that the national minimum wage rate should be set within certain parameters. When Ministers talk about the national minimum wage rate, they are wont to express it not in terms of a rate above or below which it would not be proper for people to be paid for reasons of equity and fairness, although they refer to that from time to time--their customary approach is to express their broad concept of what the rate should be as sensible in the light of economic circumstances, which drives us straight towards the amendment.
<P>
Is there a way in which, if the amendment were accepted, the Government could under this legislation or subsequent regulations help set further parameters for the work of the Low Pay Commission? Ministers have gone about the process of asking the Low Pay Commission to express a view on a number of matters but to set parameters within limits, limiting the criteria or the variations over which the commission can make recommendations. Likewise, they could say to the Low Pay Commission, ``Recommend a rate which achieves the Government's objectives of equity and fairness but does not damage economic circumstances. We have a responsibility to the economy as a whole and we will set, by prior regulation, a level above which the national minimum wage rate should not be set.''

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting argument. Would he not concede that the Government remit letter to the Low Pay Commission makes no reference to equity or fairness in its prescription? It talks only of the wider economic and social implications and the likely effect on the level of employment and inflation and on competitiveness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That is a very good point. I suspect that I was being generous towards the Government in ascribing a broader interpretation to the terms in which they set out the remit of the Low Pay Commission. It further reinforces the point that I was going on to make.
<P>
The Government do not see it as inappropriate to express clearly to external and independent bodies their view of the national economic circumstances and of what the country can afford. Just as Ministers have made it clear to the Committee in the course of our proceedings that the Government wish to see the national minimum wage rate set in relation to those kind of criteria, they can express that view to the Low Pay Commission. It is perfectly possible, therefore, for the Committee so to amend the Bill that it can, on behalf of Paliament, set a limit in the same way. Ministers who make representation to pay review bodies regarding public sector workers, for example, presumably go through a similar process.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to probe Ministers' intentions and find out whether they understand economic circumstances and whether they have formed or are in the process of forming a view on what the parameters of the national minimum wage rate ought to be and outside which there would be damage to employment and competitiveness and an unacceptable cost to the national economy. Why cannot that view be brought into the context of the Bill so that the Low Pay Commission can be given its instructions directly by Parliament? It is Parliament's task, and that of the Committee, to set the parameters for the national minimum wage.
<P>
Reflecting on the debate on the amendment, which relates specifically to the rate of the national minimum wage, I was struck by the use of surveys made by the Minister for Small Firms. She talked about the number of small businesses that are in favour of the national minimum wage. As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made clear in the debate on the previous amendment, support can vary a great deal according to the rate that is proposed. As he might have said, in his entertaining analogy of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, it depends on how much sugar or salt is in the porridge.
<P>
I am reminded by the House of Commons Library's research paper that last autumn the NatWest Small Business Research Trust Quarterly Survey of Small Businesses found that 49.9 per cent. of small businesses would regard a minimum wage of &#163;4 an hour as a bad idea. One in five said that they would employ fewer people if such a minimum wage were introduced. However, more than half of those firms thought that the rate of &#163;4 an hour was a bad idea supported a minimum wage of &#163;3 an hour. In relation to the amendments, therefore, we can see that &#163;3 to &#163;4 an hour is the range within which the attitude of small businesses varies.
<P>
It will not surprise members of the Committee that small businesses' view of the minimum wage will depend in large measure on the rate at which it is set and in greater measure on whether they pay above or below that rate. If I were the manager of a small business and I paid all my employees more that &#163;3.50 an hour, I would regard as a good thing a minimum wage set at &#163;3.50 an hour because it would remove the threat to competitiveness of other firms offering lower wages. If, however, the minimum wage were set at &#163;4 an hour, I would regard it as a bad thing.
<P>
I say that not to decry the motives or actions of small businesses but merely to reflect the fact that they are rational, act in economic circumstances and relate to markets as they understand and experience them. The irrationality is on the part of Ministers and Labour Members who undertake surveys and aggregate the results, divorce them from reality and present them as a conclusive argument in favour of their legislation.
<P>
The amendment's purpose is to find out what the Government mean when they talk about a sensible rate in the light of economic circumstances or what the country can afford. The figures chosen for that purpose are illustrative; they are not a recommendation by myself or my hon. Friends. It would be unwise for the Bill to state a figure until the Low Pay Commission has received its evidence and the Government have presented it. If an amendment such as this were to be made, the figure would probably be at the upper end of the range--&#163;4 an hour rather than &#163;3--because of the impact of economic circumstances.
<P>
The amendment's purpose is to test out the Government's view on those issues. I do not want to engage in an argument of reductio ad absurdum, but if the Government do not believe that it is right to set parameters for the structure of the minimum wage and the level above which it should not be set, why do they not propose a figure of &#163;5, &#163;6, of &#163;7? There must be a level at which Ministers are confident that a national minimum wage would damage the economy, so do they not have a responsibility to tell the Committee what it is? This is, after all, a probing debate, rather than a definitive one.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The nub of the issue is that Ministers have a responsibility to give their evidence to the Low Pay Commission, to publish that evidence and allow the Committee to understand the context within which Ministers view the introduction of a national minimum wage. What rate do they have in mind? Within what parameters are they working?
<P>
All hon. Ministers will have read the evidence presented to the Low Pay Commission. The implications of rates even as low as &#163;3 are rather disturbing. The CBI has said that, given half restoration of differentials, a national minimum wage of &#163;3 would cost business &#163;2.37 billion and might cause the loss of between 50,000 and 100,000 job losses in two years.
<P>
A rate of &#163;3.40 for the minimum wage would be the average, uprated over time, of the rates formerly specified by the wages councils. Ministers have told the Committee that those councils did not lead to job losses, so they may consider that &#163;3.40 would be a reasonable maximum level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend that it would help the Committee to know whether the Government prefer &#163;3.40. However, if that were so, would not the Labour party's support five years ago for a national wage at that same level have led to substantial job losses? It would show that previous position to have been highly irresponsible if now the Government were to advocate the same level for the national minimum wage, irrespective of the effects of inflation over five years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. We should not allow Ministers off this hook. In opposition, Labour Members were happy to express a view about what the national minimum wage should be. They now behave very differently, and in effect are hiding behind the skirts of the Low Pay Commission. It is about time we saw their ankles, as it were.
<P>
Amendment No. 61 mentions a rate of &#163;3.50. The British Chambers of Commerce stated that 15 per cent. of business would be affected if the national minimum wage were set at that level. The BCC survey of last year suggested that 58 per cent. of firms affected by the national minimum wage rate would decrease their work forces, while 55 per cent. would react by increasing prices. So the majority of firms affected by setting the national minimum wage at &#163;3.50 would respond by cutting jobs and raising prices. Ministers should say whether they would regard as unacceptable the damage to the economy resulting from the imposition of a minimum wage at that level. What will they say in their evidence to the Low Pay Commission on that subject?
<P>
At &#163;4 an hour, 45 per cent. of firms would be affected. At this point, therefore, there would be a large-scale impact on British industry in terms both of prices and of job losses, which would damage our competitiveness. If we went further, I suspect that we would find much larger numbers of businesses affected.
<P>
The extent to which that effect occurs--Ministers should also be tested on their response to this--depends on the extent to which differentials are affected by the imposition of a national minimum wage. I am afraid that the Minister's previous intervention on this subject did not do him credit, as he has the intelligence to know better. We know from evidence that the imposition of a minimum wage at a rate that falls within the existing pay scales of businesses will automatically lead to an impact on differentials. Where firms have to move a young persons rate, a trainee rate or their lower pay scales upwards, there will inevitably be pressure within a company to move up other pay rates as well. The greater the impact of the minimum wage, the more likely the majority of firms are to find such an impact working through their pay scales. Among lower paying businesses, those impacts could be very substantial. There would be virtually a 100 per cent. restoration of differentials in some relatively low-paying companies. When we reach a 50 per cent.-plus or 100 per cent. restoration of differentials with a firm, there will be an adverse impact on that firm's costs, competitiveness and, of course, its subsequent employment and prospects. We must examine carefully what Ministers propose to say to the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
How can we be clear about the effect of the Bill in the absence of Ministers' evidence to the Low Pay Commission? The amendment is designed to elicit the parameters within which Ministers want the Low Pay Commission to work. Even if the rate--the floor--is to be the subject of advice by the Low Pay Commission, will they at least say that it should also set out the adverse implications of setting higher rates? If Ministers are tempted to depart from the Low Pay Commission's recommendations, other hon. Members will then be able to point to the adverse economic implications of setting a rate other than that which is proposed.
<P>
At what level would the national minimum wage rate be unsustainable, in the Government's view? It would be interesting to know whether, for example, they would regard as unsustainable &#163;3, &#163;3.50 or &#163;4--rates that have been mentioned in relation to certain regions. Ministers have not answered, for example, the question about the prevailing wage rate in Northern Ireland and its relationship to the United Kingdom. There is here a clear potential for an anti-competitiveness effect.
<P>
When Ministers say, ``In the light of economic circumstances'', they are presumably talking about the economic circumstances in the regions of the United Kingdom. The economic objectives to which Ministers adhere are therefore concerned not only with the international competitiveness of the United Kingdom as a whole, but also, I hope, with the relative economic competitiveness of different parts of the United Kingdom, their geographic disparity, and their ability to continue to create jobs and to gain thereby.
<P>
Let Ministers tell us whether, in the light of economic circumstances, they would regard as unsustainable a rate of &#163;3, &#163;3.50, &#163;4 or some other figure. They might, for example, consider &#163;4.61, which is the level at which the Trades Union Congress pitches its recommendation to the Low Pay Commission. As the TUC might be regarded as taking a maximalist view, would Ministers be prepared to endorse an amendment that would set a ceiling on the national minimum wage, by reference to the TUC's recommendation or to hourly average earnings? It is incumbent on Ministers to tell the Committee why they have sought to introduce legislation and to debate the structure and architecture of the Bill without giving any indication of their view, or of the ceiling that they would apply.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I agree that Ministers should tell the Committee exactly what rate they favour, but it does not seem likely that they will. Does my hon. Friend agree that, in view of the fact that Government Back Benchers do not share in collective ministerial responsibility but sit on this Committee, they ought at least to offer their personal view of what the rate should be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend extends an invitation that I hope members of the Committee will accept. I hope that members of the Low Pay Commission will read the Committee's proceedings, to seek a greater understanding of the purposes of the national minimum wage and of the characteristics that Parliament intends it to have, and to examine the risks associated with the rate at which it is set. It falls to them to recommend to Ministers a rate that does not run those risks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will my hon. Friend further consider the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham? Many Labour Members have or have had close links with trade unions. The unions will make their views known to the Low Pay Commission either individually or through the TUC. It would be appropriate for Labour Members with trade union links to inform the Committee of what they and the trade unions with which they are associated think that the minimum wage rate should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. The evidence given by the TUC and the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham in an earlier intervention, in which he spoke of previous statements from Ministers and Labour Members about a wage rate, show that the relationship between Labour Members and trade unions is very close with regard to the matter being discussed. During the campaign for the 1992 election, which I remember well, and rather more fondly than the last, the Labour party not only expressed a view on the national minimum wage rate, but did so largely at the behest of the trade unions.
<P>
As remains true to this day, the trade unions set Labour party policy through the party conference. That is true even if it is now the habit of Ministers and of the Labour party not always to listen to the conference, but to refer matters to the Low Pay Commission, seeking to be thereby absolved or protected--``protected'' is perhaps the word that I am looking for--from the view of party members, whether in the House or outside, and of trade unions, insofar as they are paymasters and determinants of Labour party policy.
<P>
I hope that I have set out the amendment's purpose. It is not intended to do more than probe the Government's intentions, in relation to evidence, to the wage rate, to the Bill's architecture and to the purposes of the Low Pay Commission. It seeks to probe whether those purposes can be set in a broader context of giving force to the Government's apparent intention that the commission should not set or recommend a rate that would be adverse to Britain in terms of what it can afford, and of its economic circumstances.
<P>
The Ministers, as the Opposition have amply demonstrated in previous debates, have gone to the trouble of constructing a Bill that is enabling in character. They have then disabled themselves and the Low Pay Commission in many ways. They would do a service by accepting or tabling an amendment that goes further and which would disable the Low Pay Commission and themselves from setting a rate that would be transparently damaging to Britain's jobs, competitiveness and economy. On those grounds, I support that amendment in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): I have listened to the debate with great interest. I shall be brief and to the point, which has not been the case for Opposition Members. They are not taking the issue seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I want to make progress, but am happy to come back to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
We want to establish a structure and have thought carefully about that. The figure in the amendment has been plucked out of thin air and is nowhere near the &#163;7 an hour recommended by the hon. Member for Buckingham, though I suspect that the job for which he would pay that amount is more difficult than some of those we have discussed. Perhaps he was referring to his cleaner.
<P>
There must be greater analysis of the figures. We cannot discuss figures that have been plucked out of thin air. Opposition Members have tried to draw out our views several times, but we cannot concoct a figure so that they can go home happy. This is a serious business. The Low Pay Commission is drawing on the experience of employers and unions--that has to be done properly--and the wider social, economic and job implications are being addressed. Conservative Members would be first to criticise if they were not.
<P>
The Low Pay Commission is taking evidence from many of the organisations recommended by Conservative Members--the CBI, the TUC, employers and employees. It will report back and make recommendations at the appropriate time. Hundreds of submissions have been taken and it would be grossly discourteous to pluck a figure out of thin air in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Lady accept that the thrust of our remarks concerns the Bill's fettering of the Secretary of State's power to take the commission's recommendations into account?
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> No. I accept that Conservative Members are doing everything they can to stop the Bill--that is the thrust of their arguments. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) made it clear that Conservative Members do not approve of the principle of the Bill. That is what their long speeches have been about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is the second time that the hon. Lady has made that point. The longest speech was made by the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry. It is discourteous to criticise for making a long speech someone who is not only from her own party, but who is not in her place.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I would not dream of involving my hon. Friend the Minister in such comments. She was responding to three sittings of debate and the hon. Gentleman would have accused her of gross discourtesy if she had not addressed the arguments of Conservative Members. There was no attempt to slow progress.
<P>
The amendment illustrates that the Bill is essential. The figure of &#163;3 per hour is a recognition that people are being paid less than that. Even if the national minimum wage was set at that rate, more than 1,400 people in my constituency would benefit. That is the scale and implication of low pay in this country.
<P>
Although Conservative Members have engaged in detailed debate, they do not want it on the exact figure. They want to pluck a figure out of thin air, which would be a gross discourtesy to the Low Pay Commission and the people who have given evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Lady say why it was proper and prudent to suggest a particular rate in April 1992 and why that is inappropriate now?
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> It is appropriate for the Low Pay Commission to deal with the matter. If the hon. Gentleman can find any reference to my making such a comment in 1992, I would be happy to see it. We will wait for the evidence of the Low Pay Commission. I urge hon. Members to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I will be exemplarily brief and follow the strictures of the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith), whom I was pleased to see on her feet in the Committee. I can assure her about the Opposition's role, and I should say that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire moved the amendment with all the necessary health warnings and with considerable elegance. Our role is to probe, ask questions and invite the Government to respond. That is nowhere truer than on this amendment.
<P>
The amendment enables me to bring to the Committee's attention a continuing concern of mine, although I am disturbed to have to do so again. For all the submissions that both sides of industry have made in great depth to the Low Pay Commission, they have still not heard from the Government. They have a skeleton document, a copy of which I have on a flimsy fax. As I mentioned in an intervention, the document makes no reference to the word ``social'' or to any of the aspirations of the minimum wage. It hints at potential political and economic damage, but does not flesh out the matter.
<P>
If I were the chairman of the Low Pay Commission and was confronted with those terms of reference--I would not want them to be too prescriptive--I would be desperately asking Ministers for a steer. I would be saying, ``Can you tell me, Minister, the parameters within which I am to think? What weight should I give the potential loss of jobs as against the actual or perceived benefit to individuals? How seriously am I to take the distinction between the small business that pays a particular rate and which is happy for everybody else to be pulled up to that rate and the small business that thinks that its rate will be altered?''
<P>
Such economic and social implications will centre on the rate chosen by the commission, and I have no problem in the context of Government policy with the commission considering that. I am, however, sure that it would help the commission--and it would certainly help the Committee--if the Government's evidence were tabled. Somewhat implausibly and not entirely to my liking, I am in the position of the late William Joyce. Speaking to the British nation during world war two, Lord Haw-Haw, for those who have not placed him, consistently asked, ``Where is the Ark Royal?'' At the time, it was sailing happily in the Mediterranean, although it was later sunk. Every time Lord Haw-Haw broadcast to us, however, he asked where it was. Every time I come to the Committee, I have to ask, ``Where is the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission?'' It has not come yet and does not inform our debate, which makes it more difficult for the Minister to respond.
<P>
I want briefly to pick up on a couple of points. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire mentioned the British Chambers of Commerce survey. That was interesting because of the global figures that he adduced and for the insight into the strategies that individual businesses will adopt depending on the level of the national minimum wage. The survey cites a large fast food retailer, which would look to close marginal business units if the national minimum wage were set above &#163;3.50. That is perhaps the kind of thing a fast food retailer would do. The survey goes on to mention
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a group of well-known restaurants''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know which group--that would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consider closing up to 20 of its less profitable or loss making businesses if the rate were above &#163;4.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The next sentence referes to the clothing and textiles industry. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there can be little doubt that businesses will close if the rate is as high as &#163;3.50.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an interesting set of analyses. As we said in an earlier debate, each firm is different. Firms report that fact to the CBI, which draws on it and on the British Chambers of Commerce in its evidence. Each firm will do something different depending on the rate. I am not asking the Minister to produce the rate this morning, even though I would like to have his evidence. The rate will, however, be critical to the strategy and survival of individual firms. There is a perfectly good economic justification for that because a change in the rate comes in at the margin and directly affects the bottom line of the business. As I am sure Ministers now realise, because they are new Labour and they are learning how the market economy works, a change at the margin has a direct and disproportionate impact on the profit rate. That is why I counsel them not to assume that they can split the difference in selecting a rate. Every advance in the rate, whether determined for political or other reasons, will have a cost because it will make more businesses less viable and make the impact on profits even greater. That is the simple economic curve that the Minister should consider.
<P>
It is worth referring to the statistical tables appended to the Library analysis of the Bill which are ultimately derived from the labour force survey and are broadly up to date. The figures show that more than 400,000 people report gross hourly earnings of less than &#163;2 an hour. They are the people whose rates give the Minister cause for concern and indignation. The tables show that 881,000 people receive less than &#163;2.50 an hour, 1.57 million--I am rounding off the figures--receive less than &#163;3 an hour, 3 million receive less than &#163;3.50 an hour, 4.63 million receive less than &#163;4 an hour and 7.8 million receive less than &#163;5 an hour.
<P>
It is interesting that the numbers rise almost arithmetically in a regular progression. For every rise of 50p an hour in wage rates, the number of workers receiving that rate increases by roughtly 1.5 million. So, whether the rate is set at &#163;3, &#163;3.50 or in between, it will affect a significant number of people. That has business and industrial consequences and should be taken into account.
<P>
The figures also translate--this was the subject of earlier exchanges with the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry--into percentages. Going through the same series, that means that 1.8 per cent. of people earn less than &#163;2 an hour, 4 per cent. earn less than &#163;2.50 an hour, 7.1 per cent. earn less than &#163;3 an hour, 13.6 per cent. earn less than &#163;3.50 an hour, 20.8 per cent.--which is roughly one in five of the labour force--earn less than &#163;4 an hour and 35.3 per cent., which is roughly one-third of the labour force, earn less than &#163;5 an hour. A targeted effect on a group for which the Minister has considerable political concern and for which we all have great sympathy is a different kettle of fish from bringing one-third of the labour force within the scope of the minium wage. The rate will therefore be extremely important.
<P>
The rate will be important for two other reasons. First, the Minister may find that there is a danger of scoring an own goal because any rate that has a significant industrial bite is bound to affect commercial costs and feed back into prices, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has already said. That will feed into the retail prices index and devalue the benefit of any chosen rate. The Minister will know, and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and others have recently warned, of the dangers of restarting the cost-price spiral, which is the last thing we want to do for the British economy, as I am sure we all agree.
<P>
The second danger does not directly concern prices and costs but relates to differentials. We must consider the implications for differentials of the setting of minimum wage rates. It would be idle for the Minister to argue that there will be no effect; I see no evidence of that. The exact details of that effect are bound to be contentious and will be matters of judgment. The Minister will recall that when the Department of Trade and Industry, under the previous Administration, was prepared to entertain figures and make estimates, the working assumption was a 50 per cent. differential--a diminishing one, and not 100 per cent., but a significant one. Whether that figure is right, I do not know.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I mentioned earlier the concerns expressed by the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. It employs skilled workers. It sees a cluster above the minimum wage rate with many unskilled workers. The union wants to establish its craft and expertise differences, which is an entirely reasonable aspiration.
<P>
It does matter hugely at the margin. Even a few pence makes a great deal of difference. I am sure that the chairman of the Low Pay Commission, whether instructed by the Minister or not, will bear these economic factors closely in mind.
<P>
The Government should consider the amendment in the spirit in which it has been moved--as a way of probing the kinds of consideration involved in setting a rate. I hope that they will be ever conscious in their response, and in their eventual decisions based on the Low Pay Commission's recommendations, of the critical importance of avoiding action at the margin which, in some political effort to split the difference or to reconcile the differences between Departments, leads to even a small movement in the rate because any small movement can have a critical effect on significant parts of the labour force and the economy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friends have made the points behind the amendment very eloquently. I shall attempt to be brief in adding one or two more points for the Committee's consideration. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire made clear, the principle attempt of this group of amendments is to pin the Government down and establish the rate that they have in mind. We want to do that because an understanding of the rate that the Government intend to impose will inform the rest of the debate and may even shorten it. If the rate is to be &#163;3 an hour, several of our major concerns will diminish. If, however, it is to be more than &#163;4 an hour--and the Government's rejection of the amendment will mean that that is possible--there will be serious concerns.
<P>
I also suggest that the impact of the measure at different rates of the minimum wage will not merely be quantitative as the rate changes but qualitative. There is a clear distinction between the reaction in terms of the restoration of differentials across the labour force if a minimum wage is imposed at a level around &#163;3, merely placing a floor under the very lowest paid workers, and the effect of a minimum wage set at &#163;4.61, for example. There is a very large group of workers--a cluster of wage rates--just above the level of the minimum wage which will have a much more significant effect when it comes to the restoration of differentials.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire spoke of the Minister's earlier reference to a sensible level for the minimum wage. That phrase has occured time and again throughout our debate with varying definitions. I draw the Committee's attention to another rather interesting definition of a sensible level, which is contained in the financial memorandum to the Bill. If says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``assuming the National Minimum Wage is set at a sensible level, with employment and the productive potential of the economy unchanged, the net effect is likely to be relatively small.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The DTI clearly thinks that there is a sensible level for the minimum wage at which employment will be unchanged. One reason for tabling the amendment is our genuine confusion as to the Government's view on this issue. From the financial memorandum, it is clear that the DTI believes that there is a sensible rate which will cause no job losses. The Minister, with the benefit of his McCartney curve, believes that imposing a minimum wage will increase the number of jobs in the economy. According to the Deputy Prime Minister, any silly fool knows that a minimum wage will cost jobs. The chairman of the Low Pay Commission seems to agree, although he doubts the value of some of the jobs that will be lost.
<P>
The Secretary of State has invited the Low Pay Commission to recommend a rate based on several criteria, yet none of those criteria specifies that employment levels should be left unchanged. In view of the contents of the financial memorandum written by his Department, I invite the Minister to explain why the Commission has not been asked to recommend a sensible rate, within the Department's own definition, that will leave employment levels unchanged.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will describe the Government's internal working assumptions about the minimum wage. It will have a significant effect on public expenditure plans, and that effect must be taken into account. For example, the increases in education and health are welcome, but their significance will be reduced or negated if the minimum wage is set at the upper end of the spectrum.
<P>
I wish to deal with a matter that would normally be tackled in a clause stand part debate. However, Mr. Atkinson, your co-Chairman, Mrs. Dunwoody, made it clear that she was unwilling to allow such a debate on clause 1, so I crave your indulgence.
<P>
The amendments would place a maximum limit on the minimum wage. If they wanted to uprate the minimum wage beyond that limit, the Government would have to introduce new primary legislation. Clause 1 does not refer to the methodology for uprating or revising the minimum wage. Does the Secretary of State have the power to decrease the level if she felt that to be appropriate at some time in the future? If she wished to revise the level, would she have to refer the matter to the Low Pay Commission? The Bill does not make either matter clear.
<P>
The amendments are designed to probe the Government: I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to describe the procedure that the Government have in mind for reviewing and uprating the minimum wage. I am worried that future Secretaries of State, regardless of party, may come under pressure to revise the level. That may happen, for example, in the run-up to a general election, when political parties seek financial help from their supporters in the industry.
<P>
I do not want the minimum wage to be subject to some sort of Dutch auction before a future general election, with political parties trying to outbid each other in their promises for uprating in the event of victory. That would be detrimental for the country as a whole, but the Bill's omission of procedures for considering uprating make that a possibility.
<P>
I am also worried that uprating would become a major factor in fuelling a future wage-price inflation spiral, as I am certain that there will be much debate about what minimum percentage increase will be acceptable to both sides of industry. We have all been there before, in the '70s. None of us wants to be there again. I hope that the Minister will address those concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall discuss two points which go to the heart of the deliberations: the rate and its mode of uprating. It is astonishing to business men in my constituency to whom I have spoken over the past few days--and to many of the farmers who lobbied Parliament this week--that we are discussing the Bill without knowing the rate. Universally, they said, ``I did not know that the Government had set the rate, but you are debating it.'' I said, ``They haven't.'' They replied, ``This is absurd. How can you have debates without knowing the rate.'' From the figures given to the Low Pay Commission, it is clear that they are right.
<P>
The CBI said that &#163;3 an hour would lead to job losses; British Chambers of Commerce said that the lower the rate, the better; the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association made the good point that the initial rate should be low, because it would be easy to increase--if the rate were too high and the assessment was that it was damaging, it would be difficult to lower. The Minister should consider the point that it will be practically impossible to lower the rate. The setting of the initial rate is important. At the other end of the scale, the Low Pay Unit wants the figure to be half male median earnings, which it calculates to be &#163;4.61. The range is enormous and goes outside even that suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry in the amendment. The value of our debates is reduced enormously by the Government giving no indication of the level at which they will pitch the rate.
<P>
The bodies that have submitted evidence to the Low Pay Commission have also made a huge range of suggestions on uprating, which is also dealt with by the amendment. The CBI wants no formula and no regular uprating; the TUC wants annual uprating in line with earnings; a group of London School of Economics academics has suggested annual uprating in line with benefits; and the engineering employers do not want an annual review, because that would set the going rate for industry. Without intending to do so, we could slip back to incomes policies. The Government, if they believe their own rhetoric, would not want that to happen.
<P>
Several of my hon. Friends have mentioned differentials. I was interested when the Minister said that the minimum wage is a floor. The TUC uses the same language, saying that it must not be a substitute for collective bargaining. The TUC clearly thinks that there will be an effect on wage bargaining across the spectrum. Therefore, it is extremely likely that there will be differentials. It beggars belief that the imposition of a wages floor would not affect differentials in a company.
<P>
If the Government do not accept that, they should come clean and say whether they will tell the Low Pay Commission to ignore any subsequent effect on differentials. Such an instruction would seriously affect the figure recommended by the commission. There could be differences: the commission might say that differentials matter, but Ministers might not agree. In theory, then, the Secretary of State could set a higher level than that recommended by the commission.
<P>
Without giving guidance to the House and to the Low Pay Commission, the Government are making the Committee's task much less easy than it could be and our deliberations much less valuable than they should be. Members of the Committee know that a balance of advantages and disadvantages is being set--this is not a scientific exercise. The Government have not given the Committee guidance on where they will set that balance, so our task has been made much less valuable.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we adjourn, I should make it clear to the Committee that I shall follow Mrs. Dunwoody's line: it is most unlikely that I will accept a clause stand part debate.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
