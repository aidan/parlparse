<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> New clause 7 would allow the Secretary 
of State to make regulations prohibiting discrimination by 
an employer on the ground of age. New clause 8 similarly 
allows the Secretary of State to make regulations 
prohibiting discrimination by an employer on the ground 
of sexual orientation.
<P>
The general sense of both new clauses is that they 
establish in law the fundamental right that no person 
should be discriminated against because of race, creed, 
gender, age or sexual orientation. Hon. Members know 
that in the first three cases, there is already established 
law to protect people from discrimination. I should like 
to believe, and trust, that members of the Committee and 
Parliament share similar concern about discrimination 
because of age and sexual orientation, because they are 
just as prevalent and pernicious in the workplace as any 
other form of discrimination. We have spent a great deal 
of time debating the removal of discrimination on the 
basis of training and membership, so I would have thought 
that this was a good opportunity for the Government to 
make their credentials clear and back their rhetoric with 
a statute.
<P>
I have salient examples that I think are worth putting 
on record to demonstrate why I believe new clause 7 is 
important. I will begin with the teaching profession. We 
are told that there is a crisis in teaching supply, yet it 
could be that schools themselves are guilty of ageism, 
which is cutting off the supply of teachers.
<P>
Whenever shortages of teachers are reported, there is a 
flurry of letters in the press from older teachers, who 
complain that they cannot get jobs, even in maths and 
science, for which there is a desperate shortage of 
teachers,. Alan Smithers, professor of education at the 
university of Liverpool, cites the case of Bob, who lives 
in London. The Committee will appreciate that I do not 
wish to give people's full names. Bob has a degree in 
chemistry and had 22 years experience in industry. He 
decided to change career, and, in 1997, trained as a
teacher. Since qualifying, he has applied for more than 50 
jobs but has had only six interviews. On each occasion, 
the post for which he applied went to a younger person, 
and all that he can obtain is part-time contract work.
<P>
Melissa spent 10 years teaching secondary schools 
maths, for which there is a great shortage of teachers. 
She decided to break from the classroom and undertake 
educational research. Now, with a PhD in education, she 
is unable to get a post.
<P>
There are difficulties, too, for the "scarce males" in 
primary education. Many hon. Members will know that 
there is a tremendous demand to get more men into 
primary school teaching.
<P>
To cite the case of a gentleman called David from West 
Yorkshire. After 29 years in mechanical engineering, with 
a degree in environmental science, he decided to change 
career and train as a teacher. He was told before he took 
the course that he would make an excellent primary 
teacher and would be snapped up and that, with his 
experience, he would have no trouble finding a teaching 
job. However, after countless applications he still has not 
found a full-time post.
<P>
Finally, let me quote the case of Dr. John Whittaker, one 
of my constituents is Eastleigh. John has a 2.1 honours 
degree, a PhD in modern languages, another supposedly 
shortage subject in schools. He qualified as a teacher 27 
years ago and was immediately employed. He then worked 
for 10 years as a teacher and for three years as head of 
languages. He then spent eight years training teachers as a 
senior lecturer at one of our local colleges of higher 
education, so clearly he is a man of considerable talent. His 
post was then declared redundant. Over the past three years 
he has applied for 160 teaching posts, not one of which has 
resulted in a job offer, even though he has kept his teaching 
skills and experience up to date by working as a supply 
teacher. On the rare occasions when he has reached a 
shortlist, he has been told, "You were the best candidate. 
We chose someone not as well qualified, but who we 
thought would fit into a younger team."	 Another example 
was "We are under a lot of pressure to appoint bright 
young people."	
<P>
John Whittaker is an extremely successful teacher. His 
referees confirm that he delivers considerable value for 
money. His problem is that he is 47 years old 47, and 
on the scrapheap of our education system. He is told by 
the association of teachers against ageism that the 
response that he has received is typical of that received 
by hundreds of teachers throughout the country. Indeed, 
national statistics show that teachers aged 45 or over are 
twice as likely to be unemployed six months after 
completing their training as those in their twenties.
<P>
Ageism is by no means confined to teaching it occurs 
in the mercantile marine, too. In my part of the country 
there still is a mercantile marine just running out of 
Southampton port. I know of a chief engineer with 30 
years' experience, 10 years as a chief officer, who applied 
for a job on an oil tanker. He was told by the company 
that it did not employ chief engineers over 45 years old. 
This man had 30 years' experience in charge of 
ocean-going ships, with a wealth of knowledge and 
practical experience behind him but he was over 45.
<P>
There are examples of deck officers who qualified as 
pilots. For the uninitiated, that means piloting vessels into 
harbour, not aircraft. One man qualified as a pilot and was 
sent on deep-sea duties to gain the necessary experience 
for the certificates that a mercantile officer needs to be 
appointed to a senior position. But by the time he had 
acquired the certificate he was 39 years old, and he was 
refused a post as a pilot because he was too old.
<P>
There is a wealth of evidence to show that there is 
widespread discrimination against age, particularly 
against the over-40s, who find themselves bypassed for 
promotion, the over-45s, who have fewer opportunities 
for job-related training, the over-50s, who find it difficult 
even to get a job interview, and the over-55s, who are 
more likely to be the long-term unemployed. Age 
discrimination in the workplace curtails individual 
opportunity, wastes resources and, by forcing many older 
people into early retirement, cuts off the valuable skills 
and experience that we are told our nation desperately 
needs.
<P>
Negative and inaccurate assumptions about the 
capabilities and abilities of older people are reinforced by 
the pay and conditions structures of many organisations, 
making it financially more attractive to replace older 
workers with younger people. The experience and skills 
of older workers are often undervalued by employers, and 
they can be regarded as less capable or less adaptable than 
younger people. Studies have shown that older workers 
may give better service, have lower rates of absenteeism 
and stay in post longer than younger ones. We can look 
around this place and draw few examples that reinforce 
that analysis. That has made a few people think. Perhaps 
I am thinking of beyond 2001, but I must not stray from 
the point.
<P>
Anti-age discrimination legislation will not change the 
underlying negative attitudes, but it would be an important 
step towards ensuring that employers change their 
practices. There is also strong support for such legislation 
from industry. The Institute of Management, in a recent 
survey of its members, found that 69 per cent. of 
managers favour legislation to restrict the use of age limits 
in job advertisements and 65 per cent. nearly two 
thirds favour comprehensive employment protection 
legislation, "comprehensive" meaning protection against 
age discrimination.
<P>
Some organisations argue that a voluntary code is 
sufficient that promoting the benefits of older workers is 
enough and that legislation is unnecessary. The CBI is a 
case in point. It put out a range of "what if" situations to 
show how legislation could prohibit age discrimination. 
Its approach is not dissimilar to that of many serious 
probing amendments to the Bill, but in each and every 
case the Government have responded by saying, more or 
less, that the carrot of voluntary codes is not sufficient: it 
needs to be backed by legislative sticks.
<P>
The Government have said in each case that the Bill 
provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations, 
should he see the need and only after consultation, but 
that the power to make such regulations will be enforced 
in law. New clause 7 asks for no more than that. If the 
Government accept it they will grasp the opportunity to 
ensure that discrimination in the workplace on the basis 
of age is prohibited by law.
<P>
Briefly, new clause 8 deals with discrimination by an 
employer against another person on the ground of sexual 
orientation. This issue first came to my attention in 1994 
when I was elected to this place. Within weeks of being 
elected I was contacted by Lisa Grant, who lives with her 
partner Jill Pearcey in my constituency. That may sound 
a little parochial, Mr. Atkinson, but I assure you that it is 
not. Lisa told me that, as an employee of South West 
Trains, she was entitled to privileged rail travel. If she had 
been married, the privilege would have been extended to 
her husband or even her common law spouse, but, because 
her partner is of the same sex, she is denied the travel 
rights given freely to other employees, even though the 
policy document issued by her then employer, British 
Rail, stated that such discrimination was not acceptable.
<P>
That is not as parochial because as some hon. Members 
may recall, the case became a cause ceÂleÁbre. It was taken 
to the European Court, and argued by that well-known 
barrister, Cherie Booth QC. While the European Court 
agreed that there was discrimination, the case was lost, 
because it considered that the issue was outside its 
jurisdiction. New clause 18 would remove that anomaly 
and protect same-sex couples in matters of employment 
rights.
<P>
That case is by no means unique. A fairly recent survey 
showed that among gays and lesbians, 16 per cent. had 
faced discrimination at work and 21 per cent. suspected 
that they had, on the ground of their sexuality. Another 
48 per cent. claimed that they faced harassment, including 
ostracism, threats and physical violence.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the Social and Community Planning Research 
organisation, which is wholly independent, undertook a 
survey among employees of all sexual orientation. It 
found that one in three heterosexuals was less likely to 
hire an applicant if he or she knew the person to be gay 
or lesbian. In 1998, the Equal Opportunities Commission, 
in its publication "Equality in the 21st Century: A new sex 
equality law for Britain"	, included the recommendation:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There should be legal protection against discrimination for 
lesbians and gay men."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Sexual Orientation Discrimination Bill went through 
the other place last year, but insufficient parliamentary 
time was available for the Bill to become law.
<P>
New clause 8 presents the Government with an 
opportunity to at least prohibit discrimination against 
sexual orientation in the workplace. The Government are 
on record, in the other place, of having reservations about 
the scope and timing of the Sexual Orientation 
Discrimination Bill, but not about its good intentions. The 
scope of new clause 8 is specific. Its intentions are clear 
and precise and I urge the Minister to grasp the 
opportunity to convert the Government's rhetoric into 
law.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is perhaps fitting that after discussions 
that have ranged vigorously across the economic 
implications of the Bill, we should conclude on a, perhaps 
not quieter, but more reflective note, with a series of three 
new clauses, two of which are embodied in this group and 
one that will follow shortly, on what might loosely be 
called personal or moral factors.
<P>
Of course, these factors have an economic implication, 
and I am not suggesting that other parts of the Bill do not 
engage on people's moral concerns, but these are 
particularly about discrimination and personal 
consequences, so it is right for the Committee to debate 
them. In that spirit, it is probably right, in responding to 
the eloquent speech of the hon. Member for Eastleigh 
when he moved his two new clauses, to declare an interest 
myself certainly in respect of new clause 7. People of 
my age are perhaps not always obliged to say precisely 
how old they are, although such information about hon. 
Members can be obtained from Vacher's or Dod's, but 
the Committee may be interested to know that I attended 
my first public election meeting during the 1945 general 
election. In order to awaken the interest of Government 
Back Benchers, I should say that the person who 
addressed that meeting 
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that his 
life pattern reinforces my view that the older worker has 
more staying power, less absenteeism and stays in the 
post longer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am delighted to hear that and am 
tempted to respond that only time will tell. I shall finish 
my anecdote, to tie things down more precisely. I am 
advised that the speaker on that famous occasion was 
none other than the late Professor Harold Laski, of whom 
Clem Attlee said that a period of silence would oblige. I 
hasten to say that my attendance was not out of political 
conviction, nor did it subsequently influence my political 
views. I was two at the time, but I am told that I was 
there. Some of us become increasingly interested in issues 
of age discrimination.
<P>
With regard to older employees, I echo the experience 
of the hon. Member for Eastleigh that they are often of a 
very high quality. Some years ago I was chairman of my 
constituency association or, if Government Members 
prefer the term, constituency party and it became our 
firm practice, if not a conscious decision, to employ 
agents over 50 because they were extremely experienced 
and very good at their job. We had satisfaction from a 
series of older people in that position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend is correct that older 
people often make better employees, but is he not falling 
into the trap that has been set under age discrimination 
legislation that if one prefers older employees all my 
secretaries have been older than me, which can be quite 
old that can be discriminatory?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> With his customary prescience and 
presence of grey matter, my hon. Friend has anticipated 
the point that I was to make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on the 
wording of the new clause? It does not mention whether 
a person is older or younger; it deals with discrimination 
on the basis of age. Did not the hon. Member for South 
Dorset say that he discriminated in favour of older 
people? There is no such reference in the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That may be the case, but the argument 
generally centres on discrimination against older people. 
The hon. Member for Eastleigh spoke eloquently about 
the problems of older teachers an issue with which I 
have some familiarity and about the difficulties of older 
workers in general. I share the view that older workers 
often give excellent value to their employers and that 
there can be discrimination against the older worker, 
sometimes in ways that are inappropriate.
<P>
I am dealing at the moment with the initial stages of 
such a case. A professional driver has told me that, 
although he could obtain employment from an employer 
in an adjacent borough, he is unable to take up the post 
as the borough will not license him because he is over the 
age of 60. Apparently it would relicense someone 
attaining the age of 60, but, despite the fact that the man 
has had a clean licence for 40 years and an impeccable 
medical record, it will not permit him to join the payroll 
because he is 64. I shall not pursue that case because I 
have not completed my inquiries into it, but it comes 
immediately to mind as an example of a clear age test. I 
am sure that all members of the Committee wish to avoid 
the imposition of rigid age tests and I hope that many 
share my views about the quality of older workers. The 
difficulty is that it is one thing to express the aspiration 
to avoid such discrimination the Prime Minister was 
warm on that subject some time ago, but appears recently 
to have become more tepid on it, perhaps as it got nearer 
the time for taking decisions but it is another to turn that 
into viable legislation.
<P>
It is here that we begin to get into the kind of trouble 
to which the hon. Member for Eastleigh referred and to 
which the CBI referred in its briefing note. The CBI says 
that clarity is extremely important and asks what a 
suitable comparator for alleged age discrimination would 
be; if the complainant is 35, for example, should the 
comparator be younger or older and by how much? It also 
makes the point that not all discrimination on the grounds 
of age is unreasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the 
only discrimination in the work place should be on the 
basis of ability? The age of an employee is not necessarily 
irrelevant to that and the point of the new clause is to take 
age out of the equation and concentrate on ability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have sympathy with what the hon. 
Gentleman is saying, but I was about to cite a counter 
example. I will also give other examples. It would not be 
unreasonable to require a professional driver over the age 
of 60 to be tested more frequently for his physical 
well-being than someone aged under 50. The Driver and 
Vehicle Licensing Authority requires more frequent 
eyesight tests or a doctor's certificate, if necessary, for 
older drivers.
<P>
As for training requirements, it is more difficult to 
teach older people new tricks than it is to teach younger 
people. However, one always learns new tricks in this 
place and we may even learn some more before we have 
finished debating the Bill. Who knows? I am not sure that 
the point of the hon. Member for Eastleigh, although it 
was made with considerable charm and eloquence, is 
entirely valid.
<P>
The CBI goes on to say that the concept must be tied 
down and, without such clarity.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"legislation in this area would be a recipe for managerial paralysis. 
Any employee or potential employee could bring a case of 
discrimination on the basis of almost any day to day managerial 
decision, whether in relation to recruitment, promotion or 
redundancy. The employer would have to defend such cases".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The spectrum is that it is not always easy to differentiate 
other sorts of discrimination, but it might be particularly 
difficult to do so in relation to age discrimination.
<P>
The ball is in the Minister's court to express his attitude 
towards the clause. If the hon. Gentleman can find a 
viable answer that does not increase the costs to business 
and the uncertainty that it faces, we might be talking, but 
there are difficulties. To aspire to good employment 
practice is not necessarily to require that it be enshrined 
in legislation. It is reasonable to say in certain respects, 
"Well, this issue may be handled better by guidance or a 
code of practice", something that I think that the 
Government are contemplating. We look forward to the 
Minister's response.
<P>
I turn now to new clause 8 on gender discrimination, 
which is more sensitive and generates great feeling. I was 
aware of the South West Trains case to which the hon. 
Member for Eastleigh referred. I remind the Committee 
that the age of consent is a matter of personal opinion. In 
a personal rather than Front-Bench capacity, I am one of 
those Conservative Members who voted for a reduction 
in the age of consent to 16, so that will not be an issue 
between me and some other members of the Committee. 
I believed that such discrimination was no longer justified.
<P>
However, we probably have to accept with regret 
the fact that even in contrast with other sorts of 
discrimination, such as on the grounds of race, a person's 
gender generates strong personal feelings. It might be 
difficult to practice for employment law to bite in areas 
where the employer felt passionately that he did not want 
to employ a certain person. I do not recall ever having 
been in that position when I was an employer.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons </B>(Rochdale): I welcome the fact that 
the hon. Gentleman voted for lowering the age of consent.
<P>
Does he think that it is justified for an employer who 
believes passionately about issues of sexuality to 
discriminate against an employee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Lady must allow me to make 
the argument: It is important that it should be coherent. I 
was saying that I am not aware of ever having had to 
decide whether to employ someone who was homosexual, 
because I am a relatively small employer. I hope that I 
would respond in an entirely non-discriminatory way I 
think, genuinely, that I would. For example, taking a 
sensitive area, I am aware that some clergy are 
homosexual, yet I regard them as excellent parish priests 
and in no sense worthy of discrimination. I hope that we 
share the same line on that.
<P>
Realistically, some people in my view wrong and I 
hope that that gives the hon. Lady a lead choose to 
discriminate against persons with a homosexual 
inclination. It may be even more difficult to persuade 
people not to discriminate if they are aware of it than it 
would if they are not aware of it, whatever the law. That 
is difficult to measure, but it is right to flag it up as a 
practical problem. We ought to be getting to the stage 
where we can overcome that problem. I share the view 
that we should not discriminate against people. I have read 
the Stonewall evidence; it is, as always, most responsible. 
I find it compelling. That is my personal view. I give it 
because others may wish to dissent.

<P>

<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I am struck by 
my hon. Friend's comments. I wonder how one can even 
begin to prove that discrimination has taken place on the 
ground of sexual orientation. Putting together a case 
against an employer would be difficult. In my view, there 
would seem to be a potential for vexatious litigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I understand my hon. Friend's concern. 
To some extent, I go along with it. However, it should 
not be beyond the wit of mankind or even Parliament 
to produce legislation if Parliament so decides. It is not 
easy to prove gender discrimination, which is closely 
related, or race discrimination, because discriminatory 
cases are difficult to prove. I notice that the hon. Member 
for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) nods his head on 
that point.
<P>
I said that I do not want discrimination of any kind, but 
that view needs to be translated into legislation, as we did 
with ageism. As my hon. Friend the Member for 
Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbridge) said, if legislation is not 
viable or watertight it could be discredited or give rise 
to difficulties.
<P>
Given that it is the Government's responsibility to take 
decisions in such matters, we need to hear from the 
Minister a clear indication of the Government's intention. 
It seems to be a little clearer since the Minister for 
Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities 
announced on 3 March that the United Kingdom 
Government had acceded to convention 111 of the 
International Labour Organisation on discrimination on 
employment and occupation. Signatories to that 
convention undertake to:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"declare and pursue a national policy designed to promoteequality of 
opportunity and treatmentwith a view to eliminating discrimination".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will also know that, in November 1998, the 
Equal opportunities Commission stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There should be legal protection against discrimination for 
lesbians and gay men."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In another place in June 1998, in a debate on the Sexual 
Orientation Discrimination Bill, which did not reach the 
House of Commons and therefore was not enacted, 
Baroness Blackstone stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"At this stage therefore I can promise that the Government are 
committed to giving serious consideration to the issues raised by 
this BillWe are looking forward to seeing the recommendations of 
the EOC after consultation and we shall consider them carefully and 
positively." [Official Report, House of Lords, 5 June 1998;
Vol. 590, c. 657.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For a change, that sounds encouraging. However, we must 
accept that it is not an easy matter.
<P>
The Committee should begin to consider the issue and 
it is important that the Minister should respond to the 
anxieties that have been expressed on both sides of the 
Committee on those sensitive matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): New clause 
7 and 8 have been bundled together because they tackle 
discrimination in the workplace. Surely it is right that 
everyone in the UK has an equal right to be considered 
fairly for a job and thus to have the opportunity to work?
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry made a telling point 
when he referred to the race relations and sex 
discrimination legislation, to which much initial 
opposition was presented. As he suggested, when an 
attempt is made to tackle such matters and consider them 
in detail, ways forward can be found. That is a key point. 
A solution can be found for such issues when they are 
considered.
<P>
An Age Concern survey found that 65 per cent. of 
managers favour the introduction of comprehensive 
legislation, which appeared also to have Government 
good will. On 9 February 1996, the Minister of State to 
whom I should like publicly to send best wishes for his 
early recovery, and am sure that I am joined by many 
others said in the House:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Labour party's position is quite clear on age 
discriminationan incoming Labour Government will introduce 
comprehensive legislation to make age discriminationillegal."	 
[Official Report, 9 February 1996; Vol. 271, c. 618.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although the Government have suggested that they are 
willing to tackle the problem, all that we have had so far 
is a six-point code of practice from the Department for 
Education and Employment, which I shall not detail but 
which is available to hon. Members. The code of practice 
highlights the problem but, as has been said by many 
people in industry and elsewhere, does not solve it.
<P>
The House has had nine opportunities over the past 16 
years to introduce an age discrimination Bill. Just this 
afternoon, my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) 
proposed a ten-minute Bill on that very issue. He made 
the point that the code of practice that has been 
implemented has no teeth, and, to give one example, John 
Monks of the Trades Union Congress has said that it will 
not work in practice.
<P>
We all agree that a problem exists and that it will be 
difficulty to tackle. Nevertheless, in tackling previous 
problems such as sex discrimination, it has been possible 
to find a way forward.
<P>
The Lobby to End Age Discrimination says that the 
code of practice will not have a significant impact and that 
we must consider a far stronger approach in due course.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh used several 
examples. I shall give just one, of a lady who was made 
redundant from her job in the City at the age of 45. She 
has since refreshed her computing skills, applied for 
dozens of jobs and registered with 35 employment 
agencies, and has been told time and again that she is over 
the hill.
<P>
Hon. Members will not deny that a problem exists. 
People who want to work, are able to work and have 
experience, skills and commitment should be allowed a 
fair opportunity to do so.
<P>
I can draw on my own experiences. To be honest, there 
were times when I said at work, "I wonder whether we 
should have someone older, or younger." I am being frank 
about that and am shamed to say it, but sometimes people 
talk in that way when they are looking for people to fill 
jobs. In admitting it, I am saying that it is a problem and 
that all of us need to be educated and to realise that it 
must be addressed.
<P>
The Government's projections state that 35 per cent. of 
the labour force will be aged 45 or over by 2000. By 
2010, almost 40 per cent. will be in that age group, while 
the 16 to 24-year-olds will make up 17 per cent. of the 
work force. By 2010, almost 40 per cent. of the work 
force will be 45 or over, and we know that that group of 
people have problems finding a job.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Are not those figures an argument for 
making more effective legislation to tackle discrimination 
against young and older people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> We are not focusing on age groups. As 
the hon. Member for Daventry said, it is wrong to talk of 
35 give or take a plus or minus. We are addressing 
principles on discrimination that have been discussed 
before, and are saying that there should not be 
discrimination against people at work, whatever their age.
<P>
New clause 8 deals with serious discrimination. I 
wonder whether I was alone in not realising the extent 
of discrimination in the workplace on account of sexual 
orientation. I did not realise its extent until I read the 
details, which I hope colleagues will do, and I felt 
ashamed that in a country such as ours the number of 
people discriminated against, is, as my hon. Friends said, 
such a disgrace. I was shocked. I want to emphasise that. 
I did not realise that people were being barred from jobs 
on the basis of orientation. I understand that people have 
difficulties of one type or another, but hearing the figures 
that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh gave came 
as a shock. As many as 40 per cent. of respondents to a 
Stonewall survey in 1993 felt that there was harassment 
at work. People feel the need to lie, and to hide their 
sexuality at work.
<P>
In Smith v. Gardner, the court ruled that the proper 
frame of reference was between a lesbian and a gay man, 
and declared that if an employer could demonstrate that 
he treated all gay people equally badly, all was fine and 
dandy. How sickening.
<P>
Legislation for this purpose is being introduced. The 
Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the Scotland Act 1998 
created a statutory obligation on their legislatures to 
ensure equality of opportunity in relation to sexual 
orientation. That is an important point. In England, we 
remain aloof. I hope that after tonight we shall not.
<P>
I could say more, but my hon. Friend the Member for 
Eastleigh said much that I would have said. I believe that 
tonight that we have the opportunity to end appalling 
discrimination in the workplace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> First, I want to outline the Government's 
position on discrimination. We stated clearly in our 
manifesto that we would seek to end unjustifiable 
discrimination wherever it exists. Therefore, I have a great 
deal of sympathy with the comments of most hon. 
Members, and especially with the concern that prompted 
the amendments from the hon. Member for Eastleigh. I 
genuinely regret that I shall have to reject the new clauses. 
I will set out my reasons at some length because I realise 
the strength of concern and have much sympathy with the 
sentiment underlying the new clauses.
<P>
The Government believe that unfair age discrimination 
in employment is bad for the individual, bad for business 
and bad for the country. Promoting age diversity and 
tackling age discrimination in employment is a key part of 
the Government's strategy of building a country in which 
everyone, young and old, can play a full part. That is 
not in dispute. The only question is how best to achieve 
that goal.
<P>
The use of legislation has not proved to be the best way 
forward in such a complex area. Let us consider the 
position on jobs, for example. France and Spain have age 
discrimination legislation but their older worker 
employment rate is lower than ours. In Canada, which 
also has legislation on the issue, the economic inactivity 
rate among 55 to 64-year-olds is higher than in this 
country.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It became clear during a year-long consultation carried 
out by my hon. friend the Minister for Employment 
Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities that effective 
legislation covering age discrimination raised some very 
complex issues, not least whether the retirement age itself 
is discriminatory. That is why the Government are taking 
a measured approach, taking forward a range of initiatives 
that will help older people and bring about cultural 
change, and using the lessons learned from those 
initiatives to inform future plans.
<P>
We need to change attitudes; employers need to believe 
that people can and do add value to their business 
regardless of their age. The results of the consultation 
published last year pointed to a non-statutory code of 
practice as the best way is to encourage this process of 
change because if we do not change the culture we will 
not solve the problems.
<P>
The Government have therefore been working to 
develop a draft code with some key partners, including 
the TUC, CBI, the Employers Forum on Age, Age 
Concern, the Institute of Personnel and Development, the 
Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services and 
the Institute of Management. The code will be launched 
in May this year.
<P>
We believe that the code will bring real benefits in 
promoting good recruitment and employment practices, 
irrespective of age. it will cover all aspects of employment 
practice, from recruitment through training and promotion 
to redundancy and retirement. it will be backed with more 
detailed guidance and illustrative case studies.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> The Minister mentioned the Employers 
Forum on Age. I emphasise that that organisation said that 
the cost tot he country of the forgotten workers those 
between 50 and 64 is about £26 billion a year. The 
number of people not employed in that age is about
3.7 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. 
The code is designed precisely to tackle such problems.
<P>
We will monitor the code's effectiveness and it will be 
fully evaluated by February 2001. The ground work that 
will be necessary to carry it out is already being put in 
place. We have commissioned an independent 
organisation to carry out the necessary large-scale 
research project.
<P>
The result of that evaluation will help inform future 
plans for legislation in this area, including the approach 
that the Government will take to proposals for EU 
directives or regulation under the new article 13 of the 
treaty of Amsterdam, which will allow the European 
Commission to introduce proposals to counter 
discrimination on a wide range of grounds, including that 
of age and of sexual orientation, to which I shall come in 
a moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If I may, I shall continue with my point 
and if the hon. Gentleman still wants to intervene I shall 
give way.
<P>
In carrying out the evaluation, we shall look in detail 
at employer policies and practices in recruitment and 
employment and at the impact that they will have on age 
diversity in their work force. In order to provide a baseline 
against which to measure changes in attitudes, practices 
and policies, an initial survey of employers and older 
people is being carried out prior to the publication of the 
final version of the code. In addition, we shall publish 
each June key indicators showing the position of older 
workers in the labour market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> On many occasions in Committee I have 
criticised the Minister for making speeches that I did not 
agree with and, therefore, I thought it appropriate to say 
that I could not have made a better speech on working 
with industry, the unions and everyone else to ensure that 
ageism is ended. I am glad that he has realised that a 
legislative approach to ageism is wrong. His plans will 
move things forward, and I hope that he will use the same 
principle in other provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am always grateful for support from 
whichever quarter it comes, and I am especially grateful 
to the hon. Gentleman for those gracious words. I am 
pleased that he has recognised the measured approach that 
we have adopted in this case and throughout the Bill. I 
reassure him that we shall continue to adopt that measured 
approach throughout the proceedings on the Bill.
<P>
On new clause 7, I hope that I have reassured the 
Committee that the Government are far from being 
inactive in such matters and that we share the commitment 
of the hon. Member for Eastleigh to take action against 
unjustified age discrimination in the workplace. We differ 
only about how to achieve our shared goals. We do not 
believe that the time is right for a legislative measure such 
as that proposed, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman is 
satisfied that we have recognised the problem and that we 
are moving forward. Therefore, I hope that he will 
withdraw the motion.
<P>
New clause 8 deals with discrimination on the grounds 
of sexual orientation. I am well aware that, in comparison 
to measures to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of 
sex, race and disability, a gap exists in the protection that 
we offer some individuals. The Government deplore 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. We are 
revolted by the treatment that some gay men and lesbians 
continue to suffer.
<P>
Having said that, we do not believe that the Bill is the 
appropriate vehicle to deal with that important, 
wide-ranging new topic, as it would involve a radical step 
away from the indentions on which we consulted in the 
"Fairness at Work" White Paper and it would clearly 
require extensive consultation in its own right.
<P>
We shall consider the matter further in the context of 
the wider European developments that I have already 
referred to, such as new article 13 of the Amsterdam 
treaty. When all member states have ratified that treaty, it 
is likely that the Commission will make positive 
recommendations on such matters. The problems that 
concern the hon. Member for Eastleigh and the 
Government may be addressed in those recommendations, 
but we cannot commit ourselves now to accepting each 
and every measure the Commission may propose.
<P>
Apart from the European dimension, last November the 
Equal Opportunities Commission formally presented to 
the Government its recommendations following a review 
of sex equality legislation. The EOC proposed that there 
should be a specific legal protection for lesbians and gay 
men. We remain committed to considering that, and the 
EOC's other recommendations, carefully. However, it is 
too early to be clear whether a legislative measure would 
be the appropriate way to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Does the Minister recall that I referred 
to the Sexual Orientation Discrimination Bill, which was 
passed in the other place, and to the fact that his colleague 
in that place stated that the Government did not object to 
that Bill. So why is the Minister not prepared to support 
something similar to that Bill, which did not become law 
because of a lack of parliamentary time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We must be absolutely sure that we achieve 
our goals. There is no difference between us about the 
goals. [Hon. Members: "Yes there is."] No, there is no 
difference between us; we deplore such discrimination. 
However, we must be sure about how best to achieve 
those goals. We want to be sure that we remove injustice 
thoughtfully and in full knowledge of the impact of 
legislation, and that will require full and extensive 
consultation with many relevant parties, such as industry, 
the armed forces and the Churches.
<P>
I regret that the Government cannot support new 
clause 8, although I assure the hon. Member for 
Eastleigh that our differences are over only the means 
and not the objectives. I hope that he will feel reassured 
enough to seek to withdraw the motion. I assure him 
that the Government will address the discrimination, but 
I hope that, for the purposes of the Committee, he can 
be patient at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am bitterly disappointed by the 
Minister's reaction to the two new clauses. For all his 
charm and persuasive oratory, the basis of his response is 
that the Government will not do anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not get 
into bed with the Minister. We told him that before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> That is a rather tasteless remark from a 
sedentary position, given the new clauses that we are 
debating.
<P>
The Minister opened his remarks by reminding us I 
had not mentioned it in my comments that these issues 
were in a manifesto pledge from the Government before 
the general election, and it is now clear that they are late, 
not an early, pledge. The Government were concerned 
that legislation in regard to ageism the older worker 
would not work, because France and Canada, which had 
such legislation, had more unemployment among older 
workers. What the Minister did not say was whether that 
was related to their age or to their skills. The point of the 
new clause is that the only reason for discrimination, or 
choice if one prefers, in employees is what they can do, 
not what their age, sexual orientation, colour, creed or 
race might be, and the Minister has ducked that issue.
<P>
The Minister went on to claim that the all-singing, 
all-dancing code of practice, which seems to be 
continually under revision and consultation, will solve 
these problems. He has not accepted that there are loud 
concerns from many quarters about the effectiveness of 
the code of practice; nor did he respond to my point that 
the Bill contains countless examples of powers being 
provided for the Secretary of State that may allow him to 
make regulations should he decide that it is necessary. I 
do not see any problem in allowing the Bill to give the 
Secretary of State such powers in the event that the codes 
of practice do not work. therefore, I am not satisfied with 
the Minister's response.
<P>
Discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation, 
which is dealt with in new clause 8, is not a new topic. I 
do not understand why the Government failed to consider 
this area, which the Minister said revolts him. Why was 
it not included as an area of consultation in the White 
Paper, "Fairness at Work"? The Minister cannot cry 
crocodile tears about it in Committee if the topic was 
totally ignored in the preparation of the Bill.
<P>
Why must we wait for EC legislation before the 
Government can take a lead EC legislation into which 
they would enter a caveat and say they may not accept? 
All that the Minister has given us so far is a commitment 
to consider the issue, when we should have a firm lead 
from a party and a Government who claim to be 
concerned about social issues.
<P>
I very much hope that the issues raised in the two new 
clauses will be able, if Madam Speaker so allows, to be 
debated in a wider forum on Report, as I believe them to 
be extremely serious. I do not believe that we have had 
convincing arguments from the Government to confirm 
their so-called commitment. Therefore, in the hope that 
we can have a fuller and measured debate among all 
members of the House later, I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read 
a Second time.
<P>
Colleagues may be surprised to see my hon. Friend's 
name as well as mine on the new clause. [Interruption.] 
I will accept "astonished"	. That is as mild as one could be.
<P>
We have just heard an extraordinary debate in which 
the hon. Member for Eastleigh has rightly put the 
Government next to the fire to test them on the 
commitments that they made when in opposition. 
Members of the Committee will have received a letter 
from the Keep Sunday Special campaign which examined
the Bill and what rights the Government are giving 
workers. Take, for example, having a cooker installed 
an appropriate item for the moment because I was 
supposed to be having one installed today. However, not 
having left a note for the Whip about being absent when 
my clause was being moved 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is a domestic emergency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> As I had not left a note for the Whip,
I stayed here. Curry's I mentioned the company 
previously turned up, and I paid them an extra £25 so 
that they would install my cooker, but according to them, 
there was no socket there, so they did not install it. There 
is the emergency. That is an example of the sort of minor 
measure that the Government are committed to providing 
for in the Bill.The Keep Sunday Special campaign rightly 
pointed out that, when the Labour party was in opposition, 
it said a great deal about the problems of individuals it 
could be a single-parent family but let us say that there 
are two parents who wanted to spend a whole day each 
week together with the children, and to be able to plan 
ahead so that an employer could not stop them having that 
day off.
<P>
When the previous Government introduced and allowed 
Sunday trading, they specifically ensured that individuals 
who were already working on a contract that did not 
include Sundays or any other day for that matter could 
not be forced by an employer to change it. The Labour 
party, when in opposition, said that that would not work, 
that it would not be a sufficient guarantee. So we tabled 
new clause 10 to test the Government. In opposition they 
said that it was essential that people be allowed to spend 
one day a week at home. After all, the Front-Bench teams 
of all Opposition parties including the Scottish and 
Welsh nationalists are in favour of preserving family 
life. Are the Government now in favour of it? The hon. 
Member for Hyndburn will surely get stars at the end of 
the debate he has kept to schedule and has had no 
embarrassing amendments from the Trappist tendency on 
his Back Benches; they have kept their silence and I am 
sure will get good reports. There will be all sorts of 
promotions in the reshuffle: additional jobs, visits 
overseas and so on.
<P>
Perhaps the Keep Sunday Special campaign is naive 
perhaps it is not. Perhaps it believes that when Labour 
Members campaigned to ensure that people could take a 
Sunday off, that was Labour party policy writ in stone, 
that it was a Labour commitment. I congratulated the 
Minister on the Government's good sense in adopting, 
hook, line and sinker, Conservative policy on age 
discrimination I am sure that the Minister of State wrote 
his speech on that especially for him. I hope that he did 
because that would show how much our ideas have got 
through to new Labour. I would like to hear from the 
Minister or from any of my colleagues on that 
commitment that Labour gave when it was in opposition. 
The hon. Member for Eastleigh found the Government 
wanting; perhaps their deal I shall not describe it more 
embarrassingly with the Government did not provide the 
Liberal Democrats with any way through for their 
policies.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friend the 
Member for South Dorset. The amendment is an 
important test of what the Labour party said in opposition 
and what it is saying now in government. The new clause 
opens up an important area of employment law and 
employment rights. All members of the Committee would 
want to pay tribute to the Minister for the way in which 
he picked up the cudgels as a result of the unfortunate 
medical condition of the Minister of State; we all hope 
that he will recover soon. It cannot have been easy for the 
Minister suddenly to find himself in the driving seat. 
Despite disagreeing with him, we think that he has done 
a good job. That said, he gave the definitive performance 
of a Minister struggling to find words in difficult 
circumstances when he said in the debate on the previous 
amendment that he was committed to considering the 
important legislation, to which the Labour party was 
committed before the general election but about which it 
is now not sure apart from the fact that it does not want 
to be with the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say 
about the clause because it should lie at the heart of 
an employment rights policy especially as we are to 
introduce measures about which we have doubts, such 
as paternity rights and rights to time off in crises, which 
we think over-regulatory and unnecessary; however, the 
Government have a mandate and are likely to pursue 
the measures. We are considering rights that improve 
the quality of life, which is what I believe Labour 
Members are all about, although we disagree with their 
means of going about it. The right to have a day off 
is important, as is the right to have a designated day 
off. Both the man and the woman in a couple often 
work nowadays and if they are to have quality of life 
with one another, as well as going out to pay for that 
quality of life, they must have a day off each week 
it is even nicer if it is the same day for both of them. 
For most of us at least, Members of Parliament 
that happens to be Sundays, although sadly not always. 
Everyone should have a guaranteed day off every week 
that is not subject to shift patterns, which may get out 
of sync and go awry.
<P>
I shall be brief, as the Committee has continued for 
some time. I see the hon. Member for Hyndburn smiling 
at me what a pleasure. I support my hon. Friend the 
Member for South Dorset and look forward to what the 
Minister has to say. I hope that, on this final amendment, 
he will find something with which we can agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my colleagues for tabling 
the new clause and for the way in which they have spoken 
to it. I should declare an interest, as I was one of a handful 
of five or six Ministers who supported the Keep Sunday 
Special option when it was debated during the passage of 
the Sunday Trading Act 1994. I came to that position with 
some difficulty and diffidence.
<P>
I also have a slight interest because the briefing from 
the Keep Sunday Special campaign involves a case in my 
constituency in Daventry, which I referred to the 
campaign because of my concern about the implications 
for the individual. The briefing states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A driver working for a supermarket chain had a contract with an 
element of weekend working (the agreement was for one Sunday in 
nine and five Saturdays in nine). In June 1998 the management 
decided to break our written agreement and force long term drivers 
to work equal amounts of Sundays. They introduced a book for 
drivers to state a preference but 20 long term drivers refused to enter 
their names because of the increased Sunday work. The result was 
a new 20-week rota introducing five Sundays in 20, which broke 
company and union agreements. The matter was put in the hands 
of ACAS."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That group of employees believed that it was the then 
Government's intention that no employee working 
directly in the supermarket industry would be forced to 
work Sundays. That was entirely consistent with the views 
of the right hon. Member for Sedgefield, who was then 
the Labour spokesman on employment matters and who 
is now, of course, the Prime Minister, when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I hope the Minister will confirm that the Act will not only protect 
people from being dismissed for refusing to work on a Sunday but 
prevent them from suffering any detriment at all in their 
employment, including in their promotional prospects."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, there is evidence, which may not be universal 
but which is enough to be disturbing, that such practices 
are continuing.
<P>
The new clause is an aspirational amendment, to some 
extent, suggesting that employers, wherever possible, 
should offer that facility to their employees. I hope that 
that would be a matter of good practice anyway. The 
Minister should come clean about what the Government 
are doing, and say whether they think legislation is 
required, whether they want another of their famous codes 
of practice, whether they are still consulting, or whatever. 
They are the Government, so they should grasp the nettle 
and tell us their reaction to our proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Members for South Dorset and for 
Bromsgrove said that the new clause was tabled to test 
the Government. They have been successful; they have 
tested my powers of comprehension.
<P>
New clause 10 proposes that employers should be 
obliged, at the request of an employee, to take all 
reasonable steps to offer one regular day of leave each 
week in respect of any of the employment rights in 
schedule 3. It appears to be suggesting that employees 
should be able to take entitlements to maternity leave, 
parental leave and emergency time off one day a week. 
There is even the possibility that they would take a day 
off for each of the different types of leave in the same 
week. That may not be what was intended, but it could be 
exactly what would happen under the new clause.
<P>
I do not think that there can be any dispute that a 
woman needs to take a continuous period of maternity 
leave. While we encourage flexible arrangements when 
they can be agreed by employers and employees, it would 
be impracticable for maternity leave to be taken in that 
way and, as we have discussed, employees must have a 
continuous period of two weeks' compulsory leave after 
the baby is born.

<P>

<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I fear that the Minister is becoming 
demob happy, bearing in mind that he is about to finish 
debating this rather onerous Bill in Committee. The civil 
service has come up with a fanciful interpretation of the 
new clause, but in the usual course of attending work each 
week, a guaranteed day off should be available to the 
employee. While the Minister's suggestion is entertaining, 
he is clearly wilfully misinterpreting our argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful for hon. Lady's enlightening 
contribution. Neither I nor the civil service drafted the 
new clause and those who did must stand by the 
interpretations that have been put on it.
<P>
I am sure that Conservative Members did not intend 
that employees should take a regular day off a week to 
deal with family emergencies, which is another possible 
interpretation of the new clause. I shall not enjoy myself 
too much by expanding on such a ridiculous concept, 
given the definition of emergencies. If Conservative 
Members want to deal with parental leave, which may 
have been in the back of their minds when drafting the 
new clause, by suggesting that it should be taken in the 
form of working part-time in this case, by taking off one 
day a week that is reasonable and I have considerable 
sympathy, with their suggestion.
<P>
We are giving careful thought to how the parental leave 
scheme should be covered in the draft regulations. Our 
aim is to maximise flexibility and to enable employers 
and employees to agree individual arrangements to suit 
their particular circumstances. That could include working 
fewer days a week for a period. We are certainly attracted 
to helping parents to take parental leave on a part-time or 
reduced working hours basis for a limited period, if that 
is their preference.
<P>
To date, our consultations have revealed great support 
for flexibility. It is an important option for many parents, 
especially when it helps them to have better child care 
arrangements, for example. That is also much in line with 
our objectives on part-time work, whereby we want to 
encourage employers to look positively at requests for 
changes in working hours. In many cases, such provisions 
might suit them better than losing the employee for a 
block of time.
<P>
However, employers should not be required to agree to 
part-time parental leave in all circumstances, as the new 
clause envisages. We are committed to considering very 
carefully how to reflect that in the regulations and I assure 
Conservative Members that we shall consult on the 
outcome in the draft regulations.
<P>
I now move on to what may be at the heart of the new 
clause, which is the right to a day off a week under the 
working time regulations, which are separate from any 
rights to parental leave. If the parental leave regulations 
provide for part-time working, that will not affect rights 
to a weekly rest period. I shall explain the difference 
between "leave" under the terms of parental leave and a 
"rest period" under the working time regulations. Leave 
is taken during a time when, if one were not on leave, one 
would be working. It is leave from work. A rest period is 
different; it is a period during which one would not 
normally be working because one is resting from work. 
However, I must express my gratitude to Opposition 
Members for raising the issue. We shall reconsider the 
working time regulations in parallel with the Bill to ensure 
that they achieve the effect that we want. In the meantime, 
I hope that the hon. Member for South Dorset will 
withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am tempted to explore further, and 
to ask the Minister to get to the heart of the Keep Sunday 
Special debate. However, I am conscious that we have 
laboured reasonably seriously today, and that the Minister 
would feel that I was being rather churlish in not 
accepting the spirit in which he made his remarks. We 
shall wait to hear what the Government have to say about 
Sundays in their commitment to consider to use the new 
terminology the working time regulations. I beg to ask 
leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I pay tribute on my behalf and on that of 
my right hon. Friend the Minister of State to all the hard 
work that has been done in the Committee. I am especially 
grateful for all the hard work of hon. Members on both 
sides of the Committee, and for your firm chairmanship, 
Mr. Atkinson, and that of Mrs. Dunwoody, in steering me 
through what has been for me a novel enterprise. I am 
grateful to the Clerks, the Hansard reporters, the Door 
Keepers and police officers who have supported us 
throughout our deliberations.
<P>
I have just made a rapid reckoning I hasten to add that 
I have been attentive in the meantime that the Committee 
has now sat for some 36 hours, over 17 sittings, during 
which time we have tackled some 38 clauses, 53 pages of 
schedules, and more than 280 amendments, including new 
clauses and new schedules, more than 80 of which were 
tabled by the Government. That is a most impressive record 
of productivity, which bears witness to the spirit of 
partnership and co-operation that has been very much on 
show and for which I am especially grateful.
<P>
The Committee has done good work in improving the 
content and understanding of the Bill. I am confident that 
as a result of the Committee's efforts, the Bill will go 
forward in an even better state than it was at the end of 
January.
<P>
Finally, I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister 
of State regrets his inability to take part in our later 
debates. We have all missed him. I hope that he feels that 
we have done right by his Bill. I am sure that everyone 
looks forward eagerly to his rapid recovery and his return 
to parliamentary business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I share the sentiments expressed by the 
Minister. I thank you, Mr. Atkinson, and your 
co-Chairman, Mrs. Dunwoody, for your expert and 
increasingly familiar chairmanship of Committees dealing 
with employment legislation. The Bill has been debated 
with a degree less rancour and slightly more smoothly 
than the legislation we debated last year, and certainly at 
more convenient hours of the day and night.
<P>
I must also Opposition Members always do this with 
great feeling thank our clerk, the Hansard reporters who 
impeccably pick up even our stray references, the 
attendants and the police, and all those who brief us and 
generally inform our debates.
<P>
I shall start with the ministerial side of the Committee. 
We all wish to be associated with the remarks made about 
the Minister of State. He has given a great personal 
commitment to the Bill, at some cost to his short-term 
personal health. All members of the Committee wish him 
a speedy recovery and hope that he will be his usual self 
as soon as possible. He must not hurry back untimely; he 
is entitle to some rest after his efforts. Indeed, he was 
most responsive to our comments in the earlier stages of 
our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
Having been a Minister myself, I am conscious of the 
fact that the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, 
the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) has come 
fresh to the Bill, which is not an easy task for anyone. I 
do not say that in a patronising sense. He sought to 
address the issues, even if necessarily through 
consultation; he sought to explain the course, the 
sometimes rather sinuous course, of Government policy; 
and he displayed a considerable charm in doing so, which 
will stand him in good stead in our inevitable 
deliberations on the fall-out from the Bill for example, 
on the regulations.
<P>
I thank Government Back-Bench Members, who were 
occasionally let off the leash and who made some 
interesting contributions. We appreciated their knowledge 
of trade unions and, in one or two cases, their knowledge 
and commitment to small business.
<P>
I thank also our part-colleagues, the Liberal Democrats. 
They, too, have made interesting and constructive 
contributions. Their votes may have been a little more 
pusillanimous than their sentiments, but their support has 
nevertheless been appreciated.
<P>
Above all, I thank my hon. Friends, not only for putting 
up with me, which Government Back Benchers also had 
to do, but for their thoughtful, lucid and sensitive 
contributions. Ours has been a concerted effort to improve 
the Bill. The Bill did not reach us in a perfect form; it has 
already sustained 80 Government amendments, and more 
are promised. There will be other occasions to debate the 
Bill, but, collectively, the Committee has done a good 
job of work on the Bill. We certainly enjoyed playing 
our part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I add my support to the sentiments 
expressed so eloquently by the hon. Member for 
Daventry. First, I thank all the staff for the help that they 
have given me and my small team in trying to address the 
serious issues in the Bill, which I hope to have done to 
the best of my ability. I also add my genuine wish and 
desire to see the Minister of State back in his usual place, 
entertaining us with his foresight, wisdom and humour.
<P>
I congratulate the Minister, who has taken on a difficult 
job at short notice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Unpaid as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Unpaid, as the hon. Member for South 
Dorset said from a sedentary position.
<P>
Despite all the frustrations that he must have felt, the 
Minister has managed to steer the Bill through patiently, 
and with good humour and not a little charm. As the hon. 
Member for Daventry said, we shall return to some of the 
issues as the consultation process proceeds. I have no 
doubt that some serious points still need to be resolved 
in the interests of achieving good and sensible law on 
employment relations.
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank hon. Members for co-operating 
with the Chair, particularly the two Whips, who ran the 
Committee in such an orderly way. It was quite unlike the 
National Minimum Wage Bill, which Mrs. Dunwoody and 
I also chaired, and which once or twice went through the 
night. We are both grateful to the Whips. I thank the 
Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry for his help, 
and say how well he has done, given that he had to do it 
on his own.
<P>
I, too, hope that the Minister of State, will return soon. 
We missed his wit his special sort of wit in the latter 
stages. Once again, I thank all members of the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
