					<a name="07101663000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment to explore the scope of the commission&#146;s
power to write off arrears and to seek confirmation that the wealth of
the child or children will be taken into consideration in respect of
any regulations that are made to do so. To be fair, we had a good
debate on this subject in the last amendment. The Minister gave us an
assurance that the welfare of the child would be paramount in this Bill
and when the commission wrote off debt. We also had a fairly good
debate on the circumstances in which debt may be written off and the
involvement of the parent with care. On that basis, I do not intend to
push the amendment, if the Minister is prepared to reiterate that that
will be taken into account in any write-off. I would be satisfied by
such an assurance and would withdraw the
amendment.</div>

underpins this Bill is the welfare of the children. I thank the hon.

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) at the conclusion of

scheme.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07101663000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
the previous amendment, this is a probing amendment. I seek a little
more information from the Minister about the operation of pilot schemes
and, in particular, how the results and findings of such schemes will
be processed and published. If a pilot scheme is operated, the results
should be made available. The amendment seeks to ensure that the
results and findings are published every six months when a pilot scheme
is in operation and at the conclusion of every pilot scheme. I should
be grateful if the Minister could tell us how the Government intend to
operate any pilot
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07101663000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000360"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b> I am grateful to the hon.
Member for Rochdale for moving his probing amendment. Before looking at
the effect of his amendment, let me deal with his other point and
outline the purpose of piloting. Piloting allows policies and
programmes to be tested, adjusted and evaluated before decisions are
made as to whether they are applied in general. The clause enables the
commission to pilot in circumstances that will benefit from that
approach.</div>
					<a name="07101663000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
give an example. We will be using the piloting powers to prove the
effectiveness of using deductions from earnings orders as the primary
method of collecting child maintenance from non-resident parents in
employment, and they will allow us to test that method for up to two
years. Pilots will be able to operate in specific areas and in relation
to specified types of people, or to people selected through either
specified criteria or on a sampling
basis.</div>
					<a name="07101663000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would compel the commission to produce six-monthly and final reports on
any pilot. Although I do not disagree with the main thrust of the
proposal, which is to publish the results of pilots, the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s wish that it should be done on a six-monthly basis
would not achieve what he wants, and I shall explain why. Pilots can be
conceived and designed for a wide range of reasons, such as considering
the implementation of new services or the impact of a measure. The wide
nature and possible scope of pilots would make it difficult to ensure
that they were all able to meet the six-monthly reporting regime.
Furthermore, six-monthly reports would be of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>little value, because the analysis of the findings would need to be
carried out from such an early stage in the pilot that it would be
unlikely to produce results of significant or sufficient quality. The
most effective analysis can be gained only from cases that have had a
sufficient journey through the system, allowing us to assess the full
impact of changes in circumstances&#151;for example, the impact of
job change in the case of the direct earnings order pilot, which I
mentioned earlier.</div>
					<a name="07101663000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission, in consultation
with the Department, will determine how best to report on research. As
the hon. Gentleman knows, the Bill already requires the commission to
report on all activities in each and every financial year. I emphasise
that we share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern about the value of
publishing the results of pilots, but they are more effective if they
are allowed to run their natural course in an appropriate length of
time. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s wish to have a fixed, regular
reporting period would not produce reports of much light; they would
probably impede the process. We want pilots to be of value and to give
us real results, which they will. They will be published at the
appropriate time, when the pilot has naturally
expired.</div>
					<a name="07101663000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07101663000362"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 94, in
clause 37, page 35, line 32, leave
out &#145;20&#146; and insert
&#145;25&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07101663000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to point out the slight contradiction
between the Bill and the laws of Scotland. Members will note that
clause 37 defines a child
as</div>
					<a name="07101663000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person who has not
attained the age of 16, or has not attained the age of 20 and satisfies
such conditions as may be
prescribed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07101663000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would increase the age from 20 to 25, because the definition
of a child under Scots law, which can be found in the Family Law
(Scotland) Act 1985, defines a child as</div>
					<a name="07101663000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
person&#151;</div>
					<a name="07101663000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) under the age
of 18 years; or</div>
					<a name="07101663000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) over that
age and under the age of 25 years who is reasonably and appropriately
undergoing instruction at an educational establishment, or training for
employment or for a trade, profession or
vocation&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07101663000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under that
Act, both parents are under an obligation to aliment the child while
they are undergoing such training or instruction. Under the law of
Scotland, both parents can be responsible for children until the age of
25 in those specific circumstances. I appreciate that the cases in
which that will become a problem are few and far between, but they do
exist. If the Bill is not amended, after the age of 20 anyone in
Scotland who is relying on this definition of &#147;aliment&#148;
may not be able to approach CMEC, because its responsibility would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div>end when they reached 20. If someone&#146;s aliment had been dealt
with through CMEC, perhaps for a large number of years, it is
conceivable that it would stop when they were 20, even if there were
still an obligation for aliment to continue after that, the result
being that the person would be required thereafter to raise an action
of their own in the courts to seek aliment from one or both parents and
to start all over again, with all the difficulties that could
ensue.</div>
					<a name="07101663000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
appreciate that the cases in which such a circumstance might arise are
few and far between, there is a contradiction in this provision. Will
the Minister consider the definition of &#147;child&#148; and,
perhaps, include in regulations some reference to the fact that in
Scotland things are different and allow the definition under the 1985
Act to be carried into the Bill in respect of the Scottish
situation?</div>
					<a name="07101663000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000363"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I appreciate the hon. Member for Angus raising
that point. I recognise that in Scotland children have different
rights. However, our agreeing to his amendment would have at least one
perverse outcome under the law that we are seeking to pass here and,
for that reason, as well as others, I hope that he will reconsider. Let
me expand on that.</div>
					<a name="07101663000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman has said, under Scots law courts can make orders for
aliment to be paid in respect of a person until they are 25, where they
are in education or training for employment or for a trade, profession
or vocation. That measure is based on the age by which a person would
normally be expected to have completed their education, including any
trade apprenticeships, and no longer need parental
support.</div>
					<a name="07101663000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Children Act 1989, the courts in England and Wales have the power to
make orders for maintenance on an application by a person over 18 whose
parents are separated and who is receiving instruction at an
educational establishment or undergoing training for a trade,
profession or vocation. Thus orders for maintenance can be sought in
England and Wales for a similar period that aliment might be sought in
Scotland.</div>
					<a name="07101663000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would not
want to widen the definition of &#147;child&#148; in the way in
which the hon. Gentleman has suggested for child maintenance purposes
to define young adults substantially older than the age of 20 as
&#147;children&#148;. Doing so would extend maintenance
dramatically for some young people. Furthermore, when a non-resident
parent themselves falls within the meaning of &#147;child&#148;
under the Act, they are exempt from paying maintenance. If the
amendment were agreed to, legislation would have to be amended so that
children born to parents up to age 24 would not have to wait until
their non-resident parent reached 25 to get maintenance from them.
Amending legislation in the way in which the hon. Gentleman has
suggested would cause more complication to the system than we have now,
and we want to avoid that. I hope the hon. Gentleman understands that
and will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07101663000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000364"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> I hear what the Minister has said, and I understand
the difficulties. It looks like over-20s in Scotland will still have to
go to the courts in the few cases where the provision applies. However,
I accept the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>Minister&#146;s reasoning. The amendment would
have a slightly perverse application in respect of allowing parents
under 25 to escape, and I would not wish to impose that upon the
nation.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 refer to schedule 6,
which deals with the use of information. I am sure that Members will
recall our discussions in Committee when we considered several
amendments dealing with the relationship between the commission and Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. In particular, we addressed
concerns about the systems in both the Inland Revenue and the
commission, and about whether all the information from the different
computer systems at the Inland Revenue would be readily available to
the commission. The specific issue that was raised was that of the
non-resident parent who might seek to maximise their tax position to
minimise their payments to the parent with
care.</div>
					<a name="07101663000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">What this small
amendment&#151;again, it is very much a probing amendment&#151;is
seeks to do is to elucidate from the Government what particular process
is currently in place. As I have said, several computer systems are
already operating within the Inland Revenue, and they do not
necessarily talk to each other. There is also the issue of the free
flow of information to the commission. Before the new system becomes
operational, we want the Government to present a report to Parliament
that sets out how the system will
operate.</div>
					<a name="07101663000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know from
the history the problems that have been experienced with IT
systems. Will we be embarking on a whole new IT system? If we are not
doing that, what steps will be put in place to ensure that the existing
system
copes?</div>
					<a name="07101663000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07101663000368"></a>
							<b class="B">Albert
Owen</b> (Ynys M&#244;n) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman is making
an important point about different Departments talking to each other.
However, does he agree that the role of the Select Committee is to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>scrutinise each Department and to ensure that its reports are up to
date? The Select Committee will get that information by scrutinising
properly.</div>
					<a name="07101663000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000369"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I think that the
Select Committee will have a vital role to play, to ensure that, once
the commission is up and running, the system is working. However, the
purpose of the amendment is different. We know what has often happened
in the past&#151;when new IT systems have been introduced or there
has been a new way of working, it has taken months or years for such
information to become available.</div>
					<a name="07101663000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">From our previous discussions
about the recovery process, we know the number of amendments that are
being made to the current system to make it operate properly. I seek an
indication from the Government about what will happen with those IT
systems. Will there be a full-scale rewrite? If not, how will we ensure
that that large amount of information is accurate? We have previously
discussed the problems that the parent with care has when the
non-resident parent seeks to deny the information, and also the
concerns about the onus that is always being put on the parent with
care. We fully support the use of Inland Revenue systems, but we want
the Government to ensure that those systems&#151;as I have said,
several systems within Inland Revenue do not automatically talk to each
other&#151;work to the benefit of the parent with care and do not, as
they do at the moment, considerably disadvantage them.</div>
					<a name="07101663000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of asking for a
report before the process starts is to enable the Select Committee,
once the commission is operational, to have a benchmark. The Government
have said that certain things will happen and that this is the process
that will be gone through. The Select Committee will then be in a
position to monitor progress. I am sure that the Government and members
of the Committee agree that that is something that we all want to see.
We want to see the commission get off to a flying start; we want to
ensure that the correct systems are in place; and we want to ensure
that the Select Committee has the wherewithal to monitor that
process.</div>

						<a name="07101663000370"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Taylor. As I shall be away this afternoon, may I
say anticipatorily how much I have enjoyed your and your
colleague&#146;s chairmanship of this Committee, which has been very
constructive? I hope that the debate continues in that
vein.</div>
					<a name="07101663000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Rochdale is right to raise the issue, and I agree with his general
judgment that the resources and information available to HMRC should
also be available to make the most accurate assessment of child support
liabilities. There is no difference between us on that matter or on the
specific intentions, which the hon. Gentleman has explained, about the
need for a public understanding that the computer systems are going to
talk to each other and are going to be fit for purpose. We are all at
one on that.</div>
					<a name="07101663000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
worth a moment of the Committee&#146;s time, if only because I enjoy
Ministers giving me assurances, briefly to consider some of the civil
liberties arguments. The clause&#146;s heading is &#147;Use of
information&#148;, and it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>occurs to me that there is always the potential&#151;Ministers need to
be aware of this and to acknowledge it&#151;for abuse of information.
I would simply like the Minister in responding to the amendment to give
us assurances, which I recall, for example, being given to me on the
Welfare Reform Act 2007, that the information will be used, as the
schedule states, for the purposes of functions relating to child
support, which is virtually the rubric of the schedule, and only for
that purpose. The first point is that there will be security systems in
place.</div>
					<a name="07101663000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I flag up two
particular concerns. First, persons within the agency or commission
should use the system only when they are trained and when it is
necessary for them to do so. It should not be available for fishing
expeditions by other members of the commission. For example, there is
the possibility of the parent with care seeking to find out
information&#151;there will be a strong temptation in some cases to
do that, but it should be resisted.</div>
					<a name="07101663000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, there is growing
concern on both sides of the House about the retention of information,
for example, on DNA databases for persons who may have no specific
criminality or for whom the issue is long past. I am concerned about
the retention of such material, and whether it might be in some way at
a lower level of security or after a passage of time, straying out in
to the public domain, where it should, could and generally will remain
highly sensitive and properly controlled. That is not impossible. I do
not wish my comments in any way to subvert Ministers&#146;
intentions, which are both honourable and sensible, but we must always
go through the business of assurances in such a sensitive
area.</div>
					<a name="07101663000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000371"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I understand entirely why the hon. Member for
Rochdale has raised the issue. He is right to remind us of the history
on IT and the experiences that we have had with the agency and its
system. He is right to seek reassurances, and he is not alone in that.
We all want reassurances about the
IT.</div>
					<a name="07101663000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The IT question
divides into two parts, and in our brief debate we have strayed over
both of them. First, there is the issue of the robustness of the IT
within the agency as it is currently, and within what will become CMEC.
We have had some discussions about the famous 509 defects and the speed
with which they are being put right. I want to assure the hon.
Gentleman that, as part of the operational improvement plan, there is
very heavy investment in re-engineering the existing IT platform, and
the bulk of the defects have been corrected. We are absolutely
determined to ensure that the legacy system that moves under
CMEC&#146;s control is fit for
purpose.</div>
					<a name="07101663000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
part of the IT question is the inter-relationship between IT and
different parts of Government, and the exchange of data. The hon.
Member for Daventry, who spoke on that matter, is of course right that
we seek the reassurances that he wants. That is why laws have been
passed to set the framework and to give us the means to control that
important and sensitive area. Both human rights legislation and data
protection legislation have been fully recognised in the way in which
we are proceeding, and gateways and security systems are in place to
ensure that data is transferred for the purpose for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>which it is intended and no other, and that there is no access beyond
that which is authorised by the steps that we are taking.</div>
					<a name="07101663000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The historical income
information acquired from HMRC forms a central part of the proposed
maintenance calculation arrangements. The use of HMRC historical income
data and the proposed system of annual reviews will help to ensure that
maintenance calculations are made more quickly, that they remain up to
date and that the opportunity for manipulation of income by
non-resident parents is minimised. We are absolutely committed to
ensuring that the link providing HMRC data to the commission functions
both efficiently and effectively.</div>
					<a name="07101663000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are currently working on how
the information links will be established. We have set up a
cross-governmental working group with colleagues from HMRC and the
information division of the Department for Work and Pensions to ensure
that the process receives all of the attention that it requires. We
intend that work to inform the development of regulations that set out
how the transfer of information will take place and how the commission
will use it to the fullest effect. The work that we are doing will also
benefit the commission as it considers the development and
implementation of the new systems and how they will be used by
staff.</div>
					<a name="07101663000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure hon.
Members that we will take every step necessary to ensure the smooth and
effective transfer of information between HMRC and the commission, and
we will be happy to make information on this topic available as and
when it is appropriate to do so. Of course, the Select Committee will
rightly want to pursue that matter as we proceed. Until then, I do not
believe that there is any need to require a report to be presented as a
motion to Parliament. Furthermore, schedule 6 sets out the
information-sharing gateways in relation to not only HMRC, but
a number of Departments. The amendment, and the report that it would
require, concern the information gateway between the commission and
HMRC and so would miss part of the picture in any
case.</div>
					<a name="07101663000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
information-sharing gateways are important to the commission and are
essential to enable it to carry out its functions. The gateways are
also essential to HMRC, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
and the Northern Ireland Office to enable them to carry out their
functions. If the coming into effect of schedule 6 were dependent upon
a motion submitted to each House of Parliament, it would not only delay
the ability of the commission to use historical tax information in the
calculation of child maintenance, but impact on the functions of a
range of other Departments, agencies and bodies. The hon. Member for
Rochdale was right to raise the issue, as was the hon. Member for
Daventry, and I hope that I have given them the reassurances that they
seek. In that light, I hope that the hon. Member for Rochdale will
agree to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): I beg to move
amendment No. 120, in schedule 6, page 69, line 8, at end
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;5A (1) This
paragraph applies to information which is held for the purposes of
Court proceedings in which the non-resident parent is a
party&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) by the Court,
or</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) by a person providing

Commission, or</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) to a person

functions relating to child
support.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07101663000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is relatively simple. It would make the schedule more
comprehensive. It already covers sharing information between the
commission and a range of Departments, but it omits allowing the
commission to receive information from a court if it holds information
for the purposes of child support which would be useful to the
commission. The amendment would widen the scope a little to allow a
court to share with the commission information that it held about an
action to which the non-resident parent was party. We think that that
would be a helpful provision which does not appear to be included at
present.</div>
					<a name="07101663000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000374"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for the amendment. We
have no objection in principle to what he wants to achieve by it, but
there is a difficulty about the means. If he will bear with me, I shall
explain what that
is.</div>
					<a name="07101663000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree that it
is right that parents or their representatives should be free to
disclose information from court proceedings to the
commission if they consider that such information would enable the
commission to make fairer and more accurate maintenance calculations
and, in short, provide a better service to parents and children. In
most cases the information that would be disclosed would be details
about a non-resident parent&#146;s income, obtained in private
proceedings, such as ancillary relief proceedings in divorce.</div>
					<a name="07101663000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">By removing
the current need, in certain proceedings, to apply to the court for
permission to pass that information on to the commission, we may speed
up the process of getting maintenance flowing to children and ensure
that maintenance calculations are fair and accurate. We support the
free passage of information between parties to court proceedings, their
representatives and the commission where that would help the commission
to fulfil its functions more effectively, and we are working to find
the best way to achieve that agreed
objective.</div>
					<a name="07101663000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would capture the information held by the Children
and Family Court Advisory and Support Service and potentially
information held by expert witnesses, which might include, for example,
information on psychological assessments of parents and children. We
are sure that that was not intended by those who drafted the amendment.
It is not clear, at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>this point, how best to achieve the objectives that the hon. Gentleman
and I share. It may need a change in primary legislation, or it might
be possible by changing court rules. The relevant court committees,
including the family procedure rule committee, are the bodies that make
rules of court. They would need to discuss and consider proposed rule
changes, and appropriate consultation would be needed before that could
happen.</div>
					<a name="07101663000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000375"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s care in
explaining his thinking, and his welcome for the concept that my hon.
Friends want to advance. Does he agree that at least in principle it
would be better if the documents in question were
court-generated documents, made available to the commission, rather
than reports, perhaps at second hand, from one of the parties to the
decisions, that are merely relayed to the commission? If there is, as
it were, an official imprimatur, there will not be a great evidential
argument about who has produced half the evidence, rather than the
whole
bundle.</div>
					<a name="07101663000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000376"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> That is exactly the issue that must be
investigated. We want to achieve the supply, from court proceedings to
the commission, of information that will help in getting a maintenance
assessment done and in getting maintenance flowing. Devising a rule as
has been suggested may do that, but everyone needs to look into what
the practical implications of that approach would be. It sounds neat,
but it might also exclude certain documents, which, nevertheless, could
help to serve the purpose of the commission as to
maintenance.</div>
					<a name="07101663000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
why we want the court committees to consider the matter. That will get
us the best advice on how to proceed. There is no objection in
principle to what the amendment is intended to do; we support that
intention. It is a question of finding the right method. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment and leave it with us to
figure out the best way to
proceed.</div>

						<a name="07101663000378"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Michael Clapham</b> (Barnsley, West and Penistone) (Lab): The
aim of part 4 is to provide payments to mesothelioma sufferers, both
live and posthumous cases. It makes provision for the recovery of
payments in certain circumstances. The Bill has been welcomed by a
number of organisations, from the TUC 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>through to the Association of Personal Injury
Lawyers. However, I will raise one or two points as we go through the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07101663000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to raise
a couple of points. My first call for clarification is in relation to
clause 41(3)(b), which says that
we</div>
					<a name="07101663000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may prescribe
different amounts for different cases or classes of cases or for
different
circumstances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07101663000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
refer to the Bill&#146;s provisions as the new 1979 scheme. It will
make payments, but until the fund is built up they will be less than
those paid under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146; Compensation)
Act 1979. The payments will then be equal to those paid under the 1979
Act and the two will merge.</div>
					<a name="07101663000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I first dealt with payments
some years ago. The 1979 Act was introduced following the 1974 scheme
to accommodate slate workers in Wales. Payments were based on the age
of the claimant, the date of development of the disease and the degree
of disability. However, since we moved from dual diagnosis, anyone who
is diagnosed with mesothelioma is given an industrial injury
disablement benefit at 100 per cent.&#151;in other words, the
disability is seen as a 100 per cent. disability. Therefore, it appears
that the only difference in payments under the new scheme is likely to
be based on age. Will the Minister clarify that? There may be other
circumstances in which a claimant could have received a payment under
the 1974 scheme. Is that the case, because I want to bring to her
notice the 1974 scheme and some of its implications when we move on to
clause 49?</div>
					<a name="07101663000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point relates to subsection (5) and the procedure for dealing with such
cases and deciding in a posthumous case on how a payment is to be
divided. For example, will the Minister follow the procedure that has
been set under the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease scheme which
calls for letters of probate and then leaves the division to a
solicitor? I know that we want to minimise the use of solicitors, and
we do not want solicitors involved in this particular scheme. I assume
that the Minister, or the Department, will call for letters of probate
to determine the number of siblings and so on before deciding how the
payment is to be divided in a posthumous case. Will she clarify that?
We will be dealing with these claims as soon as the Bill becomes law.
As she is aware, we are expecting at least 600 cases a year, which
means that we will be dealing with 12 cases a week. In some of our
constituencies, cases will be brought to our surgeries at an early
stage.</div>
					<a name="07101663000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000379"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is an acknowledged expert on
these matters, and I listen to him with great respect. Does he not
agree that the person with mesothelioma may, given that they are
afflicted with a terminal disease, wish to express certain priorities
before their death in relation to the allocation of the assets and the
lump sum? Does he not also agree that one of the sad facts of our
modern society is that few people conclude wills, and instead leave
matters to intestacy rules, which might lead to a different disposition
of assets or entitlements from the one that they had intended or
wanted?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000380"></a>Mr.
Clapham:
						</b> I do not class myself as an expert; it is simply
the case that, as a compensation officer years ago, I used to deal with
claims that came under the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>1979 Act. However, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point raises some of the
complexities that the Minister will have to deal with. I should have
thought that a claimant who wished the payment to be divided in a
particular way would set that out in a will. Once a claimant has died,
and we are left with a number of siblings, it will be difficult for the
Minister to interpret what that person would have wished. However, I
hope that the Minister will clarify some of the issues, particularly in
relation to subsections (3)(b) and (5).</div>

Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): I welcome you to
the Chair, Mr. Taylor, and I pay tribute to the hon.
Gentleman. He says that he is not expert in these matters, but he has
been extremely diligent in working on them in the House over a number
of years, and most of us would certainly regard him as far more of an
expert than we are.</div>
					<a name="07101663000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition Members very much
welcome the proposals. It is the Opposition&#146;s job to oppose
where we think that the Government have got things wrong, and we have
done so constructively on quite a few occasions with regard to this
Bill. However, the provisions before us are a very worthwhile
solution&#151;indeed, they have been described as a creative
solution&#151;to the problems raised by an extremely distressing
disease.</div>
					<a name="07101663000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
briefly put on the record the scope of what we are talking about. The
Library note tells us that there were 1,969 mesothelioma deaths in
Great Britain in 2004, and that is expected to rise to about 2,400
deaths a year by 2013, before coming down to perhaps 500 deaths a year
by 2050. It is quite important for the Committee to realise that
although no employers today are&#151;let us hope&#151;putting
workers or those who live near their premises at risk of mesothelioma,
the legacy of such problems will be with us for a long time to come and
there is a considerable tail.</div>
					<a name="07101663000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly welcome the fact
that clause 41 breaks the strict link that used to exist in respect of
having an occupation and being an employee. For the first time, lump
sum payments will unquestionably cover family members, such as wives
who washed overalls or children who went in the bath just after the
worker&#146;s wife had washed the overalls in it&#151;indeed, a
constituent told me that she used to go in the bath just after her
father&#146;s overalls had been washed in it. Also covered are people
who lived next to relevant premises. They were not family members, but
they had the misfortune to live or perhaps play next to a factory that
was putting them at risk of mesothelioma.</div>
					<a name="07101663000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also welcome particularly the
speed with which it is intended the payments will be made. It is
perhaps worth putting on the record once more the fact that, once
diagnosed, mesothelioma is generally fatal within 12 to 18 months. It
is intended that payments will be made within six weeks of diagnosis.
That is an ambitious target but, given the distressing speed with which
the disease moves, it is right that we aim for such a speed of
payment.</div>

					<a name="07101663000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I echo the
question about subsection (3)(b). It states that regulations</div>
					<a name="07101663000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may prescribe different amounts
for different cases or classes of cases or for different

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000384"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I shall take that on board. You can be my campaign
manager.</div>
					<a name="07101663000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
clause. I have been a Member of the House for only a few years, but I
know that the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone has been a
stalwart on the mesothelioma issue. In my short time as a member of the
asbestos sub-group of the all-party occupational safety and health
group, I have seen the hard work that is done on the matter. I am also
grateful to the Ministers who came up with the clause last year, when
we were dealing with the Law Lords&#146; decision. The clause deals
with some of the issues that arose in the courts by extending
the availability of compensation and by ensuring that compensation is
dealt with more
quickly.</div>
					<a name="07101663000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was an asbestos factory in my constituency&#151;at the time, it was
the world&#146;s largest&#151;and it is a sad fact that within the
community of Rochdale, more people are suffering from mesothelioma on a
daily basis, and that will be the case for the foreseeable
future.</div>
					<a name="07101663000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone has said, there is no doubt
that although the process was well meaning, it was painful and
protracted. It resulted in massive payments to lawyers, and it often
did not benefit the people for whom it was designed. The clause will
extend entitlement and ensure that money is paid more quickly, which is
right and proper. Many people outside the House will be reassured by
this Government
measure.</div>
					<a name="07101663000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
seek clarification from the Minister on a couple of points. First, as
has been mentioned by the hon. Members for Barnsley, West and Penistone
and for South-West Bedfordshire, the issues of classes, amounts and
cases will be dealt with in regulation, and I hope that the Minister
will give us some detail on how that will operate. I have been asked to
ask the Minister for a reassurance that the 1979 Act payments, and the
arrangements to uprate them, will not be affected by the new
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07101663000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is about recovery. There is concern that millions of pounds of
1979 Act payments have been wrongly credited to employers and insurers
over the years, and the Bill does not allow for the repayment of such
moneys. The Bill ought to deal with that issue, so that decent payments
are made under the new scheme. Will the Minister respond to those two
concerns?</div>
					<a name="07101663000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000385"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:
						</b> I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship
again this morning, Mr. Taylor. I want to echo the comments
made by colleagues: although the Bill is principally about the reform
of our child maintenance system, it is entirely appropriate that we
have managed to use the opportunity of early legislation to deal with
an issue that has long been a source of great concern to colleagues
from all parties. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>hope that colleagues will also forgive me if I
highlight the role played by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley,
West and Penistone. He has been a doughty champion of the cause over
many years, and I welcome his support and comments. It was entirely
appropriate of him to highlight the fact that those changes have been
welcomed by the trade union movement and those who have represented
workers like him over a long period of
time.</div>
					<a name="07101663000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
colleagues have already mentioned, mesothelioma is one of the diseases
covered by the 1979 Act. It is fatal and is caused by exposure to
asbestos. As far as anyone is aware, there is no known cause of diffuse
mesothelioma apart from exposure to asbestos and, as the hon. Member
for South-West Bedfordshire has said, that exposure can be second or
third hand. I want to thank him for his comments in support of this set
of changes. He said that prognosis means that people can live between
12 and 18 months, but the average life expectancy is eight to nine
months. It is a savage condition that takes people very quickly from
this life, which is why we wanted to get the measure on the statute
book as quickly as
possible.</div>
					<a name="07101663000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
colleagues have highlighted, one in 100 men born between 1940 and 1950
will die of the disease&#151;the disease mainly, although obviously
not exclusively, affects men. We are dealing with a horrific situation.
Some sufferers of mesothelioma are not entitled to a lump sum payment
under the 1979 Act, because of the work link that hon. Members have
mentioned.</div>
					<a name="07101663000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me pick
up on a couple of specific questions. My hon. Friend the Member for
Barnsley, West and Penistone asked how the payments would be laid out.
Payments will be tapered according to age. It is right that payments
are weighted to compensate for the poor prognosis associated with
mesothelioma for those who are younger at the time they are diagnosed
and who will die at a younger age as a
consequence.</div>
					<a name="07101663000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
concerns have been raised about cases with more than one claimant,
particularly when the principal claimant has died. I share my hon.
Friend&#146;s view that we want to keep the involvement of
lawyers&#151;with the greatest of respect to the hon. Member for
Angus, although I do not know why we always say. &#147;With the
greatest of respect to lawyers&#148;&#151;and legal intervention to
a minimum. This is about getting compensation payments as quickly as
possible to the individuals concerned. If the claimant dies between
claiming a payment and the payment being made&#151;we are committed
to turning the payments round within six weeks&#151;the payment will
be made to their estate, which will then be decided as usual. If there
is no will, the normal probate rules will apply. Having said that, I
cannot give a categorical assurance that there will not be
circumstances in which there is legal intervention on behalf of one
member of a family or
another.</div>
					<a name="07101663000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Angus will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that the
rules of probate in Scotland are slightly different from the rules in
England&#151;I am probably venturing into territory where I should
not have put my toe in the
water.</div>
					<a name="07101663000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000386"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> There is no probate in Scotland&#151;it is called
confirmation&#151;but the same basic rules apply: things are divided
between the children. In Scotland, at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>least, there are strict rules, and it would be difficult, in the absence
of a will, for one child to get a different split. I do not know
whether that applies in
England.</div>
					<a name="07101663000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000387"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:
						</b> There may be some legal argy-bargy here, because
there is at least one lawyer on the Labour Back Benches. All I am
saying is that we want to get the money to the claimant as quickly as
possible. If the claimant dies, we are bound by the normal rules. We
hope that there are very few circumstances in which there would be
legal intervention, but the legal involvement on how things are sorted
out would probably occur within the
family.</div>
					<a name="07101663000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Colleagues
also asked about the entitlement of dependants and how they would be
paid. We shall follow the procedure laid out in the 1979 Act, and only
one category of dependants can qualify for a payment under the Act. The
dependants would qualify in the following order: the wife or husband or
civil partner who was living with, or who was maintained by, the person
with mesothelioma; children, meaning children under the age of 16;
children under the age of 21 who are not receiving wages from full-time
employment; and children of any age who are permanently unable to
support themselves. Then it would be a person living with the person
with mesothelioma as if they were husband and wife, or as if they were
civil partners, and any other relatives who are completely or mostly
dependent on the person with mesothelioma immediately before their
death, which mirrors the situation in the 1979
Act.</div>
					<a name="07101663000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Rochdale asked whether the 1979 Act payments would continue to be
uprated. Yes, I can confirm that they will
be.</div>
					<a name="07101663000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is estimated
that up to 600 people who do not currently receive help from the
Government will receive an estimated &#163;6,000 on average during
the first year of operation of the new scheme. Hon. Members on both
sides of the Committee recognise that no amount of money will ever
compensate individuals and families for the suffering and loss caused
by mesothelioma, but those who are suffering deserve some form
of monetary compensation as quickly as possible. We need to get that
money out as quickly as possible before it is too late, which is why we
are acting within the terms of this legislation to put in place a
scheme that will meet those
needs.</div>
					<a name="07101663000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
often discuss our industrial heritage, when we look at the wonderful
industrial buildings around Britain, we must recognise that those
buildings were built on the foundation of workers, many of whom are now
paying a dear price for having been part of that regeneration,
certainly after the second world war. I therefore thank hon. Members
for their
support.</div>
					<a name="07101663000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000388"></a>Mr.
Clapham:
						</b> The Minister has mentioned that the average
payment will be in the region of &#163;6,000, but there is, of
course, the additional weekly payment of industrial injuries
disablement benefit, which is paid at 100 per cent., which is about
&#163;140.</div>
					<a name="07101663000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000389"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:
						</b> My hon. Friend is correct. As I have
said&#151;I do not want to repeat this endlessly&#151;we want to
get the compensation payment out to people quickly, so that they are
not left wanting at a point in their lives 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>when they just need recognition not only of their suffering but of the
things that they must do in the last few months of their lives without
experiencing the complications involved in gaining compensation. It is
a self-funding programme. Money is recoverable through other
compensation, when insurance pays out and so on, but it is a
significant step&#151;a great step&#151;in the right direction. I
thank hon. Members on both sides of the Committee for their support for
this part of the Bill, notwithstanding, as I was about to say, that
they might want to raise some issues of
detail.</div>

						</b> Obviously, with your approval, Mr.

in whose name amendment No. 148 has been
tabled.</div>
					<a name="07101663000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two
Government amendments make it clear that the Government may, as
necessary, introduce regulations setting out the connections with the
United Kingdom that a person with mesothelioma must have in order for
them, or their dependants, to be able to receive a lump sum payment
under the new scheme. The amendments make it clear that regulations may
be made, depending on whether it is necessary to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07101663000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to ensure
that payments from the new scheme are available to those who have
contracted mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos in the
United Kingdom. I make it clear that we do not expect people exposed
abroad, or their dependants, to travel to the UK just to claim the
payment or to make a claim from abroad. If we have evidence that the
system is being used in that way, however, we want the power in
regulations in order to deal with it. We do not anticipate any
difficulties in that respect, but we feel that it is entirely
appropriate that we take such an enabling power in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07101663000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000393"></a>Mr.
Clapham:
						</b> Such cases crop up from time to time. You may
have come across cases in your constituency, Mr. Taylor,
given that it is a mining constituency, in which people have moved
abroad and then been diagnosed with a disease for which compensation is

<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>available, such as under the chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease scheme. The Minister might be aware that under that
scheme there is a procedure whereby medical reports from abroad are the
accepted basis for determining a diagnosis. Presumably, she would work
in a similar way, because it is no use inventing the wheel twice. If
the procedure under the COPD scheme is working well, maybe the
Department should look at it as a way in which to deal with cases from
abroad in relation to payments under the scheme that we are discussing
here.</div>

							<a name="07101663000394"></a>Mrs.

industrial injuries benefits still have a work component, as I think
that he recognises. If a person has contracted mesothelioma through
another route, they are not entitled to the industrial injuries benefit
that he mentioned earlier. Certainly, however, I shall reflect on the
point that he made about not reinventing the wheel, because not doing
so is a valuable rule to
follow.</div>

an asbestos plant, are covered, and to avoid the equivalent of benefit
tourists&#151;if I am allowed to use that phrase. They are people
with no connection to the UK who travel here to gain a lump sum. People
working in the dockyards in Gibraltar would be covered because it is a

who contracts mesothelioma as a result of that employment and cannot
claim through their own country, should be able 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>to access a compensation scheme. As Gibraltar is a dependent territory,

					<a name="07101663000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are three
types of case about which I am not quite clear, and I shall ask the
Minister to elaborate on them. First, there is the case of a British
worker who spends their entire life working here in the UK, contracts
mesothelioma from their employment and then retires to Spain. Will that
person still be covered? I believe that that was the question that the

						</b> May I refine my hon. Friend&#146;s point? There
might at least be the potential for a distinction between countries of
the European Union and countries outwith it&#151;I am thinking, for

matter.</div>

experience on such matters. At this point, I am perhaps beginning to
have a bit more sympathy for the Minister than I should, because I know
we are posing a complicated set of questions, but they are incredibly
important. If she cannot give the details that we seek, will she assure
us that she will write to all members of the Committee, so that we are
clear about them?</div>
					<a name="07101663000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Case
one was the retired worker going to Spain or wherever. Case two is the
worker in the British Crown dependency of Gibraltar or one of the
sovereign base areas in Cyprus, for example, who has perhaps worked for
the British armed forces for all their life. Case three is someone who
worked, for example, for Rio Tinto in Zambia. As I understand it, under
amendment No. 148 Rio Tinto would be considered as a company based in
the UK, but I do not believe that the intention behind the Bill is that
a Zambian working for a subsidiary of Rio Tinto in Zambia, under a
Zambian contract of employment and Zambian law, should be able to come
and claim a lump sum payment here in the UK. With respect to the hon.
Member for Rochdale, that would probably be the result of that
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07101663000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Considering those three generic
cases and the possible refinement for the EU that my hon. Friend the
Member for Daventry mentioned in relation to case one, I should be
grateful if the Minister could give the Committee some
clarification.</div>
					<a name="07101663000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000401"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> We have had a good rattle on some complicated and
sensitive issues, because I am quite sure that the Committee is at one
in not wanting to exclude anybody who has a material connection with
the United
Kingdom.</div>
					<a name="07101663000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most of the
points have already been made, but I would at least like to get the
Minister&#146;s assurance that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div>she will reflect on the situation where there is a Crown employment
connection but that connection has not necessarily been established in
a British colony or a British territory. For example, at one stage we
had, controversially, a British naval dockyard at
Simonstown in South Africa, which was not, I think, a British
territory, although it was part of the Commonwealth at that time. We
need to be absolutely sure that we are covering everybody who has, in
effect, been working in the service of this country, wherever that may
have been, or indeed their dependants.</div>
					<a name="07101663000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">That prompts my second
question. There is a reference in the helpful explanatory notes on
secondary legislation, which have been circulated to members of the
Committee, to the fact that a person with mesothelioma would not be
entitled to a lump sum payment, if they were eligible for a payment for
the same disease under the MOD&#146;s war pension scheme or the armed
forces compensation scheme. I suspect that few of us would wish to sit
an exam on the details of those schemes, but would the Minister at
least undertake to go away and check
them?</div>
					<a name="07101663000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
from the way in which the clause is written that the Minister&#146;s
new scheme, which we have all welcomed, is designed to pick up people
who are otherwise left out. In a case of secondary
contamination&#151;for instance, the contamination of the wife or
partner of a service person who might be compensated under the war
pension scheme&#151;they would be eligible under this scheme and not
under the MOD scheme. Given that we are anxious to avoid any possible
omissions, will the Minister at least undertake to ensure that anyone
who is a dependant is not ruled out, perhaps by the terms of the MOD
scheme, from claiming because they are not the person who was directly
employed in Crown service?</div>
					<a name="07101663000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000402"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:
						</b> As hon. Members have graciously recognised, there
has been a series of detailed questions, some of which I will be able
to give a response to this morning; others I will answer by writing to
all members of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07101663000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some areas, I will be able
to give some comfort to hon. Members. I reiterate that the principal
aim of the new scheme is to make lump sum payments quickly to those
people who are not currently eligible, as the hon. Member for Daventry
has rightly recognised, for help from the Government. We aim to fund
this new scheme by recovering lump sump payments from any later award
of civil damages. That means that people who have been exposed to
asbestos, or who currently cannot claim compensation under the
Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146; Compensation) Act 1979, would
receive compensation.</div>
					<a name="07101663000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have limited funds for the
scheme, as I think all colleagues have recognised, and we think it
right that those funds should be used to pay compensation to people
with links to the UK who have contracted mesothelioma. We have
obviously taken the power in the Bill to do
that.</div>
					<a name="07101663000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like all hon.
Members, I have every sympathy for anyone who has contracted
mesothelioma, which is a terrible condition, while working
abroad&#151;they may even have been working for a UK-based
company&#151;but, frankly, we simply cannot afford to pay people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div>from abroad compensation from this scheme. I know that there is a slight
refinement in the amendment, as the hon. Gentleman indicated in his
contribution to the debate, but I do not think that the UK taxpayer
should be expected to pick up that bill, albeit that we have every
sympathy for the individual concerned. If a person is exposed to
asbestos abroad due to the negligence of their employer, then, within
the parameters of their own country or of the country in which they are
resident, they need to examine whether there are compensation
schemes.</div>
					<a name="07101663000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I deal
with some of the specific issues? The hon. Member for Daventry asked
whether, if the wife of a member of service personnel or other MOD
personnel were not entitled to compensation under the MOD scheme, they
would be able to claim for compensation under this scheme. I say to the
hon. Gentleman and other colleagues that the test for exclusion will be
the entitlement to the MOD
scheme.</div>
				
					<a name="07101663000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07101663000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the issue of
civilians who work abroad, albeit in what might previously have been
described as British dependencies, foreign civilians who work for UK
companies will not be entitled to compensation unless they have some
other UK link such as residence. The issue of people who retire abroad
was mentioned by two or three hon. Members. If the exposure was in the
UK, and those people retired abroad, they would be entitled to payment
under the scheme. The link is the UK. We do not believe that the
existence of the scheme will encourage people to travel to the UK, and
that point was affirmed by the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire.</div>
					<a name="07101663000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Rochdale asked some very specific questions about MOD
staff working abroad in Gibraltar, and somebody else mentioned Malta.
The situation is complicated by bases that were not entirely part of
the UK, such as Simonstown. We shall make a payment from the new
mesothelioma scheme in cases where the MOD will not pay, because
exposure did not occur in service. I hope that that clarifies the
position. I was asked whether people can claim if they are diagnosed
with mesothelioma caused during service in the armed forces. If the
condition was caused during service before 6 April 2005, ex-service
personnel can claim under the war pensions scheme, to which no time
limits apply. If the condition was caused during service on or after
that date, a claim can be made by both serving and ex-service personnel
under the armed forces compensation scheme. I hope that that covers
most of the issues of detail that hon. Members have highlighted. I urge
the hon. Member for Rochdale not to press his amendment. Although he
clarified the thinking behind it, it is of much wider scope than the
points that he mentioned.</div>

that I was concerned about are very specific. I do not want any
extension of the provisions to British companies operating
abroad&#151;clearly, none of us want that&#151;so I shall not press

					<a name="07101663000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment probes the conditions for the entitlement of dependent
persons, and it draws attention to certain family situations. The
Minister may wish to explain the working of entitlement but, as far as
I can make out, subsection 2(a) restricts the payment of a sum under
subsection (3) to dependants in cases in which a payment has not yet
been made to the individual who is ill.</div>
					<a name="07101663000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">What would happen if a payment
was made to a sick person or to a dependant, but later an application
was made by another dependant, who would not be entitled to even a
small payment under the Bill? The provision is concerned only with the
initial claim and with a payment split between the
sufferer and their dependants. If another dependant made a claim, they
would not be entitled to payment, so will the Minister explain how the
arrangements for the sick person and their dependants will operate?
Furthermore, if a dependant receives a part-payment, and is shown to be
suffering from mesothelioma because of previous occupational hazards,
including secondary contact such as washing overalls, will they be
entitled to a separate payment under subsection (1) if they have
already received a dependant&#146;s payment? People are not eligible
for payment if they are eligible for compensation after making a civil
claim. That is fair, but what happens if a civil claim takes too long
to process, or if someone appeals against the decision? As we know,
people can die very quickly from mesothelioma. Can we introduce a
system whereby they receive a payment under the Bill while they await
the outcome of civil
litigation?</div>

						</b> I have rather more sympathy for amendment No. 147
than for amendment No. 148, although I accept what the hon. Member for
Rochdale was aiming to achieve. Amendment No. 147 is sensible, because
it appears from clause 42(2)(a) that a dependant could lose out if
another dependant, the deceased, or the deceased&#146;s personal
representative has received a payment. I hope that the Minister can
clarify the
position.</div>

that the hon. Member for Rochdale is on to something. As he and I
understand subsection (2)(a), a dependant could lose out if another
dependant, the deceased or the deceased&#146;s personal
representative has been paid. They would not receive payment, and I do
not believe that that is the intention of this part of the Bill. On
page 55 of the explanatory notes, there is a list of dependants who can
claim, which the Minister read out in a previous debate. It
gives categories of dependants, including children under 16, children
under 21, and children of any age. It makes it clear that the provision
applies to more than one dependant. However, a literal interpretation
of subsection (2)(a) suggests that other dependants could lose
out.</div>

do so quickly. It is not the intention to make more than one lump-sum
payment to a family, as we would be compensating the same family more
than once. As the hon. Member for Angus said, it would duplicate
compensation. I said earlier that the scheme is self-financing. If we

would receive a payment, and if a person in his household later
developed a disease, they would be able to claim a payment, because it
would be a separate case. Is that how the Minister sees
it?</div>

in danger of arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of
this particular pin. Obviously, there is a relationship between
claimants and dependants, but as my hon. Friend said, a dependant could
also make an independent claim in their own right for contracting
mesothelioma. They would therefore have the right to pursue
compensation over and above their right as a dependant.</div>
					<a name="07101663000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am still at something of a

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000419"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> One of the distressing by-products of having
taken a substantial part in discussing the Mental Capacity Act 2005 is
that there is an almost irresistible temptation to refer to it in other
Committees. I do so briefly this morning and, I hope,
helpfully&#151;I think that the Government&#146;s intentions are
entirely clear&#151;because I would like to flag up one or two points
arising from my experience of that very sensible legislation.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>
					<a name="07101663000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I would like to draw a
distinction, although it appears that the cases are similar, between
those identified in subsection (1). A person under 18 will never have
had the capacity of disposing of substantial assets of the order of the
&#163;6,000 lump sum or, even as a dependant, a proportion of that,
which the Minister has already indicated, whereas a person who lacks
mental capacity may have been able to make that kind of disposition in
the past.</div>
					<a name="07101663000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mention
this matter to the Minister because there were some cases during the
passage of the 2005 Act in which it was clear that the Department had a
somewhat different set of criteria from those that were applied by the
now Ministry of Justice in relation to mental capacity. For example,
there were rather parallel systems in operation in relation to
appointed persons who could receive a benefit on behalf of
somebody.</div>
					<a name="07101663000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
remind the Minister that the 2005 Act does not provide a definitive
test for all matters at all times and it may vary according to the
circumstances. The difficulties of this are, first, trying to determine
whether the financial matters are sufficiently large for the person not
to have mental capacity, and, secondly, whether at the particular time
it is relevant, because a person can recover their mental capacity
whatever their physical condition. That, therefore, produces some
difficulty about the test in paragraph (b), because we need to know
that the person does not have mental capacity in relation to financial
matters. Had I had the time and inclination, I would have tabled a
probing amendment with the wording, &#147;financial matters relevant
to the lump sum&#148;. It would also have suggested that we should be
aware of the fact that the person could recover their capacity
subsequently.</div>
					<a name="07101663000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leads me on to the second half of my argument&#151;I am leading up to
a particular point that I want the Minister at least to entertain in
relation to the appointment of trustees. I mentioned appointed persons
under the social security legislation and how they differ from the
various persons who can be appointed under the 2005 Act. The proposal
in this case is that the Secretary of State will appoint such trustees
as are clearly appropriate. I have no doubt whatever that that could be
done and would normally work perfectly well. The Secretary of State
will also be able to specify trusts that are appropriate to the case.
Those who are more familiar than I am with compensation matters will
know that that kind of thing happens all the time in the private
sector&#151;for example, in relation to road accident damages.
However, within the mental capacity legislation, there is the
opportunity for a person, while they have capacity, to appoint someone
as their attorney under a lasting power of attorney.</div>
					<a name="07101663000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that mainly concerns
me is that if that person is competent&#151;there is no reason to
think that they would not be, although they might not be because the
sum could be bigger than any that they have ever had to
handle&#151;there is no reason to think that they should not be the
natural person to be the trustee for the Department for handling that
lump sum. They may be handling other assets that the person has
available under the terms of their lasting power of attorney. They
could receive and handle those perfectly well. I shall put it another
way. If a set of trustees handled other assets, represented by the
attorney holder, and a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>different set handled these assets, that might not lead to the best use
of the assets overall and might give rise to friction.</div>
					<a name="07101663000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those possibilities exist
within the mental capacity legislation. We do not need a definitive
answer on that from the Minister today, but I hope that she will have
regard to what is done in relation to that and try, as far as possible,
to marry the two systems, using the people who may already be
competently in place and who could handle perfectly well this other,
somewhat sad duty of receiving and dealing with a lump sum on behalf of
the person who has lost
capacity.</div>

							<a name="07101663000420"></a>Mrs.

						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his thoughtful and
helpful comments. The Bill&#146;s provisions mirror the 1979 Act,
which predated the Mental Capacity Act 2005. He made some interesting
points, including those relating to whether a person recovers capacity,
the appointment of trustees and the power of attorney&#151;that, as I
understand it, is something that a person sorts out before they have
lost capacity.</div>
					<a name="07101663000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is certainly designed to ensure that someone who lacks capacity
is protected. It also safeguards the rights of other beneficiaries by
allowing the Secretary of State to appoint trustees and make a payment
to them to hold for the benefit of the beneficiary. The hon. Gentleman
made some interesting and detailed points and, although I do not wish
to pursue them now, we will certainly reflect on whether there are
further implications for the legislation as it
stands.</div>

Selous:
						</b> Clause 49 is extremely important and deals with
how the money will be provided for the lump sum payments that the
Department will pay out up 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>front. If Committee members read clause 49 in full, they will see that
lump sum payments that are paid out promptly&#151;within six weeks,
we hope, of diagnosis&#151;are to be recovered from subsequent
compensation payments made either by solvent employers or by insurers,
should those employers choose to claim against their insurance policies
or should the employer have become insolvent. It is an extremely
important aspect of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07101663000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall refer briefly to
remarks that the Minister made in an earlier debate. I think she said
words along the lines of, &#147;We do not have enough money to pay
everyone.&#148; I may have misquoted her slightly, but it was
something similar.</div>

							<a name="07101663000424"></a>Mrs.

slightly misunderstood her, so I apologise.</div>
					<a name="07101663000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is none the less important
that we understand the mechanism that the Government
use&#151;absolutely rightly&#151;in the clause.
It involves using the compensation payments from solvent employers and
their insurers, or from the insurers of insolvent employers, to
compensate the Department&#151;quite rightly&#151;for the money
that it pays out quickly up front, and about which we are all
pleased.</div>
					<a name="07101663000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
21 is part of my attempts to be helpful, and I hope that the Minister
will recognise its spirit and intention. It would have two benefits. It
would benefit the sufferers of mesothelioma, because when an amount
greater than the lump sum payment is payable by the employer or by
their insurer, the new clause would speed up the compensation payment
process. If there were any excess over and above the lump sum, it would
get it to the sufferer more quickly. At the same time, it would come to
the aid of the poor, beleaguered public purse&#151;the finances of
the Department for which the Minister is responsible&#151;because it
deals with the mechanism whereby the Department gets back the money for
paying out the lump sum.</div>
					<a name="07101663000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a news release from the
Department on 20 July 2006, no less a person than the former Secretary
of State said:</div>
					<a name="07101663000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are also continuing
the essential work that is ongoing to speed up the full compensation
payments due to many sufferers and their families through the civil
claims process&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07101663000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
words were very welcome and important, but it is not clear whether the
Bill includes anything to aid that process. The new clause would give
the Secretary of State the reserve power, when in his or her opinion
employers or insurers were dragging their feet and not responding, to
make a charge on them to ensure that they responded in a timely manner
to inquiries.</div>
					<a name="07101663000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause was tabled in part because of my constituency experience, which
I am sure is mirrored by that of other Committee members who have found
employers and insurers incredibly slow and unresponsive when dealing
with such claims, whether they are for mesothelioma or for similar
issues. It gives 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>me no pleasure to say that, because my background is in insurance.
Before I came into the House, I was a chartered insurer, and I am
generally extremely proud of the British insurance industry. It makes a
major contribution to our balance of payments and the public purse, and
it does a tremendous amount of good throughout the world. I spoke to
the Association of British Insurers before tabling the new clause, and
I know that it, too, seeks to guard the good reputation of the
insurance industry.</div>
					<a name="07101663000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07101663000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister will look sympathetically at the new clause. My experience as
a constituency MP is that it is almost impossible to get movement on
some cases. We know that the former Secretary of State was exercised
about such matters. The new clause gives the Department a stick with
which to prod or cajole employers or insurers as and when
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07101663000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000426"></a>Mr.
Clapham:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I raise two points on clause 49, in
particular in relation to subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b) of proposed new
section 1A. Some of the responses that I received from the Association
of Personal Injury Lawyers relate to the recouping under subsection
(3)(a) of compensation paid to dependants of the deceased. The
association points out a conflict with the Fatal Accidents Act 1976,
saying that when assessing damages in respect of a person&#146;s
death under that Act certain other benefits are disregarded. It feels
that in cases of mesothelioma we should also disregard the recouping of
payments made to dependants.</div>
					<a name="07101663000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point is about
proposed new subsection (3)(b), under which recovery can be made from
the injured person&#146;s compensation. It can result in the entire
payment being recouped. In a previous life, I heard of cases in which
recoupment resulted in the special damage element being completely
taken, but never has it taken any of the general damage element. It is
possible under proposed new paragraph (b) that money could be recouped
from general damages&#151;payment for pain and suffering. Again,
there is a conflict with the civil law.</div>
					<a name="07101663000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a chance that we may
give impetus to challenges in the civil courts on the basis that some
schemes, particularly this one, allow for general damages to be
recouped. Until now, they have been sacrosanct. Will the Minister
reflect on that? We do not want to create a situation in which general
damages that are normally ring-fenced in civil litigation are likely to
be taken. That would be the thin end of the wedge, and it is likely to
be challenged. Reflection is needed.</div>
					<a name="07101663000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">One other point relates to the
amendments that the Government are thinking of making to the Social
Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1977 in relation to proposed new
subsection (3)(e). They say that they want to be able to review
certificates of lump sum payments in a similar way to certificates for
recoverable benefits. They also say that they want to recover lump sums
from compensation when a claimant receives any of several prescribed
payments. One of those is payments made under the 1974 coal
workers&#146; pneumoconiosis scheme. I am aware that there will be
circumstances in which a person may have two claims. A person who can
claim under the 1974 scheme may be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>able to claim also under the 1979 scheme. That has been the situation
since the demise of British Coal in 2004.</div>
					<a name="07101663000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">A person who makes a claim
under the 1974 scheme before making another under the 1979 scheme is
precluded from using the 1979 Act on the grounds of being in receipt of
compensation. One of the provisions of the 1979 Act is that a person
who has received compensation cannot claim under that Act. There is a
procedure to follow in making both claims: a pneumoconiotic must claim
under the 1979 Act before claiming under the 1974 scheme, to get both
payments. </div>
					<a name="07101663000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern
is about the circumstances in which payments will be reclaimed under
the 1974 scheme. For example, I can envisage that a dependant of a
deceased person who did not make a claim during his life might make a
claim under the 1974 scheme, and at the same time have a claim under
the 1979 scheme&#151;the new 1979 scheme, which we are talking about.
That would occur because mesothelioma is a cancer caused by asbestos
and asbestosis is a form of pneumoconiosis. It is defined under the
1974 scheme. A miner, for example, can claim under the 1974 scheme if
he has developed an asbestos-induced disease; at the same time, as I
have said, since 2004 the same miner has been able to claim under the
more recent scheme.</div>
					<a name="07101663000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can see that a situation might arise in which a dependant would make
both possible claims. Is it in such a circumstance that the Minister
envisages recouping the 1974 payment, rather than in a living case? I
should have thought that the matter moves outside the relevant scope
when we relate the Act in question to a living case<i class="I">.</i> She will
know of moves that are, I understand, afoot to review the whole of the
pneumoconiosis scheme. I do not know whether that will happen sooner or
later, but will she clarify the circumstances in
which we shall recoup 1974 pneumoconiosis scheme
payments?</div>
					<a name="07101663000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000427"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I was going to echo the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points in connection with representations submitted by APIL. The main
guiding principle should be that whatever is contemplated, it should
not strike differentially between the two different arrangements; it
should be on the same basis as the civil compensation scheme, both in
relation to the treatment of dependants and in relation to any
recovery, or non-recovery, of general damages. I think that that is a
good principle, so I shall not go on about it.</div>
					<a name="07101663000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to say a word or
two in support of the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for South-West Bedfordshire about information. It is clearly important,
and, when I looked into the matter in detail, I found that a number of
employers clearly did not have particularly good employment records,
and several insurers, no doubt for their own reasons&#151;it may or
may not have been intentional&#151;did not have very good records of
coverage either.</div>
					<a name="07101663000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
can also affect what might, in shorthand, be called compliant
employers, or compliant employer liability insurers. One of my worries
when the Government moved, in effect, to say that they would reverse
the court judgment and make any insurer liable for its part in the
scheme, was that if only one employer, and possibly only one employer
liability 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>insurer, could be identified&#151;even if that employer had employed
the person who contracted the disease for only a week in a career of 40
years, and even if the illness was not directly attributable to that
week&#151;it could in principle be liable for the whole quantum of
compensation.</div>
					<a name="07101663000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not clear about what stage that proposal is at now, but it would be
very inequitable if that state of affairs came about, and no one in the
Committee wants to create a situation of inequity. It is clearly right
that all the insurers that are involved over a person&#146;s career
should be engaged and should take their proportionate share of the
liability, if that is possible&#151;or at least broadly so. Perhaps
the Minister can respond to my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns, which are
set out well in his new clause, and give us a slightly more general
appreciation of the problem, which has troubled me for a number of
years.</div>
					<a name="07101663000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000428"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> As always, my hon. Friend is absolutely right.
There is a large issue in respect of incomplete or poor record keeping
and an issue about someone who has a work history over many years, with
perhaps one employer or one insurer being asked to take an unfair
burden in contrast with their share of
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="07101663000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 21 does not really deal with either of those issues; it would
give the Department&#151;the Secretary of State&#151;a reserve
power where it is clear who the employer was. I have a constituency
case where a gentleman worked for 35 years for one employer, knee-deep
in asbestos, and he cannot get past his employer to get on to his
insurer. That offends me hugely and it offends a profession that I was
proud to be part of before I came into the
House.</div>

Boswell:
						</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s clarification is useful.
There are both specific and, if I may say so in the terms of earlier
remarks, general issues of concern about ensuring that the burdens fall
where they properly should and that delinquent
employers and/or insurers&#151;they may not be all of them or any of
them&#151;should be identified wherever possible and encouraged to
pay their proper share of the burden. Perhaps the Minister will
enlighten us on how she is getting on with
that.</div>
					<a name="07101663000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000432"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:
						</b> I thank hon. Members for a complicated and
detailed discussion. On pulling out the detail, we
will hopefully have a greater understanding of the Bill and where we
are going with
it.</div>
					<a name="07101663000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire, whose new clause was
tabled in a spirit of opening up the dialogue about how we speed up
compensation and pursue claims through the normal compensation process
in the courts, if that is necessary. I think that all of us would agree
that civil compensation can be a pretty 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>long process, because there are so many arguments to consider. The key
thing in terms of the process is to get the decision
right.</div>
					<a name="07101663000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying
to streamline the process, especially for those suffering with
mesothelioma. The new scheme is, as I have said on previous occasions
this morning, designed to get some funds quickly at the point of
diagnosis of mesothelioma, or as near to it as possible. In relation to
the civil claims for compensation&#151;the hon. Gentleman highlighted
this&#151;the civil procedure rules, the practice directions and the
pre-action protocols prescribe the time scales within which actions
must be carried out, so there is already a process in place. The court
can currently apply sanctions where those procedures are not complied
with. It would not be appropriate for the Secretary of State to levy
charges in these circumstances. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman
has tabled the new clause in the spirit of trying to encourage greater
speediness in dealing with relevant cases, but it would not be
appropriate to levy
charges.</div>
					<a name="07101663000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both insurers
and personal injury lawyers have been helpful in looking at ways in
which we can speed up some of the processes, particularly in relation
to mesothelioma. I fully understand that there is
frustration when cases seem to take for ever, but although the hon.
Gentleman has tabled his new clause in the spirit of being helpful, I
am not sure that that would have the desired result and I urge him to
ask leave to withdraw
it.</div>
					<a name="07101663000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend asked about the recovery of payments under the 1979 Act and
the new mesothelioma scheme. As he recognises, the lump sum payments
are made in lieu of compensation. We want the compensators to be able
to deduct the amount of the lump sum payment that they are required to
repay to the Department for Work and Pensions from any part of the
compensation award, including general damages, which are highlighted
specifically for pain and
suffering.</div>
				
					<a name="07101663000330"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07101663000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we attach
the lump sum payment to a particular head of damage, the sufferers or
their dependants could be doubly compensated and, as we made clear
earlier and has been accepted by all sides, we do not want double
compensation to be possible. There are no plans for recoverable
benefits to be recovered from the general heads of
damages.</div>
					<a name="07101663000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend asked also about payments under the 1979 Act and the new
mesothelioma scheme being paid to dependants, and whether they would be
subject to compensation recovery. Payments made directly to dependants
will be subject to compensation recovery from awards made to them under
the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. Again, there are no plans for recoverable
benefits paid to the person with mesothelioma to be
recovered from the dependant or from the compensation
awarded to the dependant under that Act. I hope that I have addressed
his
concern.</div>
					<a name="07101663000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000433"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> Given that we are looking at several interactions,
may I take the Minister back to her remarks about the armed forces
compensation scheme and war pensions? She mentioned that, under the war
pensions scheme, there was no time limit on claims. Under the armed
forces compensation scheme, there is, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div>of course, a five-year time limit on claims, although there is provision
for dealing with late onset diseases. Will she confirm that
mesothelioma would be captured under that scheme and will she ensure
that it would not fall foul of the five-year time limit for
claims?</div>
					<a name="07101663000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000434"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:
						</b> I shall be pleased to come back to the hon.
Gentleman with confirmation or otherwise of that specific point, which
was slightly to the side of the
discussion.</div>
					<a name="07101663000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend also highlighted the coal workers pneumoconiosis scheme payments
in respect of the compensation recovery scheme. I hope that the
Committee will forgive me if I go into some detail on that. It is our
intention only to recover the 1979 Act payments on new scheme payments
from subsequent awards made to a person under the coal workers&#146;
pneumoconiosis scheme. That is to stop a person being compensated twice
for the same condition: from the Department for Work and Pensions under
the 1970s legislation or the new scheme and from the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Reform&#151;previously the Department of
Trade and Industry&#151;under the CWPS. We do not intend to recover
any social security benefits that a person may receive from the CWPS
awards.</div>
					<a name="07101663000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend might be aware, earlier this year BER received a
challenge from claimants&#146; representatives to the action of
denying claims to the CWPS when it was understood that a compensation
payment for pneumoconiosis had already been made under the 1979 Act.
BER&#146;s view was that paying under both schemes would effectively
be compensating claimants doubly for the same condition. Later this
year, following legal advice, it was decided that it must pay
compensation to the CWPS in such cases. As my hon. Friend is well
aware, the 1979 Act was, in fact, never intended for miners as they had
their own compensation scheme on which that Act was based. They only
became entitled to a claim under the legislation when the British Coal
Corporation was dissolved in March 2004. I hope that I have dealt with
some of the issues raised. I advise the Committee that, since June when
BER started to pay out the claims, it has only received a couple of
dozen claims to CWPS when payment has already been made under the 1979
Act.</div>
					<a name="07101663000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
broader application in respect of general damages, I shall carefully
reflect on what my hon. Friend said. I do not believe that our
proposals for lump sums have set any form of precedent. They are
intended only to apply to lump sum payments, but I shall read carefully
what he has highlighted and, if need be, we can come back to such
matters.</div>
					<a name="07101663000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 49
amends the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 to provide
regulation-making powers to the Secretary of State for the recovery of
lump sum payments. Money generated through this compensation recovery
process will be used to fund the new mesothelioma scheme so that it is
self-funding. Lump sum payments under the new scheme will initially be
based on what the level of recoveries will allow, but the payments will
increase in subsequent years as more recoveries are made. This means
that the scheme will be self-funding.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>
					<a name="07101663000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principles of the current
scheme are to be adopted for the recovery of lump sum payments and the
amount of the lump sum is to be recovered even if it reduces the civil
compensation award to nil. This does not disadvantage the sufferer or
their family in any way as the lump sum payment is paid in lieu of any
civil compensation. We are not taking money away that people would
otherwise have. Regulations falling out of this clause may also allow
for a lump sum payment made before the scheme is introduced to be
recovered from civil compensation awards made after it is introduced. I
ask the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire not to press his new
clause to a Division. Although he was trying to be helpful, there are
enough safeguards in the current system to deal with the issue that he
highlighted.</div>

							<a name="07101663000435"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for recognising my
reason for tabling the new clause. I will not press it to a vote. I
note her comments about the court being able to levy charges, which she
thought was sufficient and there was no need for the Secretary of State
to have a power. I hope that it will not try her patience if I ask her
to write to me or to the Committee&#151;or perhaps to respond later
today&#151;with some indication of the frequency with which the
courts use that power. It is all very well having a reserve power, but

Minister would have made that point, so I got there first.</div>
					<a name="07101663000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the problems with the
CSA has always been the amount of regulation, and their difficulty and
complexity. The many organisations throughout all the jurisdictions in

those regulations and the problems that have arisen under
them.</div>
					<a name="07101663000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">In drawing up
regulations for CMEC under the new Act, it would be valuable to consult
such organisations so that we might avoid some of the pitfalls that
bedevilled the CSA. I am not suggesting that the consultation continue
for ever, and I appreciate that we must come to a decision and
introduce regulations, but I want to tease out from the Minister what
consultation is being undertaken and who is being consulted. I also
want him to understand that it is useful to consult those who have
worked at the coal face over many years.</div>

							<a name="07101663000439"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for moving his
amendment. Let me say, however, that this has been one of the most
consulted-on Bills of recent years. I accept what he says about the
need to consult. He asked who has been consulted. Before the Bill went
through pre-legislative scrutiny in the Select Committee on Work and
Pensions, a list was published of all the organisations that the
Department had engaged in the consultation process, and, before that,
those consulted by David Henshaw&#146;s inquiry, which also consulted
extensively.</div>
					<a name="07101663000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the Bill&#146;s history and the route that we have taken to reach the
proposals before us, I think that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman
that there has been extensive consultation, and that consultation is by
no means finished. It will not be endless and for ever, as he
rightly said, but as CMEC comes into being and takes its early
decisions, it will still consult major stakeholders, such as One Parent
Families, Families Need Fathers, Resolution and the Child Poverty
Action Group. Many other organisations have, however, been heavily
engaged with us in the consultation process.</div>
					<a name="07101663000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is therefore
right to stress the importance of consultation. I can assure him not
only that there has been a lot of it, but that it is ongoing. However,
there is no case for including a requirement to consult in the Bill,
and I hope that he will agree to withdraw the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000444"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> We have returned to our earlier debate on my
amendment relating to minutes of agreement. I do not intend to repeat
all I said. However, it is important that minutes of agreement are
recognised, and also that the one-year time scale will seriously
undermine the take-up of such agreements. That is a shame because it is
a way for many couples, although not all couples, to deal with
their difficulties. I will support the amendment if it is pressed to a
Division.</div>
					<a name="07101663000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000445"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> As hon. Members said, we are in danger of
returning to previously visited ground. However, in view of the
indication that the amendment might get pressed to a vote, I will
respond in some detail. It is important that the matter is understood
as there may still be some misapprehensions about it.</div>
					<a name="07101663000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am going to reiterate the
points that I made on 9 October. The existing 12-month rule applies in
cases where parents have a consent order or a registered minute of
agreement made on or after 3 March 2003. It prevents parents from
applying for a maintenance calculation for the first 12 months that a
consent order or minute of agreement is in place. Variations to that
agreement during its first 12 months can only be secured by a return to
court. Once a year has expired, either parent may apply for a
maintenance calculation, thus overturning the order for the
minute.</div>
					<a name="07101663000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment is to extend that 12-month period to 48 months. It is
not the Government&#146;s intention to disrupt arrangements agreed
between parents which are working well. We want such agreements to
continue and to benefit children for as long as possible.</div>
					<a name="07101663000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 12-month rule acts as a
safety net for those parents and children whose arrangements are not
working out. There will be occasions when things go wrong&#151;an
agreement breaks down, circumstances unexpectedly change or a parent
decides that another type of arrangement would be more suitable for the
children. The 12-month rule strikes a balance between giving time for
agreed arrangements to bed in and work, and, when they do not work,
providing a readily available route to the commission so that fair
payment of maintenance can be established as soon as possible. The
amendment would lock parents into agreements that are potentially no
longer working for four years, and could leave children trapped in
inadequate arrangements, often without the money that they need.
</div>
					<a name="07101663000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000446"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> Again, I do not want to go over old ground, but I am
still not sure why the Minister keeps saying that people would be
locked into agreements. A minute of agreement would normally have a
clause for variation and, if it were not working and had clearly broken
down, it could be enforced, as I explained. Once 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>it is registered, it has the effect of a court decree. If one parent is
not following the agreement, it can be enforced against
them.</div>
					<a name="07101663000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000447"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I fear that we are going over old ground. In one
sense, the hon. Gentleman is right. If the problem has arisen with the
minute of agreement, then either party can go back to the court. The
question is about at what point we want to give parents the right of
access to the commission. Proposals such as removing the 12-month rule
potentially leave the minute of agreement in place indefinitely,
thereby effectively blocking off access to the commission. The only
means of resolving a breakdown in the agreement is by going back to the
courts. That can be both a lengthy and time-consuming process. If
parents choose to go down that route&#151;only a minority choose do
so&#151;and it becomes problematic after the agreement is initially
struck, they need to have the choice to come to the commission and have
things arranged by that means. However, if the 12 months were in lieu,
that choice is not open to
them.</div>
					<a name="07101663000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000448"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> Does the Minister not accept that in circumstances
in which there has been a lengthy battle to reach agreement on payment,
12 months is actually quite a short period? What the parent with care
and the child need is some form of stability. That 12-month agreement
does not give them long. There may have been a turbulent time in the
courts up until that period, but an agreement has been made and a
minute of agreement is in force, yet 12 months later everything is up
in the
air.</div>
					<a name="07101663000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000449"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> In one sense, the hon. Gentleman almost makes my
argument. As we were saying, the agreement may have been struck in
court at the initial point and it may endure. It may be a fine
agreement for a lengthy period. However, circumstances may change or
the agreement may break down. What offer do we make to people in those
circumstances? Are those people restricted solely and entirely to
having to go back to the courts to deal with any breakdown, or are we
giving them the option, after a time, to come to the commission? We
cannot give them the option of coming to the commission immediately
because there would be no point going to court. There has to be a time
for the agreements that have been reached in court to bed in. That is
why the 12-month rule is, in effect, a compromise between the two
positions.</div>
					<a name="07101663000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
12-month rule has another valid purpose. It encourages settlements that
contain fair levels of child maintenance broadly consistent with the
amount calculated under the statutory scheme. It therefore discourages
the old style clean-break agreements that divide up property and assets
between adults but leave children without regular payments of
maintenance.</div>
					<a name="07101663000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
performance of the Child Support Agency has been widely and often
justifiably criticised. One of the unequivocal successes of its
establishment is that from the outset it has steadily raised the
profile of child maintenance and helped to embed a cultural norm that
parents should continue to support their children whatever the
circumstances of their relationship or in the event of a
breakdown.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>
					<a name="07101663000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">During our debate on 9 October,
hon. Members implied that they felt that the 12-month rule was unfair
because it prevented clean-break child maintenance arrangements.
However, that is precisely why the 12-month rule is fair and why is
should stay. It is recognised in the legal establishment, and
increasingly in the wider society too, that while divorce or separation
in adult relationships may be arranged around a clean break, there is
no clean break for children.</div>
					<a name="07101663000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government firmly believe
that children have a right at the very least to
adequate and ongoing financial support from their parents. Adult
relationships may end, but the commitment to children does
not.</div>
					<a name="07101663000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000450"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> I shall be very brief because we have talked about
this point at great length. Although a clean-break settlement with
asset transfer takes place at a point in time, the transfer of assets
leads to a flow of financial benefits, whether it is a reduction in
expenses or some income coming in as a result. It is not the case to
say that a clean-break settlement leaves children unprovided for. It
may do, but, equally, it may not.</div>
					<a name="07101663000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000451"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The problem is that the flow is not guaranteed.
At the point of break, there may be an arrangement about the transfer
of property. It is surely impossible to determine at that point unknown
future circumstances that may significantly change the nature of that
agreement Either of the parents taking on the property may move out of
it; their circumstances may change in such a way that they have to
dispose of it; or they may amass huge debts and sell the property to
clear the debts, negating any flow of money to support the children.
That is why we want to discourage clean-break agreements, because the
one thing that needs to be done at the point of separation is to ensure
that there is an ongoing flow of maintenance for the children. We
cannot rely on circumstances that might pertain at the point of
separation; we need to nail down an arrangement that will endure for as
long as those children need it. We may be talking 10, 15 or potentially
almost 20 years. That is why clean-break agreements do not do the
business.</div>
					<a name="07101663000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07101663000452"></a>
							<b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): The Minister seems to
be implying that a maintenance arrangement based on a proportion of
someone&#146;s income is somehow much more stable than some kind of
asset transfer that will have financial yields. As we all know, it is
entirely possible for people to lose their jobs or to be made
redundant. There may be variations in someone&#146;s earning capacity
which are at least as risky&#151;perhaps even more so&#151;than the
yield on a financial investment. It is not fair to say that one is
risk-free and the other is not. In fact, both are risky, and it is at
least arguable that assets yields are substantially less risky than
career earnings.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>
					<a name="07101663000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101663000453"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The big difference is that if we begin at the
point of separation with an agreement in place, and an understanding is
arrived at on the part of both parents that an agreement needs to be in
place, there is at least an acceptance in principle that there is an
ongoing agreement to maintenance. That will need to be varied according
to varying circumstances that pertain to the parents involved, which is
why, under CMEC, we are introducing the annual review system. The hon.
Gentleman is right to say that there are risks in a maintenance-based
agreement, but the system under CMEC builds in a process for handling
that risk and underlines the principle that a flow of maintenance needs
to be in place. That is different from a clean-break agreement that
makes no specific provision for maintenance. There is an assumption
that maintenance will flow from the nature of the clean-break
agreement, but it may not. That is an important point to bear in
mind.</div>
					<a name="07101663000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clean-break
maintenance arrangements contain a high level of risk for children,
which is one reason why they do not attract the support of any of the
major stakeholders who have been involved in the discussions and
consultation about securing arrangements for CMEC. A child maintenance
arrangement may need to cover a long stretch of time,
covering the child&#146;s upbringing. During that time, unforeseen
circumstances may arise and clean-break arrangements, although made in
good faith, may become irrelevant and no longer provide support for the
children concerned.</div>
					<a name="07101663000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s view is that there is a clear principle that
children should, throughout their childhood, continue to enjoy a share
of the income and prosperity of their parents. While we believe that
clean-break arrangements present a particular problem, similar concerns
apply to locking parents irrevocably into any type of agreed
arrangement. Circumstances for one or both parents might change
dramatically. A once highly paid non-resident parent may become ill or
unemployed, or gain responsibility for another child and no longer be
reasonably able to meet the maintenance commitments of an original
agreement.</div>
					<a name="07101663000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider the opposite case&#151;for example, where a non-resident
parent makes an agreement as an unsalaried student, but then after
graduation joins the civil service fast stream, secures rapid promotion
and attains a grade 5 post by the age of 30. It would not be
right if his offspring were still supported by a maintenance level
appropriate to that of a
student.</div>
					<a name="07101663000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
lots of situations and circumstances in which, without any ill-will, an
agreement made in good faith no longer provides for the needs of the
children concerned. The purpose of the amendments appears to be to
amend various provisions of the Child Support Act 1991 that relate to
written maintenance agreements and maintenance
orders.</div>
