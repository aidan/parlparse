<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) I do not have to remind the Committee that we shall be discussing a matter that excites great passion and interest for the House and the public. It is important that we conduct our affairs in the highest traditions of debate in the House. In particular, I ask the Committee to co-operate with the Chair in ensuring that sedentary exchanges across the Floor do not take place. The proper way to intervene, as hon. Members know, is to stand and ask the hon. Member who has the Floor to give way. Should that hon. Member not give way, the hon. Member wishing to intervene must sit down. That is our tradition and I shall attempt to enforce it strictly. Otherwise, it will be difficult for the Committee's words to be recorded properly by our stenographers and the Committee will quickly descend into disorder. I am sure that none of us wants that to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, if proceedings on the Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to emphasise your words, Mr. Wells, concerning the conduct of the Committee because the eyes of the country and of other hon. Members will be on us when the Committee is sitting.
<P>
I am pleased to welcome the Members of the Committee. We can contribute much of value to the debate because of our breadth of experience. The Committee includes former members of the League Against Cruel Sports and people who hunt, so it encompasses a wide range of experience. Some members of the Committee have held ministerial office and others are newly elected, which will add valuable insight to the arguments that will be borne out during the next few months.
<P>
I am pleased to say that almost all members of the Committee attended the Second Reading debate and voted on 28 November. It is fair to say that every Member of the House welcomed that debate and many comments have been made about the enjoyment of having a debate with a full House, a free vote and such a wide exchange of views. Whatever the stance taken by hon. Members, all accepted that it was a valuable debate.
<P>
I particularly enjoyed the result of the debate because of the overwhelming endorsement that was given to the Bill. The massive show of support was almost unprecedented in private Member's business--411 hon. Members voted in favour of the Bill. The percentage of hon. Members who voted--73 per cent.--more or less mirrors the feeling of British public opinion on the issue, so the House has done a service to the people of this country. We showed that we are in touch and in tune with British public opinion. The Committee and the House cannot ignore that vote and the size of it, nor the issues that were raised in the debate.
<P>
Today, we are not here to restate the arguments made on Second Reading because that is not the purpose of the Committee. The Second Reading was valuable and raised issues that had been raised before. The Committee need not concern itself with the arguments about civil liberties, jobs or traditional country practices. Our debate and the Bill, are based on the premises of animal welfare and the need to prevent cruelty to wild mammals and the Committee should concentrate on those matters.
<P>
I have also considered the role that the Committee will play in the coming few weeks--it should examine the detail of the legislation. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) made an eloquent speech, which was well received by all, in which she pointed out that the Committee's job is to revise and improve the Bill. If Committee members think that the Bill is badly drafted--that has been said of it--this is the time to put that right. When it reaches the statute book--as I sincerely believe it will--we should rightly be proud of the fact that we ensured that it was workable and decent legislation.
<P>
I have heard the argument about private Member's Bills being badly drafted. It was raised some 30 years ago when David Steel--Lord Steel as he now is--was involved with the passage of the Abortion Act 1967, which was opposed not because of its policy but because it was badly drafted. Now is the time for all Committee members to improve the Bill.
<P>
I can forgive some of the comments that were made on Second Reading. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) completely misinterpreted the Bill. I accept that that was an accident--I do not believe for one moment that he misinterpreted it deliberately. Emotions were running high and perhaps they got the better of the right hon. and learned Gentleman. The Committee's role is to make the Bill's implications clear to members of the public. For example, it has been alleged that the Bill will stop people from walking their dogs in the park because of the fear that they will chase squirrels. People who read the Bill carefully will see that that is nonsense. The Bill is not designed to have that effect and is not drafted with that end in mind. As I said, the Committee's role is to clarify such matters.
<P>
As you pointed out, Mr. Wells, the Committee's role is also to use reasoned argument to come up with suggestions for improving the Bill. The Committee should not indulge in deliberate delaying tactics--doing so would be wholly wrong. The British public and many hon. Members do not necessarily understand some of the House's more arcane practices. At the end of the day, we sit in the British public's Parliament--it is their House of Commons. As Members, we are involved in passing legislation through the House. We must be seen to be upholding democratic values as strongly and as strictly as we can. I urge all Committee members not to use delaying tactics or deliberately to filibuster. It is therefore right to condemn the comments that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) made on Second Reading. He said that he would use every possible device to delay the Bill. That is not what we should do in Committee; we should be seeking to improve the Bill.
<P>
I prefer the attitude of the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway), who opposes the Bill. In a letter to one of his constituents, he wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``However, I accept the will of the House and I write to give you an undertaking . . . my undertaking to you is that I recognise the desire of the House to pass this legislation and I will not engage in any Parliamentary tactics which will delay the Bill.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before any Committee member rushes to write an early-day motion to establish the date that that letter was written, I hasten to say that it was written on 8 December 1997. One does not need to go too far back in history to study that piece of information. Although the hon. Gentleman and I may not agree on every issue that we shall debate in the coming months, I find this attitude very worthy. I am sure that we all agree that the eyes of the British people are on us. We must ensure that we uphold the valuable traditions that we cherish and protect.
<P>
I hope that democracy will be seen to be working in the Committee and that delaying tactics will be put to one side. I hope that the Committee will attempt to improve the legislation to make it workable, so that when it is presented to the House, we can say that we have done a valuable job in our contribution to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): First, those of us who advocate the Opposition side of the argument welcome you, Mr. Wells, to the Chair of the Committee and endorse the comments that you made earlier.
<P>
I think that everyone understands the role of the Committee. The intention of the Bill is to create criminal offences. If it is passed, lawyers and magistrates must be able to construe it and to consider its import and meaning. Therefore, it is very important that it is got right.
<P>
Opposition Members approach the Committee constructively. I note on today's amendment paper that 10 amendments have been tabled by those who voted in favour of the Bill on Second Reading and 11 by those of us who opposed the Bill on Second Reading. Therefore, it is fair to say that hon. Members on both sides of the debate are approaching the Committee intelligently.
<P>
I have absolutely no doubt that if any amendment is tabled that is not in order, it will be ruled out of order by the Public Bill Office and will not be selected by you, Mr. Wells, for consideration. I have no doubt that if at any stage during the course of the proceedings any hon. Member should attempt to filibuster or cause unnecessary delay to proper consideration, you will take appropriate action. I am sure that this Committee, like every Committee in the House on which I have ever sat, will be all the better if we treat each other with courtesy and respect. I am sure that that will be the pattern.
<P>
There are some important issues to be debated. The main principles have been debated on Second Reading; they may well be debated again on Report and at Third Reading. However, this is a detailed consideration, line by line, clause by clause, and it behoves us all to take that responsibility seriously, as we on the Opposition side of the argument intend to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Salter </B>(Reading, West): It is gratifying to hear a responsible attitude being taken by the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry). We should be in no doubt about the strength of public feeling that the Bill has aroused. In my constituency, that number of signatures were made available on a petition to ban hunting with hounds. My problem is explaining to young people, in particular--
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett </B>(Denton and Reddish): Does my hon. Friend accept that holding up a visual aid may upset the Chair, and it does not help the Official Report? Will he therefore tell the Committee how many signatures he has there, or has he not counted them?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. I wish that I had had time to count them. I will certainly make them available to my hon. Friend in the long hours in which we shall be discussing the Bill, should he wish to count them. Certainly, there are several thousand--many, many more thousands of signatures have been collected across the country.
<P>
Yesterday, I visited a couple of schools in my constituency. I returned from my constituency to be here today. Young people perceive the House of Commons as the place where the laws of the land are made. The problem that I have is explaining to my constituents, especially young people, why, if the House of Commons is so overwhelmingly in favour of this measure, there is a possibility that it will not become law.
<P>
The private Member's Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) has attracted the greatest ever support on the Floor of the House of Commons for a private Member's Bill, as well as the largest majority. We shall have ample opportunity in Committee to examine the proposed legislation in a calm and rational manner, which was not the case on Second Reading.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I suggest to Opposition Members who oppose the Bill that it would not be in their interests unnecessarily to frustrate the will of the House of Commons. It would not be in their interests for this issue to become the subject of a Government Bill and for the legislation to be pushed through both Houses of Parliament in an atmosphere of resentment.
<P>
If there are concerns about the legislation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester said--I doubt that there are, because I know the trouble he took to find expert advice before drafting the legislation--let us examine them calmly and rationally. Let us not forget that, in our actions, we must take into account the reputation of the House and of parliamentary procedures. Excessive use of the filibuster and other delaying tactics threatened on Second Reading would be harmful to the intelligent debate that has taken place in the country.
<P>
I am a lover of country sports, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, when he has time--I probably have more time than he does because he has a young family. I go fishing and spend much of my time in the countryside and I talk to many gamekeepers and landowners. What poisoned the debate in the countryside was labelling those of us who represent largely urban constituencies--Reading, West is not entirely urban--as ignorant urbanites who know nothing of the ways of the countryside. That suggested that the Bill was a divisive measure that set town against country, but the polling evidence does not support that argument on jot.
<P>
As for my sport of angling, polls were carried out by the major angling papers, one of which showed that 91 per cent. of coarse anglers were opposed to hunting with hounds. That is a higher proportion than the figure recorded when the general public were polled. The last polls taken by MORI before Second Reading--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Wells. I understood that the idea of sitting in this Committee Room, which is slightly larger than the Committee requires, was to allow a reasonable number of the general public to observe our proceedings. It looks as if there is some difficulty. I do not know whether it would be possible at the next sitting of the Committee, for Committee members to sit in one half of the room to allow the public to sit in the other half. Perhaps you could give directions so that at least the chairs reserved for the Press could be used, so that people are not left outside.
<P>
Furthermore, as our proceedings are being televised, would it be possible to tell those members of the public who are accompanied by House of Commons passholders in which room they can watch the televised proceedings?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am prepared to permit members of the public to sit in the Press seats, as they are not occupied this morning, if that can be arranged. On the latter question, I shall inquire whether we can admit those with passholders to a place where they can see the televised direct broadcast.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I endorse my hon. Friend's remarks, although being interrupted twice by Labour Members is something new and, frankly, dangerous.
<P>
Whether one lives in the suburbs, the town or the country, this issue arouses tremendous public feeling. The campaign has engaged hundreds of thousands of people on both sides of the argument. Our constituency mail has now, thankfully, receded--I was delighted that we were able to complete the Second Reading before Christmas. Of the constituents who wrote to me, 550 people were in favour of the Bill and, predictably, only three were against, but in urban Reading we do not have many fox or stag hunts.
<P>
I hope that we will be able to continue our deliberations in a calm and rational atmosphere. The use of unnecessary delaying tactics will only damage the reputation of the House and the cause of hon. Members opposed to the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester on getting a Bill into Committee. It is rare for any Member of the House to obtain a Second Reading and even rarer to get a Bill through Committee, which is what I assume will happen. Indeed, it is very unusual to get a private Member's Bill on to the statute book, especially one that has received so much public interest.
<P>
I endorse your remarks, Mr. Wells. It is important to listen to your strictures and to uphold the best traditions of debate and tolerance in the Committee. I know from previous experience that you will chair our proceedings in accordance with those strictures. I caution hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that if they stray from the proper path, you will be zealous in bringing them back to order.
<P>
Most people are aware that the Government are neutral on the Bill's proposals and, irrespective of any action that I may have taken, I speak on behalf of the Government. My own position, which is on the record, is not necessarily the same as the Government's position of neutrality.
<P>
The issue we must consider--this is where your comments, Mr. Wells, come to the fore--is that the will of the House was expressed on Second Reading in a well-attended debate and Division. The public will greatly misunderstand our behaviour in Committee and in later debates if deliberate parliamentary delaying tactics, such as filibustering, are used to thwart the will of the House. The politics of the country are on a warning from the public. The public have expressed concern in a variety of ways during and since the general election about how we have conducted our politics. They do not understand why debating devices, tactics and so on are often used to change or delay the outcome of legislation, or to thwart the will of the House. It is alien.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): The hon. Gentleman's contribution is the third or fourth to concentrate on the possible use of filibustering or other abstruse or obscure parliamentary tactics to delay or change the Bill. May I remind him that the opening remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) made it plain that hon. Members opposed to the Bill have no intention of using filibustering or other obscure antics or tactics? Although I am grateful to him for his contribution, perhaps he may like to move on to something more meaty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I think, Mr. Wells, that if my remarks had been inappropriate or off the subject, you would have called me to order. It is important that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) realises that whatever he or his hon. Friend the Member for Banbury may say, what was said by some of his hon. Friends on Second Reading is on the record. I think that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that he would use any tactics available to delay the progress of the Bill. If I am not mistaken, the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) threatened to table 200 amendments. Although those amendments will be competently drafted and in order, I have to question their purpose. I am sure that they will not necessarily be for the greater enlightenment of the British public or for the improvement of the Bill.
<P>
How we handle the Bill is a matter of legitimate public scrutiny. As a Member of the House and on behalf of the Government, I must point out that we must conduct our politics in a way that is understood by the public. Our proceedings must be conducted in a manner that does not lead the public to feel that dodgy tactics have been used to achieve an outcome that is neither their nor the House's wish.
<P>
I share your view, Mr. Wells, that the Committee should take the opportunity to consider the Bill in detail and to examine where it may have weaknesses. Most importantly, we can make necessary improvements to the Bill. If we can proceed in that spirit, we will bring credit on the House and gain the support and sympathy of the public. To proceed in any other way would bring severe discredit on us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): I join my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury and other members of the Committee in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Wells. As you said at the outset, it is imperative that members of the Committee conduct our deliberations over the next few weeks calmly, rationally and dispassionately. Hunting arouses strong emotions on both sides of the argument. Therefore, I hope that under your chairmanship, Mr. Wells, and that of Mr. O'Hara, whom we will welcome to the Chair on another occasion, we shall follow your suggestion and conduct our deliberations sensibly.
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Worcester. As the Under-Secretary of State said, private Member's Bills rarely even get this far. Therefore, the hon. Member for Worcester is to be congratulated even if I wholeheartedly disagree with most of what he says on the subject. We have debated it outside the House on a number of ocasions, if one counts appearing on a Central Television programme as a debate. The hon. Member for Worcester and I know where we and most of our constituents stand on the issue. In my constituency, I candidly admit that the initials MFH--master of foxhounds--often take precedence over those of MP.
<P>
I am delighted to see the Under-Secretary of State here, because it is vital that the Government's presence should be apparent even if silent. I noted that he proclaimed neutrality in so far as he represents the Government. Although I shall not press him about it now, I shall be interested to see whether his neutrality extends to abstaining during the votes.
<P>
The Under-Secretary of State's constituency includes part of Sefton, which was the name of a horse that was badly injured during the IRA bombing at Hyde Park. In addition, Lord Sefton owned Aintree, the famous national hunt racecourse. Therefore, the Under-Secretary of State brings with him huge connections with the hinterland of the matter before us.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury said, if the Bill becomes law, it will add hugely to the criminal law. Not for the first time, I disagree with the hon. Member for Worcester. The Bill raises questions about civil liberties and jobs. If those issues are relevant to any particular clause, the hon. Gentleman cannot expect opponents of the Bill not to canvass them. Our arguments will be in order and will not be designed to filibuster. We intend to remain on point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester said that the Bill is about animal welfare. To an extent, that is right. I am sure that both sides of the argument share an interest in animal welfare. Where we differ is the means by which we achieve it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury said, the Committee is here to clarify the Bill and, if necessary, to revise and improve it. We will not be sidetracked by emotion--at least, not unduly--and we will not be tempted into improper delaying tactics.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester and the Under-Secretary of State referred to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and my right hon. Friend the Member for Henley, who are not members of the Committee. Members of the Committee can cast worries about them out of their minds. We can concentrate on the Bill as it appears before us. I trust that on the next few Wednesdays we shall have interesting discussions and enjoy ourselves. When we leave the Committee and return to the Floor of the House on Report, I trust that we shall still be friends, remaining true to our own beliefs. I trust that Labour Members will treat us with the courtesy that our arguments deserve, as we shall treat them with the good manners that are deserved by their arguments and their sincerity.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): First, may I welcome and endorse the comments that you have made, Mr. Wells, about the spirit in which the sittings of the Committee should be conducted.
<P>
I was delighted to hear the comments of the hon. Member for Banbury, who said that there would be no attempt to delay artificially, or filibuster, the Bill in Committee.
<P>
I understand the concerns of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier), but we must recognise the anxieties felt by hon. Members and by the public that there will be attempts to delay the Bill. It cannot be delayed by the public and it cannot be stopped by Parliament. There is support for the Bill in the country and in the House. It can be stopped only by the delaying, procedural tactics of hon. Members.
<P>
Hon. Members who support the Bill are worried about that matter, and I think that they are fully justified. On 28 November, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``When a Bill as bad and pernicious as this comes before the House, I will use every possible device to delay it.''--[Official Report, 28 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 1265.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That comment strikes fear in the hearts of those of us who have long campaigned for the Bill.
<P>
I welcome the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, although I would take issue with him on one point. He said that some members of the Committee are former members of the League Against Cruel Sports. My hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Mrs. Gordon) and I, and no doubt some other hon. Members, are still members of the league, and will remain members. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) is wearing his League Against Cruel Sports tie.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I am at fault. I meant to refer to former employees of the League Against Cruel Sports.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I will plead guilty to that.
<P>
The credibility of Parliament is at stake in the way in which we deal with the Bill. The public at large do not understand parliamentary procedures, such as Committee, Report and Third Reading. Indeed, many new Members do not understand the various tactics and procedures used in the House. There will be grave problems if the Bill is artificially delayed. Democracy must be seen to be effective. There is an overwhelming majority in the House--73 per cent. of hon. Members support the Bill--which shows that we must ensure that the Bill becomes law.
<P>
The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), said that the public will misunderstand the matter if delaying, procedural tactics are employed and the Bill does not become law. The public will not misunderstand the matter; they will fully understand what is behind any delay. I hope that the Committee will ensure that the Bill is discussed in a way that addresses the concerns of hon. Members and irons out their worries.
<P>
We have the opportunity to sort out any technical glitches. On 28 November, there were some misunderstandings on Second Reading. One hon. Member said that it would be illegal for a dog to chase a squirrel up a tree, and that the dog's owner would be guilty of an offence. That is not the case, but such concerns can be addressed in Committee. We must ensure that there is enough time to discuss such matters.
<P>
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough said that the Government had remained neutral on the issue. It is proper and appropriate that the Government should remain neutral on a private Member's Bill. There was another example of that this week in the Doctor Assisted Dying Bill; that is a genuine cross-party issue. That Bill was also a private Member's Bill, like the one that we are discussing, but perhaps it had more genuine cross-party support. Unfortunately, we have not had the support from Conservative Members that we would have liked for this Bill. We welcome those Conservative Members who have supported it, and we would welcome any further support, but as it is a private Member's Bill the Government must remain neutral.
<P>
The support of 73 per cent. of Members of Parliament for the Bill is reflected in the population at large. We must do all that we possibly can to ensure that the Bill that leaves the Committee is excellent, and that we can move it forward in the way that hon. Members and the country expect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit &Ouml;pik </B>(Montgomeryshire): First, may I add my congratulations on your appointment, Mr. Wells. I trust that you will enjoy it as well as do the good job that I know you will. I apologise for my wretched state of health, for coughing and for having to clear my throat--interrupting my own perorations. Clearly the stress of attending this Committee is already taking its toll.
<P>
There can be no doubt that 28 November was a great occasion in the House. The Bill's Second Reading saw exciting exchanges: the speeches, the interjections and ultimately the vote--all were exciting. The Countryside rally in Hyde park, attended by more than 125,000 people, was equally a great occasion with a sense of high drama. People were demonstrating their concerns about certain aspects of the Bill and other matters affecting the countryside. We can thus conclude that there are very strong feelings on both sides, representing divided views in the country on the important issues facing the Committee. So, I sympathise with the hon. Member for Worcester who, as a new Member of the House, has been thrown in at the deep end. I am pleased that I am participating as a contributor, rather than an instigator, in the Committee. I hope that the hon. Gentleman takes a few days off at Christmas before the major celebrations of next year.
<P>
My main concern in Committee is to ensure that we pass good legislation. I hope to encourage a reasonable exchange that will lead to reasonable improvements to the Bill. Many people in the countryside--my constituents have certainly made it clear to me--have a number of worries about the Bill. Making the Committee a success has nothing to do with filibustering or delaying. Rather it is about achieving new accords and finding alternative ways in which to approach the Bill to make it more appropriate to people who take fox control seriously, while also recognising the strong support in the country for the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to fox hunting as a means of fox control, but does he not accept that fox hunting is purely a sport?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> The hon. Lady will know that the definition of fox hunting is one of the most important topics for debate in Committee. I do not want to embark on detailed exchanges on the subject at this stage, except to repeat that the hon. Lady's question is one of the most important for us to deal with as the Committee progresses. For the record, I believe that fox hunting covers the whole gamut of activities--for some it is about participating in a sport, for others it is about controlling the fox population.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that since the general election of 1 May, Ministers from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and from the Ministry of Defence have made it clear that the Government believe that fox hunting is an effective means of fox control?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want the Committee to become embroiled in arguments at this stage. I remind the Committee that we are supposed to be discussing the sittings motion and that we should address our remarks to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Thank you, Mr. Wells. We can at least see from our brief exchange that there is much to be debated and I hope that we shall do so reasonably and constructively. There should be a willingness on both sides to co-operate. I hope that we avoid a pointless debate from entrenched positions. We must all listen. None of us in Committee has either a monopoly on good ideas or the unequivocal and unanimous support of the nation. We must acquit ourselves in such a way that we can be proud of our contributions and be seen by the public to have held a genuinely constructive debate. Many comments have been made about delaying tactics and playing games to talk the Bill out. If I wanted to play games with members of the Committee, I would invite them to my house on Boxing day to play Scrabble.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ian Gibson </B>(Norwich, Norwich): No, thanks. I do not like Scrabble.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Well, we Estonians think in a funny way at Christmas. Still, I do not intend to spend Wednesday after Wednesday playing games with members of the Committee. The Bill deals with a serious matter, which has profound implications for countryside management. Therefore, it behoves us to take the measure seriously, without using facetious delaying tactics that hinder us from, reaching a conclusion.
<P>
Finally, Mr. Wells, because I am a new Member, I shall be guided by you. If I transgress the etiquette of the Committee, I shall be grateful for your advice. Our procedings will be a useful learning experience, and I shall do my best to add value to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Wells. I hope that you find the proceedings interesting.
<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester on getting the Bill this far; I would like it to reach the statute book. However, I hesitate to agree with my hon. Friends who claim that people outside will not understand if the measure does not reach the statute book. The main objective is to get it right. People outside will not understand if we make bad legislation.
<P>
Our priority is to examine the Bill line by line. Therefore, I suggest that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester should reconsider the sittings motion. I doubt whether we shall have time to scrutinise the Bill effectively is we sit only on Wednesday mornings. The Under- Secretary of State suggested that if someone tabled 200 amendments, that would wreck the Bill. I shall reach that figure quickly; if I tabled only two amendments, the consequential amendments and changes would make a substantial total on my score card.
<P>
Hon. Members volunteered to serve on the Committee are prepared to devote a substantial amount of time to getting the measure right. If there is to be a shortage of time, it will happen on Report. Therefore, it is important to tackle the amendments in Committee so that, on Report, we have to consider only one or two major issues of principle, not a large number of nitty-gritty amendments. We must ensure that Parliament's intentions are clear and unambiguous when the courts interpret the law.
<P>
I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester to consider whether we should sit in the afternoons as well as the mornings on Wednesday. The substantive amendments cover only the first five lines of the Bill; The others are consequential amendments. If we are to scrutinise the Bill effectively, we may need more time.
<P>
When one examines a Bill, it is easy, in my experience, to consider the first few lines, but tabling amendment to the whole Bill takes time. I shall not devote a great deal of the Christmas recess to the Bill, but I shall try to devise appropriate amendments in the first week in the new year. When my hon. Friend sees the number of amendment, he may feel that he needs to reconsider the sittings motion.
<P>
I ask the Minister what the Government's attitude to amendments is. He has said that he is neutral, but Government neutrality comes in different forms. I have served on Committees considering private Member's Bills when the Government took a lot of time and trouble to ensure that the measure was right, although it was clear that they were neutral. I firmly believe that it is the Government's duty to ensure that if it is the will of the House that this Bill is enacted, the wording is right.

<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend has long experience of the House and its proceedings, and I understand clearly what he means, but it would not be appropriate for me formally to table amendments, because the Government hold a neutral position. However, I have undertaken privately to my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester that any concerns that the Government have about the technical competence or the wording of the Bill will be communicated through the usual channels. My hon. Friend will thus be in no doubt if he considers that there are difficulties about the drafting of the Bill. I hope that he will then be able to develop a solution to any problems that may arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> That was a helpful intervention; when will the Minister convey that information, however it is done? There is a temptation for us to feel that a clause is not quite right after it has been debated. At that stage, it is extremely difficult for anyone to table a new amendment because we move progressively through the Bill. Therefore, any amendment must be tabled on Report. As I said, there is a shortage of time at that stage so it is important that amendments are tabled now and discussed in Committee when we have plenty of time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> My question is more properly directed at the Minister, but I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman gained the impression from the Minister's answer to his question that the information would be shared only with him or with the rest of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> The Minister might want to intervene to keep the Committee in order, but for the moment I will reply and if the Minister does not like my answer, he can intervene.
<P>
My understanding is that if the Minister is not happy with the clause, he will explain why and perhaps suggest that another amendment on the amendment paper is more suitable. I would have thought that he could put his name to an amendment, but I understand his difficulty. I am sure that he will share his view with the whole Committee when we debate any change that the Government deem necessary in order for the measure to achieve its aims.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, I am grateful to my hon. Friend. It is not necessarily my intention to express any reservations in Committee, although if it were a matter about which the Government were strongly concerned, I might feel it necessary to do so. However, I do not intend for that to be the normal way in which I proceed on behalf of the Government.
<P>
What I have said--I hope that this will make the point clearer--is that I have undertaken to my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester that if the Government have any anxieties about the competence of a clause or the wording of any part of it that may need amendment, I shall advise him accordingly. My reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) who asked when I would do so is, ``In good time.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I will not pry into what the Government consider to be in good time, as that would take too long. All I can say to my hon. Friend is that although I defend the Government's neutral position, if ``in good time'' means that the amendment must be tabled on Report, I will not consider their position to be neutral or their actions to be in good time. My hon. Friend must carefully consider the situation in the light of the number of new amendments necessary and ensure that we receive good intelligence from the Government about them.
<P>
While we are considering the sittings motion, it is legitimate for me to tell my hon. Friend some of my concerns and to ask him whether there will be time to explore them. I do not want to inticipate our first debate, but will my hon. Friend consider whether the matter should be dealt with in primary legislation which sets out the details or in enabling legislation and subsequent regulations? My impression from the Second Reading debate is that there are many intertwined issues. We are particularly concerned about animal welfare but it would be sad if we passed legislation and then found that it could not be modified without the complication of another private Member's Bill if it was not working in the best interests of animal welfare. I ask my hon. Friend to consider whether, instead of being very prescriptive in the Bill, it would be better to give the Secretary of State powers to make regulations to deal with most of the matters raised and to allow some phasing in.
<P>
One problem is that a series of issues was raised on Second Reading and I want my hon. Friend to guarantee that there will be time for proper discussion of them. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding) argued passionately about the problem of mink. I do not know whether my hon. Friend has considered how he will respond to that, but I hope that he will consider ways in which we can have a proper debate because legitimate concerns were raised.
<P>
I turn to other items on my shopping list for which time should be made available so that we can set at rest the fears of people such as hill farmers and the problem at lambing time of foxes attacking lambs. That may be a peripheral problem because it exists in many parts of the country where there is no hunting, but the whole issue of flushing out is difficult and if a Wednesday morning is taken for each of the issues that I have mentioned, we shall have difficulties with time. I make the point again to my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester; I am watching you carefully, Mr. Wells, and I am having to mention the sittings motion rather more frequently than I would like, but I shall keep doing so to remain in order. I want to press my hon. Friend on whether he is allowing sufficient time--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. While I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's attempt to keep his comments in order by making frequent reference to the sittings motion, I suggest that he confines his comments closely to the sittings motion and does not begin to debate the subjects that we shall come to during our consideration of the Bill and amendments to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Yes, Mr. Wells, I accept that and I understand the difficulties, but if I am trying to persuade my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester to allocate more time to our proceedings, I must set out some of the matters for which more time is necessary.
<P>
I shall not continue much longer, but I stress to my hon. Friend that one of the issues raised by hon. Members opposed to the Bill is penalties. We would be lucky to be able to deal with that issue during one morning's sitting. None of us wants the penalties to be opposed, so we must get the balance right to persuade people to obey the law without having to impose harsh penalties. That may take a considerable time.
<P>
There are three available Wednesday mornings in January and three in February. I have already listed sufficient topics to take up all those mornings. We must ensure that drag hunting can continue under the legislation and we must spend some time discussing deer management. My plea to my hon. Friend is that a sittings motion for Wednesday mornings only is insufficient for the Committee to give that Bill the scrutiny that it needs. We must ensure that when it leaves the Committee we have got it right and that the Bill will not need to be changed on the Floor of the House or in the House of Lords.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martyn Jones </B>(Clwyd, South): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Wells. I well remember--but I suspect that you will not--that 10 years ago you spoke after my maiden speech and made the traditional comments on it, although I suspect that they were wholly undeserved. I am certain that you will run our proceedings with magnanimity and good judgment.
<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) on his luck--though I hesitate to use that word--in winning the ballot. I came top of the ballot in 1988, and, although I did not choose a subject as controversial as my hon. Friend's, even that did not get through. He has done very well to get this far and I hope that the Bill will get a lot further. I am convinced that with such a huge majority on Second Reading it would be quite wrong and undemocratic if it did not go further.
<P>
I represent a rural constituency and I have--unusually for a Labour Member--done so for 10 years. I do not believe that the Bill involves a countryside-versus-town issue. I understand the comments of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. &Ouml;pik), who tried to present both sides of the argument. He suggested that the Countryside rally represented one side of the debate. Many people who attended that rally--some were from my constituency, and, no doubt, some were from the hon. Gentleman's--did so in the belief that if the Bill is enacted farmers in uplands areas will suffer the depredations of fox damage at lambing time because there will be no means of controlling foxes. With your Welsh connections, Mr. Wells, I am sure you are aware that in the uplands of Wales the predation of lambs at lambing time is a serious problem. In the hills, foxes are controlled throughout the year--but, significantly, prior to lambing--by driving them out with hounds and, in the main, by shooting them. Many farmers and concerned country folk attended the Countryside rally because they believed that the Bill would stop that practice. I am pleased to note that the Bill includes a clause that will allow flushing out with hounds. The problem that I see with the clause--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I really must insist that he brings his remarks into order and discusses the sittings motion. He must refrain from debating particular clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> You beat me to the punch, Mr. Wells. I was that second about to mention the sittings motion. I was going to say that it is not sufficient to allow us to discuss all of the nuances of the matter that I mentioned --they deserve greater consideration. We are discussing the introduction of criminal offences and I foresee potential problems. Some barbaric practices, which do not control foxes--or, to make an important distinction, which do not do so humanely--should involve a criminal offence. However, the sittings motion should take account of the length of the debate that is bound to be engendered by that subject.

<P>

<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman also agree that the matters that he raised about fox control in the upland and rural areas--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I cannot allow the debate on that subject to continue. We are discussing the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I think that I have made my point on the time needed to get the Bill right.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) seems to be making a case for sitting more often. Bearing in mind the spirit of co-operation expressed today, does he not accept that the Wednesday morning sittings motion proposed by the hon. Member for Worcester will give us enough time adequately to examine all the issues? The Bill is not long and it is not difficult. We are tidying up what was expressed in the House of Commons when we debated some of the issues on 28 November. The issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South do not need the level of debate that he suggests. It will be adequate to meet on Wednesday mornings. The spirit of co-operation in the Committee--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be short and to the point. They must not try to further the argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martyn Jones:</B> Thank you, Mr. Wells. I acknowledge my hon. Friend's point. I hope that we will have that spirit of co-operation. If the statements of co-operation come true, the Wednesday morning sittings motion will be fine. We all have other things to do. I hope that we receive that co-operation and that we get the Bill right because if we get it right, it will work and that is important.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I have not served on a Committee before, in common with other hon. Members. Although I am not entirely clear about procedures, I understand that a Standing Committee is not a debating society set up to consider various topics, much as it might be fascinating to discuss whether hunting with dogs is a town-versus-country issue. I, too, represent a rural constituency. One of the things that angers my constituents most is people saying that only townies oppose hunting wild mammals. The vast majority of my constituents oppose it.
<P>
I believe that the purpose of the Committee is not to debate such topics but to examine the detail of the Bill. I would be most surprised if the hon. Member for Worcester believed that his Bill were perfect and unable to bear a little scrutiny or the odd change of emphasis or wording. If he does think that it is perfect, I congratulate him three times over, not just for getting the Bill through Second Reading, but for being able to produce something perfect at the first attempt. Few of us could claim that achievement.
<P>
We are here to examine the detail of the Bill. Hon. Members opposed to the Bill have said that they have no desire to filibuster or to table silly amendments just for the sake of it. They recognise that over the past few years Parliament has been slipping in regard in the public view. It is important that we are seen to be doing our job responsibly and with care. Amendments will be tabled in a genuine attempt to improve the Bill so that the Act of Parliament is enforceable. When the will of the people and the will expressed in Parliament come to fruition, it is important that the final Act can be enforced.
<P>
As for the time that our deliberations should take, again I am not an expert--I have no experience of how long it might take to consider such a Bill. It is not a long bill, so Wednesday mornings should be adequate. However, my constituents, on both sides of the hunting debate have asked me whether there are not more important issues for Parliament to debate. Many hon. Members would say that there are plenty of other issues for them to deal with. Those who live in rural areas expect us to concentrate on things that are damaging the rural economy--I shall not list them because that would be to stray from the subject.
<P>
We must allow adequate time to do justice to the Bill and the will of Parliament, but not so much time that we are unable to fulfil our other duties as Members of Parliament and represent our constituents. Therefore, I strongly support the sittings motion tabled by the hon. Member for Worcester.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I wish to echo the welcome that other Committee Members have given you, as Chairman, Mr. Wells. I endorse your comments that the eyes of the country are on us and that we should consider the matter with all due seriousness and not play parliamentary games.
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Worcester on bringing the Bill into Committee, but he will not be surprised to hear that I oppose it. I want to pick up a couple of remarks that he made this morning. This is not merely a matter of animal cruelty. The legislation would have serious economic and employment consequences and I am delighted to see that the Under-Secretary of State has returned to his seat.
<P>
The legislation would have serious consequences for the horse-breeding industry, for point-to-pointing and for hunting. We should bear in mind that Aintree was founded on hunting. I also disagree with the hon. Gentleman's comment about human rights. There is a serious human rights issue here, which should be clearly discussed. The Government made it clear that opinion polls and the vote on 28 November showed that there was a substantial majority in favour of the Bill, but there is a tradition in liberal western democracies of not allowing the majority to ride roughshod over significant minorities. We do not want to become involved in a childish debate about townies against people from the countryside, but substantial numbers of people who live in the countryside believe that they are being victimised by people--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman address his remarks to the sittings motion? He is straying way out of order because he is discussing the merits of the Bill. There will be plenty of opportunity to do that later in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I apologise, Mr. Wells. I was just picking up something said by the hon. Member for Worcester. As a new Member, I have much to learn and I look forward to learning from you, Mr. Wells. I endorse the sittings motion and shall sit down.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eileen Gordon </B>(Romford): First, may I say how privileged I am to be on the Committee. As another new Member, I realise that I have much to learn, but I hope that I can make a positive and useful contribution.
<P>
I agree that we must be cool and rational in our approach to the legislation and that we must consider it in detail to ensure that it is correct before it becomes law. If I could be allowed a minute's indulgence, I must say that this is one of the issues that made me determined to become a Member of Parliament. This morning, we are talking about time; I have spent a considerable amount of time campaigning on this issue and I am still somewhat stunned that I am here and able to do something about it.
<P>
The time has come to deal with this issue. So I welcome the commitment by those who oppose the Bill not to filibuster or osbstruct the will of the people. I have thought about the question of time and, like my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, I was concerned that we would not have enough time to consider the legislation. However, now that we have an assurance that it will not be deliberately obstructed, I agree that Wednesday mornings will be adequate.
<P>
One of the things that I have learnt since coming to the House is that what is important is not the amount of time that is available, but what is done with that time. We can in a good spirit examine the detail of the Bill, put anything right that is wrong and get it through as soon as possible. I therefore agree with the sittings motion. I would have been prepared to sit in Committee day and night to get the Bill through because I feel so strongly about it. I should be quite happy to do that. My family might not be very pleased, and certainly over Christmas it might be difficult, but I would do that because this is an issue that the country is waiting for us to deal with and to settle once and for all. I therefore support my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester on his sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): If you are not embarrassed by now, Mr. Wells, I should like to welcome you to the Chair of the Committee. This is effectively the first Committe that I have attended. I sat on a Standing Committee that dealt with paralytic shellfish, and another on the Mink Keeping Order 1997. I would not want to underestimate the life-enhancing experience of serving on one of those Committees. I suppose that this is, however, my first real test and I am looking forward to it immensely.
<P>
I hope that the sittings motion moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester will enable us to have a proper debate, and to discuss all the issues, especially given the assurances that we have had from Opposition Members that they will stick to fair play. I hope that that will be the case; there is a rather cynical side to me that says that time will tell, but we are all honourable in this building.
<P>
The Committee provides the opportunity to elaborate on arguments that were not heard on Second Reading. The Speaker made it clear at the start of that debate that many people--I think more than 50--had put their names down to speak; many did not get called. I was one of those. I therefore welcome the opportunity that the sittings motion provides to allow me to contribute to the debate. My contribution to the debate thus far was summed up in one of the diary columns as ``Mike Foster's hooligan'', ranting at the Opposition. I promise you, Mr. Wells, that I will try to be more constructive as we proceed.
<P>
Many hon. Members have alluded to the fact that the debate so far has been rather crude, especially on Second Reading, falling into all sorts of arguments, especially the rural-versus-urban debate. The composition of the Committee gives us an ideal opportunity to dispel that myth once and for all. Not only does the Committee consist of hon. Members with different political views, but its members represent a good mix of the different types of constituencies in this country. The time that the sittings motion will provide will enable those different experiences to be brought forward.
<P>
My constituency of Brigg and Goole, which rolls through north Lincolnshire over the Humber and into the east riding of Yorkshire, is about as rural as can be found. I welcome the opportunity that the sittings motion will provide to make the point that in a large rural constituency such as mine, we have not one hunt, yet somehow we all manage to survive. Life in the rural economy thrives and is very strong indeed. Very occasionally, the Brocklesby hunt will come into Alkborough, one of the villages in my constituency--and I always receive complaints when that happens.
<P>
The sittings motion will, therefore, provide hon. Members with every opportunity to ensure that we have considered the legislation when it reaches the statute book. It will also show people, regardless of which side of the argument they support, that hon. Members have done all that they can to consider their concerns.
<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire mentioned the Countryside rally, now comprising 125,000 people--if only British industry could match that growth. I know that the Metropolitan police thought that the number was nearer 70,000 or 80,000. Nevertheless, a reasonable number of people presented a strong view. My hon. Friend's sittings motion will enable us to discuss such views.
<P>
The sittings motion will also enable us to consider the views expressed through many opinion poll companies--especially MORI, which did a great deal of work on attitudes to the Bill and showed clearly that the British public supported it. Hon. Members matched that support when they voted on 28 November.
<P>
I am not sure whether opinion polls were carried out in every constituency, but I do know that MORI investigated the constituencies of the party leaders and found once again that there was more support for than opposition to the Bill. The constituency of the right hon. Member for Richmond (Mr. Hague) was the only one without an absolute majority--42 per cent. favoured the Bill, but we should remember that even there only 35 per cent. wanted it to fail. If many people in that constituency appear not to know, that could explain why the right hon. Member for Richmond was elected!
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The sittings motion will lead to an informed debate. In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, I am perfectly willing to sit in Committee as long as it takes to pass the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Mrs. Gordon) said that sitting through the night would not please her family, although I suspect that it might please mine.
<P>
The sittings motion is important: it begins the process and sets the ball rolling. I gather, as you have explained, Mr. Wells, that we may have other possibilities later if we find that the present sittings motion is inadequate. I am pleased to support the current sittings motion.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I will briefly deal with some of the concerns expressed by my hon. Friends the Members for Denton and Reddish and for Clwyd, South. I was reassured by Opposition Members and I thank them for clarifying how they intend to conduct themselves in Committee. The sittings motion will provide a short Bill with enough time for thorough scrutiny, so long as we focus solely on the legislative provisions rather than on the wider arguments surrounding the Bill. We are all agreed that we want to make the Bill workable, which is why I propose the sittings motion with the confidence that it will meet the requirements of the Committee, the House and the British people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am rather disappointed with my hon. Friend's response. I am not convinced that he has recognised how much time will be necessary or the extent to which he will need to negotiate. In my experience, members of a Committee may want to finish earlier on Wednesday morning, take advice and return in the afternoon to deal with outstanding problems. When a Committee is around half way through debating important questions, it can be annoying to have to wait until the next Wednesday for a response. An extra sitting has distinct advantages. If my hon. Friend will not concede that at this stage--I can well understand if he felt that it would be inappropriate to sit on the first Wednesday afternoon after the Christmas break--I hope that he will consider having additional sittings later. I would also like Opposition Members to say whether they would be prepared to attend afternoon sittings, if necessary, later in the new year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> It is now 11.49 am and we are still debating the sittings motion which, in many Committees, is often taken, after the usual courtesies, on the nod. We are now taking up time that could have been spent debating substantive issues. I also note that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish has tabled the first group of today's amendments. I had anticipated that we would make good progress on those amendments before we rose at 1 o'clock.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that assurance. If we have at least had a hint that we shall not take long on a further sittings motion, I shall leave it at that.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Will you explain to the Committee that it is only in the spirit of Christmas that you have called this group of entirely starred amendments at this festive time? [Hon. Members: ``They are not starred.''] They are starred on the amendment paper that I have.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> They were starred yesterday, but they are not today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> As I took some trouble with the amendments on Monday night so that they would not be starred, those comments could be considered a slur. Perhaps, at this time of year, we should have a few extra stars.
<P>
The amendments are designed to take the first opportunity in the Bill to press my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester on whether it is necessary to be specific throughout the Bill. Would it not be a better approach to give Ministers the power to make regulations so that there is flexibility? I understand the difficulties with that approach, and I have sat on Committees and said that it was dangerous to give Ministers regulatory powers. However, on this occasion, I think that they should be given such powers if the House is given control over the regulations by discussing them under the affirmative resolution procedure. Regulations would provide flexibility.
<P>
No one can predict totally accurately what will occur should the Bill become law. We hope that it will improve the welfare of animals. However, if it were to have unexpected consequences, I would prefer the legislation to be flexible so that Ministers could deal with the problems without having to introduce further primary legislation.
<P>
Most people's main concern with the Bill is that it will stop hare coursing, deer hunting and fox hunting. I must say to my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester that I am puzzled about the provisions for rabbits. Under clause 5, rabbits are excluded from the Bill. Why is a rabbit not covered by the Bill if it is alone in a field when a lurcher is nearby when it would be covered by the Bill if there was a hare in the field too? What is the reason for the difference?
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester will deal with that point because many of my acquaintances cannot tell the difference between a rabbit and a hare until the animal starts to move. I understand that, under the Bill, if a lurcher sets off after a rabbit, no offence will be committed. However, if a lurcher sets off after a hare, an offence will be committed.
<P>
I am not sure of the Bill's provisions for rodents. As I understand it, no offence will be committed if one is trying to catch rodents on a piece of land. What is the position on rats around farm buildings? Does that count as land? I am not sure how effective the practice was but, in my youth, hill farmers kept a dog to go after rats when a rick was being taken down. I remember being stood on a bucket and given a stick with which to hit it and make a noise to drive the rats towards the dogs and people with sticks. What is the Bill's position on rats and other vermin, especially in the context of the definition of ``land''?
<P>
I want to consider other wild animals. We have all seen newspaper headlines about the beast of Bodmin moor. In almost every part of the country, there are tales about some animal roaming about in the wild. The majority of such tales are urban legends, and no such wild animals exist. The stories make good newspaper pieces, especially on a bad day for news. However, from time to time, there are various escapees. What is the Bill's position on dealing with escapees if they cause a problem? Would the Bill make it impossible for people to hunt them with a dog, which would drive the animal out for people to shoot? Does the provision for flushing out a fox apply to such animals?
<P>
I want to discuss the possibility of foxes in this country contracting rabies. There is a debate about regulations, and whether we should have passports that would allow people to take animals to and from the continent. I do not want to consider that debate in detail, but we must be aware of the possibility of rabies spreading from continental Europe to this country. If that occurred, and especially if foxes were infected, would we try to exterminate the whole fox population? If that was necessary to prevent the spread of rabies, what methods would be available? Will my hon. Friend the Minister be able to tell us?
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> My hon. Friend seems to argue in favour of fox hunting to prevent rabies from spreading in this country. Does not he accept that the last thing we should do is set a pack of hounds on a rabid fox? We would end up with a rabid pack of hounds.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman continues with his point I draw his attention to the amendment, which does not cover rabies. I ask the hon. Gentleman to bring his remarks into order and to deal with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Amendment No. 28 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(6) The Secretary of State may by Order made by statutory instruments specify--
<P>
(a) the species of wild mammal which;
<P>
(b) the places in which; and
<P>
(c) the times at which
<P>
</UL></FONT>it shall be lawful to hunt''.
<P>
I would have thought that, if we had to try to control a species that had rabies, a possible method would be the flushing out process. The aim would to shoot the animals. Has the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the necessary powers to control wild animals in the countryside for the sake of those animals' health and that of people who live there?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister may decide to answer that, but not in the context of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> The amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may by Order''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
make it ``lawful to hunt''. If the Secretary of State was confronted with a crisis, how would he deal with it? It is legitimate to try to ascertain whether the Secretary of State has sufficient powers elsewhere, and therefore does not need powers to make regulations.
<P>
There is a strong argument that it would be better to put the matter into regulations, rather than to lay down absolutely that no hunting is possible. As I suggested earlier, we do not know how the Bill will work. We cannot predict its implications, or what animal health problems may occur in the countryside. I mentioned rabies to illustrate the problems that may arise in the future; yesterday, decisions were taken about culling badgers in some parts of the country to discover whether it would reduce the spread of bovine TB. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should have powers to deal with such matters.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman accept that there is no intention to cull badgers by hunting them? Indeed, if any urgent animal welfare issue demanded culling, hunting would be the least effective and efficient method of doing so, as many hunts catch nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I was using the culling of badgers as an illustration of the fact that as problems develop in the countryside, measures need to be in place. Having banned hunting for the good reasons set out in the Bill, we do not then want to find that we have restricted our opportunities to pursue other animal welfare issues. I am arguing that it may be better for the Bill to have the flexibility to allow the Secretary of State to make certain things lawful in particular circumstances, with the full approval of the House. If such things are stated absolutely, in black and white, we may find in the relatively near future that because something crops up that was not foreseen, we do not have either the existing emergency powers of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the powers that could be included in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Ann Widdecombe </B>(Maidstone and The Weald): I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I am not sure whether he is temporarily my hon. Friend--I am always confused by the conventions. If the amendment is accepted as drafted, what guarantee is there that a future Secretary of State would not specify a fox, a deer or a hare?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I fully accept that that is one of the fundamental flaws in my proposal, but I hoped, at an early stage in our proceedings, to probe whether the Bill should include a regulatory power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin McNamara </B>(Hull, North): In response to my hon. Friend's argument, I draw his attention to clause 5, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The definition given in subsection (1) does not extend to . . . the flushing out of a wild mammal from cover on or above ground to be immediately and lawfully shot for the purpose of the necessary management and control of the wild mammal or wild mammals of that species.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would appear to deal with the hon. Gentleman's case about rabbits. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) dealt with the case relating to badgers; extending the measure as my hon. Friend suggests means that it will fall into the trap mentioned by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I accept those criticisms but I want to establish whether there is a case for using regulations in the Bill. If so, these are not the best-drafted amendments. If I were convinced that there was a case for using regulations, I could return to the issue and, although it would not be easy, I might be able to design regulations which would allow some flexibility but not permit the problems to which the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald referred, which means that they could be reversed by a future Government. On the other hand, a future Government would be able to reverse a proposal by further legislation.
<P>
One must weight the balance between making regulations and introducing primary legislation. It could be argued that if the legislation was not working, it would be better to be able to repeal the Act, or a section of it, relatively quickly on animal welfare grounds rather than have to wait for someone's good fortune in the ballot for private Member's Bills.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> The amendment would allow hunts to take place; it is the process of hunting--the harrying and the pursuit of an animal to the point of exhaustion--that many of those who believe in the Bill find obnoxious. Professor Bateson's report on stag hunting made it clear that it was the chase that was wrong with hunting. The amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish would allow the chase to take place legally. Does he have any qualms about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I would not want the amendment to be used to support deer hunting, because I was convinced by the evidence put forward about the suffering endured by the animals during the chase. We must weigh up, however, how far flushing out will work under the regulations and whether it would be better to put in flexibility, but I will seek my hon. Friend's advice on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Amendment No. 18 and the other amendments tabled by my hon. Friend would provide that the Secretary of State could make an order, specifying times and places, to allow the hunting of individual species. Any licensing system that permitted hunting with dogs would run counter to the spirit of the Bill. The Bill is essentially about abolition, and the overwhelming sentiment of the House on Second Reading seemed to be in favour of abolition, as distinct from some form of licensing.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester has made it clear that the case is based on animal cruelty; in other words, that hunting is cruel and that therefore it should be abolished. If that is so, licensed hunting cannot be countenanced any more than hunting per se.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish pointed out that some species are more of a nuisance than others, at some times and in some places. It would be difficult to distinguish between species for the purposes of a licensing system, or in the Bill, purely in terms of how much of a nuisance they are perceived to be. If the arguments are based on cruelty, it is no more or no less cruel to use any form of hunting, whether licensed or not, to reduce the effects of a particular species on farming and so on.
<P>
The decisions to ban deer hunting over National Trust land, where there was a form of licensing, were also based on considerations of cruelty to animals. That tends to support the argument about the principle of the Bill, rather than the practice. Although the Government retain neutrality on the matter, we are not wedded to any form of licensing being maintained for hunting over Ministry of Defence or Forestry Commission lands. In both cases, those licensing systems will be reviewed in the light of the passage of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> It may be my age, but I did not quite catch what my hon. Friend said. Will he repeat it, please?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend is pleading age, but he seems to be as vigorous as ever. However, to avoid any doubts that he might have, I understand that the Ministry of Defence and the Forestry Commission intend to review their licensing systems in the light of the passage of the Bill.
<P>
The more general responsibility for licensing systems would fall to the Home Office. As matters stand, I do not consider that it would have the expertise to conduct any form of sensible licensing system. I might add that if my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer were here, he would expect me to say that we do not have the resources to put such a scheme into place. On balance, therefore, the Government neither support nor oppose hunting, but we are certainly not inclined to regulate the activity.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I believe that licensing is the sensible and correct approach. I shall be brief because we may return to the matter later in our deliberations.
<P>
Many people in the fox control industry believe that it would be correct to have an independent professional licensing authority. That would eliminate the cowboys and those who conduct the process in an inhumane way, and it would allow those who can show that they use the most humane approach to carry on with their work. I hope that I had some small part to play in the inclusion in the Bill of clause 5, which will allow flushing from cover and shooting. It shows that the hon. Member for Worcester is listening and understanding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martyn Jones:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that licensing should apply to hunting on horseback with hounds? The fact that a fox is chased for hours on end is not particularly relevant in this connection.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> To some extent, the key issue with regard to licensing is not the fact that a horse pack is involved. Running from cover with hounds is clear and easy to understand. Another system of fox control, which is especially relevant in the hills, involves running an animal to ground, digging it out and disposing of it with, for example, a bullet--that is the preferred mode of terminating a fox's life among the packs that I have observed. Licensing should be used in that connection. The intention should be to use hounds not to tear the fox apart, but to identify where it has gone to ground and to finish the process accordingly.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that terrier dogs should be sent in to flush out the fox, so that it can be given a bullet?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> That is correct. I shall say a few words about terrier work, because this is the appropriate moment to do so. Many people say that it is not appropriate to license that approach because terrier work cannot be conducted humanely--the terrier will necessarily attack the fox. I do not believe that that is the case. I have spoken with professionals who adamantly profess to being able to train their terriers not to attack the fox. My own observations suggest that that is the case with at least some packs. I do not doubt that some terriers have attacked foxes and caused something of a blood-bath underground. However, with the right terrier men, that can be avoided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's argument about acceptable forms of terrier work. Does he subscribe to the view of the Wildlife Network, which is that there should be a time limit on the length of time that a terrier is underground trying to drive out the fox? Have his professional friends taught their terriers how to tell the time?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> The question of time limits is reasonable. I shall return to it later in our deliberations because it is a slight distraction from the point that I am trying to make. My point is that a licensing system could eliminate from the process of fox control those individuals who do not take seriously the valid concerns that have been expressed about some of the barbaric activities that are associated with terrier work. To restate my position, I believe that terrier work is not necessarily barbaric if it is handled by professionals in that right way. That is what should be licensed.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise to the Committee, but I must suspend our sitting for two minutes. I shall be back as soon as possible.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>12.17 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> The concern about terrier work is a valid subject for discussion, but I do not want to got into that too deeply. The crucial point is that there is plenty of evidence to suggest that terrier work can be carried out humanely. If that assumption is accepted, it should be acceptable to use a process of licensing to eliminate those who do not handle terrier work responsibly and to license those who do.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman inform the Committee whether, if amendment No. 28 falls, he intends to return to the subject of terrier work and to table an appropriate amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct and I shall return to the matter, which is why I am a little reluctant to discuss terrier work in too much detail now.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to professionalism and licensing. What criteria would he use for his licensing procedures? How would he decide who received a licence and who did not?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I am discussing the principle, but the criteria have already been suggested. I was at a meeting on Monday discussing detailed licensing criteria with a professional called Barry Wade. I shall bring the details to a future sitting so that the Committee can see them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman, like the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald, is still my hon. Friend. He seems to be saying that some aspects of hunting with hounds are humane and others inhumane. He has focused on terrier work, which he believes could be made more humane. I am confused as to which aspects of hunting are humane and which are not and how he came to that decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> For clarification, my apparently half-hearted acceptance of my hon. Friend's points was due to the fact that I am aware of taking up the Committee's time. It is a pleasure to hear from my hon. Friend on all matters, including the one before us. I am cautious of entering the debate that she suggests because we may end up with a nebulous anthology of my views on every aspect of hunting. She asked a sensible and appropriate question, but we shall return to the matter later. In the interests of brevity, I shall merely make two brief points on licensing, but I shall be happy to discuss the matters raised by my hon. Friend at a later stage in our proceedings.
<P>
My first remaining point is that, if it turns out that the majority of or all hunts in the United Kingdom are not effective in maintaining a humane, professional and sensitive approach to terrier work and so on, the licensing procedure would not preclude a ban based on the merits of each individual case. However, it goes without saying that many hunts conduct themselves responsibly.
<P>
My second remaining point is that many people, primarily those involved in agriculture, believe that running foxes to ground, digging them out and shooting them is a fairly efficient and essential part of how they protect their stock from attacks by foxes. We could discuss whether it is done most efficiently, but my concern is that the whole Committee should ensure that such processes are conducted in the most humane way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman approve of stag hunting being professionally registered and, therefore, continuing?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I have made my views on that clear. I am not a supporter of stag hunting, with hounds but the important point is that a system of licensing would enable the decision to be made on the basis of objective data. It would not preclude the abolition of stag hunting based on data which, I am told, is conclusive in showing that it is cruel. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
Many people involved in agriculture do not celebrate the control of foxes as a sport and would benefit greatly from the opportunity for reasonable treatment that the licensing system would allow. It would be incorrect to refuse a licensing system on the tactical grounds that resources do not allow it. Human rights are important in a liberal society and must not be fettered simply because it may cost a little to have a licensing system. There may even be ways of making the licensing process self funding.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Will my hon. Friend explain which human rights are under attack?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I advise the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire not to be tempted down that line of argument by his hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Thank you, Mr. Wells, for your advice. I see from the foxy smile of my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton that she is trying to lure me into a wider discussion than we should be having. To clarify the matter and using a less charged phrase, I believe that it is a matter of human rights for people to be able to conduct their business and specifically to control foxes in certain ways. A system of licensing would not preclude those who approach the matter sensibly and cautiously and who do not celebrate the death of a fox as the primary purpose, but instead wish to control foxes as they have done for many centuries. For that reason, I strongly support the introduction of a licensing system, which would get rid of the cowboys and allow those who control foxes to do it in the multifarious responsible ways available to them. The Bill is about banning not humane, but inhumane approaches. Licensing is a much more discriminating approach than the undiscriminating approach of banning the activity as a whole.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> I fundamentally disagree with the last point made by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. The work of Patrick Bateson and his team, as well as that of other scientists who have studied cruelty to animals, negates any consideration of licensing. Chasing mammals has been clearly shown to evoke in them a high level of stress and cruelty. That will remain a fact, however the process is licensed. Bateson's work has recently been published in The Royal Society's eminent journal and it will thus achieve international recognition. People who talk about licensing do not take on board the fact that the animal has rights too. That is fundamental and something that the Bill takes into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Bateson report refers exclusively to stag hunting and that there is no equivalent research into fox hunting?
<P>
<B>Dr Gibson:</B> Work is being carried out on other mammal populations, which, in its initial stage, is showing similar results. Different hormonal substances are involved, but the basic evidence is that animals suffer from stress. The leval of stress depends on factors such as distance and the scientific evidence will take some time to emerge, but the fundamental principle is that the animal suffers stress and cruelty. That will never change, even if the process is licensed.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I want to address amendment No. 28. I cannot see the point in creating a Bill that has within it the seeds of destruction of its main purpose. The Bill's main purpose--we may as well face it--is to abolish hunting foxes, hunting deer and coursing hares with packs of hounds.
<P>
If amendment No. 28 is accepted, any future Secretary of State will be able to specify that hunting foxes and deer and coursing hares are lawful. When I raised that objection the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish responded by saying that it was true that a Secretary of State could do that, but that he could do it anyway because any future Government could introduce new legislation. However, there is a huge difference between introducing legislation and amending legislation by statutory instrument. The one is an enormous proposition in terms of its imposition on the time of the House. The other, is a fairly minor proposition and much easier, as we all know, because we--especially the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish--are ever vigilant about what is delegated to secondary legislation.
<P>
We all know that secondary legislation puts considerable power into the hands of the Secretary of State and the Executive in a way that primary legislation does not. So the hon. Gentleman's answer to my objection was not convincing. I have sat on the Government Front Bench in many a Committee and been asked by him, ``Why are you dealing with matters in secondary legislation? Is it not just a way of bypassing the House?'' Yet now he suggests that the answer to my objection is secondary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I accept that there is a fine balance between what should and should not be dealt with by regulation, but suppose a future Government were to win a general election by including in their manifesto that they would reintroduce hunting--
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Most unlikely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Should that manifesto promise have to go through the whole legislative process or could it be implemented quickly?
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> In future, any manifesto promise can be dealt with in secondary legislation. We shall not have to go through the horrible bore of bringing primary legislation before the House to prove the case line by line and subjecting it to the various parliamentary stages. We stick a promise in a manifesto, we win an election and we introduce secondary legislation. I am not going to say that the hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense--that would be far too rude so early in our proceedings--but he knows that his arguments are not valid. I do not envisage a future Government who include such an election promise in their manifesto getting elected. I hope that no party will be tempted to go down that rather dubious route.
<P>
The amendment is not a negative amendment in the true sense of the word, but it would destroy the main purpose of the Bill. I think, from the reaction around me, that I do not have to do much urging, but if I were to, I would urge my temporary hon. Friends to reject the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> I am saddened by the right hon. Lady's last comment about her temporary hon. Friends. I would have thought that the spirit of cheer at this time of the year could be extended to more than just temporary--we may disagree on some matters, but we respect each other.
<P>
I am also saddened that you, Mr. Wells, did not allow the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to develop his ideas on a new protocol for the European convention on human rights. We would have been interested to see which part of the Human Rights Bill, which is going through another place, contains a human right to tear animals to bits. I am sure that our fellow signatories to the European convention on human rights would have greatly enjoyed the hon. Gentleman's idea. Presumably the Spaniards would have supported his proposed course of action, but it is hard to believe that many others would have done so.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman not feel that some questions of personal liberty are associated with the Bill? That was my point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> But not with this clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> In amendment No. 28, proposed subsection (6)(c) says ``the times at which''. Perhaps that deals with the point made by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. I am always worried about the question of personal liberty--when one person's idea of liberty infringes on another's. Where do we draw the line? Do we say that other sentient beings do not have rights?
<P>
I do not go overboard on animal rights; I do not regard animals as on a par with human beings. When I introduced my Bill on this subject, I received many letters saying that only human beings pollute the planet and that animals are pure, upright and special. It is true that we do pollute the planet, but with a degree of intelligence, we should be able to overcome that. That aim has the support of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>
As for licensing, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire was trying to do what my temporary right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald described. He said that in some situations, the hunt was humane. I am a bit lost on that. The same argument is advanced about hare coursing. It is said that the point of hare coursing is not killing the hare; it is seeing the extent to which the hounds can turn and show off their dexterity and training. The hare, which is unfortunately pulled to pieces in a tug-of-war, is an incidental to training the hounds and to achieving a proper points system for them. We are sad about the poor hare, but not really bothered about it. That seems a strange argument to be applied to hunting animals such as foxes and stags. We already have scientific evidence relating to the stag and we may acquire evidence about the fox. But, should we license people to kill animals humanely when the very means that such people use to capture and pursue foxes are not humane at all? The dogs are bred purely and simply for stamina--for the joy of the chase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Will my hon. Friend deal with mink? I am sure that he listened to the points made on Second Reading by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme. Hunting mink could well be the most efficient way of exterminating a pest that is destroying the natural habitat.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> I will not pursue that matter because I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) is keen to speak on it. She is an expert and I do not want to obscure her limelight. She is the best one to deal with mink.
<P>
Let me return to the debate over the ``efficient'' killing of foxes by dogs. I was saying that both stag and fox hounds are trained for stamina, not speed of kill--a crucial point. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire needs to recognise that it is not possible to have a humane hunt. We either have or do not have a hunt--we cannot have a humane one.
<P>
I want to move on to terrier work. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire argued that some terrier work is positively humane. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester asked him when a terrier knows that his time is up. How quickly is a terrier going to respond to being told, ``Come in, No. 2, your time is up''? Is a terrier supposed to think, ``I've been trained not to attack a fox, but if one has a go at me in desperation, I am going to turn the other cheek''? Many of us may have been urged on occasions to turn the other cheek, but I doubt whether a terrier is likely to--especially when it is down a hole and is as frightened as the fox. That should not be allowed to continue.
<P>
I was pleased to hear my hon. Friend the Minister say that I was young, active, virile, good looking and handsome--
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I think that my hon. Friend read rather too much into my words.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> I gather that the Minister is only temporarily my hon. Friend. I was unsure whether I heard him right when he said that the Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Defence were reviewing their policy on the Bill. If the Bill is passed, they will not have to review anything, that will be it, full stop. So what exactly does my hon. Friend mean? Will representatives come here to listen to the arguments and decide whether they will allow hunts to be carried out on their land?
<P>
Recently, it has emerged that some huntsmen have resorted to blackmail over the use for hunting of certain parts of Ministry of Defence land. They have said that their land cannot be used for military training unless they can use Ministry of Defence land for hunting. Is the proper use of Ministry of Defence land, which is for the training of troops for the defence of the realm and other roles such as United Nations peacekeeping in Bosnia, to be put on a par with chasing after a furry four-legged animal? Really.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> For the sake of clarification, I meant that the Ministry of Defence and the Forestry Commission have already noted the expressed will of Parliament. They are looking for alternatives to hunting as a means of controlling the populations of wild mammals on their land.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> May I say how pleased I am by that reply? The Under-Secretary of State is back in my good books and has become a permanent friend. His point is important because it clarifies the ambiguity of his earlier statement. We now know that the Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Defence are positively considering alternatives to hunting to control foxes, hares and other animals on their land. That is splendid news. We should chalk it up and say ``Well done'' to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and to Ministers in other Departments.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish--temporary hon. Friend is the current term to use--would disrupt the Bill. It is completely against the will of the House as expressed on 28 November. The House did not say that it wanted hunting with hounds to be abolished except in certain circumstances.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish referred to pest control. That problem is adequately dealt with by clause 5, which tidies up and changes any technical glitches in the existing provisions. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester will be happy to deal with them.
<P>
The amendment goes too far. When he moved it, my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said that he hoped that the licensing provisions would not affect deer, because the Bateson report on the cruelty to deer caused by hunting had been clear. I am sorry, but amendment No. 28 would affect deer. It does not refer to species of wild mammal excluding deer; it refers to the ``species of wild mammal'' that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may by Order made by statutory instrument specify''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
can be hunted.
<P>
It is not possible to draft an amendment to do what my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said he wanted. His amendment would allow for the hunting of foxes, hare, deer, mink and for terrier work. On 28 November, the House clearly said that it was against that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Would it not be easier to deal with the proposed subsection (6)(a) by tabling amendments that cater for individual species of mammals at a later date? The amendment would give the Secretary of State fairly open-ended powers.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> There are dangers if every time someone raises a problem with the Bill, an amendment is tabled to deal with it. If genuine issues are not covered by the Bill as presented to the House on 28 November, they should be dealt with as issues. We should not draft amendments every time an objection is raised.
<P>
Amendment No. 28 does not state who would be responsible for saying that there is a problem and it does not state the circumstances under which the Secretary of State would issue an order. It is curious that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the purposes of promoting animal welfare'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
hunting should be allowed. I can think of no circumstances when it would be in the interests of animal welfare for hunting to be allowed.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) was referring to the control of specific species in the wild when he described me as an expert on mink. I assure members of the Committee that that does not mean that I would ever wear a mink coat. On 28 November, the House heard the terrible problems that mink cause in this country. We heard that they were destructive and detrimental to the countryside and, therefore, we needed to have mink hunting. Do we not have mink hunting now and still have problems with mink? If mink hunting in any way solved the problems, we would not have them now. One cannot argue that we have problems with mink, therefore we need mink hunting. We have mink hunting now, but mink still cause serious problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Does my hon. Friend think that if mink were not hunted it would be feasible to exterminate them? They are a foreign species.

<P>

<B>Angela Smith:</B> I am not convinced that it is possible at this stage to exterminate mink, but even if it were, the way to do so is not by hunting them with hounds. Where the numbers of mink have fallen, it is because they have been killed by otters. It is to their great shame that Members of the House of Commons argued against the Bill to protect otters when it was going through--
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Surely it is the other way round; otters have been ruthlessly hunted by wild mink. That is one of the biggest and most pernicious problems associated with the animals.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I do not dispute the hon. Gentleman's point, but I am concerned that we should not fall into the trap of saying that mink hunting will control, or have any effect on, mink numbers. Any hon. Member who is worried about pest control can table amendments to clause 5; I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester will be happy to consider them.
<P>
Amendment No. 28 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it shall be lawful to hunt with dogs, for the purposes of promoting animal welfare and the control of specific species''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could apply to terrier work. I can think of no circumstances in which it would be humane--terrier work is barbaric. In cases, reported in the pro-hunting press, terriers have been put down earths after foxes and have been lost. Those reports should be examined in detail before amendments to the Bill are tabled.
<P>
I do not accept that it is possible to limit terrier work and amendments on the subject should be tabled as soon as possible so that we can debate them fully. It is impossible to train a terrier not to attack a fox, and a fox in fear might attack a terrier. I have seen photographs and film of a terrier and a fox brought out of a hole locked jaw to jaw; they had to be separated with a spade. Legislation cannot prevent such things happening.
<P>
The amendment states that it shall be lawful to hunt with dogs. It does not specify the form of hunting--it could be fox hunting, hare coursing, deer hunting, mink hunting or terrier work. That decision lies solely with the Secretary of State. If the House passes a measure that makes it clear that it wants those activities to be banned, as it did on 28 November, then, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald said--I am delighted to call her my right hon. Friend on this occasion--
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Only on this occasion.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> A temporary right hon. Friend. Although one never knows; stranger things have happened in politics, especially among the Tories.
<P>
A future Secretary of State should not be able to overturn the will of the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Let us be clear. It would not be the will of a future Secretary of State, but the will of the House of Commons. The Secretary of State would be able to put such a proposal to the House only if the House were prepared to go along with an affirmative resolution.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Secondary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I accept, as the right hon. Lady said, that it would be secondary legislation and therefore quicker, but it is still a question of the future will of the House to make changes. Without that will, the Secretary of State could not act.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> But secondary legislation is a different kind of will. The will of the House was expressed on 28 November. We cannot force the Bill into law before it has passed through all its stages. Any attempt to unravel the measure should go through the same procedures as the Bill.
<P>
I urge members of the Committee to reject this bad, wrecking amendment. It does not represent the will of the House of Commons as expressed on 28 November.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I oppose the amendment for three reasons. First, as my hon. Friends--temporary and otherwise--made it clear, if the will of the House is expressed and the Bill is enacted, to allow a future Secretary of State to overturn it by means of secondary legislation is not the proper way to make law. If I have interpreted the wording correctly, a future Secretary of State could decide which species could be hunted. He or she would not be limited to a particular species. Therefore, a future Secretary of State could decide to hunt badgers.
<P>
When the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish moved the amendment, he picked on badgers as a species that caused problems. A constituent attended my advice surgery and asked why badgers were not hunted. I looked blankly at him, and he explained, ``Badgers don't run fast enough, that's why''.
<P>
The second reason for opposing the amendment is its ambiguity.
<P>
	It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it shall be lawful to hunt with dogs for the purposes of promoting animal welfare''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A definition of ``promoting'' is advertising, or telling people that an action is good. A Secretary of State would not want to tell people that it was good or in the interests of animal welfare to chase animals with dogs. The amendment's wording is sloppy.
<P>
The third reason for rejecting the amendment is on practical grounds. If the Bill is passed, packs of hounds will disband. There will be no purpose in continuing to keep and feed trained hounds if hunting is not allowed. If the amendment was accepted, and the Secretary of State did not like the behaviour of a particular species and allowed it to be hunted in an emergency, how would the Government re-establish disbanded packs of hounds? Once the so-called sport was banned, it would be impractical to reintroduce the practice of hunting a particular species in an emergency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The Committee should reject the amendment for one simple reason. The Bill bans hunting with hounds; the amendment would allow the practice to continue. Many members of the Committee have pointed out that the amendment would give the Home Secretary the power to decide which species could be hunted, and when they could be hunted. My hon. Friend the Minister will agree that my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) is all-wise and all-powerful.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> In all ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> In all ways. However, as my temporary right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and the Weald knows, that it not the case with every Home Secretary! Therefore, we would not want such a power placed solely in the hands of a Secretary of State. Any attempt to reintroduce hunting with hounds should be made through primary legislation, and political parties that wished to do that should admit their intentions. There is a term for the political party that wishes to do that: the Opposition. Nevertheless, a party that wished to reintroduce the practice should try to do that through a Bill, not through the amendment which would enable change with hardly and recourse to Parliament.
<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire mentioned terrier work; I await his proposals with interest. However, I am sceptical about a licensing system. The definition of ``humane'' is crucial. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) spoke about the stress that mammals experience, and evidence exists to show that Bateson's findings on stags and deer could also apply to foxes. We await the outcome of the research.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman realise that similar data exist on fish?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Fish are not the subject of the Bill. There is evidence that cold-blooded animals do not feel pain in the same way as wild mammals.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Fish are not mammals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I realise that--at least they are not yet.
<P>
There is evidence about everything, although we have to decide whether it is evidence or opinion.
<P>
There is evidence about everything, although we have to decide whether it is evidence or opinion I find it hard to understand--as most people will--how the fact that the terriers would not bite the fox when they reached it would lead to a reduction in the stress on the fox. Perhaps the terriers will wear helpful tee-shirts or carry cards, which say, ``I won't bite you when I get there.'' That will be of no great benefit to the fox.
<P>
There is also a matter of quality control. If a licensing system were introduced, and dogs were trained to act in the way proposed by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, who would check it? Who will check that person X is licensed and that his dogs are trained? Will they have to do dog obedience tests before a licence can be granted?
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> I am entertained by the hon. Member's musings on the subject, but will he accept that there might be ways in which to create a self-funding system of regulation? Many people in the industry would be willing to contribute to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I fear that people in the industry are the last people whom we would want to regulate the matter and check that the hon. Gentleman's good proposals happened in reality. It we allowed such a system of regulation in any form at all, it would be abused, all the Bill's good intentions would be distorted and the practice that we want to outlaw would continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> With relation to the terrier work aspect referred to by my hon. Friend, many of those who hunt have told me that they do so to control elderly and sick foxes. The healthy foxes escape, either by out-pacing the hunt or by going underground. The regulation of terrier work would run counter to that practice because it would permit the killing of healthy foxes, which I am told do not pose a great threat to lambs, chickens and young piglets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, and look forward to future amendments on the subject of terrier work. Such amendments are not likely to be persuasive, but we shall have to wait and see.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish made the point that there will inevitably be occasions when we need to cull mammals in the countryside. Only yesterday, the Government accepted the report of the Krebs inquiry, which was to establish whether there was a link between bovine TB and badgers. Badgers will inevitably be culled in an attempt to control bovine TB. As other hon. Members have pointed out, however, that culling would never be done by hunting with hounds. If there was a significant health risk or some other reason for controlling wild animals in the countryside, culling would have to be done by an efficient and effective method that would lead to the desired end result. Hunting with hounds and terrier work will never achieve that.
<P>
The amendment would result only in the opening of a back door, which would allow a practice that the British people and the House of Commons want abolished.

<P>

<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman realise that we are about to conclude the first sitting of the Committee and that we have not yet dealt with even the first group of amendments? Only one Conservative Member has wanted to contribute, and has contributed, to the debate so far. May we have an understanding that there will not be the scintilla of a suggestion during the Committee's sittings that Conservative Members are attemptinag to filibuster? Can we not be patronised on that matter by any further speeches from the hon. Member for Worcester or any other hon. Member? Our contribution is constructive. If the hon. Gentleman cannot get through even the first group of amendments on the first day of the Committee, that is a matter for him and for his hon. Friends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I welcome the hon. Member's comments. He is obviously as keen to get the Bill on the statute book as we all are, but we have a commitment to good legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Given the comments made by the hon. Member for Banbury, does he not accept that our debates are an important part of the scrutiny process? That is why we have Committees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. The amendment is important; it sets the tone for our discussions throughout the Committee's sittings. This is an abolitionist Bill, and although I understand the intentions of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, I do not welcome the amendment. I hope that the Committee will join me in rejecting it.
