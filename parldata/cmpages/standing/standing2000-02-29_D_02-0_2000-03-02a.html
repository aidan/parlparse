<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We begin with clause 2 and amendment No. 61. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I say now that there is a potential overlap between this group of amendments and a group of amendments that was debated and rejected at our first sitting. I shall be listening carefully to ensure that points raised during this morning's debate are new points and not a repeat of Tuesday's debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt: The last thing that I want to do is to repeat our debate on clause 1. The amendments to clause 2 are designed to deal with custody after charge. We dealt with the question of custody before charge when debating the amendments to clause 1 about custody officers that were moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury </B>(Mr. Key). Although those amendments were rejected, I have had time to refine those ideas so that we can give the armed forces the flexibility that they need to deal with custody after charge and to make the system bombproof against taking their cases to the European court under the European convention on human rights.
<P>
The amendments are simple and straightforward. They would simply add the words "or custodial" between the words "judicial" and "officer", so that either a judicial officer or a custodial officer could adjudicate on the continuation of the custody of someone who has been charged.
<P>
I wonder, Mr. Malins, whether you could give me some guidance. We are presumably debating new clause 2 with this group of amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Malins. I shall start by dealing with new clause 2 and the definition of a custodial officer.
<P>
Clause 2 includes provisions for a judicial officer, but I believe that, for custody after charge, we should allow not only judicial officers to adjudicate on whether a suspect who has been charged should be remanded in custody; we should also allow custodial officers to adjudicate in such cases. The difficulty is that it may be difficult in an operational environment to ensure that a judicial officer is available every eight days or every 28 days, when it may be necessary to remand someone in custody again.
<P>
The Bill makes clear the difficulty of getting, judicial officers in touch with suspects, because it contains a provision for video links. The difficulty of ensuring that judicial officers are in a position to make adjudications on custody is recognised. The Government are unable to produce a draft statutory instrument that sets out how electronic and media links will work. The civilian system has only limited experience of video links between prisons and to facilitate children giving evidence. We have to make a decision on bandwidths and the electronic spectrum that is available to the military. It is a difficult statutory instrument to draft, which is no doubt why the Government have not produced it. Had it been easier, the Minister would have acceded to my request on Second Reading to see a draft statutory instrument. That would have allowed us to see how they will write the regulations to enable the judicial officer to adjudicate on custody cases. An alternative arrangement of custodial officers would assist the armed forces.
<P>
If there is no judicial officer to adjudicate on whether someone should be remanded in custody, the amendment would provide an alternative in the form of a custodial officer. He would be a commissioned officer, as defined in the new clause, who has been trained in the proper tests to apply for custody and court martial procedure. To avoid the problem of custodial officers being associated with the commanding officer, who is part of the summary justice system for the individual concerned, new clause 2 recommends that custodial officers should be appointed by the general commanding officer, depending on the service. That appointment would be two steps removed in the chain of command. Custodial officers would permanently take on the responsibility and would be able, in whatever theatre of operations the armed forces were acting in, to make decisions. That would enable the armed forces to meet the enormous difficulty that the Government face in trying to ensure that judicial officers are in the right place.
<P>
<B>Laura Moffatt </B>(Crawley): The hon. Gentleman and I served on the Select Committee on Defence. Our in-depth consideration of defence medical services made it clear that video services were crucial. Video links are not the problem. It is the poorest reason to say that, because we may have difficulty setting up such links, we should deny people access to proper legal advice and instead have someone who may not be trained. That cannot be justified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her intervention, which exposes some of the issues and misconceptions. I thoroughly enjoyed our time on the Defence Committee and valued her expertise on defence medical services, but it does not apply to this issue. The problem of video links will be discussed later, but we must consider the difficulties associated with bandwidth and whether the picture will be good enough to allow the judicial officer to see the defendant. It is plainly not an easy matter. Otherwise, the Government would have produced a statutory instrument or included it in a schedule to the Bill.
<P>
The proposed alternative deals simply with remand, which used to be in the hands of the commanding officer. No one can say that it is unfair for a commanding officer to make decisions on remanding prisoners in custody based on legal advice obtained from the Army Legal Corps, which is the usual means for making such judgments. That is regular procedure, and it was followed in my regiment, where the commanding officer remanded people facing serious charges every eight days. A prisoner would be marched out of the guardroom and taken before the commanding officer. He would then be formally remanded and go back into a further eight days' custody while the pre-trial procedure continued. That is the simple procedure currently in place.
<P>
We are being told, however, that following the European court judgment in the case of Findlay--if I am correct--that is not acceptable. That is why such matters will now be dealt with by judicial officers. Those officers are, however, enormously expensive and it will sometimes be difficult for them to adjudicate on the simple remand decisions in question. We propose an alternative system of custodial officers who are not commanding officers but commissioned officers trained to whatever standards in custody law are deemed appropriate. They would be appointed by a major-general, an air vice marshal or a rear admiral two steps up the command chain and removed from the commanding officer himself. Such an alternative to judicial officers would provide flexibility when it was not possible for them to make remand decisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Viggers </B>(Gosport): I am following my hon. Friend's arguments carefully and I support his proposal. Has he given thought to whether the custodial officer would be a senior officer--a major or above and the equivalent in each of the services? Has he also given thought to the length of training required for custodial officers and to whether such officers would be within or outside the chain of command?
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I have given thought to those matters. I am obviously relying on my Army experience, but I believe that the general commanding officer would be likely to appoint such people. It is also likely that the post would relate to one of the divisional troops. The major commanding a Royal Military Police company would be part of the divisional troops available to the general officer in command, as would the equivalent in the other two services. Anyone to do with the military is part of a chain of command, which is the difficulty that we face in the Bill. The armed services are part of a chain of command starting with our Sovereign. We have discussed the independence of the judiciary and the legal system, but whatever system one creates, a case can be made to the European court to say that it is not independent. That applies not least because we live under a rather wonderful and peculiar constitution in the United Kingdom. Our constitution is unwritten, and the rules establishing the independence of the judiciary, the purpose of the Lord Chancellor being part of the Government and so on will be explored by the European court under the convention.
<P>
The amendments seek to present a reasonable alternative using the judgment of reasonable people, which, following the Findlay judgment, can be used by the armed services as a satisfactory alternative to expensive judicial officers. We should bear it in mind that such officers are either permanently employed as lawyers with an additional overhead or have to be brought in and paid a fee for their services to remand people in custody. Allowing a major commanding an RMP detachment. a lieutenant or a commissioned officer trained in custody law to exercise judgment on whether somebody should be in custody would solve a vast part of the problem of the legal overheads imposed on the armed forces by the new custody rules. It is a substantial overhead, and the cost is being borne by the Ministry of Defence, as was made clear in the other place, but every opportunity we have to reduce the burden on the defence budget and to invest that money in the front-line capability of the armed forces, rather than on legal overhead, is a step forward. If we can establish a system of custodial officers, we will reduce that legal overhead.
<P>
My amendments are different from those tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key). Instead of deleting "judicial" and inserting "duty", as my hon. Friend's amendment would, I propose to include the words, "a judicial or custodial officer." That would give the armed forces the opportunity to use a system of custodial officers to see whether it works.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If someone were to challenge that successfully in the European Court, at the appropriate moment, in a quinquennial Bill or on the happy day that we have a tri-service discipline Act, the words "or custodial officer" could simply be deleted. The amendment would give the armed forces flexibility to try out a system that consists of a general officer in command, who appoints a custodial officer, who is outside the immediate chain of command of the individual, and who is a reasonable person in the judgment of reasonable people--which the European court judges should be but, in the eyes of the armed forces, have not always been as a result of the peculiar decisions that they have made.
<P>
The amendment does not prevent the use of judicial officers if they happen to be easier and more available, but the system that I propose will certainly be considerably cheaper and easier to administer. Therefore, I hope that the Minister and his officials, who, I hope, have had an opportunity during the past 24 hours to examine the proposals, will see that the amendment takes nothing away from the Bill. The proposals give the armed forces flexibility and, if it is decided that the system of custodial officers works, it will offer an alternative to the issue of remand in custody and present the opportunity to remove a huge administrative burden from the armed forces and the defence budget. Therefore, I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I support my hon. Friend's amendment, which would extend the Bill to include the words "or custodial" because I am deeply concerned about the requirement that there should be a judicial officer to review the cases of those held in custody.
<P>
I want my first words in Committee to pay tribute to the armed forces because I do not want anyone to say that any comment about judicial or custodial procedures is a slight on those who serve in our armed forces. I have been extremely fortunate to be in service in the Royal Air Force and the Territorial Army, as well as to be a member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Defence and the NATO parliamentary assembly. That experience has given me the opportunity to see our forces in action, flying aeroplanes and shooting them down, as well as in the trenches, in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and the Adriatic. I have also had the chance to compare our armed forces with those of other nations. Although it might be over the top to say that one knows that one's own armed forces are the best in the world, I have certainly had extended opportunity to compare our armed forces with those of other countries and can think of no better armed forces anywhere. They are exemplary.
<P>
We are concerned to ensure that there are fair and proper processes of law in the armed forces because, due to the stresses and strains under which people serving in the armed forces are put, there are about 6,000 cases a year in which a man or woman needs to be disciplined and there are occasions when a case of summary justice or a court martial is necessary.
<P>
It is important that we account in our procedures for the difficult circumstances in which the armed forces might find themselves, and we should carefully examine the proposed changes in the legal procedures for handling cases against service men and women. That is why I resent the Government getting the Bill so wrong. By requiring themselves to implement the European convention on human right law this year, they made it necessary to advance the Bill ahead of the quinquennial procedures, instead of waiting until next year.
<P>
A quinquennial review will occur in Januarv 2001 under the Armed Forces Act 1966. The Committees in 1986, 1989 and 1991--two of which I chaired--had the opportunity to take evidence in detail, as shall the next one. Evidence is required in such procedures and individual members of that Committee might make visits. The 1991 Committee visited Germany and Colchester and talked with people in the chain of command to ensure that the procedures were right. So be it--we are where we are.
<P>
I should like to apologise for my absence from the Committee last Tuesday; I shall also be absent next Tuesday. I was, and shall be, at the Royal Hospital Haslar, the only tri-service hospital left in the armed forces, which the Government are trying to close, making it the largest cause celebre in my constituency. It is crucial for the armed forces, which is why I must ask permission to be absent.
<P>
Judicial officers must be qualified to be judge advocates, or be barristers or solicitors of five years' standing. You, Mr. Malins, and I know the qualification to be of great repute, Such individuals will be expensive because they might not be involved in the direct action of the Army, Navy or Air Force. They are passengers on the military vehicle, who will need to be brought in as extras to take the responsibility. I am profoundly concerned that there will be difficulties with the extended communications of the three services and with arranging for a judicial officer to be taken to the area in which the case must be heard or getting the accused to a judicial officer. If neither option can happen, there must be video conferencing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) referred to the video conferencing links in Defence Medical Services. I appreciate the fact the she and others took the trouble to come to the Royal Hospital Haslar.
<P>
I looked at the video conferencing facilities at the hospital on Tuesday, and was told by the officer in command that they do not use moving pictures. Moving picture video facilities are available and are used in medicine elsewhere, including in the United States. However, Army, Air Force and Navy doctors, who form one of the elite units in the world, have found that moving pictures do not give the reliability and certainty of still pictures, which allow them to achieve higher accuracy. They have still photographs sent from Bosnia, the Falklands, Cyprus and elsewhere. On Tuesday, I saw detailed photographs of wounds suffered by personnel around the world and the difference between still and moving pictures.
<P>
Video facilities require extensive back-up. The nearest unemployed lance corporal cannot be given a video camera and asked to film something; proper facilities are needed, When children in child abuse cases are put on video for court purposes, they go to prepared studios and are filmed by specially skilled technicians. The quality of the technical back-up is high. That is relevant to the way which the judicial officer will exercise his discretion. If a judicial officer cannot be taken to the forum of war, conflict or difficulty, he will watch a film, possibly in the United Kingdom. There is no guarantee that the quality of the film will be good enough for him to ascertain the circumstances of the charge or of the individual involved. I am profoundly concerned that no detail of the video facilities has been produced.
<P>
Tricks can be used in video links. When I was a Northern Ireland Minister, we set up a video link between London and Belfast to cut down on travel. Up to six individuals could be filmed at each end. Encrypted studios were prepared in London and Belfast. If I wanted to put a case before the Secretary of State and we were both in Belfast, I would fly from Belfast to London so that we were facing each other on camera and not sitting side by side in front of a camera. Every photograph can tell a lie; every video can mislead. Until we have detailed explanations of how video links will work, we should not pass the Bill. As I said on the Floor of the House, I am deeply concerned because the Bill could be introduced only by a Government who do not care too much about the armed forces and by Ministers who have not served in the armed forces.
<P>
We need to know how video links will work and that judicial officers will be able to fulfil their role. That is why I am enthusiastic about the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt). He has wide experience in the armed forces and knows that independent, impartial officers of an appropriate rank can be trained to provide custodial services and to stand in for the judicial services, which can be provided at the front only with difficulty.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Is my hon. Friend aware that because of the limited width of the band in the Falklands, the armed forces have to buy time on commercial satellites, which is available only when a satellite is overhead? They have to prioritise their traffic so that only the most important transmissions go on the military satellite. In an important military engagement, what would be the priority--the  judicial officer who receives the signals or the important military traffic coming from that location?
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I did not know that. To extend that idea slightly, every pound of payload in aircraft that goes to and from the Falkland islands--which is possible now that there is an airfield--is considered carefully before it is authorised. It might not be possible to bring the accused back to the United Kingdom if the payload on the available aircraft is required for essential military stores. In those circumstances, video links would be necessary. I have no idea how the armed forces would prioritise the use of video links between the UK and the Falkland islands. Priority might have to be given to essential military intelligence. Mercifully, we have no problem in the Falkland islands at the moment, but the same argument could be applied throughout the world, where facilities might be less developed. My hon. Friend puts his finger on an important point.
<P>
When Ministers were advised that it was necessary under the European convention on human rights to conduct an external review through judicial officers, some fairly bright spark must have asked,"What happens if we cannot get the judicial officer to the field of action and the accused back?" A slightly brighter spark would have said, "No problem; we can use video links." As information technology is the darling of the stock exchange and video links are the all-embracing cop-out for Ministers in trouble, they said, "Fine, let's use video links." However, they have not thought it through. Until they do so and it can be demonstrated to us that the system will work and will be valid and operable, we should not agree to the Bill or to the clause as drafted. I therefore support my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate and his useful amendment. It would get the Government off a difficult hook and I hope that they will accept it.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell </B>(Tatton): I could read this Committee quite a lecture on the distortions of video, but I do not think that this is the time or place. [Hon. Members: "Yes it is".] We are discussing words, and I have had to coin a new word, "bombproofability". I am impressed by the proposals made by the hon. Member for Reigate, which have merit on two grounds: practicality and cost. I am not sure, however, about compliance with the European convention on human rights. I shall listen with interest to what the Minister says about that and will vote accordingly. We should be trying to do three things: A, stop the lawyers from enriching themselves too much at the expense of soldiers and taxpayers; B, construct a system that has the necessary bombproofability; and C, safeguard soldiers' rights. We should be trying to do the latter most of all. That is why the first Division in the previous sitting dismayed me so much. I shall listen with interest to the Minister's remarks. I venture to suggest that the first Labour Member who dares to break ranks with the party line will earn from me an honourable mention in my forthcoming political memoir as one of the independent-minded Members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Key </B>(Salisbury): I should begin by saying that it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Malins, as this sitting is the first in which you have been in the Chair. I should like also to congratulate the hon. Member for Crawley on speaking.
<P>
I hope that the experience gained by the Government during the weeks in which the Bill is considered in Committee will not be wasted. I make it clear to the Minister that we have not tabled wrecking amendments, for which the Bill is far too important. We do not need wrecking amendments and we are genuinely concerned with improving the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr. Lewis Moonie):</B> Let me make it clear that I accept that. During our first sitting, I said that the second group of amendments considered would have the effect of wrecking amendments, which is slightly different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that clarification, as the allegation that I had tabled wrecking amendments hurt. It is not in my nature to wreck anything. When I had a proper job as a teacher at Loretto school in Musselburgh, my bedroom window looked over the Firth of Forth at Kirkcaldy. I know that the Under-Secretary knows that Royal Navy ships pass up and down the Firth of Forth, between his bedroom window and mine. It could therefore never be claimed that either of us have no knowledge of military affairs. [Interruption.] I am trying to be generous, and, in that spirit, I should say that I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his remarks.
<P>
We have not tabled wrecking amendments; we have a good point, which is why I support the proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate. We will debate video links later, when we consider clause 8. However, they are an important point of practicality in relation to the clause before us. My hon. Friend's amendments are important because they would provide the flexibility that will be necessary if things go wrong. I am worried that the Government are seeking to introduce a system that relies entirely on video links when a judicial officer is not present. The chances of a judicial officer being present are somewhat slim, which is why flexibility is sensible. In military circumstances, "What if?" tends to be the norm.
<P>
Hon. Members from both sides of the Committee have visited places where it is not possible at the flick of a switch to turn on a video link--or, for that matter, the internet. We should explore the use of the internet as well, because in medical circumstances, it can be used to great effect. It is very good in helping doctors to treat dermatology cases and in the diagnosis of burn problems and other wounds. My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) is right to say that one can gain so much more from a still picture on the internet than from a video link, provided that the screen has enough pixels. However, even more than using a military satellite link, that raises the question of confidentiality.
<P>
We are not wrecking or being anti-technology. We are not sticking our heads in the sand. Far from it; we want to make the Bill work. We have made it clear that we do not like the Bill. The Opposition believe that the Government should have adopted a different approach. However, if we are going to have such a system, it really should work in the interests of our service men and women. We must make provision for what should happen when a video link fails or cannot be established.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate mentioned training. I know that the Ministry of Defence is undertaking a lot of training in preparing the services for the introduction of the Bill, and I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary would tell us what training is being given in respect of this part of the Bill. I know that it is a really big rush to get all three services ready to cope with the introduction of the Bill's provisions by October. What training is going on? Training must be given for the technology, and we have been told that trials are being held. A helpful parliamentary question was answered last night, which I shall refer to when we reach clause 8. Nevertheless, we need to know what training is being given.
<P>
I like the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate that the custody officer would be two steps up the chain of command. That would make him sufficiently removed from the immediate command position. Will the Under-Secretary say whether the situation is different for the Royal Navy? As far as I remember, judicial officers in the Royal Navy are barristers in uniform. There is a rather different ethos in the Navy, which might make a difference. It is likely that the judicial officer will be serving on a ship, possibly a large ship, such as an aircraft carrier. The Navy seems to have got it right. It would have an option in those circumstances that would not be available to the Royal Air Force or the Army.
<P>
These are simple amendments. It is right that the military should have the flexibility to deal with eventualities of a sort that could never happen in Crawley or Salisbury. We should anticipate those problems and assist the Under-Secretary to make the Bill workable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> My hon. Friend mentioned aircraft carriers and said that the Royal Navy had the situation in hand in that respect, but we have many more smaller service ships and submarines than aircraft carriers. How does my hon. Friend envisage the system working in a submarine on extended service?
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> We had a little debate about submarines under the polar ice cap and elsewhere during the previous sitting. The answer is, or course, that the system would not work. That is why I have asked for clarification of the naval position--and the Under-Secretary will no doubt oblige us--although my hon. Friend is right to say that what counts is practicality. As Baroness Symons pointed out in another place, there is a flexibility clause, which underpins the argument--I paraphrase it--that says, "or as soon as is practicable". However, what is "as soon as is practicable" if one is on a three-month underwater tour of duty? We hope that that would not arise in a submarine. The hon. Gentleman is experienced in the matter.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It has never happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I could not resist intervening because the Under-Secretary interjected that the situation had never arisen. The Bill must take account of what might happen. The fact that the Royal Navy has had an exemplary discipline record on its submarines, has a stiff selection policy and that people on board have been well commanded and led is a tribute to it. However, discipline Acts must give the commanding officer the ability to deal with any situation that might be encountered. Like the nuclear deterrent, the power will, we hope, never be used. Its absence is a lacuna.

<P>

<B>Mr. Key:</B> That is absolutely right; the Opposition have been seeking to explore that and will continue to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> My hon. Friend has rightly noted that there is a flexibility clause. However, what is to stop a man from suing a commanding officer for inappropriately exercising flexibility provisions that he decided needed to be applied? Anyone who has not thought the question through should read an article from the Daily Mail earlier this week, in which General de la Billiere noted the danger in which the Bill is putting the armed forces.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Yes; as the Under-Secretary said, the question of suing has been explored and refuted. There has always been an ability to sue an officer, but normally the Ministry has been sued. We return to the fundamental point--why did the Government so respond to my parallel amendments? They said that having duty officers in the same place as judicial officers would render the Bill incompatible with the European convention on human rights. Their legal advice, though no doubt well intentioned, was not right. The major question addressed by the amendment must still be answered.
<P>
On 10 February, my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate asked the Minister for the Armed Forces, who was giving evidence to the Defence Committee, about the Bill's strength against a possible challenge under the ECHR. That is perhaps why my hon. Friend has tabled the amendments. He asked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Can you guarantee that this Bill ... and the new system of military justice that it brings in, would be proof against ECHR judgments?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) called that the "bomb proof ability" of the Bill. The Minister replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I could no more guarantee that than the Member for Mid-Sussex could have guaranteed it when it was introduced in the 1996 legislation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Strangely, the Government are introducing legislation to ensure ECHR compliance, but cannot guarantee that it will do the job. What, then, is the point? Judicial officers will cause just a small part of the extra administrative costs. I would like a firm statement from the Under-Secretary to clarify why they are pursuing the Bill so far if they cannot guarantee that our summary justice system will not be open to challenge in the ECHR.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will no doubt cite the legal advice that he has received, but the ECHR is surely unchanging. Some might say that that is its problem. What would he need to do to make our armed forces' discipline 100 per cent. safe?
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> My hon. Friend said that the ECHR was unchanging, but the difficulty is that it is not. When we signed up to the convention in 1951, everyone assumed that the armed forces would not be affected. By 1974, when France acceded to the convention, the whole climate of how the ECHR worked had changed, so that France obtained a derogation for its armed forces. Now, 26 years later, the convention has changed fundamentally in its approach. That is the problem we would not be in this position if we had known on accession what we know now.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The text is unchanged, but my hon. Friend is right. Lord Renton argued the point at length in the other place. He said that when Britain signed up to the convention, he was a new member--bright-eyed and bushy-tailed--of the Council of Europe at the side of the Belgian Minister who supervised the scope of the convention. He said that it was never envisaged that the Act would be applied to the military. In the aftermath of the second world war, the ECHR was all about preserving democracy and extending the values of democracy, which had defeated Nazism, across the signatories to the convention.
<P>
Of course, when France signed up, 22 years after we did, the French had seen that the convention caused serious problems for the military, and that is why they got their derogation and why new members who sign the convention also get a derogation. That goes a little wide of the amendment but it emphasises what my hon. Friend said. Therefore, the Minister should tell us how he expects discipline in the armed forces to be 100 per cent. safe, or has he been advised that the only way to do that would be to seek a derogation from the ECHR? That might technically be possible and it was explored by Ministers while wringing their hands over what to do to ensure compliance by the military. However, another important point was made by the Chairman of the Select Committee about the possibility of the Ministry of Defence taking "hits" in the ECHR in relation to summary justice compliance with the ECHR
<P>
Towards the end of last year, the ECHR found that our policy of banning homosexuals was illegal. The Ministry of Defence had fought the case, tooth and nail, right up until the finding. It was often speculated that the Ministry of Defence knew that it would lose the case--I remember discussing that at Trenchard Lines more than two years ago and the Army anticipated then that it was likely to lose the case--so the question remains as to why the Government did not concede the case and simply lift the ban of their own accord.
<P>
I refer to the homosexuality issue because the Government did not act pre-emptively in that case and lift the ban in advance of the court's judgment, but they seem to be acting pre-emptively in this case to avoid an adverse judgment with respect to the human rights credentials of discipline in our armed forces. They seem to display double standards in that respect--double standards that I suspect are governed by political imperatives. Although they knew that they could not get away with lifting the ban on homosexuals without putting up a fight, they think that they can get away with imposing this costly and burdensome technical measure.
<P>
That is why I support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate. If we must introduce this wretched Act, let us be sure that the system will work in the field, as well as in the barracks, the station and the ship. The flexibility afforded by my hon. Friend's amendment is more likely to make the system work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> This is the first time that I have had the privilege to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Malins, so I must say how delighted I am to do so.
<P>
I do not usually indulge in quoting large passages of Hansard, but it might benefit the Committee if I sketch out to a discussion that we had in our previous sitting because it ended on an unsatisfactory note. It is relevant to the clause and I discussed the matter yesterday with my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury. We intend to table amendments that would introduce flexibility in cases where the judicial officer cannot be present because of operational circumstances.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to an exchange at our previous sitting, in which the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We said that operational considerations will remain paramount; the Bill has been designed to work in all circumstances and there should be no misunderstanding of the matter. I do not want to get into a "what if this happened" argument, and suddenly find myself on another planet discussing "what if that happened".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I intervened, and the Minister pointed out that he had said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>nothing in the Bill will preclude a commanding officer taking the action that he believes to be right. If that is what he said, what would happen when a soldier was required to be detained for more than 48 hours but no judicial officer was present?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In those operational circumstances, it would be unlikely for that to take place, but I am trying to avoid too many hypothetical cases. If there were no alternative, however, we would back the judgment of the commanding officer.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am grateful to hear what the Minister said, but I cannot find any provision in the Bill that allows a commanding officer to take such action.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We did not consider it necessary to make specific reference to that in the Bill. Our legal advice and that of service chiefs suggests that the Bill provides adequate support for the person charged.--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 29 February 2000; c. 31-2.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
You, Mr. Malins, are a lawyer and I am not. It is all very well for the Minister to give fine words of comfort--I do not doubt his sincerity in this regard--but if the matter is not stated in the Bill, how can it be a fact in practice? I again urge the Minister to consider the matter.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I should point out that Ministers' amplifications at any stage in a procedural Bill are citable in future actions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister refers to the Pepper v. Hart decision, which I understand only too well. Despite his comments, however, it would be better to refer to the matter in the Bill. Our primary purpose in Committee is to establish whether the Bill can be improved, and, in this context, it can be. I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury to table amendments that might introduce flexibility in relation to operations that take place out of area. That matter was discussed in another place, when Baroness Symons said that that would create a grey area about which type of environment our service men were operating in.
<P>
The matter could be dealt with simply. An individual service man would be informed at the moment that he was required to go on an operation out of area that the normal peacetime law no longer applied and that he was operating under a different military law. If the lawyers and the Minister were minded to take that approach, it would be easy for the parliamentary draftsmen to draft appropriate clauses. We shall seek to achieve that end through amendments to which we shall come later.
<P>
Various operational circumstances may be involved--many have already been cited, and I do not want to give further examples. Service men in our armed forces expect to operate in unusual circumstances--that is the nature of their job and what they train for--and breaches of discipline may occur in those circumstances. Anyone can deal with situations that are straightforward and relatively well known--we simply copy parts of our existing civil law, which has been tried in the courts in numerous cases and refined to a huge extent. The civil law is well established under the Bail Act 1976, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Legal Aid Act 1988. The Bill is intended to deal with the exceptional circumstances in which our service men serve, which is also how the European convention on human rights applies. There appears to be a lacuna in the Bill.
<P>
The Bill could incorporate by order the kind of flexibility clause that I have outlined, on the understanding that a derivation was first obtained from the European Court of Human Rights under article 15. I do not know what is in the mind of my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury, but perhaps that is the kind of mechanism that we should discuss at a later stage of our deliberations. A little more flexibility is required. A judicial officer is the only person who may dictate that a service man may continue to be held in custody, which is a highly stratified procedure.
<P>
I wholly commend the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate. In difficult operational circumstances--perhaps only in such exceptional circumstances--the custody officer should be able to make those decisions in loco parentis for the judicial officer.

<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I am not sure whether I should speak next.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have called the Minister because no other hon. Member has risen to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I want to be in a position to speak once the Minister has given his reply.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that at the conclusion of the debate he may wind up and either press the amendment to a vote or withdraw it. The Minister will, of course, speak first.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Malins. I look forward to serving under your chairmanship.
<P>
I shall start with the problem of quinquennial reviews and the need to legislate outside them. I could argue that if the 1996 review had conducted its business rather better, the Bill would have been unnecessary. The then Government recognised the need to incorporate some provisions relating to the European convention on human rights into its Bill, even though it was not at that time incorporated into British law. Alas, they did not incorporate quite enough of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> It is also true that the then Minister for the Armed Forces told the Committee that considered the Armed Forces Bill that the Government's lawyers--who are, no doubt, the same lawyers who advised the Minister --had assured the Government that the provisions of the 1996 Act would make the military law bomb-proof.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I shall certainly not use the word bomb-proof at any stage. I am far too cynical for that. One can never guarantee that that is so, especially given the propensity of judges to restate the law at regular intervals according to their own opinions. That leads to an almost infinite progression, comparable to the what-ifs that we have been dealing with. I am not going to get into a hypothetical chase whereby whenever I deal with one case someone stands up and says, "Ah yes, but what if this or that occurred." One could go on ad infinitum, and I do not intend to do that. As far as possible, we try to make Bills cover every eventuality that we can foresee. If, in future, it transpires that something has been left out, we have to revise the legislation. We do the best that we can in the circumstances.
<P>
Before I deal with the individual points that have been raised, I should give a full description of the thinking behind the clause. We are talking about post-custody scenarios, so many of the points raised about operational circumstances do not apply. People who require an eight days' review after charge will have been removed from the operation theatre and returned to the UK.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> During consideration of clause 1 and on Second Reading, the 48-hour or 96-hour time limit for keeping a person in custody without charge was discussed. It was argued that such persons could be kept in custody and charged when one is on operations, detached and without access to judicial officers. That took matters into the realms of a part of the Bill in which the qualification "as soon as practicable" is established. However, there remains the question of an operational reality test. Those who are on operations and detached will face the same operational problems, even when a person is charged according to the Bill's description of the role of judicial officers. Arguments about time limits and operational difficulty apply equally, but what happens after charge?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I disagree with that, but perhaps I should amplify my reasoning more clearly. I accept that the amendments are intended to provide flexibility with regard to those who may be appointed to review the need for detention after an individual has been charged. To that extent, I am sure that the amendments are intended to be helpful.
<P>
Under the Bill, if the commanding officer believes that there is a case for holding an individual after charge, the accused should be brought before the judicial officer as soon as practicable. As I have said, the phrase "as soon as practicable" provides one of the most important flexibilities in the Bill.
<P>
The Bill already gives us the flexibility that we need in respect of timing, the means of conducting hearings and the range of individuals who may be appointed as judicial officers. As I said on Tuesday, we do not expect judicial officers to serve in that capacity full time. We would normally expect those duties to be fulfilled by the Judge Advocate, whose main responsibility is to preside at courts martial. However, we have also repeatedly made it clear that others can be appointed to serve as judicial officers when required, and the hon. Member for Salisbury agreed that that would be of some value.
<P>
I should point out in passing that, in the case of the Falklands, it may be possible to use a practising civilian lawyer as a part-time judicial officer, which would greatly help in the circumstances described in that hypothetical case. I am starting to deal with hypothetical cases as I go along, which I said I would not do, and I must ensure that I do not stray too far down that road.
<P>
After charge, the judicial officer will determine whether there is a case for continued detention according to criteria set out in the Bail Act 1976. Those criteria assess whether the accused is likely to abscond, commit an offence, interfere with witnesses, or needs to be held for his or her own protection.
<P>
It is in the nature of the Bill's proposals that the judicial officer acts as a check on the commanding officer, but that is not intended to be burdensome. It seems only right that the check should be independent of the commanding officer and anyone up and down his chain of command--"up and down" being the key phrase. Some might consider that a reasonable proposition, regardless of what the convention or the courts may say on the matter.
<P>
Many Committee members have pointed out that we are talking about service men and women who risk their lives for their country. Because of their special circumstances, they have an absolute entitlement to the same human rights as every other citizen, or better. There is no question of derogation or of changing our attitude. As a point of principle, I would not dream at any stage of giving an inch and excluding service men and women from the provisions of the ECHR. It is the minimum to which they are entitled.
<P>
The amendments would also allow a custody officer to be appointed to conduct custody hearings. That might appear to be unobjectionable, but new clause 2 wants the custody officer to be appointed by the chain of command--in the Army's case, by the general officer commanding. That is our main problem with this set of amendments.
<P>
Article 5 of the convention says that an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should determine issues of custody. That brings us to the Hood case, which is the basis of much of what we are seeking to do in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> The Minister has quoted article 5 and he mentioned the Hood case. When David Hood went absent without leave for the fourth time, his commanding officer was thought not to be considered impartial in relation to authorising his pre-trial detention. That was in violation of article 5.
<P>
We must distinguish between custody and trial, because the word "impartial" appears in article 6, which relates to fair trial. It does not appear in article 5, which would seem to make it unnecessary to expand the provision in the current law.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Our advice is that previous case law from the European Court of Human Rights makes it clear that if it appears that the officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power in relation to custody, as required by article 5, may later intervene in the subsequent proceedings, there is a risk that the commanding officer's impartiality is capable of appearing open to doubt. In the Hood case, the court in Strasbourg confirmed that approach and held that the powers and duties of a commanding officer in the British Army, subsequent to his conduct of the custody hearing, were such that his impartiality was indeed open to doubt. That is because the commanding officer determines whether the charge should be dealt with by him or dismissed, or recommends that it be passed on to be dealt with by court martial. He does not, therefore, meet the requirement for impartiality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> The Minister has made an important point. The commanding officer does not have the ability to appoint the custody officer, as proposed in my amendment. That is the whole point: it is done by the general officer commanding. Under the 1996 Act, the general officer commanding was removed from being able to have a further stake in the proceedings of any court martial that might follow because of the Findlay case. The reason given in the advice that the Minister has been given is faulty: a general officer commanding will not have a further role in the court martial proceedings because of the changes made in the 1996 Act. Therefore, the Minister's advice is at fault. I hope that, because the commanding officer is not making the decisions on custody, my amendments will be acceptable.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That was a nice try, but the point is not that the commanding officer will take part in subsequent proceedings but that he is part of the chain of command and therefore challengeable under this ruling. He therefore could not be said to be a reasonable person to appoint a custody officer, as the hon. Gentleman said, because that would be taken to be interfering and it is not his role in a court martial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Is the Sovereign in the chain of command?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B>  In operational circumstances, no--only technically, as part of our constitution, as far as I know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> No, I shall not give way. I think that that is a specialist point.
<P>
New clause 2 refers to the custodial officer being appointed not by the commanding officer, but by the general officer commanding. I am afraid that that does not get us round the article 5 issue, as the GOC or officers subordinate to him will act as the higher authority in cases where the commanding officer decides to recommend trial by court martial. In such cases the higher authority may direct that the case should be dismissed or dealt with summarily, instead of by court martial. He therefore has powers to take decisions in relation to the accused after the individual has been the subject of a custody hearing. A custody hearing conducted by an officer appointed by the general officer commanding would run into the same objections as one conducted by the commanding officer or an officer appointed by him.
<P>
I recall that, on Second Reading, the hon. Gentleman warned that the courts could rule that judicial officers might not be independent of the chain of command because they were paid by, and owed their duties to, the chain of command. That is not so. We have taken advice that the arrangements for the appointment of judicial officers are such as to ensure their independence. It has been said that one can never be sure that procedures--including those in the Bill--will not be subject to challenges. The test that we have set ourselves is to have the best procedures in place to withstand challenges, and that is what the Bill represents. Notwithstanding the convention issues, however, we do not consider the amendments necessary. The Bill gives us sufficient flexibility in relation to custody hearings so as not to require any additions to the categories of people who may conduct them.
<P>
I shall turn to the points with which I have not yet dealt. I do not want to go into great detail about training for video conferencing, because we shall have an opportunity to debate its principle and practice in due course. However, I shall make a number of points that will not invalidate our future debate. The Judge Advocate General and his staff have been involved in the trial of video conferencing equipment for the purpose of custody hearings. They need to be satisfied that the equipment will be suitable for those purposes. The Judge Advocate General expressed the view that he was satisfied that the equipment that he had seen demonstrated was adequate for hearings to be conducted in a fair and safe manner. I shall not say more than that at present, because we shall consider the question in some detail later.
<P>
I shall go into more detail on the general training that is given to existing personnel. A fair point was made on that issue during the debate. We intend to conduct extensive training, pitched at various categories of personnel who will be affected by the changes. It will be directed both at those who will be in post when the changes take effect and, through alteration to training courses, at those likely to take on relevant responsibilities in due course.
<P>
In the Royal Navy, briefing of key players has already started. Those already in post who will be affected by the changes will receive comprehensive training in advance of the commencement of the Act in October. That will be achieved by the issue of revised guidance, updated manuals, roadshows and so on--all the usual paraphernalia used in these circumstances. A rolling audit will be used to ensure that there are no gaps in the training. Syllabuses of relevant training courses are also being revised, and all personnel will be made aware of the changes to the system before October.
<P>
The Army's training strategy is a mix of initial training and continuation training. Initial training will be conducted throughout the field army from July to October this year by dedicated training teams. The aim of this phased strategy will be to ensure that commanding officers and those involved in the administration of discipline, both in units and headquarters, are fully conversant with the new procedures and therefore able to exercise their powers safely and within the law. The training package will be delivered as an intensive short course, focused on the new legislation and its practical application at custody hearings and during summary dealings. The second strand of the strategy is to revise existing legal training courses such as the adjutants' course and officer training at Sandhurst, to ensure that officers achieve a satisfactory standard at appropriate points throughout their careers.
<P>
The RAF plans to undertake introductory training from July to September this year for commanding officers and station staff responsible for administering service discipline. The RAF police will conduct their own training during that time. I hope that I have been able to assure the Committee that we take the matter seriously, and that we shall ensure that staff are up to the mark before the provisions of the Bill come in to force.
<P>
The question was raised as to whether we could guarantee compliance with the European convention on human rights. No, we cannot. Hon. Members have rightly pointed out that judges reinterpret the provisions of the articles according to case law as they find it. We cannot, therefore, be absolutely certain. We have taken the best advice that we can, and, as far as we know, the provisions in the Bill will match it. I hope that I have satisfied Opposition Members, although I have a strange feeling that I may not have. We have taken full account of who can appropriately be considered a judicial officer. For the reasons that I have given, the alternative--a custodial officer--is neither necessary nor an adequate substitute.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am disappointed by the Under-Secretary's speech on a number of grounds, and not only in relation to the amendments. If I cannot persuade him, I hope that I can persuade some of his hon. Friends to listen my arguments. A proper duty is owed to our armed forces. I speak as someone who has served in the Army for 12 years, whereas the Under-Secretary has received advice from lawyers.
<P>
First, the Under-Secretary stated that soldiers had an absolute entitlement to human rights, and that the European convention on human rights was the minimum to which they should be entitled. On the surface, that statement seems entirely reasonable. Although it might sound self-congratulatory, we all admire our armed forces, the duties that they undertake and the sacrifices that they are prepared to make. As I said on Second Reading, when someone joins the armed services he signs a blank cheque on his life--the ultimate and most important right of all. That cheque can be called on at any time in the service of Crown and country. Therefore, it is not tenable to say that the armed forces and individual soldiers must be given the minimum standard of rights under the European convention. They simply do not work like that.
<P>
If someone is in an active engagement in which he is almost certain to lose his life, but it is absolutely necessary to take a position for the greater good of the cause, his colleagues and his orders, he cannot say, "Hang on, you can't do that. I've got a right to life. You can't expect me to expose myself in that way." Clearly, it is absurd to subject the armed forces to the convention in the way presented by the Under-Secretary.
<P>
Most of the Bill's provisions protect the summary justice system, which, as every sensible person accepts, is not independent of the chain of command. It is part of the chain of the command. Our purpose is to protect something that is not compliant with the convention--the armed forces' ability to administer discipline within the chain of command, which is not independent. The commanding officer knows that the soldiers are under his command, which enables him to administer discipline in a militarily effective way. As Brigadier Ritchie told the Defence Committee, that is the vital ground that the armed forces are seeking to defend.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the minimum standards that should be expected were those in the convention. That betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the Bill. I fear that the chiefs of staff have been bamboozled by lawyers in the Ministry of Defence. Which organisation inside the Ministry of Defence will benefit from the Bill. It is the department of the Judge Advocate General, whose empire will increase considerably. Who will give advice on what is necessary for compliance? The Judge Advocates and the lawyers in the Ministry of Defence will do so. Soldiers are not lawyers and when they are told that they are being given expert legal opinion and that something is necessary to make the Bill compliant, they are not in a position to question that judgment. We are here to examine the question of advice and to protect the interests of the armed forces and our nation. We are discussing what the armed forces describe as their vital ground and that makes it a vital interest to our country. If we betray our armed forces, we betray a vital interest of the United Kingdom and the people who send us here to represent them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend, with his experience, accept what I failed to convince the Minister of--that there is all the difference in the world between discipline in peacetime and discipline in wartime, when operational conditions are very different?
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> We should apply a reality check. In what circumstances will the Bill apply? The purpose of my amendments is to enable the duties that we are placing on the armed forces--to remand people when they have been charged--to be carried out more easily and in compliance with the convention. The Bill has been drafted as though there will never be a major war. We cannot have two parallel systems of justice--one for war and one for peace. We need one system of military justice and one system of armed forces discipline.
<P>
The system of justice in the Bill must work in all circumstances. The trouble with legislation covering the armed forces--this applies to the previous Government as well as the present one--is that it is designed for peacetime. It does not take account of the fact that we might have to go to war. There is an assumption that we do not lose wars, that nothing goes wrong because we control the air, that the other lot--the Serbs and the Iraqis--are on the receiving end of our attentions, that there is precious little they can do about it that, if we are lucky, we can get away with conflicts without losing anyone. We lost only nine people in the Gulf and that was due to friendly fire from the United States. We suffered no deaths because of Iraqi enemy action and in Serbia last year we suffered no casualties from enemy action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bell:</B> I think that the true figure in the Gulf war was 18 because some soldiers died following accidents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The hon. Member for Tatton is right and I suspect that if all the accidents that happened during training for the operation in the Gulf are taken into account, the figure is probably higher than 18. If road traffic accidents, supplying and running a line to the front line during action and training are taken into account, I fear that the figure is probably 50 or more. That is part of military life. If exercises are not testing and stretching, the army will not be ready to operate effectively when war comes.
<P>
The problem with the Bill is that it assumes that we shall never be at the wrong end of an engagement, losing, retreating or isolated with provisions of action wholly constrained. All that we are seeking to do is to put a provision in the Bill to give the armed forces greater flexibility with regard to keeping someone in detention after they have been charged. That might happen in circumstances in which one might have to apply military discipline if things are going wrong. Those are the circumstances that we should be considering--when all hell is breaking loose when provost-marshals are probably having to administer pretty rough justice to keep troops in line and keep an army that is under pressure in action. We want them to be able to operate within reasonable laws, which we shall set out in the Bill. If we put too many restrictions on them, we make the military justice system impossible to work during operations. We should not be surprised when soldiers are taken round the back of the barrack block to be given a thump by the sergeant major or his troop sergeant instead of being put through the summary justice procedure. We shall come to those arguments later in the Bill. Nor should we be surprised when, on operations, things get more serious and more difficult. That is where I have a real difficulty with the philosophical position that the Minister betrayed in his remarks.
<P>
From someone from a non-service background, those comments seem entirely reasonable. I realise that most members of the Committee do not come from a service background. To them, the Minister would seem to be the embodiment of reason, decency and rationality, but the amendments must be considered from a service point of view.
<P>
I want to come now to the detail of this set of amendments, so that my hon. Friends and the Minister can see what I am attempting to put in the Bill. I am not striking judicial officers from the Bill. There is nothing to stop the operation of custody after charge by judicial officers if that is what the Ministry of Defence wishes to do. The amendments suggest an alternative system. Instead of expensive judicial officers deciding the question of custody, let us use custodial officers if they are adequate in the eyes of the convention. I shall return to those arguments later. The amendment would not remove the opportunity to use judicial officers, if it is decided, when a case goes to the convention or is taken after 2 October before our own courts, that custodial officers are not independent of the chain of command.
<P>
Here is where we come to the judgment about the chain of command. The Minister is a Minister of the Crown--he is part of the chain of command; the Sovereign, in my judgment, is part of the chain of command; the general officer commanding is part of the chain of command; the commanding officer is part of the chain of command; and that is the problem with our constitution. When a case goes to the European court, a judgment must be made--a reality judgment, hopefully--about who is independent. The Minister quoted back my remarks from Second Reading, but in the end he cannot come before us and say, "These people are clearly independent".
<P>
Any reasonable person would say, when dealing simply and solely with the issue of remand into custody, that it would be a reasonable judgment to say that a custodial officer appointed by someone two levels up in the chain of command, away from the commanding officer who is taking a role in the disciplinary proceedings, is independent--particularly after the 1996 Act, which took the general officer commanding out of the court martial system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to put to my hon. Friend one idea that he might press with the Minister. If the Minister intends to refuse my hon. Friend's amendment outright, would my hon. Friend consider it reasonable to table a compromise amendment that says that a judicial officer may, under exceptional military circumstances, authorise the custodial officer to make the decision in his stead?
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am not sure that we can do that at this stage. I fear that we must deal with the amendments before us. We may be able to come back to that on Report and to look at that question again. As I understand it--I am happy to be corrected--this debate must relate to the amendments.
<P>
The Minister also raised the issue of "judicial" or "custodial", in terms of the armed forces being able to choose which is the appropriate vehicle for deciding custody after charge. Clearly, the first remand after charge is the most important. There may be a case for a judicial officer in such circumstances--I do not accept it, but one can assume that there is. Remand can go on and on. If someone is in custody for a prolonged period, he is likely to face serious charges--murder or rape for example. In those circumstances, the administrative burden on units holding someone in their guardroom should be reduced.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the period is to be every eight days--I have known soldiers to be kept in custody for eight or nine months awaiting trial--a judicial officer will have to make a decision far too many times. If a custodial officer can meet the requirement, he should be enabled to do so. Having a custodial officer appointed by the general commanding officer is entirely compliant with the convention; I do not believe the legal advice that it is not. That advice should be tested. Any reasonable person would say that a custodial officer was independent and able to make a decision about remanding in custody. We are merely providing greater flexibility for the armed forces in the administration of the system. Most importantly, we are reducing the expense of administering the military justice system, using taxpayer's money more wisely and enabling that money to be invested in the armed forces' real purpose--to provide a military capability for our country. We hope that that capability is used as a deterrent, but on too many occasions it is needed to further the interests of the United Kingdom.

<P>

<B> Mr. Key:</B> I recall that when we were discussing the previous group of amendments, the Under-Secretary reminded us that his words might be cited in future interpretation of the legislation. He is entirely right. That decision took a lot of fun out of being a Minister. I recall its introduction in the middle of the Standing Committee consideration of the Local Government Finance Bill, when I was a Minister with responsibilities for local government finance. My right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) and I were charged with the interesting little technical matter of repealing the community charge--the poll tax--and introducing the council tax. The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) was speaking for the Opposition, this Room, as I recall. We were discussing banding for council tax purposes. My right hon. Friend was considering the matter, when he noticed that someone was wearing a tie decorated with balloons. That presented a wonderful opportunity. He was able to say that one could make banding decisions by drifting above houses and streets in a balloon, checking who had swimming pools in their back yards. Shortly afterwards, the rules were changed and Ministers received a memorandum from the Cabinet Secretary, as a result of that court case, pointing out that we must neither make jokes nor say anything that could be misconstrued and cite.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate highlighted an important issue, to which we shall return. I mention it now because I want the Minister's excellent officials to have the opportunity to do some homework. They doubtless thought that their work on the Bill was finished, but it ain't. We shall ask not only to whom the Bill will apply--a question which arose during the previous sitting, and to which the Minister will want to return--but about the circumstances in which it might apply. Reference was made to high-density warfare, but most of time, mercifully, British forces are engaged instead in peace enforcement or peacekeeping, which, technically, differ, and have different rules of engagement.
<P>
It is important to raise the issue of judicial officers during this debate. During my time in Kosovo, I visited the only prison in Pristina, which contained Kosovar citizens and was under British Army control. I encountered more than the usual miscreants that one expects to find in such circumstances. One gentleman, who had fallen foul of important legislation on the carriage of guns in cars, was the acting Minister of Health.
<P>
It is important to know in precisely what circumstances the British military might be sued by foreign nationals if, in the course of their peacekeeping duties, they imprisoned people on perfectly reasonable grounds and brought them before the judicial process. What would be their status? That issue will be increasingly significant and we cannot ignore it. I stand to be corrected but, as far as I know, Serbia is not a signatory to the convention. What would happen to British soldiers in a peacekeeping or peace-enforcement role? We need to know the answer, because I suspect that the problem will increasingly arise. I should be grateful if the Minister would address that issue, but it is only fair to give him notice of it.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's explanation of training procedures. We all want them to work, and we must keep a close eye on the matter, but they will cost money. Moreover, it is a question of training not merely the new operation's existing chain of command, but new military lawyers. The Defence Committee's report referred to the number of additional lawyers that would be required to make the process work. In evidence taken before the Committee on 10 February, the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) asked about the number of staff being taken on to deal with the changes, and how many of those were lawyers. Brigadier Ritchie said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Speaking for the Army, we are seeking, and indeed actively recruiting, 15 additional military lawyers for the Army Legal Services. I am afraid I have not got the exact number but I believe we have got 11 or 12 and there are three or so more to get. There was a major recruiting drive before Christmas.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Commodore Humphrey said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the Navy, of course, we are different, we do not have a legal branch as such, we are all line officers who are lawyers. All we have done in this is we feel it sufficient to make two extra full-time legal posts and we have the capacity from a pool of qualified lawyers to man those posts.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Air Commodore Charles said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although we are fishing from the same pond as the Army, we have been recruiting three and we have been successful.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Portsmouth, South asked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When you recruit these lawyers into the Army at what rank do they come in?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Air Commodore Charles replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the Air Force it would be Flight Lieutenant.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brigadier Ritchie replied: "Captain". The Chairman of the Committee asked what the salary scale would be. Air Commodore Charles said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I believe the starting salary is of the order of 26,500.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Portsmouth, South then asked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Coming to the costs again, on the 6.5 million that it is estimated this is going to cost, where is that going to be found from within the MoD budget or are you expecting this resource to be put to you from the Treasury to help?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister for the Armed Forces replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is to be found within existing resources.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Portsmouth, South asked, "Year by year?", and the Minister replied yes.
<P>
A very large sum of money will have to be found. The judicial officers will be expensive, which comes as no surprise. We should bear that point in mind, because apart from the obvious implications of the introduction of judicial officers into the military discipline system on the status of the commanding officer, it will create a whole new raft of bureaucracy, which is unnecessary and puts further pressures on the budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> If I ask my hon. Friend a question at this point, I might enable the Minister to prepare a reply. What proportion of the budget will be taken by salaries and what proportion by other administrative expenses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> That is an important point, which echoes what I was about to say. Costs will be added not only by the lawyers, but by the support staff, the technical equipment for the provision of video links and facilities for the new summary courts. I asked the Minister of State about that on Second Reading, but he was unable to answer. I do not blame him for being unable to say whether the usual courts martial centres will be used, thereby saving costs, but it would be nice if the Under-Secretary could answer my hon. Friend's question.
<P>
The cost of the Bill has been estimated by the Ministry of Defence at about 9 million a year--substantial cost to be found from the resources of all three services. For example, the Ministry of Defence has had to cancel training exercises this year on cost grounds, and 9 million would go a long way to providing the cost of two major exercises. It would also provide very many free telephone calls for our service men to their families.
<P>
The Ministry of Defence says that there will be about 1,500 appeals a year to the summary appeals court. On that basis, the estimated cost of implementing the changes would be 6.5 million a year. In 2000-01, that figure will include start-up costs of 1.5 million to cover the costs of additional computer systems, personnel, accommodation and office equipment. The bulk of the additional costs associated with the Bill will therefore be personnel costs, which will involve additional lawyers, investigators and other staff in administering the new procedures. The total costs in any one year will be sensitive to the number of appeals to the summary appeals courts. The figure of 6.5 million is based on a planning assumption of around 1,500 appeals each year.
<P>
11.15 am
<P>
The Defence Committee noted in its report that the estimated number of appeals had been revised from 850 to 900 since the Bill was introduced in the other place last November, yet the estimated costs had remained the same. The witness from the Ministry of Defence, whom I shall refrain from embarrassing as he is sitting not far from the Minister, told the Committee that the revision arose because the Army had carried out a more detailed study of the likely number of appeals. The estimated cost had not changed because the original figure had been based on the assumption that 50 additional Royal Military Police investigators would be needed to provide appropriate evidence to appeal courts. The view now seems to be that appeals will be more likely to be against sentences, rather than against the findings of summary proceedings, and that significant additional investigative work will not, therefore, be necessary.
<P>
Will the Minister give us an undertaking that he is satisfied that the figures with which the MoD is working are correct? I ask not because I wish to impugn anyone's motives or accuracy, but because it seems a tad convenient that one was able to substitute all the little bits of the jigsaw so conveniently. It was as though one had been able to click on the screen and drag the icon across to a different position, thus providing a jolly good answer for the Minister. However, I wonder how safe that judgment is, and whether it is possible that the costs could be substantially higher.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On the question of resources and of what might be covered by the Bill, does my hon. Friend remember asking Lord Chancellor's Department on 8 June 1999 what progress had been made with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>revision of the topics identified by the Law Commission in 1995 where consolidation was essential?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He received the following answer:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The following additional topics have been identified since 1996: Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors; Audit Commission; Justices of the Peace; Petroleum; and Criminal Appeals. The consolidating legislation on the first four of these has now been passed. It remains the Government's intention to consolidate the Service Discipline Acts at the earliest opportunity.--[Official Report, 8 June 1999; Vol. 332, c. 316.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear that more topics are being identified all the time as coming within the scope of the Bill, and that more people will therefore be required to deal with them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Key:</B> I recall that answer very well. It was provided not by the Parliamentary Secretary but by her predecessor, the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz). We shall return to that matter with great relish later. Indeed, I shall refer to a wide selection of answers that I have received from the Lord Chancellor's Department on those subjects. My hon. Friend is right. This underlines the unpredictability of the circumstances.
<P>
The question of costs was raised in another place by Lord Chalfont on Second Reading, who said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The summary appeal courts are to have not only extra officers assigned to them, but a judge advocate also. As noble Lords will see from the Bill, these judge advocates must have had at least five years experience as qualified lawyers. Such animals do not come cheaply; one cannot get qualified lawyers of five years' experience to come into the Armed Forces without paying them, and paying them very highly.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 1787, c. 689.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I ask the Minister again to assure us that the estimated costs are not in danger of ballooning out of control. The Ministry of Defence has a bit of a reputation with the National Audit Office for allowing provisions to cost more than they had originally thought. An example of that came from the Procurement Agency, which was paying 65 for padlocks that cost 79p at an ironmongers. I hope that such instances will not happen again. On Monday, during the debate on the Defence White Paper, my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) raised the question of a plastic strap, which a company in his constituency could manufacture for 55p, that was being sold to the Ministry of Defence for 500. That, too, underlines the problem.
<P>
Lord Chalfont also raised the issue of who was to pay for the new measures. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It may not be a matter for the Ministry of Defence to decide, but, in that context, I should like to know what the Ministry of Defence understands about the defraying of the obviously very considerable extra costs which will come about as a result of the Bill. Are these costs to be borne by the defence vote? If so, as noble and gallant Lords have already said, an already overstretched budget, which caters for already overstretched forces, will become further overstretched, to the great detriment of the Armed Forces and the effectiveness of our services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister, Baroness Symons, responded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Those costs will arise from the establishment of a summary appeal court and the other new arrangements. The majority of the costs will arise from the need for additional lawyers, investigators and other staff to administer the new procedures. These will also include travel and subsistence costs, fees, witnesses' expenses and so forth. Obviously, the costs will absorb an appreciable part of the Armed Forces' legal aid scheme. . .
<P>
I am sure that the noble Lord will be sad to hear that the costs will fall to the MoD. However, they will be absorbed across a wide range of budgetary areas, each of which will manage their costs in terms of their overall priorities.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 November 1999; Vol. 607, c.689-98.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is known, I seem to recall, as salami slicing. Therefore, right across the Ministry of Defence, every budget holder will have a slice taken off to pay for the new arrangements. It leaves many questions unanswered, and we shall press on later amendments for clarity on this aspect. The Government estimate that 55 additional service personnel and 35 additional military defence civilians will have to be employed.
<P>
I want to touch on one another aspect in relation to judicial officers. The clause says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the judicial officer may by order authorise the keeping of the accused in military custody, but only if--
<P>
(a) the judicial officer is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that the accused, if released from military custody, would--
<P>
(i) fail to attend any hearing in the proceedings against him,
<P>
(ii) commit an offence while released, or
<P>
(iii) interfere with witnesses<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on. New section 75F(3) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In taking the decision required by subsection (2)(a) above, the judicial officer shall have regard to such of the following considerations as appear to him to be relevant--
<P>
(a) the nature and seriousness of the alleged offence ...
<P>
(b) the character, antecedents, associations and social ties of the accused.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In Bosnia, Kosovo or some other part of the world, the judicial officer will have to inquire into
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the character, antecedents, associations and social ties of the accused.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not a lawyer, but you are, Mr. Malins. I think that this is probably a requirement of the Bail Act 1976 but is it not stretching things a bit far if, through a video link, a judicial officer inquires into
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the character, antecedents, associations and social ties of the accused?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is rather like the argument in the court martial itself. The attitude to courts martial has been characterised by some people as "March in the guilty party", as the soldier comes in, without his hat or his belt. This modernising measure requires that, in these circumstances, the squaddie's uncles and aunts, as well as all his relatives and his friends back in the Rover's Return, will be interrogated to inquire into his character, associations and social ties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> My hon. Friend is making an interesting point. One of the ironies of the Bill is that what is in the Bail Act would be known to the commanding officer, but the Bill takes away the commanding officer's responsibility to make a judgment about whether an individual should be remanded in custody. He will know  these things and is in a perfect position to make such judgments; indeed, he is probably the best person to make them. Yet the Bill takes that responsibility away from him and gives it to someone who, as my hon. Friend makes clear, is in an almost impossible position from which to make a judgment about the provisions in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I almost wish I had not given way to my hon. Friend, because he has shot my fox. That was to be my next breath--that it was more likely that the commanding officer of the man in question would know about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the character, antecedents, associations and social ties of the accused<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
than would a judicial officer thousands of miles away, or perhaps even down the road. It would cost an enormous amount to find all that out, whereas the commanding officer would probably know it darn well. That is yet another example of why the clause is questionable.
<P>
The Minister of State told the Committee that it would be a dereliction of his duty if he did not introduce the Bill. It could well be argued that the reverse is the case. In our view the system of judicial officers set out in the clause is an expensive, unnecessary and unsure burden on our armed forces. That is why we intend to vote against the clause.
<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
