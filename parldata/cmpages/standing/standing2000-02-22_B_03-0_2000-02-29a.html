</P>

<P>
Schedule 1 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<P>
Duty of the Commission to ensure provision of a universal postal service
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page (South-West Hertfordshire):</B> The clause outlines the Postal Services Commission's duty to ensure provision of a universal postal service. Conservative Members welcome the inclusion of such a provision. Indeed, on Second Reading, the shadow Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs Browning), fully supported the commission's aim of ensuring a universal postal service and of setting minimum standards for the universal delivery of letters.
<P>
Communication by e-mail and the internet has led to shrinking costs. However, without a universal postal service, certain parts of the country would suffer much higher costs on the delivery of postal packets. Incidentally, we shall seek to amend clause 4's definition of such packets.
<P>
Clause 3(1) states:
<P>
The Commission shall exercise its functions in the manner which it considers best calculated to ensure the provision of a universal ... service.
We all say amen to that. However, the explanatory notes advise that clause 3 should be read in conjunction with clause 5, subsection (1) of which states:
<P>
Subject to section 3, the Commission shall exercise its functions in the manner which it considers is best calculated to further the interests of users of postal services, wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition between postal operators.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that that means that the commission is under a duty to set up a universal postal service at the lowest level consistent with providing a service? The 12th report of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry which was printed on 14 September 1999 stated:
<P>
The Secretary of State announced a reduction in the monopoly from the existing £1 limit to 50p or 150 grams.
Earlier in our proceedings, I mentioned that reduction, which was due to be implemented on 1 April 2000. An order giving effect to the change was laid on 8 July 1999, but we all know what has happened to that. However, the same day, Minister for Competitiveness told the House:
<P>
greater commercial freedom must be matched with some liberalisation.--[Official Report, 8 July 1999; Vol. 334, c. 1176.]
In response to questioning, the Minister agreed that it might be appropriate to link the 50p limit to the retail prices index. However, he also said:
<P>
the figure is pitched at a level that will ensure that the Post Office can still meet its universal service obligation.--[Official Report, 8 July 1999; Vol. 334, c. 1184.]
<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee by repeating the point. I simply want the Minister to confirm that the commission has a duty to pitch the limit at the lowest level possible to achieve a universal postal service.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson):</B> In case hon. Members are confused about terminology, I should explain that ``universal service obligation'' and ``universal postal service'' refer to the same thing. It is ironic that universal service obligation has become known as UPS, because a distinguished and reputable private courier has the same name, and it seems to have managed to get its name into the Bill.
<P>
It has been said that the Secretary of State talked about setting the USO at the lowest possible level, but he actually referred to setting the reserved area at the lowest possible level. The universal service obligation will apply to items up to 20 kg under our proposal, which we shall debate later. That will ensure that people receive items up to that weight at a uniform tariff wherever they live in this country. Registered post will also come under the universal service obligation. However, parcels up to 20 kg and registered items will not be part of the reserved area, which will involve items up to 350 g.
<P>
We are dealing with two different matters. The first is the reserved area, which used to be called the monopoly. The limit must safeguard the ability of the Post Office to fulfil the universal service obligation without other companies cream-skimming and, therefore, preventing it from achieving economies of scale. The second is the universal service obligation. I am happy to reassure Opposition Members that the reserved area should be set at the lowest limit consistent with protecting the universal service obligation. Items such as registered post and parcels over that limit are in the competitive market, but we shall insist that people have proper access to those services.
<P>
We do not believe that the universal service obligation should be set at the lowest possible level; we believe that it should be set at a level consistent with giving people in all parts of the country, no matter how remote, access to parcel services above and beyond the reserved area. This short clause deals with the universal service obligation, and the purpose of its three subsections is clear. Clause 4 contains further detail, but I hope that, given those assurances, Opposition Members will agree to the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Provision of a universal postal service:</B> meaning
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, page 2, line 25, after ``packets'', insert ``and relevant postal items''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 3, in page 2, line 28, after ``packets'', insert ``and relevant postal items''.
<P>
No. 4, in page 2, line 30, after ``packets'', insert ``and relevant postal items''.
<P>
No. 5, in page 2, line 33, after ``packets'', insert ``and relevant postal items''.
<P>
No. 6, in page 3, line 16, after first ``packets'', insert ``or relevant postal items''.
<P>
No. 7, in page 3, line 16, after second ``packets'', insert ``or relevant postal items''.
<P>
No. 8, in page 3, line 22, leave out from ``Union'' to end of lines 25 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``relevant postal items'' means postal packets whose weight does not exceed 2 kilograms and whose dimensions fall within permitted limits, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``relevant postal packets'' means postal packets excluding letters whose weight does not exceed 10 kilograms and whose dimensions fall within permitted limits.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Page:</B> We suggest that the phrase ``relevant postal items'' should be added after the word ``packets''. I am sure that the Minister will be only too happy to agree to this seemingly innocuous series of amendments. However, this is where the reality of competition starts to bite. This is the reality behind all the fine words about setting the Post Office free, allowing competition and letting the real world into our postal services. I shall listen to the Minister's response with great interest, as no doubt will many other people.
<P>
I should like to outline what the amendments mean and then deal with the arguments in their favour. The clause fails to define postal packets and items in line with article 3 of the European Union postal services directive. Will the Minister confirm that that is correct? The universal service obligation under article 3 requires services to be provided for postal items up to 2 kg and for postal packages, not including letters, up to 10 kg. Our amendments would separately define postal items and packages in line with the EU directive, as we are worried that the clause does not conform to it.
<P>
Therefore, the purpose of the amendments is to amend the definition of the universal service obligation in order to distinguish postal items of up to 2 kg from postal packages up to 10 kg, thus bringing it in line with the EU postal services directive.
<P>
The clause proposes to include within the definition of the universal postal services, postal packets
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whose weight does not exceed 20 kilograms''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
It is easy to see the difference between the EU directive and the clause. As a result of the clause, a universal service provider will be required to provide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``postal services for postal packets at affordable prices determined in accordance with a public tariff which is uniform throughout the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
Competition regarding postal packets whose weight does not exceed 20 kg will be limited--and the Minister is going to have to take decisions about that. How much real competition will there be in the marketplace? Competition will be limited in this significant part of the postal services market.
<P>
The Minister will know that the Association of International Courier and Express Services estimates that 95 per cent. of its members' business is in postal packets not exceeding 20 kg--and 20 kg is a sizeable weight. If Parcelforce has similar figures, its costs can legitimately be cross-subsidised for almost all of its traffic because it has a USO. That greatly undermines the competitive environment. Increasing the USO to 20 kg and allowing Parcelforce legitimately to receive cross-subsidies means very little incentive for efficiency gains. It will be a protective umbrella, which is inconsistent with the Government's intention to provide greater competition in the postal markets, as covered by the definition of a universal postal service.
<P>
I repeat what I said at the outset--the Minister can correct me if I am wrong--that our amendments would also bring the provisions in line with the second requirement of the directive. Under article 3, a universal service obligation requires services to be provided for postal items up to 2 kg and postal packages, not including letters, up to 10 kg. It is easy to appreciate that a letter of up to 10 kg would be a weighty missive. At present, the Bill fails to distinguish between postal packages and postal items. As I said, the amendments would separately define them in line with the directive. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.

<P>

<B>Mr. Russell Brown (Dumfries):</B> I am seriously concerned about the amendments. I note what the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) says about competitiveness and the marketplace, and I agree, because that is what the Bill is about. However, I think that it would be a mistake to go down the route that the hon. Gentleman advocates and opt for 20 kg.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Opposition Members made it clear on Second Reading that they favoured privatisation. We must consider the effect of the amendments on rural areas of England and--if I may be parochial--the rural areas of Scotland. The highlands and islands are a typical example, although the region is a considerable distance from my constituency. I worry about the service that might be provided there, and about the opening of a door to those who would quickly take up the opportunity of gaining further business, to the detriment of the competitive postal service that we want. The amendment would undermine what we are trying to achieve through the Bill. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will pick up my thoughts. All of us have worries about the future of the postal service in rural areas. The amendments could have serious adverse consequences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> This morning we had a constructive debate, which added to the gaiety of the nation. This series of amendments is dangerous and positively pernicious. The Opposition are again confused about the reserved area and the universal service obligation. Any item of more than 350 g in weight comes into the competitive sphere because it falls outside the limited monopoly and the reserved area. The Opposition's amendments draw a distinction between letters weighing up to 2 kg and parcels weighing up to 20 kg: they set a limit of 10 kg. They propose that any letter of more than 2 kg should not come within the universal service obligation. That would mean that the Post Office could decide to charge a higher rate for sending a letter of more than 2 kg to the Western Isles, rural Cornwall and any remote area to which access was difficult, or decide not to provide a service at all to those areas for letters of more than 2 kg.
<P>
As regards parcels, at present Parcelforce is obliged to deliver any item up to 20 kg to anywhere in the country at a uniform tariff. If we accepted the amendment, Parcelforce could choose not to deliver items weighing more than 10 kg, or to charge a higher rate to do so.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) made an important contribution to the debate. The Conservatives do not have Members of Parliament in Scotland--nor do they have Members in Wales. They are represented only in England. That is the one nation. They have met Disraeli's objective of a one-nation party. Liberal Democrat and Labour Members do represent Scotland and Wales. A glance at the Post Office guide available in the House shows that there are 4,000 postal companies in the country making large and substantial parcel deliveries. They may zone their rates and charge extra for going to the Western Isles or the Orkneys and it is their choice to do so. Parcelforce charges £2.95 to send a standard parcel from London to Aylesbury, to the highlands and islands of Scotland, to Northern Ireland, to the Isle of Man, or the Scilly isles. Such charging would disappear if the amendments were accepted. The so-called interests of competition would deny the British public something that they have held dear for many years.
<P>
We admired Sir Rowland Hill's portrait in the Committee Corridor earlier and discussed the Rowland Hill principle, which would be destroyed on the basis of the argument that it does not comply with article 3 of the European directive, which was accepted by the House in July 1999. Under that directive, this country is obliged to deliver any item up to 20 kg posted in the Greek islands or any other part of the European Union to the United Kingdom. The irony of the amendments is that, if accepted, people in this country would not have the same freedom to post items up to 20 kg for delivery within the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if the amendments were accepted, people living in rural areas would be socially excluded? The clause as drafted socially includes those people, who should not be disadvantaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend; that is exactly what the debate is about. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton said on Second Reading that the Conservative party supports the universal service obligation, and now it seeks to destroy it.
<P>
The clause as drafted is not inconsistent with article 3 of the European postal services directive; it is not the case that it expressly provides for items weighing more than 2 kg to fall outside the universal service obligation. As I explained, it insists that any European Union member state can post an item up to 20 kg anywhere in the European Union and the local postal service has an obligation to deliver it.
<P>
There is a choice in the directive; we can set a domestic tariff between 10 kg and 20 kg. The overwhelming majority of the European Union states are setting the tariff at 20 kg and insisting on the widest possible definition of the USO, on behalf of their citizens. We, who invented the universal service obligation 160 years ago, should adopt the same principle as other European Union states.
<P>
The matter is nothing whatever to do with competition. Perhaps the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire is talking about people wanting a licence to operate in the regulated area, that is, joining the limited monopoly, but being required to give a universal service obligation, as the Post Office does now. There is a provision for the Postal Services Commission to allow parts of the USO to be undertaken by some carriers, but for the privilege of operating in a reserved area they also have the obligation to deliver items up to 20 kg, the same as for the Post Office under the provisional licence, which is currently subject to consultation.
<P>
The clause is not about competition; it is about protecting the universal service obligation in law, for the first time, for the benefit of the British public.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Drew </B>(Stroud): We shall discuss the future of the sub-post offices later in the Bill. A key role of sub-post offices in rural areas is taking in and distributing parcels to and from other places, both urban and rural. To reduce that service would be an attack on the universality of the network.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am pleased that my hon. Friend intervened, as I had not mentioned that the Post Office network depends upon parcels handed across post office counters for posting to, or being received from, mail order companies. The amendments would damage that service.
<P>
The proposal relates to letters, as well as to parcels. It is possible, although not usual, to send a first-class letter of 20 kg of a uniform character anywhere in the country.
<P>
The amendments are dangerous and pernicious; I am surprised that Opposition Members have tabled them and even more surprised that they call them innocuous. I invite the Committee comprehensively to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The Minister will realise that I had my tongue firmly in my cheek when I said that the amendments sound innocuous. As we know, surprises come in small packages.
<P>
I smiled, once again, at a reversal to type. I was reminded of the similar arguments advanced in the House in support of the previous Government's privatisation Bills. We heard statements such as, ``You can't do this, because that will go wrong.'' Those who argued against the privatisation of BT said that it would be the end of the known world if competition was allowed, but we know now that prices dropped dramatically.
<P>
The Minister spoke eloquently in favour of the 20 kg limit, but why 20 kg? Why not 40 kg, or 100 kg? What is so magical about 20 kg? The answer is that the figure will exclude 95 per cent. of the competition from other companies. The amendments were tabled because we want greater competition in the market. Earlier, I quoted Association of International Courier and Express Services, which estimated that 95 per cent. of its members' business is in postal packages whose weight does not exceed 20 kg. The purpose of reducing that figure to 10 kg is to increase competition.
<P>
I am glad that the Minister raised the possibility of granting licences, with obligations. Companies would welcome such a measure because it would introduce the breath of competition and reduce prices, the reverse of what some hon. Ministers fear. I understand their anxieties, but history in the past decade or so has proved that concerns about protectionism were utterly wrong. This is the first time that the Government's political rhetoric has met reality, and been found wanting.
5 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I rise more in sorrow than in anger. Opposition Members are wrong; we are not debating privatisation. We have said that we are not going down that particular Railtrack. Opposition Members did not pursue privatisation when they were in government. They published a Green Paper and received 15,400 responses, only 60 of which were in support of their privatisation proposals. The main reason for that lack of support was people's anxiety that privatisation would destroy the universal service obligation and everything that they held dear and cherished about the Post Office.
<P>
However, what we are discussing has nothing to do with that. Items weighing more than 350 g are outside the reserved area. Private couriers can choose not to deliver anything weighing more than 10 kg to anywhere in the country. Parcelforce competes with those couriers, but it has a universal service obligation to deliver from John O'Groats to Land's End, way beyond the limit of the reserved area.
<P>
The Government seek to protect a universal postal service for everyone in the country. If that is reverting to type, we plead guilty. I was asked why the limit was 20 kg. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire quoted article 3 of the European directive on postal services, which sets a 20 kg limit. We have therefore set the limit at that figure, which allows for hefty and bulky parcels. Opposition Members want to cap the limit at 10 kg. However, 16 per cent. of items delivered by Parcelforce are between 10 kg and 20 kg. So, under the amendments, it could charge more or even decide not to deliver 16 per cent. of its substantial annual postings.
<P>
Opposition Members talk about protectionism, privatisation and other--I almost used an unparliamentary term. However, such matters have nothing to do with these dangerous and pernicious amendments, which deserve an overwhelming defeat. I cannot contemplate why a party that purports to protect the universal service obligation should perversely seek to damage it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 40, at end insert
<P>
where the prices under such agreements are geared to the costs associated of providing the services to those customers,
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not get confused about which way to take this amendment, which is quite simple. I shall set out its aims in tabular form.
<P>
The amendment would limit the threat of predatory pricing by the universal service provider in areas in which it competes with other providers. I was brushed aside when I said that the Post Office was in a position to cross-subsidise services amounting to 95 per cent. of its private competitors' business. That is a fairly high figure, so it is entirely possible that the Post Office will compete unfairly against private sector operators. The Bill therefore fails to comply with article 12 of the European postal services directive, which requires that priorities be geared to costs when the universal service provider reaches price agreements with individual customers. Consequently, the amendment would exclude from the definition of a universal postal service individual price agreements that are not related to the cost of providing postal services to the customer.
<P>
We must link prices to costs, as emphasised in the White Paper of July 1999 entitled ``Post Office Reform: A world class service for the 21st century''. The Post Office should not charge different customers--or categories of customer--different prices for the same service, when such differences do not reflect the quantity, quality or other characteristics of the service supplied. It is obvious that price flexibility should not be used anti-competitively. For example, predatory pricing should not be used to exclude competitors and discounts should not be designed to foreclose the market.
<P>
The amendment would reduce predatory pricing by the universal service provider in competitive areas. Article 12 of the European postal services directive, with which the Bill must comply, states:
<P>
Member States shall take steps to ensure that the tariffs for each of the services forming part of the provision of the universal service comply with the following principles:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>prices must be geared to costs; Member States may decide that a uniform tariff should be applied throughout their national territory.
<P>
the application of a uniform tariff does not exclude the right of the universal service provider(s) to conclude individual agreements on prices with customers.
<P>
Therefore, the power provided in the directive to conclude individual agreements is subject to the requirement that prices are geared to costs and the amendment would make provision for that.
<P>
I should like to draw a parallel, as I have trodden this path before. Similar arguments were made by companies that would be in competition with BT after privatisation. BT's accounts were in such a mess that it had no idea of its profit and loss areas. Indeed, when it was privatised, it had only one qualified accountant and was making a profit in areas in which it believed that it was losing money. That made life exceedingly interesting.
<P>
Of course, BT's difficulties were solved by the fact that the market exploded at such a rate that demand soared and everyone got a larger slice of the pie, even though the percentages may have been smaller than before. Such was the size of the pie that the division of it was perfectly acceptable to everyone.
<P>
The position in postal services is different. Competition is building up, especially in certain parts of Europe. National postal companies are buying up the competition and becoming more powerful. When the market is liberalised--as will happen in a few years--companies protected from the effects of reality will find it much harder to change and counteract the competition. Unready companies will be bitten more severely and savagely by change. The longer change is delayed, the greater the impact.
<P>
The amendment will rectify an inconsistency with the Government's intention to introduce greater competition into the postal market. I hope that the Minister will respond positively on cross-subsidisation. I am unaware of the accounting system inside the Post Office and of the extent to which it knows which sectors and which parts of the country bring in the most money. That makes it more difficult to compete and harder for the regulator to pinpoint sectors in which predatory pricing is taking place. I hope that the Minister will accept that prices under such agreements should be geared to the costs of providing services to customers, and accept the amendment.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Tony Baldry</B>(Banbury): I am in the curious position of being the only Opposition Back Bencher. I shall not repeat what was said by my hon. Friends on the Front Bench because it was said very well and there is little point in echoing it.
<P>
The amendment is important. It would be helpful to have as clear a steer from the Government as possible on the extent to which the Bill is about freeing up the Post Office from Treasury controls or about introducing competition. If it is not about introducing competition and it is held that competition has gone far enough and further competition would endanger the universal service provider, let us have that said clearly. If the Bill is intended to increase competition, a signal to that effect should also be sent out. Otherwise, it will be frustrating, as people come forward believing that the Bill provides further competitive opportunities, only to find that the dominance of the main provider makes it pointless to enter the marketplace.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire made it clear that the amendment echoed both the White Paper on predatory pricing and the EU postal services directive, which allows variant but not predatory pricing. Is the Bill mainly about getting the Treasury off the back of the Post Office and allowing greater commercial freedom within its existing structure, or more about expanding competition in postal service?
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I shall urge the Committee to reject the amendment, but I shall try not to force a card vote.
<P>
Clause 4(2) is in line with the requirements of article 12 of the EU postal services directive, according to which the application of a uniform public tariff must not exclude the right of a universal service provider to conclude individual agreements on prices with customers. Under the amendment, the universal service provider--the Post Office--would be allowed to provide discounts only for pre-sortation. Such a scheme has existed for some years in respect of a company called Streamline. If something presented to the Royal Mail does not have to go through its own machinery, the customer receives a discount based on the amount of work that the customer has done. The amendment would enshrine that in the Bill, but would not allow the Post Office to go a step further and provide discount for bulk volume users.
<P>
The arguments made in support of the amendment were about competition. However, as I said, the amendment is inconsistent with article 12 of the EU postal services directive, whereas our proposal to allow the Post Office to offer discounts on volume--also the recommendation of the Trade and Industry Select Committee not long ago--is wholly in line with the directive. While the directive requires universal postal services to be geared to costs, there is no requirement for the ability to negotiate individual prices to be so restricted. Every competitor of the Post Office can offer discounts for bulk posting. We are talking here about a UPS area, so under the amendment, Parcelforce could not offer bulk discounts but all its competitors could.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The amendment would limit competition. Constraining the universal service provider, as envisaged by the amendment, might prevent volume users of postal services from negotiating commercial discounts and would put the universal postal operator at a competitive disadvantage. That applies to all the services within the universal sector, irrespective of whether such services are within the area reserved for licensed postal operators. It would be particularly undesirable for those parts of the universal service, such as parcels and the registered post, that are outside the licensed area and subject to full competition. The amendment cannot be in the interests of users of postal services.
<P>
The Mail Users Association, the Direct Mail Association and all the major trade associations representing bulk posters have been asking for bulk discounts for years--Reader's Digest being a good example. If companies put a large volume into direct mail rather than other forms of advertising, they should be able to negotiate a discount for it. The basis for discounting is properly a matter for the universal service provider--the Post Office--as it is for any other business. Pricing should be fair and transparent. I agree with the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire about that. Above all, it should not be anti-competitive.
<P>
These important matters will be dealt with by the Postal Sevices Commission through licence conditions. It is inappropriate to deal with them by amending the definition of the universal service and the uniform tariff. An outline of a proposed licence for Post Office companies is currently circulating. It set sets out stringent requirements--for example, a licensed operator will be required to ensure that prices are transparent, that there is no discrimination between like customers and that discounts are offered to all like customers. Every equivalent of Reader's Digest must therefore be offered the same bulk discounts.
<P>
Where a licence condition is to be included in conformity with the EU directive, the Post Office company will be obliged to establish and observe quality-of-service standards, to keep separate accounts within its internal accounting system for its activities within and outside the reserved area. Accounts for the non-reserved area must distinguish between activities that are part of the universal service and those that are not. The specific point raised by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire about transparent accounting is covered by our published outline of the proposed licence.
<P>
Once again, the amendment is not really about competition: it would prevent the Post Office from offering the same discounts as its competitors. Outside the reserved area, it would have the Post Office go back into a 1960s uncommercial shell and not allow a discount for volume, which the major users have wanted for many years. I am not sure, but I believe that the Select Committee on Trade and Industry recommended such a discount. I do not agree with every recommendation of that fount of all knowledge, but that one was especially pertinent given that 90 per cent. of Royal Mail traffic is business mail and that direct mail maintains the economies of scale in postal services. Direct mail is the only growing part of the service, so it provides economies of scale and allows postal services to be kept at a reasonable price. Given that the network has to exist, the cost is roughly the same whether the postman or postwoman walks up the front path to deliver five letters or 10 letters. The system needs volume to make it cost-effective. Again, the amendment would be dangerous, so I invite the Committee to reject it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> Pehaps the Minister has misunderstood the amendment and what I have said. If that is the case, I am sure that he has done so accidentally. There is no disagreement between us. We are not worried about allowing discounts for volume, or for pre-sorted letters or packages. However, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that prices under such agreements are geared to the costs associated with providing the service to those customers.
<P>
The Minister has run all around the Committee--metaphorically speaking, of course--but he has not ruled out the fact that a universal provider can gear its figures and subsidies to produce unfair competition. He has not answered my question. We are dealing with the Post Office, but I can envisage other commercial organisations operating under such licence conditions. Can the Minister assure the Committee that the Post Office can provide adequate financial figures to ensure that such offers to customes are calculated on a fair cost-to-price relationship with no element of cross-subidy?
<P>
The danger is that unrealistic figures might be quoted to maintain market share and to freeze out competition. My hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) touched an important chord and the Minister must be careful about how he responds, given that a signal will be sent from the Committee. Will companies be able to enter a competitive market, or is the substance behind the spin that they will be frozen out of the market?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Once again, we must draw a distinction between the reserved area and the universal postal service. They are two different things. The competitors can enter any area where items weigh more than 350 g or cost more than £1 to post. We are talking about the range of universal service areas up to 20 kg.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> That is precisely the point. Can the Minister look me in the eye and say that Parcelforce has never received a subsidy from the operations of Royal Mail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> No, I cannot. The hon. Gentleman knows that under this and the previous Administration a cross-subsidy has maintained the universal service. However, we are not talking about Parcelforce but about the panoply of universal service obligation providers. I can be helpful on one specific point that he made; I can say explicitly that, under the Bill, the Post Office plc will be subject to general competition rules, like any other postal operator, licensed or not. It will be a condition of the Post Office company licence that it must compete within the law, not abuse its dominance, enter into anti-competitive agreements or use anti-competitive means either to enter new markets or to consolidate its position within existing markets. The ability of the Post Office company, or any other designated universal service provider, to agree individual prices with customers, as required under the EU directive, will not allow anti-competitive cross-subsidy of services in the competitive area.
<P>
Although the basis of discounting is a commercial matter for the Post Office company, it will be required to ensure that the resultant prices comply with competition rules. In particular, it will be required to ensure that prices are transparent and offered to all like customers, and that it does not discriminate between like customers. That is set out clearly in the outline proposals, which have been placed in the Library and distributed to every member of the Committee. I can be no more explicit about competition. No one disagrees that the amendment would limit discounts purely for pre-sorted items, and not for bulk users.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> We are inching closer together as we speak so I am worried that I am wrong. In reading the information that magically appeared in front of him, the Minister said that the arrangements must comply with competition rules, and I say amen to that. The amendment goes along those lines, but if the Minister is not prepared to accept it, he could table an amendment on Report that would cover competition in direct mail areas; or perhaps he would be happy to accept a similar amendment if we table one on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Adequate provision has been made in the Bill for all the points that I have mentioned. No such amendment is needed; it would unnecessarily restrict the Post Office and other universal service providers that may hold a licence in a reserved area. I ask the Committee to oppose the amendment.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): My constituents take a keen interest in the Bill. I have already been paged by the local press twice today because those who live in rural environments fear that what we are doing will be detrimental to rural post offices.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said that he was concerned about the signal going out from the Committee. I would be most concerned if that signal was that the Bill did anything other than protect the future of rural post offices. It would be sad if I had to report to the press when I get back to them that the universal service obligation was under attack from Opposition Members. The press would be somewhat surprised because that is not what members of the Conservative party say back in Norfolk. There, they put themselves up as the defender of the Post Office and claim that it is we who are attacking it. The reality of what we are doing in Committee is interesting. My constituents want to be sure that 95 per cent. of the traffic in letters and parcels will get to them and that they will not be met with a refusal when they go to post an item in more rural parts of Norfolk. There are about 64 parishes in my constituency. The many rural post offices there must be protected.
<P>
I am worried about the clause. Although there are provisions elsewhere in the Bill for improving on the minimum figure, there is a danger that people will perceive a risk of deterioration of the service. What the clause lays down as the minimum is well below what people expect to receive from postal services, especially in urban areas, which I will not dwell on because a member of the Committee who represents a more urban area may wish to do so.
<P>
I said on Second Reading that I wanted the Minister to offer some hope that he, at least, had a vision of improvement in services in rural areas. I referred to one or two businesses that try to make a living in small villages a few miles from the main market town in my patch, King's Lynn. The firms of which I spoke are in the village of Walpole St. Andrew and they have particular trouble. They are small businesses employing seven, eight or nine people. I assume that the Government want them and other small businesses to continue to exist in villages because that will prove that some of the Government's objectives are being met. There will be a cut in car transport because people will be able to live near their work. Employment where people live is to be applauded, but it requires a modern business environment.
<P>
All too often rural areas are the last to get good IT links. People in rural areas become tempted to move to metropolitan areas to obtain access to modern e-commerce technology. If businesses are not provided with good postal services, and if they are not given assurances about them for the future, they will see merit in moving to some industrial estate in King's Lynn rather than staying in their small villages where their businesses have been successful.
<P>
Those small companies have witnessed the deterioration of the postal service in Walpole St. Andrew. Ten years ago, when the postman delivered on his bicycle, they received a delivery early in the morning. Improvements in the Post Office in the past 10 years have meant that now they sometimes do not get their post until <P>
<H5>2.30 pm. That is unacceptable. Given the pace of business these days, people cannot run businesses successfully with that sort of service. People tend to want instant gratification; they do not want to wait. Even if they cannot trade electronically, they still expect prompt responses, and to be able to change orders.</H5>
</P>

<P>
I have every sympathy with Mr. Atkin, who owns a small vegetable preparation business in a rural environment, close to the source of the product and to his 80 customers. He says that he would like his post to be delivered in the morning, please, as it is in other areas.
<P>
There is clearly plenty of room for improvement in the Post Office. I know that there will be other opportunities later in the Bill to debate this issue. We shall discuss what access should be, and we can lay it down. I stress how pleased I was when I had my first sight of the Bill to see that we had fulfilled our pledges in the White Paper and that particular attention would be drawn to the interests of rural areas. I hope that before we vote on the clause the Minister will give me some words of comfort to take back to my rural constituency at the end of the week.
<P>
<B>Miss Geraldine Smith</B>(Morecambe and Lunesdale): Clause 4 sets out the meaning of the universal postal service. The clause requires that at least one delivery of mail be made to every household and business in the United Kingdom each working day and that one collection be made each working day from every access point. Currently, two deliveries are the norm in urban areas and there are three or four collections from each access point every working day. Collections are made every day because the Post Office collects on Sundays. The Minister will agree that clause 4 sets out the absolute minimum standards to comply with those required by the EU postal services directive. I am sure that he will join me in assuring my constituents that there will be no reduction in service and that two deliveries of mail each working day in urban areas should continue to be the norm, as should frequent and early collections.
<P>
I greatly welcome the universal service obligation and the uniform tariff, which are now enshrined in the Bill; previously they were custom and practice. This measure will be welcomed by my rural constituents. The Conservatives have claimed in Committee that they protect rural communities, but the debate today has shown that that is not so, especially as regards postal services. The Opposition would be happy to reduce all postal services, including those in rural areas. Before I became a Member of Parliament, I had to fight Conservative proposals to privatise the Post Office and reduce services in rural areas. I find it a bit rich that they now claim to be the champions of rural areas because when it comes to the crunch, they are not.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Randall</B>(Uxbridge): It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Miss Smith) and the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner). I share some of the concerns of both hon. Members. I represent a suburban area. Many of my constituents receive two deliveries of mail each day. The points about a greater number of collections were well made.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk talked of the problem of late deliveries. They are by no means confined to rural areas. In my previous incarnation, I was a retailer. I am pleased to see one of the few other retailers in the House on the other side of the Committee. Retailers rely heavily on good delivery and collection of post. Uxbridge has always had a good service. I pay tribute to the postal workers there for getting the post to us on time, and collecting.
<P>
The hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale, in an attempt to hide her criticism of the Bill, engaged in come party politicking. I will take advantage of the Committee's acknowledged experts on the postal service and ask a couple of questions. I may have missed the point, and the matters may be obvious, but given this wonderful opportunity, I would like the Minister to clarify a couple of points. The clause provides for a universal postal service
<P>
except in such geographical conditions or other circumstances as the Commission considers to be exceptional.
Can the Minister give examples of such circumstances? What I consider exceptional may differ from the Commission's view and from that of some remote islanders. The hon. Member for Dumfries mentioned that point on behalf of the Western Isles.
<P>
It may be pedantic, but I should like a definition of a working day. I am no lawyer and I do not know whether such a definition exists, although it may de defined later in the Bill. Each industry and area has its own idea of a working week and a working day. To many people, a working week is Monday to Friday and I wonder if the Bill ensures that there will be Saturday delivers. As the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Miss Smith) said, there are many Sunday collections which is an asset. I often reply to constituents' mail at the weekend and post letters on Sunday at the local sorting office, to ensure that replies are received on Monday. At peak times, before Christmas, it is not unusual to have Sunday deliveries. I would not want such a service to be withdrawn because the Bill lacks the necessary provisions.
<P>
The definition of a working week may create problems as more and more people are working on Sundays. I speak with some bitterness, as someone with a retail business which may have to open on a Sunday. I may be in dispute with other Conservative Members as I am not a great supporter of Sunday trading, purely from a selfish point of view. I do not particularly enjoy working on a Sunday.
<P>
As we proceed towards seven-day trading, will a working week include Sundays for those companies that usually work on that day? Could they justifiably argue that that they should therefore have a postal delivery on Sunday?
<P>
This seems as good an opportunity as any to ask about the term ``postal packet'', which I understand to mean enclosed. However, journals are sent at the printed rate in a wrapper, which shows some of the contents. Will such mail be included in the term ``postal packet''?
<P>
I note, with some cynicism, the expression ``affordable prices'' in the clause. Everyone has a different definition of an affordable price; will the Minister explain what that phrase means in this context? Could it be better defined?
<P>
<B>Tony Colman </B>(Putney): I want to return to a matter that I raised on Second Reading and which is apposite in this debate. I am pleased that we are considering a universal postal service. The previous Government did not introduce such a measure; no standards were laid down. I assure my hon. Friends the Ministers for Morecambe and Lunesdale and for North-West Norfolk that the service in rural areas is superior to that in urban areas. I am from north Norfolk, and return there frequently; the postal service, which one does not get in urban areas, is provided by postmen and women who are long-term servants of the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> The hon. Gentleman draws attention to the fact that deliveries in urban and suburban areas suffer due to problems in recruiting and retaining staff. In London, for example, the price of housing causes difficulties. It is the number of postal workers that causes problems, not some devious plan.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Colman:</B> It is certainly a problem in Wandsworth, where housing, especially social housing, is almost non-existent as a result of the policies of the local Conservative council. Securing and keeping postal staff in urban areas would ensure that those areas had the same quality of service as rural areas. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> Some villages have an excellent postal service; people receive their post at 7.30 in the morning, as I do. However, the service is variable; I have received several complaints in the past year or so from people in the village of Walpole St. Andrew who were told, ``You're rural, you must put up with it.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Colman:</B> Knowing Walpole St. Andrew, I envy anyone living there. As I said on Second Reading, Christmas cards were still being delivered to Putney in the middle of February. The service there is non-existent for days on end. It is extremely important to register the need to ensure that compensation is available to Putney residents and businesses for the appalling postal service.
<P>
The Minister has circulated the proposed licence for the Post Office plc to the Committee. It is appropriate to draw hon. Members' attention to the contents of the licence. We should consider the quality standards, the procedures for dealing with customer complaints, the compensation scheme and the setting and changing of prices. I strongly welcome those proposals, which will make the Post Office more accountable to the public. It is important that the Post Office management take note of the strong feelings of Members on both sides of the Committee about what the universal postal service really means.
<P>
I was worried that the Minister seemed to dismiss concerns about residential mail being only 10 per cent. of the total. I accept that 90 per cent. is business mail, but our constituents should be sure that letters with first-class stamps will not be snowed under by sack-loads of business mail.
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall), I am worried about the definition of the working day. It is extremely unusual for mail to be delivered in Putney before 10 o'clock in the morning, and the working day seems to finish some time in the early evening. It is good that the postmen are still trudging around at that time, but questions must be asked about the management of the urban postal sorting offices in places such as Putney when deliveries are made at such times.
<P>
I fought to be selected as a member of this Committee because I receive more letters on this subject than on any other. [Hon. Members: ``When they get there.''] They get there in the end.
<P>
We should therefore welcome the fact that, under clause 4, the Government are introducing standards, compensation and a universal postal service. We can give our constituents guarantees on those matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Drew:</B> I welcome this, my first opportunity in Committee to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
Opposition Members have revealed their resistance in a manner recalling the dance of the seven veils. They tabled several clever amendments, but then threw their veils off in one go to reveal the naked truth. Conservative Members purport to support the universal service obligation, but in reality so want to restrict the Post Office's position as a major force delivering the post that it will be impossible for it to carry on in the way that we know and love.
<P>
Opposition Members said that they were wary of cross-subsidisation and the lack of transparency. Clause 4 will make the operation of the Post Office more transparent. However, if the Post Office's ability to perform under the USO is undermined, the market will be open to cherry-picking. I am especially worried about that, as are many Labour Members representing rural areas. We shall monitor the Government's performance on sustaining a proper postal service in rural areas and, if the amendments are accepted, judge whether the position worsens.
<P>
One aspect of commercial freedom is the ability to guarantee service to anyone anywhere in the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire may argue that increased competition will bring about a better service to people in outlying areas. However, that has yet to be proved. The history of privatisation shows that, without a universal service obligation, the service in such areas deteriorates and people have to pay more. Let us not fool ourselves about that: prime services will be taken up and charged at the going rate. However, the most deprived people in such areas--who can least afford to pay--end up paying much more.
<P>
Our debate has been instructive and useful. I am pleased that the Government are moving on and talking about the meaning of minimum services. Like my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk, I shall tease the matter out in debate on later clauses to discover what minimum services cover and what benefit they bring. However, clause 4 is good, and its provision for transparency is the right way to proceed. We should be under no illustion that accepting the Conservative amendments would bring about a deterioration in the service in rural areas. I therefore support the clause in its current form.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): I agree with the hon. Gentleman and other Government Members.
<P>
I shall speak briefly on public interest, an issue which is is currently prominent in many different spheres; it needs to be served by several different systems. The Post Office is practically unique in being almost a monopoly that is likely to provide the best means of serving the public interest in the widest possible sense, embracing people in rural and urban areas.
<P>
People often think that introducing competition and driving down the unit cost of products and services is always in the public interest, but that is not so. That has been demonstrated in so-called competition between supermarkets; unit costs have been driven down, but have been accompanied by decimation of high streets, huge environmental costs, a reduction in farm-gate prices and farmers being driven out of business. That is all in the name of competition and serving public interest, which was meant to ensure cheap food and other products.
<P>
In relation to postal services, the best wayof serving the public interest is to ensure that, as far as possible, we maintain the integrity of the universal service and the tariff charge. We should maintain deliveries and the sub-post office network and ensure a one-nation approach. Allowing a dangerous experiment in the dogma of privatisation would destroy a service that--with some inevitable failings--serves the public in the best way possible. We must ensure that the Post Office holds together, that cross-subsidy is accepted and that a full network access to post offices is agreed across the country. Anything other than that will, inevitably, result in cherry-picking.
<P>
We know that that will happen because something similar has occurred in another sphere. One by one, banks are closing rural branches, which are extraordinarily expensive to maintain. The idea of serving a few customers across the counter is far less important to the banks than increasing their million-pound profits and improving dividends to shareholders. The Post Office should not be like that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Randall:</B> Once again, I must put in a plea for suburbia. Suburban as well as rural bank branches have been closed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I accept that. Certainly, bank branches on suburban estates have been closed more swiftly than rural ones.
<P>
The Post Office is not like that. In our first sitting, I said that the Post Office had a different sort of customer--the public--and was in many respects, a monopoly. There is nothing wrong with that, because the public interest needs to be served by various measures. In some instances, competition and market forces are right. However, in some cases--the Post Office is a unique example--it is best served by a service holding together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Hoyle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> If nothing else, we are exercising the legs of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire.
<P>
Obviously, everyone is anxious about rural areas and we are all pleading for the important universal service. There has been a two-tier postal service--that in city centres and some towns, and that in the country. I represent Chorley, a town of 34,000 people. However, the 8,000 people in nearby Coppull receive their post in the afternoon. That is the sort of anomaly that will be addressed by the Bill. We have stated clearly that it is a minimum service, but we hope that it can be developed and we seek equality of service between rural, urban and suburban areas. I hope that the hon. Member for Uxbridge does not take umbrage--I mean Uxbridge. We want rural areas, suburbia, city centres, town centres--all areas-- to have equality of service.
<P>
As the Post Office builds its strength year on year, we may be able to envisage a true and beneficial service in rural areas. Nothing can stop that. From today, we can look forward to a better quality of service that can be geared up for a bright future.
6 pm
<P>
There is an important point about the rural banks closing because they have too few customers. The right question has to be asked about banks in rural areas. The problem is not that they are losing money--they are profitable--but that it is more profitable to close them. That is the real danger. Thankfully, earlier amendments have been refuted and thrown out. Otherwise, we would have seen a loss of service in rural areas. At the end of the day, I have only 22 parishes, 80 square miles and the moor land to serve, but thanks to the Bill, I can guarantee that the service will not just continue, but get better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> It is amazing what a call from the press can do. That is marvellous, but for the Minister's sake, I hope that all his hon. Friends do not receive a call from the press, or else we shall be here until midnight. I felt exactly the same when I was Member of Parliament for Workington with a very narrow majority, but it did no good. I look forward to the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) being reborn in another constituency with a more secure majority. [Laughter] The wheel turns. The hon. Gentleman's arguments reminded me of what people used to say would happen to rural telephone boxes if privatisation of BT ever took place. As I have already mentioned, there are now more telephone boxes working more effectively and more efficienlty than ever before.
<P>
The hon Member for Morcambe and Lunesdale was right to speak of minimum standards. The Post Office provides a higher level of service to the customer than is set out in the Bill. In the fullness of time, competition will come along and current standards will be driven even higher. If not, there is little point in having competition. I have to say--[Interuption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Members wish to speak to members of the public, they must not do so across the Bar.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> For a dreadful moment, I thought that you were addressing me, Mr. Maxton and I did not know why I was out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is not yet, anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I can understand the Minister saying that, because I represent an alternative to his central command economy approach to driving forward this nation. I am well aware of that and quite prepared to fight my corner. It reminds me of the rude comment of the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) about consumers suffering as a result of privatisation. That is simply not true. One has to look only at electricity prices, gas prices, telephone prices--all down--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> Train tickets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> May I ask the hon. Gentleman to repeat that?
 <P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> If the hon. Gentleman travelled on the west coast main line, he would realise that fares have doubled. What does he say about that effect of privatisation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> If the hon. Gentleman looked at the figures carefully, he would find that the number of people currently travelling on trains could never have been reached under the old pricing system. Life has moved on; the hon. Gentleman is comparing not apples with apples, but apples with pears. I would be happy to debate it further, but in another context, Mr. Maxton, as I am receiving your message very clearly. I stand by what I said, however, in rejecting the cavalier disregard of the hon. Member for Stroud for the merits of our privatisation programme, which has been a shining example adopted throughout the world. We deserve to take credit for it.
<P>
Some hon. Members eulogised clause 4 and the requirements of the universal postal service. I wish to make it clear that hon. Members on this side of the Committee are in favour of it, will vote for it and will defend it. However, that is not to say that it is a blanket that covers all postal activities. When the Post Office was split from BT, I recall that provision was made to allow some private companies to transport mail.
<P>
In a previous Committee, I proposed a Bill that allowed mail packets to be moved around the country by courier service. I later realised that I was responsible for unleashing, particularly in London, hordes of demon motorcyclists who threatened life and limb. I can now understand why the Minister of the day decided that I would be the one, rather than him, to discharge this particular honour. We all know that Ministers are there whenever something nice can be announced--and the nicer, the better. If it is really good news, the Secretary of State will be there. Conversely, bad news is the responsibility of the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State walks away.
<P>
I re-endorse our support for the universal postal service, but I also remind hon. Members who have been so enthusiastic about it that under clause 5(1), the commission has a duty
<P>
to further the interests of users of postal services, wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition between postal operators.
That means that postal operators should be able to carry out their business in as many areas as possible, not driven out under the guise of providing a universal postal service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> This has been a good debate, which epitomises how important postal services are to people all over the country. Their representatives in Committee have spoken eloquently about constituents' needs for effective services. Clause 4 sets out the meaning of a universal service and a universal service provider for the purposes of the Act. The meaning of the universal service is in line with the EU postal services directive. The universal service required by law and the subject of the commission's primary duty should be seen as a minimum level of service. I agree with my hon. Friends the Members for North-West Norfolk and for Morecambe and Lunesdale about that. Additionally, the level of service will be underpinned by service standards, which will be dealt with as licence conditions. They will be a matter for the commission and licence holders to determine.
<P>
We fully expect service standards to improve. A message can go back to the local newspapers in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley; in Committee this morning and this afternoon, we have defended and improved postal services. We have defended them from a clear attack on the universal service obligation and, by carrying clause 4, we shall have enshrined in law for the very first time universal service obligations that existed previously, but implementation of which had been left for the Post Office to decide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> These declaratory clauses are all well and good, but if there is a right, where is the remedy? If a consumer considers that universal standards have not been met, how will the Bill remedy that problem, or is the clause simply window dressing? How can a remedy be enforced if we consider that the standards are falling?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> We are dealing with clause 4, which is concerned specifically with the universal service obligation that is enshrined in law. The Bill will improve services to customers, as will be seen when we reach the part of the Bill that provides for revamped and more empowered consumer representation and includes the measures that my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Mr. Colman) said were contained in the licence provisions. Stringent service standards will be set and people in rural areas will be assured of at least as good a service as they receive now. Those minimum standards will be written into the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk, who is the grandson of a sub-postmistress, can be satisfied with his afternoon's work.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale who, like me, worked for the Post Office, referred to ``every working day''--a point that I shall cover when I respond to the hon. Member for Uxbridge. She talked about two deliveries. Nowhere else in Europe outside central Paris receives two deliveries a day. Not all addresses in the United Kingdom receive two deliveries, but 90 per cent. of them do and many of those are classified as rural. That is an almost unique element of our postal system. Nothing in the Bill will threaten two deliveries a day, but one delivery a day from Monday to Saturday has always been regarded as the minimum universal service obligation and one that we are carrying forward in the Bill.
<P>
I am pleased to respond to the hon. Member for Uxbridge. I accept that people do not put aside their detective novel each night to read the Bill. It is only people like Ministers who are forced to do that, or perhaps we all have the Bill as bedtime reading in place of our Mickey Spillane novel. However, clause 99 defines the working day and states that, in relation to the collection and delivery of letters, it is
<P>
any day which is not a Sunday or a public holiday.
That definition preserves the Monday to Saturday delivery. Incidentally, there is no Saturday delivery in Australia, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden or many other countries. This country has always had a Saturday delivery. Indeed, I could have been on a five-day week for the 15 years that I was a delivery postman if we had gone down the same route and locked out the customer on a Saturday. I did a six-day week, the same as 80 per cent. of delivery staff still do, because we believe in the importance of a six-day service to customers. We have enshrined the Saturday delivery to rural and urban areas in the Bill's definition of a working day.
<P>
The hon. Member for Uxbridge also referred to geographical conditions. We are anticipating the exceptions that exist at the moment. There a few isolated cases such as islands that cannot be delivered to every day because a boat goes there only twice a week. The commission will police those geographical conditions as part of the USO. Sunday collections are not part of the universal service obligation. Indeed, there were no Sunday collections between 1977 and 1987. I just happen to be the national officer of the union who negotiated their reintroduction, but that is another story. The Post Office provides such a service. I think that it is now cost-effective, but it certainly was not at the beginning. It was provided as part of the efforts made by the Post Office to improve the universal service obligation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Putney took us through the horrendous story of London SW15. My son lives there, so I am familiar with some of the matters that he mentioned. If Christmas cards are to be delivered earlier, perhaps we ought to put a Santa clause in the Bill. I hope that he accepts that Putney is an exception. The problems that occur in some of the 3,000 delivery offices in the country are matters for the Post Office and the unions.

<B>Mr. Colman:</B> I accept that it is an exception, but the exception has been going on for three years, which is a long time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I do not want to seem in any way frivolous about the problems suffered in Putney, which must be sorted out, but they are not representative of the experiences that other Members of Parliament have had of postal services in their constituencies.
<P>
I shall clear up a misunderstanding. I did not mean that 90 per cent. of mail was residential; I meant that 90 per cent. of mail was business mail, either individual to business, business to individual or business to business. Only 10 per cent. is social mail. Constituents in residential areas benefit from that 90 per cent. business mail service, as they use it to pay bills and so on.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) made an important contribution. Only 5 per cent. of villages in this country now have a bank, while 60 per cent. have a post office. It is important that we preserve that situation, and we shall debate that in another part of the Bill. There are tremendous opportunities for the Post Office network to provide the services that disappeared in rural areas a long time ago. My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley also defended the USO effectively.
<P>
I suppose that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire and I shall have the same debate throughout our discussions. I was a bit of mod in the party on the subject of clause 4, but now it seems that I am a reactionary who favours a command economy as part of a command dictatorship. The hon. Gentleman continually confuses telecommunications with post, which Lady Thatcher never did when she was Prime Minister. The telecoms industry is capital-intensive and has never provided a uniform tariff, as many hon. Members have mentioned. The postal service is labour intensive and has a uniform tariff. After they introduced the British Telecommunications Act 1981, and then Government sensibly did not move on to privatise the Post Office for the same reasons why they should not have attempted to do it in 1994, as the hon. Gentleman must recognise. We are happy for the Conservative party to stand on the basis of wanting to privatise the Post Office and reduce each universal service obligation. We would be comfortable to go to the British public with that division between us.
<P>
The debate on clause 4 has been unexpectedly long and interesting. Hon. Members have powerfully set out why the USO must be enshrined in the Bill, so I hope that the Committee will accept that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
