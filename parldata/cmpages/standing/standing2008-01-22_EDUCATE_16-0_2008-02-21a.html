							<b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): Good afternoon, Mr.
Bercow. May I welcome you to the Chair of the Committee? It has been
noted that either you are a glutton for punishment, or Mr.
Bayley has deserted us. We are not sure whether this reflects
enthusiasm on your part or reticence on his.</div>
					<a name="0802221000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any case, we left this
morning&#146;s sitting at clause 41, when I was mentioning that the
amendment is inspired and supported by the National Union of Teachers.
The last time I moved an amendment that was supported by the NUT we had
a tremendous triumph when the Government crumbled in the face of the
force of the argument and acknowledged that it had to be accepted. I
think that that is the only concession that the Minister has made so
far on the Bill. We look forward to seeing that in the
future.</div>
					<a name="0802221000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
optimistic, therefore, at this final stage of the week, that we might
also persuade the Minister to accept this amendment, which is an
addition to  clause 41(5) that would strengthen the
responsibilities of local authorities to identify individual needs and
ensure that they are provided. In particular, the amendment would
ensure that a local authority has to have regard to the</div>
					<a name="0802221000533"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;age, ability, aptitude and
needs...for personalised support and personalised
learning&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">of the young
person in question.</div>
					<a name="0802221000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning,
I also referred to a helpful letter that the Minister wrote to me on 13
February&#151;I understand that it will be copied to members of the
Committee&#151;in response to the undertaking that he made at the
evidence session on Tuesday 29 January to write to the Committee and
talk, prior to guidance being issued, about the Government&#146;s
attitude to young people who would find it difficult to comply with the
responsibility to be in education or training. In one sense, the
Minister&#146;s letter might not be regarded as directly relevant to
the amendment, because it deals primarily with the circumstances in
which an attendance panel would not insist upon a young person being in
education or training. However, I would like to relate that directly to
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column596" />Column number: 596</div>amendment and to the requirement that there should be a provision of
support for young people, because the Minister&#146;s aspiration, as
he has already told us, is that in all but a minority of cases, young
people should be in education or training or some other
setting.</div>
					<a name="0802221000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, we
are seeking to discover two things in that regard. First, we want to
know the extent to which there will be a clear responsibility on local
authorities to ensure that the education and training relates very much
to the young person&#146;s needs and circumstances, and that that
includes proper support for their personal needs. Secondly, we are
seeking to discover the extent to which the Minister will be willing to
envisage the type of fourth-way option or gateway option that some of
us have talked about during the Committee&#146;s proceedings and that
many of the outside lobby groups have also talked about. I have in
front of me a note from Fairbridge, which has given evidence to the
Committee and has been talking about a gateway phase to re-engage the
most difficult to reach.</div>
					<a name="0802221000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The letter that the Minister
sent to me on 13 February indicated that he accepts that</div>
					<a name="0802221000534"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there will be young people who
temporarily, or for a longer time, cannot in practice participate due
to their individual
circumstances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
also mentioned the need to provide the personalised support that will
help young people to be in education and training. He usefully
documents a list of the types of characteristics that might cause an
individual to need support services or potentially not to have to
comply with the attendance panel. He mentioned homelessness, health
problems, addiction, the nature and timing of the courses being
studied, young parents and people with caring responsibilities.
Although those may be reasons for a young person not to have the
education and training responsibility placed upon them by the
attendance panel, they could also be characteristics that should be
taken into account in the clause in providing for personalised
support.</div>
					<a name="0802221000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
characteristics could also lead to a fourth way that is not covered
explicitly in the Bill, but upon which I would like to test the
Minister&#146;s mind yet again. That option is to have personalised
support that would in no sense meet most people&#146;s understanding
of an education or training setting. These clauses and the amendments
that we discussed under clause 40 are predicated on the basis that
people will be in a formal education and training setting and that
their personal support needs will be moulded around
that.</div>
					<a name="0802221000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
acknowledged in our earlier exchanges that the Government might be
willing to allow people to be not in education and training settings,
but in some form of supported setting that would meet their needs prior
to them being able to access education and training. We do not know
whether the Government are willing to translate that good intention
into practice. How these support needs will be met is in the hands of
the guidance that will be issued later. That will show how flexible the
Government are and whether they will allow people to be not in the
formal education and training institutional environments referred to in
these clauses, but in the other settings that were envisaged by the
outside groups and voluntary bodies that gave evidence to
us.</div>
					<a name="0802221000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not expect the Minister to deal with the specific opt-out issues
that were identified in his letter in relation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 597</div>to the clause because they relate to other clauses.
However, I would like him to confirm that for young people with high
support and personal needs, the Government have in mind that there
should be at least three options other than going before the attendance
panel and being criminalised. First, they could be in the type of
education or training setting envisaged in the Bill, but with the
support that they require framed around their individual needs, as
envisaged in the amendment. That option is the Government&#146;s core
desire for young people with great
vulnerabilities.</div>
					<a name="0802221000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there is the possibility that the Minister raised in his letter of 13
February, that some young people with very acute needs might not be in
any setting whatsoever. Thirdly, there is the other possibility that I
am asking the Minister to comment on because it is relevant to the
issue of young people&#146;s support needs. I am asking whether there
could be another option between doing nothing and being criminalised
and having personal support delivered in an education and training
setting, which would enable providers with expertise in this area to be
involved. That could be a drug rehabilitation centre where there is
nothing that would be regarded as accredited education or training, but
where the young person would be in a setting that is dealing with a
personal problem to enable him or her to go back into education or
training.</div>
					<a name="0802221000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is one
of the places in the Bill where we can explore with the Minister not
only whether the right sensitive support will be available for young
people in education and training, but whether such a different setting
is envisaged. Given that we were so successful with our NUT-linked
amendment, we would like to hear whether he is willing to put in the
Bill this more robust form of wording to ensure that there is a strong
duty on local authorities to consider all of the needs of young people
defined in the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0802221000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would also like to hear how the Minister envisages the fourth option,
or gateway option, working. Is it a serious option that the Government
would consider as a mainstream alternative to what appears in the Bill
or would they use it just as a short-term stopping-off point prior to a
young person entering education and training with personalised support?
That is what I am hoping the get out of moving the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0802221000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0802221000604"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): I want to
return briefly to a point that I made earlier. When it comes to the
service of the notices that are created in clauses 39, 40 and 41, and
the question of personalising the training and education opportunities,
as in amendment No. 164, it is important that there is genuine
engagement between the local authority and the individual
concerned.</div>
					<a name="0802221000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am worried
that a person who has left school with the sort of the problems that I
have mentioned in Committee, who is perhaps able to read and write at
only a low level&#151;they might be at a lower level than one at
which they would be able to tell their bank, for example, about a
change of address&#151;will find the notices complicated. A young
person who is ill-educated might not understand the sort of details
that are being talked about&#151;the courses are called things such
as basic skills or life skills. Will the Minister assure us that when
the notices are served on someone who might have poor educational
attainment, there will be a discussion with them to explain exactly
what the notice means?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 598</div>
					<a name="0802221000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to earlier questions,
the Minister told me that there will be advisers&#151;I accept
that&#151;but could there be some more formal legislative requirement
to ensure that a person is notified, so that we do not have a situation
in which notice after notice arrives at a person&#146;s house and are
ignored? Ultimately, such a person could find themselves in a serious
process, in court and so on. I am concerned about the possibility of a
paper trail but no active engagement between individual and authority.
Will the Minister say whether the notices will be served personally or
served by post? If it is not a personal service, will the panel require
that a person has understood a notice? Will the Minister comment on
those
issues?</div>
					<a name="0802221000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000605"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):
						</b> What a
pleasure it is, Mr. Bercow, to see you in your place yet
again. I am sure that the Committee will not tire of your presence in
the Chair, however consistently and frequently you are
there.</div>
					<a name="0802221000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000606"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I do not want to delay the Committee, and
I appreciate that this announcement will be accompanied by much flowing
of tears, but I told the Minister before the sitting that, sadly, this
is my last sitting in the Chair of this
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0802221000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000607"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Naturally, Mr. Bercow, we are
distraught, which is not to say that we are not looking forward the
Mr. Bayley&#146;s return next week. I might not have the
opportunity later on this afternoon to say how much I have enjoyed
serving under your chairmanship, so let it be recorded now that I have
thoroughly enjoyed serving under your guidance.</div>
					<a name="0802221000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I absolutely agree that the
education or training specified in an attendance notice must be
appropriate to the young person&#146;s needs. The aim of the notice,
ultimately, is to get the young person to participate in education or
training so that they can benefit from the opportunities and advantages
that that offers. They can do that only if the learning programme meets
their needs. In addition, the local authority must identify an
appropriate learning place for the young person and give them the
opportunity, and support to engage in it voluntarily, before they can
even meet the conditions for issuing an attendance notice. It is
important that the hon. Member for Yeovil understands that the
attendance notice is a stage in an enforcement process and that
enforcement should not start, as I have said repeatedly, unless
adequate support has been provided but not taken up.</div>
					<a name="0802221000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also agree that in many cases
the learning programme specified at that point would need to be
specialised and personalised. The hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire asked about discussion and whether the notice would be
personally served. As I have said to him before, prior to enforcement,
all the support provided and the contact via Connexions with a personal
adviser would be personal.</div>
					<a name="0802221000563"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0802221000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000608"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> My concern is the person who just does not engage
with the process, which happens in other contexts such as the
welfare-to-work programmes. I am worried about the sort of people who
do not go when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column599" />Column number: 599</div>they are invited to an interview and ignore a letter when they get it
through the door. How do we ensure that such people understand what
they are supposed to be doing and how the process cranks
open?</div>
					<a name="0802221000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000609"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is describing
a scenario in which someone just does not engage with the process in
any shape or form. However, there will still be the expectation that
the personal adviser will have made contact with the individual. It
will not be sufficient in terms of adequately assessing and offering
support to have sent letters, e-mails or other forms of communication.
It is important that there is a personal exchange between those
involved either by phone or face to face to discuss the matter. I
envisage that taking place over a series of exchanges, not simply
one.</div>
					<a name="0802221000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the serving of
the notice, obviously the initial steps are set out in clause 39 in
relation to the 15-day notice period. It would normally take the form
of a letter to the address that Connexions and the local authority have
for that individual. Clearly, if the 15 days elapse and there is no
response, the process would move to the serving of the notice. If the
person to whom the initial letter has been served says that they did
not receive it, that it did not arrive in the post, or that they could
not read it, it may be that the letter would at that point be reissued.
The notice would be reinstigated by means of it being personally served
and the personal adviser going to the address, giving the person the
letter and explaining its contents. That is what would need to happen
at that point.</div>
					<a name="0802221000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later,
in respect of the attendance panels themselves&#151;and I am sure
that we will discuss this in the context of later amendments&#151;we
want to ensure that panel hearings take place in a friendly way and not
a formal court-like setting. Such a setting would occur later down the
track, if the matter is sent to the youth court. The panels should be
informal and the young person should participate in the panel hearing,
which is something that we will also discuss later. The young person
should understand what is happening and the process in which they are
involved at every stage. I hope that that helps the hon. Member for
North-East
Hertfordshire.</div>
					<a name="0802221000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000610"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I hope that I am not pre-empting something that the
Minister will come to later, but subsection (5)
states:</div>
					<a name="0802221000535"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
education or training must be suitable for the
person&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0802221000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we
proceed, how will &#147;suitable&#148; be
defined?</div>
					<a name="0802221000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000611"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I will address the specific wording of the
subsection of this clause in a moment, but there is great flexibility
in the way that it is currently worded. On the questions of the hon.
Member for Yeovil about what we keep referring to as the fourth option
and fourth way, as I have said, support is important both in practice
and in theory, for however long it is needed, but it should not be
separated from participation. The specific aim of the attendance notice
is to set out participation in education and training, but we envisage
that support will also continue and that it will be
flexible in the form that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column600" />Column number: 600</div>can take. However, support is not an alternative as other ways of
participating are. It is not an alternative to education or training,
but it must work towards those to get to the point of the attendance
notice.</div>
					<a name="0802221000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000612"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I apologise for interrupting the Minister again.
However, I wonder whether he is going back on an undertaking given
earlier in the Committee that he could envisage circumstances in which
people might need support that could mean that they are not in
education or training for a long period of time, and that that support,
possibly from a voluntary group, might not look like education or
training. Is that still a
possibility?</div>
					<a name="0802221000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000613"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> It is certainly still a possibility. I would not
want to retract that in any way. I am simply suggesting that we
envisage support continuing, but the support is not an end in itself,
as I have said before. The end is appropriate education and training. A
re-engagement activity may be required in order to get young people
into education or training, but in most cases I would envisage that it
would have been offered, and hopefully delivered, beforehand. The
attendance notice process is there to try to get them to engage and I
do not want to define it any differently from the way it has been
defined previously.</div>
					<a name="0802221000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is technically unnecessary. The existing provision in
subsection (5) that the education or training specified in the notice
must be suitable&#151;the words that he picked up on&#151;for the
young person, already implies in law that it must be appropriate for
their individual needs and circumstances. In that respect, it is very
flexible.</div>
					<a name="0802221000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
have reflected and will continue to do so between now and the Report
stage on whether we need to define the matter slightly more closely so
that it is not only suitable for the person, but addresses their
individual needs. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a categorical
assurance because I need to reflect further and consult others on the
matter. However, I intend to see how we can refer to the flexibility of
the definitions that we set out in clause 4, but without relating
solely to that clause, because it does not include the employment with
training option. We would obviously want that to be available within
the attendance notice. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman some

the needs and circumstances of the young person concerned so that they
can fulfil their duties 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 601</div>imposed by clause 2. That is how it is set out in
the legislation. I do not know how to define it any more closely, for
which I apologise. As I have said, I will consider whether to tighten
the wording in subsection (5). I hope that the hon. Member for Yeovil
will withdraw his amendment on that
basis.</div>

							<a name="0802221000618"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister. Given how difficult
it is to wring any concessions out of Ministers on these occasions, I
suppose that I should be extremely grateful and rush out a press
release that champions the achievement and glorifies the NUT for being
associated with only the second twinge of movement from a Minister
during Committee.</div>
					<a name="0802221000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I, however, clarify a couple of concerns? Perhaps I did not emphasise
the issue of suitability enough in my opening comments. I took it for
granted that the Minister would trot out his line on it, but he did not
say as much as I expected, so I shall say something about it now before
moving on to the issue of support, and the question of what he might
concede and what he will not concede.</div>
					<a name="0802221000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 41 (5) says:</div>
					<a name="0802221000536"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The education or
training must be suitable for the
person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
raises the question of what the word &#147;suitable&#148; means and
who should interpret it. I think that we know who will interpret it,
but the greater problem is what it means. The Minister said that there
is great flexibility around the word, but that can be a good or a bad
thing. It may mean that there is a lot of uncertainty or that the word
is interpreted very differently in different parts of the country, so
we need to be slightly clearer about what it means.</div>
					<a name="0802221000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can think of a number of
different examples in which the issue of suitability might arise. One
with which the Government will not have a problem is a young person who
is in employment. To take our earlier example, someone who is employed
as a car mechanic may want to become a nuclear
physicist.</div>
					<a name="0802221000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000619"></a>Jim

						</b> It was an accountant
before.</div>
					<a name="0802221000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000620"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Perhaps that person has become more aspirational and
more interesting since we last discussed the Bill and wants to do
something that requires a course that does not relate to their
employment. They therefore tell the local government officer that they
are not willing to go on the local college&#146;s tedious car
mechanics course, which people are trying to persuade them to take, and
say that they are waiting to go on a course in accountancy, nuclear
physics, fishing or some other subject. Will there be any obligation on
them to take up education and training that is related to the
employment that they are in? Does the question of suitability have any
relevance in that situation?</div>
					<a name="0802221000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government can probably
provide reassure on that issue, but the amendment also refers to the
question of ability and aptitude. What if someone considers a course is
too difficult for them, given their skills? What if they think that
they need some other type of education beforehand? What if they simply
think that the local college course on offer in their subject is
hopeless and rubbish or that it is being taught that year by somebody
who is not in regular attendance? What if they want to wait until the
next year?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000621"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I remind the hon. Gentleman of what I said this
morning. At any point, the young person can voluntarily opt to fulfil
their duties under clause 2, in which case the enforcement proceedings
will stop, unless the issue has reached the youth court. If they do not
want to go on a particular course with a particular lecturer, and there
is something else that they want to do that they think is more suitable
for them, they can  do it.</div>
					<a name="0802221000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000622"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Yes, that is true, but they might not have that
option, particularly if the course that they want to take is closed
that year or is not available in a setting that they reach. It may be
difficult for them to afford transport costs, which we shall discuss
later.</div>
					<a name="0802221000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I were a
young person who did not want to comply with the Bill, I might well
argue that the education offered to me was not suitable, particularly
if I was not enthusiastic about taking up education and training in the
first place. Somebody might come to me and say, &#147;You should be
in education and training. How about these eight different courses at
Yeovil college?&#148; All those courses would no doubt be excellent,
particularly, I hasten to add, if they were on offer at Yeovil college.
In another part of the country, however, there might not be any
exciting courses on offer, and the educational institution might be
less effective. How would suitability be defined in that
case?</div>
					<a name="0802221000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We therefore
want a bit more clarity from the Minister on how the word
&#147;suitability&#148; relates to a person&#146;s needs and
aptitudes. I am not sure whether he is saying that he will consider
clarifying the issue between now and the Bill&#146;s later stages, or
whether, when he said that he would reflect on it, he meant that he
would reflect on its more personalised elements. He said that there
could be guarantees that the support needs would meet the young
person&#146;s requirements. That is a major concern, and there is
also concern about the funding that might go with it. The issue is not
only whether support needs can be identified, but whether they will be
funded and whether that will be acceptable.</div>

					<a name="0802221000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am tempted,
notwithstanding the Minister&#146;s generosity, to press the
amendment to a Division. However, if he intervenes on me to clarify
which part of the issue he is willing to reflect on, I might feel much
more reassured, and therefore less likely to do
so.</div>

difficult to reflect on one aspect an eight or nine-word phrase without
reflecting on the other words in the provision. If I think about
whether the education or training meets the individual needs of the
person, I shall inevitably think about the word,
&#147;suitable&#148;. If I reflect on that issue, I shall reflect

						<a name="0802221000625"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I beg to
move amendment No. 85, in
clause 42, page 23, line 21, at
end add&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5) This section
may not come into force before the Secretary of State has published a
report setting out his estimate of the total annual cost of the
establishment and operation of attendance
panels.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0802221000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Welcome
back to our proceedings, Mr. Bercow. Clause 42 establishes
attendance panels in each local authority that will hear appeals by
young people who have been issued with attendance notices. It would be
helpful if the Minister could expand on his intention towards the
regulations in clause 42(3). In particular, subsection (3)(a) states
that the panel chairman must not be a member of the local authority,
which means, I assume, that he must not be a councillor for that
authority. Can he or she, however, be an employee of the
authority?</div>
					<a name="0802221000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000626"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> To speed things up for the Committee, it is our
intention that they should not be a council employee, and we will
certainly clarify that point in regulation.</div>
					<a name="0802221000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000627"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> That is extremely helpful. Will the Minister then
also set out who else can serve on the panel? Can councillors fill all
the positions on the panel, with the exception of the chair? Can
council employees serve on the panel, subject to the Minister&#146;s
intention that they cannot chair it? If the answer is yes, how does
that make the panel independent? The clause does not refer to
attendance panels being independent, nor indeed do the famous
explanatory notes, so it would be helpful if he could clarify that
point.</div>
					<a name="0802221000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s White Paper&#151;I presume it is a White
Paper&#151;called, &#147;Raising Expectations: from Policy to
Legislation&#148;, says at paragraph 4.33:</div>
					<a name="0802221000537"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the young person
wished to challenge the Attendance Notice it would be referred to an
independent adjudication panel, which the local authority will set
up&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0802221000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
document therefore refers to an independent panel. Furthermore, in the
Minister&#146;s letter to the hon. Member for Yeovil of 13 February,
which was copied to all Committee members, there is an explicit
reference in the third paragraph to an &#147;independent attendance
panel&#148;. Clearly, the Government have applied
&#147;independent&#148; to the panel in their policy, but it is not
clear from the clause that, other than the chair, the panel will be
independent of the local authority that first issued the notice.
Clarification from the Minister would therefore be helpful.</div>
					<a name="0802221000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 85 relates to the
costs that will be incurred by the local authority in establishing and
running the attendance panels. It says that clause 42</div>
					<a name="0802221000538"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may not come into force before the
Secretary of State has published a report setting out his estimate of
the total annual cost of the establishment and operation of attendance
panels.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
presume that such an estimate has already been prepared by the
Government in introducing the Bill. The purpose of the amendment is
principally to enable the Minister to share that information with the
Committee.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column604" />Column number: 604</div>
					<a name="0802221000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3)(b) gives the
Secretary of State the power to make regulations to enable local
authorities to pay allowances to members of an appeal panel. Could the
Minister spell out how much these allowances will be, the conditions of
payment, how many members each panel will have and the likely frequency
of their meetings? The Local Government Association is obviously
anxious about the provision and the possible result. It is only too
aware of countless new duties imposed on local government by central
Government without sufficient funding to match.</div>
					<a name="0802221000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LGA said in its briefing
that local authorities</div>
					<a name="0802221000539"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will want to be involved in the
drafting of regulations regarding the constitution of attendance panels
to ensure that they are not overly bureaucratic, burdensome or
costly.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister
therefore spell out his thinking on the regulations so that the
Committee can be reassured that attendance panels will not be overly
bureaucratic, burdensome or costly? An estimate of the likely annual
cost of operating these panels would also assist our
deliberations.</div>
					<a name="0802221000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000628"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I shall be extremely brief. We support the
amendment, and we want to hear what the costs associated with the
provision are likely to be, how they will be met by local authorities
and whether there will be any additional funding relating to them. We
also hope that there will be a clear answer from the Minister to the
question implicit in the observation by the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton that local authorities want to be involved in
the formulation of the regulations as to how the panels will operate
and how they will be set up to make sure that the costs are reduced and
that they are as effective as possible. I hope that the Minister can
tell us how they will be
involved.</div>
					<a name="0802221000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000629"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> Will the Minister make a few comments about the
implications for civil legal aid? Community legal centres provide
education law advice and are funded by the legal aid fund. In those
circumstances, it appears that there will be a need for more advice for
young people who attend panels. I should be grateful to know what
discussions the Minister has had with the Ministry of Justice and what
he estimates will be the costs to the legal aid
fund.</div>
					<a name="0802221000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000630"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The attendance panel is crucial to the
effectiveness and fairness of the enforcement system. It is in place to
ensure that attendance notices are issued fairly and that there has
been sufficient opportunity and support. They provide an additional
safeguard to ensure that no young person can enter the enforcement
system inappropriately. We will ensure that it is effective in its
purpose and that it is not too bureaucratic.</div>
					<a name="0802221000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton asked about the panel&#146;s composition and
independence. We will want to consult fully about how it should be
composed and how it should work, but I can set some of those things out
in principle. Part of the consultation will undoubtedly involve the LGA
and other local government interests to ensure that they have a proper
opportunity to express their opinion. I remind the hon. Gentleman that
we have committed to funding any costs to local government of carrying
out that function in full.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column605" />Column number: 605</div>
					<a name="0802221000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
composition, we envisage that the local authority will establish a pool
of potential panel members by advertising. Panel members will receive
fairly brief training on, for example, understanding the law and
regulations in education and support systems, and on the expectations
of them when they interact with young people who come before the panel.
Those are examples&#151;it is not an exhaustive list of the things in
which they might be trained. Some people in the pool will be designated
as chairs, and they will receive additional training. The pool will
include some people with a background and expertise in education or the
support professions&#151;such people would have experience of the
education system and would understand it, just as schools admissions
appeal panels include at least one person who has experience in
education and an acquaintance with educational conditions in the area
or who is the parent of a registered pupil.</div>
					<a name="0802221000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
requirement for the composition of admissions appeal panels, and we are
seeking to replicate it. Indeed, much of the Government&#146;s
thinking on how the panels will be composed and resourced is informed
by how school admissions appeal panels work. The panel will normally
consist of three people: the independent chair, at least one person
with an education or support background, and one other person. We will
consult on whether there should be provision for larger panels in more
complex cases. Clearly, some importance will be placed on ensuring that
there is sufficient diversity among panel members, and that they
reflect the area in which the authority is based.</div>
					<a name="0802221000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should
be restrictions on who can become  a panel member to enforce
impartiality and independence&#151;an issue about which the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was concerned. We will
clarify by regulation the fact that someone who is employed by the
local authority or the educational institution in question should not
serve on the panel. The same applies to any person about whom there are
reasonable doubts as to their impartiality in relation to an authority
or a school. Obviously, panellists would need to satisfy the training
requirements, and they should not be involved in the decision that is
being appealed.</div>
					<a name="0802221000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
end, costs will be determined by the consultation, which we have not
yet carried out, and after we decide how the panel will be configured.
To help the Committee, the Department has made a rough estimate of
about &#163;1.5 million, based on the costs of schools admissions
appeal panels. We have not made that explicit in the impact assessment,
but it has been included in the general costings. As I said, we have
already committed both to funding additional burdens on local
authorities and to consult fully with the LGA. We will certainly
consult and take careful account of the likely costs of establishing
the panels and their functions. We will make our cost assessment for
local authorities, and we are committed to funding the measure. I hope
that I have successfully answered the questions that were asked in the
debate.</div>

that the process will result in any more young people being entitled to
legal aid than now.</div>

							<a name="0802221000633"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> A certain number of parents and students go to a
law centre to obtain legal advice, funded by the civil legal aid fund,
on panels, exclusions and such things. The measure will create a larger
cohort of such people. We are talking about panels for 16 to
18-year-olds who are do not comply with the measure, so there are bound
to be more people who want educational advice from law centres. If only
one case went to the panel, that would create one more such person. In
those circumstances, I suggest that the Minister talk to the Ministry
of Justice, because the civil legal aid fund is very
pressed.</div>

of great concern. I accept the generosity with which he is advising me,

listening attentively enough, but of the Government&#146;s estimates
of the cost of the Bill, what is the cost for independent advocacy

themselves it would be good practice for the authority to offer that

friendly and informal so as to engage young people. The more we end up
using advocates, the greater the danger that the process will be

							<a name="0802221000641"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> I listened carefully to the Minister&#146;s
response to the amendment and to the exchange between him and the hon.
Member for Yeovil. The point that he was trying to extract from the
Minister is whether, within the &#163;1.5 million, there is a cost
for advocacy. Regardless of whether he wishes to encourage it, which he
does not seem to, or whether local authorities will provide it in any
case because they believe in helping social justice, advocacy is
inevitable.</div>
					<a name="0802221000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000642"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I did not say that I do not want to encourage
advocacy, but that if the need is there for the young person, the local
authority should be encouraged, in guidance, to provide
it.</div>
					<a name="0802221000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000643"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> That is a helpful revision to the impression that
the Minister gave during the exchanges, but it will inevitably involve
a cost. He was not able to respond adequately to the intervention of
the hon. Member for Yeovil, so I suspect that the &#163;1.5 million
does not include the cost of such advocacy.</div>
					<a name="0802221000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000644"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> There are two possible elements of cost: one is
that a legal centre could give advice to the individual and help them
to prepare a statement to the panel; and the other is a case where an
advocate needed to attend. In both cases, however, the legal aid fund
would pay, unless the Department for Education and Skills is now
thinking of funding it.</div>
					<a name="0802221000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000645"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> This legislation will therefore add yet another
burden and drain on the fund, so my hon. Friend makes a good point. I
listened carefully to the Minister, who made some good points about
wanting to consult fully, which is welcome. He also said that the Local
Government Association, which will have to implement that through its
membership, will also be consulted on the regulations, and that the
costs will be refunded to the local authorities, which will please
local authorities and council tax payers. Of course, the costs always
fall somewhere on the general public, so the taxpayer will be picking
up the bill, and we want to ensure that we can be assured that the
costs that the Minister has just divulged to the Committee will be
accurate.</div>
					<a name="0802221000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
also gave some welcome indications about the membership of the panel,
and it is pleasing that he has explicitly ruled out any employee of the
local authority that issued the attendance notice being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column608" />Column number: 608</div>on the panel, either as chairman or as an ordinary member. It is also
welcome that the panel appears to be confined to three people, which
will prevent it from becoming too expensive. However, I am not yet
convinced that we have bottomed out the costs, and I suspect that the
&#163;1.5 million to which he has referred is solely the allowances
of the panel&#146;s attendees. Of course, there are other costs
associated with operating such an attendance panel, such as secretarial
support and office accommodation within the local authority. If I have
done my maths correctly on the basis of the quantum assessment that the
Minister uses, &#163;1.5 million amongst 150 local authorities is
only &#163;10,000 per local authority, so I suspect that he has
underestimated the cost of operating attendance panels.</div>
					<a name="0802221000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that
reason, I think that the Bill should contain a statement that requires
the Secretary of State to publish a report setting out the estimate of
the total annual cost for the establishment and operation of attendance
panels before the section comes into play. Given that we have until
2013 to do that, I do not think that it is an unreasonable burden for
the report to be published so that it can be scrutinised by hon.
Members. One of the key reasons why we have any power at all in the
House is to assess spending, costs and tax-raising
measures.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000646"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> As a last-gasp attempt to get the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s agreement, we are saying that we will have a
consultation and that then there will then be regulation, which can, of
course, be debated by the House. The report that he proposes in the
amendment would be only a report. Indeed, we would want there to be a
report to inform any debate that there might be in the House about any
regulation, so that will effectively happen, whether or not the
amendment is made.</div>

Given that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will
effectively get costings in the fullness of time, I am pleading that it
is not necessary for him to press the

							<a name="0802221000651"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> It is true that there are regulations under clause
42(1), but they are under the negative procedure, so there is no
guarantee that there would be a debate on them. I do not know whether
my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton feels that
the Minister might look at the concession of making that part of the
affirmative
procedure.</div>
					<a name="0802221000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000652"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a valuable intervention. If the
Minister were to promise to change that particular regulation and make
the power into an affirmative resolution power, I would seek leave to
withdraw the amendment. About 2,000 or 3,000 negative resolution
statutory instruments go through the House every year and I suspect
that few of those have a fully costed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column609" />Column number: 609</div>report attached to them. Given that it is not mutually exclusive to have
a regulation and a report setting out the Secretary of State&#146;s
estimate of the costs of those regulations, I see no reason on the
basis of that intervention or the general debate we have had not to
press the amendment to a Division at the appropriate
time.</div>
					<a name="0802221000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000653"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The amendment deals with cost issues, but we are
entitled to ask what is included in the cost estimate. As a consequence
of probing that issue, rather disappointingly, we have found that
advocacy services will not be a requirement for local authorities. I
appreciate that the Minister&#146;s natural instinct was to discuss
advocacy under clause 43, when we will deal with other advocacy issues,
but it is under clause 42(1) that the Government will provide guidance
to local authorities in relation to duties under the
provision.</div>
					<a name="0802221000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have had
a representation from Barnado&#146;s that covers not only some of the
later clauses, but clause 42(1) and therefore the costing of it. In the
context of a group that supports the Bill as a whole, Barnado&#146;s
makes it clear that it would like Ministers to provide clear assurances
that statutory guidelines under clause 42(1) will require local
authorities to make available independent advocacy services. When the
Minister was challenged on that, he said that he would encourage local
authorities to provide those services. Therefore, presumably his cost
estimates are based on the assumption that only a proportion of local
authorities will do so. If he is assuming that they will all do so, one
wonders why the necessary provision cannot be put into regulations or
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0802221000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Barnodo&#146;s
makes the point powerfully that it wants to ensure that independent
advocacy services are available, particularly for young people who have
learning, communication or sensory difficulties and in other specific
circumstances. We can all imagine that young people who appear before
such a panel under the circumstances that are envisaged would find the
situation incredibly difficult, may have serious communication
difficulties and may find it intimidating. Is it good enough to
encourage local authorities to provide advocacy services in those
circumstances? Given the Minister&#146;s generosity in relation to
the previous clause, when he said that he would reflect on some of the
issues, will he reflect on the possibility of obliging local
authorities to provide advocacy services for a prescribed number of
conditions? If local authorities have financial constraints, it will
not be good enough if, on the grounds of cost, some local authorities
chose not to make advocacy services available to young people with the
learning and communication difficulties to which Barnado&#146;s
refers. That seems to be a powerful point to which the Minister could
usefully respond or on which he could
reflect.</div>
					<a name="0802221000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000654"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I will say two final things. We continue work on
the estimates of the cost of attendance panels and at this stage we
intend to have those ready in order to include more detailed estimates
in the revised version of the impact assessment that will be published
when the Bill is introduced in the other place.</div>
					<a name="0802221000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulations will not provide for
an entitlement to independent advocacy, but they will state that the
young person should be invited and allowed to bring someone with them
to assist with the process. However, as I have said, it is not a formal
court hearing. I have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column610" />Column number: 610</div>also said that guidance would indicate that it is good practice where
there are specific needs. I shall consider whether in that guidance we
should define things carefully, leaving some flexibility for the
authorities, along the lines described by the hon. Member for
Yeovil.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000655"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I welcome that response and make a brief
intervention in order to reinforce the concession that we might get
from the Minister on the matter. I am grateful to him for saying that
he will at least consider placing a duty on local authorities relating
to young people with particular learning and communication needs. That
would satisfy some of my concerns about the
clause.</div>

virtue of the fact that it is outside the social partnership with the

made in Committee following its representations. The NUT is seriously
concerned about the extent of the grounds for appeal. It says in its

					<a name="0802221000540"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
hoped that the provision for young people to appeal against an

being particularly friendly towards the NUT at the moment, I will
associate myself with the amendment before he adopts it in the Bill. It
addresses very directly the issues of suitability that we raised, as
well as our concerns about the lack of clarity as to how that will be
assessed. How suitability is defined will provide the basis for
challenges that are made on the issue. This is another superb amendment

disagree with the National Union of Teachers. However, the clause
requires that local authorities make arrangements for young people to
appeal to the attendance panel against the giving of the attendance
notice, the description of education or training that they must attend,
and any variation to the notice. No grounds are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column612" />Column number: 612</div>specified so, as drafted, the provision allows the young person to
appeal against the description on the grounds of its suitability or for

appeal.</div>

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4) Regulations

one month of the appeal being

					<a name="0802221000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment was tabled to ensure that there is no undue delay in the
young person being able to make their case to the attendance panel.
There is always a tendency in bureaucracies for a lack of urgency to
creep in, but it is important for the young person who is subject to
the pressure of a written notice from a local authority and then an
attendance notice that the issue is resolved swiftly. If the
enforcement procedures are to be real from the point of view of the
Government and of those in favour of compulsion, the appeals process
must not become bound up in delay and obfuscation. The amendment
therefore seeks to ensure that appeals are heard within one month of
being made. Swift action on all the measures in the Bill is important
for its efficacy, given the short period during which the duty to
participate will apply. It would also be helpful if the Minister said
something about the procedures of the attendance panel and whether the
rules of natural justice and those that apply to tribunals will also
apply to the hearing of appeals on
attendance.</div>
					<a name="0802221000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister expressed the view that arrangements for those appeals should
be informal so that the young person can engage with them. However,
tribunal and court rules, which have evolved over the centuries, did so
for a purpose, the principal one being to protect the interests of the
person appearing before them. Informality is all very well, but rules
are required so that the young people are protected and have the
benefit of advocacy, and so that we can ensure that the principles of
natural justice still apply, notwithstanding the formality of the
occasion.</div>

						</b> The attendance panel is crucial to the
effectiveness and fairness of the enforcement system, and it needs to
operate with as little bureaucracy as possible, so that it can be fully
effective. Of course, we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column613" />Column number: 613</div>want appeals to be heard quickly, but it is not appropriate to specify
in primary legislation how quickly. It is usual to deal in secondary
legislation with operational details such as the code of practice for
school admissions appeals, which specifies time limits for hearing such
appeals.</div>
					<a name="0802221000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is more,
it would not be right to determine those details without thorough
consultation, given that the legislation will not come into force for
another five years. It is more appropriate to deal with this matter in
detailed guidance, which we will provide to panels to assist them in
carrying out their functions, such as those provided for in clause
43(3). That guidance will be developed by my Department in full
consultation with local authorities, children&#146;s charities and
young people themselves.</div>
					<a name="0802221000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I remind the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that article 6 of the European
convention on human rights ensures that all appeals are heard within a
reasonable time? Naturally that will apply to the provisions in the
Bill, and it implies that the associated principle of natural justice
will have some application as well. On that basis, I urge him to
withdraw his amendment.</div>
					<a name="0802221000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000680"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> That was a disappointing reply. Essentially, the
Minister said, &#147;We have not really thought about it. It will be
provided for in detailed guidance, on which we will consult, and human
rights legislation will always apply&#148;. That is not good enough.
I shall not press my amendment to a Division, as it purpose was to
probe the Minister and to raise the matter in Committee. However, his
response reveals a lack of preparation on the Bill&#146;s enforcement
procedures, which is disappointing for the Committee, given the
paramount importance of the attendance notice and the panel. However,
the point has been made, and on that basis I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000683"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The amendments are important, and I thank
Barnado&#146;s, both for inspiring them and for its excellent
briefing note, of which other Committee members have had sight. I must
confess that when I first read the Bill I did not pick up the point
made by Barnardo&#146;s that the rights of appeal and the rights of
advocacy are rather different at the three stages of the process set
out in chapter 5 of the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column614" />Column number: 614</div>
					<a name="0802221000567"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0802221000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present, the
attendance panel can consider the young person&#146;s case at three
points in time. First, it can do so on appeal against the attendance
notice, as set out in clause 43. Secondly, it can do so on appeal
against the penalty notice, as set out in clause 48, to which amendment
No. 168 applies. Thirdly, it can decide whether the local authority can
commence proceedings against the young person for failure to comply
with an attendance notice, as set out in  clause 46.</div>
					<a name="0802221000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Barnardo&#146;s has pointed
out that only at the third stage of that process is the young person
given the right to attend the attendance panel to put their case. That
is covered under clause 46(6). There is no equivalent requirement set
out in the Bill at either of the earlier appeal stages, and so the
amendments would address that anomaly. Barnardo&#146;s supports the
approach in the Bill as a
whole:</div>
					<a name="0802221000544"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Barnardo&#146;s
believe that a young person should be entitled to nominate a
representative to make representations on their behalf. This could be,
for example, a parent friend or key worker; or in some circumstances an
independent trained
advocate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two aspects to this double set of amendments. First, the power to
appeal and to be present for that appeal should be available at all
three stages, and not simply in one of them. Secondly, the rights of
the young person to advocacy should be strengthened. We touched on that
issue in when we debated clause 42, because Barnardo&#146;s has
rightly pointed out that under clause 42(1), regulations will be issued
to make clear what rights young people to advocacy and other matters.
Barnardo&#146;s rationale relates not only to the rights and freedoms
of young people as set down in article 12 of the United Nations
convention on the rights of the child, but to some of the rights of
young people as set down in the Government&#146;s own Human Rights
Act 1998 and the Children Acts of 1989 and
2004.</div>
					<a name="0802221000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Barnardo&#146;s
goes on to point out that there is another powerful reason to include
rights of presence in the appeal process. Not only are communication
rights set down in law and in the UN convention, but young people may
be more likely to co-operate with the whole process if they feel part
of it and believe they have a chance to express their concerns. They
may learn to respect other people&#146;s rights and to take on a
sense of social responsibility. They may understand more clearly what
the local authority and the Government are seeking to do in pursuing
this process, which may otherwise seem draconian and threatening. They
may gain some confidence in dealing with other people in the settings
in which they are placed, as they have to appeal against the
panel&#146;s decisions, and they will develop other interpersonal and
practical skills.</div>
					<a name="0802221000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a good case for making sure that young people are involved at every
stage, as that could be helpful in ensuring that they take a more
constructive view of the process than would be the case if they were
involved only at later stages. I should like to return to the issue of
advocacy. It would be highly beneficial to young people and the
Government if the Minister considered stronger advocacy powers in the
Bill, as set out in the two amendments, which would not only allow
young people to determine that someone else should represent them at
the panels but would make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column615" />Column number: 615</div>sure that a duty is placed on local authorities to provide independent
advocacy access when the young person is unable to represent their own
needs and requirements confidently or might not be able to call on
another person, such as a parent, relative or friend, to do so
effectively. Some of the young people we are discussing fall into that
category.</div>
					<a name="0802221000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the Government&#146;s lack of enthusiasm for opening the door to an
enormous process of expensive semi-legal appeals, but young people with
particular problems would form a much smaller group and thus the costs
would be much smaller. The Minister has said that he is willing to
reflect on that particular issue. That is helpful, but I hope that he
will show flexibility and allow the voice of young people to be heard
at the other stages in the appeal process.</div>
					<a name="0802221000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000684"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> We support amendments Nos. 167 and 168, which were
tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil. The absence of guidance on the
procedural rules of the attendance panel is an issue that I have
already raised. That is a worry, so it is right to put such matters
into primary legislation to ensure that the panel acts in accordance
with the principles of natural
justice.</div>
					<a name="0802221000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman said, under clause 46(6), a young person against whom
proceedings are taken for failing to comply with an attendance notice
must be invited to make representations to the attendance panel before
proceedings begin. Why does the same right not apply when a young
person appeals against the issuance of an attendance notice? Giving a
young person the right to attend to give evidence at their own appeal
is the right thing to do. We do not want the panels to become like the
primary care trust appeal panels to which members of the public can
appeal if they are refused funding for a particular treatment. The
panels hear a raft of cases all on one day; they do not hear from the
patients themselves. They read through the notes and reach a verdict.
Decisions often take less than 15 minutes, but they can be a matter of
life and death to some people. It is therefore important that the
appeals panel can at least hear from the young person before it
confirms the issuance of an attendance
notice.</div>
				
					<a name="0802221000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000685"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> When the attendance panel is considering whether
it is appropriate for a local authority to begin proceedings against a
young person, clause 46 states that it is required to invite the young
person to make representations to the panel. In that case, the
consequences in respect of a panel&#146;s decisions about the failure
to comply with a fixed penalty notice are serious for the young person,
which is why we have set it out in primary
legislation.</div>
					<a name="0802221000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would introduce a similar requirement when the panel is
considering either an appeal against an attendance notice or an appeal
against a penalty notice. It would entitle the young people to attend
the hearing considering their appeal or to nominate a representative to
attend in their place. I very much agree that the young people should
be allowed to attend the appeal hearing and to bring someone with them
if they want to, and I will ensure that that is covered in the
regulations governing the panel&#146;s operations. I have considered
whether such provisions should be made under primary legislation as the
consequence of the third item in Barnardo&#146;s list to which the
hon. Member 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column616" />Column number: 616</div>for Yeovil referred. I hope that the Committee will accept my
reassurances that it is sufficient to act under secondary legislation
in respect of the first two items, but the consequences of the third
item are markedly different and much more serious, which is why we must
have the justification under primary
legislation</div>
					<a name="0802221000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel
will invite people who understand the young person&#146;s
circumstances to make representations. They could include, for example,
the Connexions personal adviser, the youth worker, a teacher or a
tutor, depending on individual circumstances. Those representations and
the young person&#146;s explanation will be important in helping the
panel understand the individual circumstances of the case. It is
difficult to envisage a circumstance where the panel could meet and do
its job as set out in the legislation without hearing from the young
person about the steps that have been taken to help, support and
re-engage them, and decide whether everything possible has been done to
help them.</div>
					<a name="0802221000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
appropriate to put the detail of the panel&#146;s operations in
regulations, and to take time to consult on that. The regulations will
be laid before the House. As for independent advocacy, we discussed
that at some length in relation to the previous clause. I have very
little to add except to clarify that I do not intend to make it a duty
on local authorities. However, I will look sympathetically at what we
can set out in guidance regarding the promotion of advocacy for young
people who would otherwise struggle fully to represent themselves.
Given that assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Yeovil is fully
reassured and will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0802221000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000686"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister. It has been a long
afternoon, but I thought that he was slightly more enthusiastic earlier
about reflecting on the advocacy issue and whether local authorities
should have a duty to a particular category of high-needs youngsters.
He appears to be rowing back, having cleared the relevant clause. I
will look at his words more closely later, or we may seek to return to
the issue at a later stage in our proceedings.</div>
					<a name="0802221000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the bigger issue that the
amendments raise, I am reassured by the Minister&#146;s
comments&#151;on a scale of 10, he scores eight. He said that he will
allow the regulations to take into account the proposal in the
amendments that the young person be invited along to all stages of
appeal, including those set out in  clauses 43 and 48, as well
as clause 46. I think he was also saying, as is implicit in the
amendments, that a young person&#146;s nominated representative could
also go in place of the young
person.</div>
					<a name="0802221000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000687"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> I am baffled as to why that provision should be made
in secondary, rather than primary, legislation. I do not buy the
argument that proceedings under clause 46 are more serious. The only
argument for using secondary legislation is that it changes frequently
or is of less importance generally. Attending an appeal is in the same
category in either case, and if provision is made for attendance in
clause 46, it should be in primary legislation in other instances,
given that the Minister wants to make it a
requirement.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column617" />Column number: 617</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000688"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I was about to come on to my two reservations, but
the hon. Gentleman quite rightly got there before I had a chance. In
the Minister&#146;s response, there were three warning notes that
made me a little edgy. First, he did not say, &#147;These amendments
are so fantastic that they will be enshrined in the Bill in your name
and in Barnardo&#146;s name for the rest of time.&#148; We know
that Ministers do not like to do that very often with Opposition
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0802221000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
seriously, the Minister began by talking about &#147;allowing&#148;
young people to attend, which is not quite the same as
&#147;inviting&#148;. Later, he used the word
&#147;invite&#148;. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton indicated, the Minister also drew attention to clause 46
as &#147;markedly more serious&#148; than the other two clauses and
the appeals against the attendance and penalty notices. That rather
hinted at some uncertainty in his mind as to whether it would be
sensible to provide those rights of attendance and make sure that
someone was invited.</div>
					<a name="0802221000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would much rather see amendments made to the Bill. I am inclined to
press my amendments to a Division, but I do not want to do so
unnecessarily. Will the Minister reassure me, notwithstanding the not
very strong argument for leaving the measure out of the Bill, of two
things? First, can he assure be there will be an invitation to attend
under clauses 43 and 48? There must be no doubt&#151;the Government
must not change their mind later&#151;that they are committed to an
invitation under those clauses. Secondly&#151;and I am extending my
comments to allow the Minister to reflect on the issue in
detail&#151;will he reassure me that there will not only be an
invitation and an undertaking, but that the invitation will extend to
the young person&#146;s nominated
representative?</div>

because I know that we shall soon be parted, for you have told us,
Mr. Bercow, that you will not be joining us next week. May I
advise you during that brief sojourn to read again William
Morris&#146; &#147;News from Nowhere&#148;? It is a fine book
that is entirely relevant to the Bill, and indeed, to this aspect of
the Bill, because Morris understood that training was
critical&#151;that the relationship between craft and beauty was of
immense importance in inspiring young people to acquire
skills.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000695"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> No, I was riveted by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
speech to such a degree that I was unable to pick up a single paper. I
was entirely preoccupied by the sagacity of his remarks.</div>
					<a name="0802221000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to the amendments more
specifically, Mr. Bercow, you will know that at the heart of
our considerations thus far has been the concern of Opposition Members,
among whom I include the hon. Member for Yeovil, about the prospect of
criminalising young people. According to the explanatory notes for
clause 45,</div>
					<a name="0802221000545"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;non-compliance is an offence and
liable to a fine of a maximum of level 1 on the standard scale.
Currently level 1 is a maximum of &#163;200, with the actual amount
in each case being decided by the court in light of individual
circumstances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would delete the criminal elements of the Bill and translate
them into civil penalties. In earlier sittings, we challenged the
Minister on precisely that point, and we did so in concert with many
witnesses who gave evidence to the Committee before we started our
detailed scrutiny. The amendment would therefore specify that
non-compliance be a civil matter, rather than a matter for the criminal
law.</div>
					<a name="0802221000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Time and again in
the evidence sessions, we heard that young people may be criminalised
by the Bill. That is of great concern to the very organisations with
the most experience of dealing with challenged young
people&#151;those young people who are most typically disengaged from
the system. I make no apologies for reminding the Minister, because he
seems recalcitrant about the matter, of the evidence that we took from
some of those experts. Martina Milburn, the chief executive of the
Prince&#146;s Trust told us
that</div>
					<a name="0802221000546"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the bulk of the
40,000 people who we worked with last year had issues with drugs and
alcohol. What do you do with a young person who is already going down
the path of taking too many drugs and drinking too much and who just
says, &#145;I&#146;m not going to do it&#146; and disappears?
That happens not just in the age group 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column619" />Column number: 619</div>that we are talking about. I was talking to a young person yesterday who
started drinking at eight and who was on heroin by the time he was 11;
he certainly was not in school after that time. The question is how you
deal with that. Do you increasingly criminalise young people and just
say, &#145;Right, we&#146;re going to lock you all up,&#146; or
do you find some way of trying to reach them and sort out some of their
issues?&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Education and
Skills Public Bill Committee, </i>22 January 2008;  c. 16,
Q36.]</div>
					<a name="0802221000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">That evidence
graphically illustrates that the young people in greatest need are
least likely to benefit from the Bill, particularly if it coerces them.
We need an approach that is founded on the principle of encouragement
of support and is sensitive to the fact that those young people might
not be in a position to abide by the terms of the Bill. As the
representative of the Prince&#146;s Trust said, if someone is already
in the kind of dire circumstances that she described, it is unlikely
that the Bill as drafted will make much difference to them.</div>
					<a name="0802221000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Association of School and
College Leaders also submitted a briefing on the Bill. It
states:</div>
					<a name="0802221000547"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
preferred approach to achieving full participation is by persuasion
rather than coercion. In particular we do not support the potential
application of criminal penalties for what is a civil
matter.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendments
would ensure that enforcement of the provisions of the Bill would be
restricted to civil law. It is inevitable that we will oppose the
Government&#146;s measures unless the Minister can make a compelling
case for criminalising young people who are disengaged from education
and who are some of the most vulnerable members of
society&#151;denied a loving home, support and the knowledge and
guidance of parents.</div>
					<a name="0802221000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">For Conservatives, and I guess
for some Liberals too, from all that we have heard from the hon. Member
for Yeovil, education means opportunity for all, rather than
criminalising a few. Even if the Minister cannot accept the amendments
today, I hope that he will reflect on the tenor of the discussions that
have taken place over these past weeks. It is not the case that members
of the Committee who do not share his enthusiasm for criminalising
young people do not also share his enthusiasm for increasing
participation; we simply do not think that the system that he wishes to
put in place will work.</div>
					<a name="0802221000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the best pragmatic
argument for supporting the amendment that I can make. I hope that the
Minister, in the spirit in which I have offered it, will seize it with
both hands&#151;although I have thrown him lifelines before and he
has cast them aside&#151;and get himself off the hook by translating
the criminal elements of the Bill into civil
matters.</div>

							<a name="0802221000696"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> There is no point in the Minister sighing at the
thought of me speaking. After all, I am going to speak to amendment No.
81, as it would be somewhat negligent not to since I tabled it and it
has been selected for debate. The amendment would delete lines 30 and
31 from clause 45 and thereby prevent someone from facing a fine not
exceeding level 1 on the standard scale. The hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings will agree with that aim.</div>
					<a name="0802221000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come back, as the hon.
Gentleman did, to a good many of the representations about these
clauses that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column620" />Column number: 620</div>were received from all sorts of organisations that work with young
people, and even by some of those who support the Bill and the element
of compulsion contained within it. The Children&#146;s Rights
Alliance for England is clearly opposed to the provisions in this part
of the Bill. The British Youth Council made it clear that it was
opposed to the clauses that impose penalty fines on young
people.</div>
					<a name="0802221000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rainer, too,
has made representations to the Committee to say that it is concerned
about the proposals in clauses 45 to 48. In the useful briefing note
that it provided on Second Reading, Rainer pointed out that when it
discussed that aspect of the Bill with young people, it was
understandably the part that caused young people the most concern and
anger. The feeling was that imposing fines and criminal sanctions on
young people who may, in many senses, already be marginalised will be
of very little value and in some cases will actually be
counter-productive. The Rainer briefing paper quotes one young person
who was consulted on the issue, who
said:</div>
					<a name="0802221000548"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The whole
point is to get a better job. How are you going to do that with a
criminal record?&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rainer
believes that the proposals, and the fines contained within
them,</div>
					<a name="0802221000549"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are likely to be
particularly damaging for those who have struggled in or disengaged
from mainstream
education.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
interesting part of the briefing sets out Rainer&#146;s thoughts on
how the Government might reframe some of the responsibilities in a way
that would be more positive, and whether the sanctions regime could be
reformulated to be more rational and acceptable to young people. Rainer
says that the overwhelming majority of young people that it spoke to
thought it appropriate that they should face the consequences for
non-attendance, but felt
that</div>
					<a name="0802221000550"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the only suitable
penalty would be withdrawing financial incentives and support (such as
free public transportation, or enhanced benefit payments) for taking
part&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">in the courses in
question. Rainer said that those incentives could be regained by
somebody who then re-engaged in education and training.</div>
					<a name="0802221000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know from a previous debate
that the Government are reticent about stating their intentions for the
future financial framework of incentives and support for young people.
Indeed, some of the comments by Ministers and officials on the record
even suggest that the Government are looking at the future of the
educational maintenance allowance. I wonder whether that is something
that the Government might be planning to get rid of, phase out or
reduce. I think that we heard from the Minister during earlier
questioning that the Government are committed to keeping the EMA, but
they have left open what other forms of financial support there may be
for young people who have to comply with the Bill. I cannot recall when
the Minister said he would be in a position to tell us about the
financial support structures that will be in place after 2013. I have a
feeling that it would not be for some time.</div>
					<a name="0802221000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since I have a
feeling that the Minister may not be inclined to accept all of the
amendments today, I wonder whether we might persuade him first, to give
some indication of when he or his successors will be in a position to
say what the financial support arrangements will be for young people.
Secondly, would he be willing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column621" />Column number: 621</div>to consider a process of sanctioning, as Rainer and young people have
suggested, using the withdrawal of financial benefits for engaging in
education and training, rather than this heavy-handed method of
imposing fines on young people? In many cases they could not afford to
pay, given the income of many young people and the fact that parents
will be unwilling, or in some cases unable, to pay the fines. That
could lead to criminalisation, which could then make those young people
even less willing to engage, and less attractive to future
employers.</div>
					<a name="0802221000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister is not inclined to accept all of the amendments today, will he
tell us when the Government will be in a position to say more about the
financial support mechanisms and whether there is any possibility of
adopting a more rational and more liberal approach&#151;I will not
say a high Tory approach, because I am not sure what the high Tory
position on these matters would be&#151;that was more positive and
based more on providing incentives and support for young people, rather
than the sanctions and penalties that are contained in the
clauses?</div>

Knight:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 34 to 36 would replace the
possibility of a prosecution and a criminal fine on breach of an
attendance notice with liability for a civil penalty not exceeding
&#163;200, as the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
said. Naturally, I considered that and other options, but I concluded
that a civil enforcement system would not work in practice. I have set
out the reasons for that previously, although I am not optimistic that
the hon. Gentleman will accept them given the hard line he took in his
opening comments, saying that unless I persuaded him, he would press
the amendment to a Division. However, I will have another
go.</div>
					<a name="0802221000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Civil penalties
would be enforced in civil courts, which are not geared to dealing with
young people in the way that youth courts are. For example, judges in
the youth court receive specialist training on dealing with young
people, and the court is not open to the general public. The amount of
a fine in a youth court is set by the court, taking into account the
young person&#146;s means. Persons under the age of 18 may be sued in
civil courts, but there are complex rules under part 21 of the Civil
Procedure Rules 1998, such as the requirement in most instances to be
represented by a litigation friend. In addition, although debts may be
enforced using civil recovery methods, such as recovery by bailiffs, in
practice such methods are rarely used against people under the age of
18. The local authority would have to pay a court fee to pursue the
civil enforcement method, which also might not be appropriate in
practice, and would leave the authority with mounting costs. Court fees
and costs are added to the debt in the civil courts, which does not
happen with a fine in the youth
courts.</div>
					<a name="0802221000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000698"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> So because English law has developed over the
centuries to protect young people against the rigours of the civil
court procedures, the Minister wants to use the even more rigorous
criminal
law?</div>
					<a name="0802221000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000699"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I am saying that we have a specific youth court
which is trained and configured around the needs of young people being
brought to justice.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column622" />Column number: 622</div>
					<a name="0802221000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
previously reassured the Committee that the offence in the clause would
not be a recordable one and that the conviction would be spent after
two and a half years. Although I agree that it is important to ensure
we have explored all the options in relation to enforcement, civil
court proceedings and subsequent enforcement in the civil courts do not
present a realistic means of ultimately enforcing attendance notices. I
therefore ask that the amendment be
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="0802221000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 81 removes the provision for a fine in the youth court, but leaves
it unclear what the consequences of committing an offence under the
clause would be. It is important for the effectiveness of the new
requirement, and to avoid confusion, to set out clearly the
consequences of refusing to participate and failing to comply with an
attendance notice. Accepting the amendment would reduce that
clarity.</div>
					<a name="0802221000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proceedings in
the youth court will always be the last stage of the enforcement
process, but we need to make that last stage clear from the outset. A
person found guilty of the offence under the clause will be liable to a
maximum level 1 fine on the standard scale, which is the lowest
category available. Currently, level 1 is a maximum of &#163;200,
with the actual amount in each case being decided and fixed by the
court in the light of individual circumstances and sensitivity to
issues for young people. The maximum of a level 1 fine provides
protection for young people by putting an upper limit on the penalty a
youth court can impose. Without that, there would be no indication of
how such an offence might be dealt with and the penalty imposed could
be more
severe.</div>
					<a name="0802221000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Financial
support provided to young people in this context is principally the
education maintenance allowance, but that is obviously currently
conditional on participation in education or training. so I am not sure
how we can introduce something else that is conditional in the way that
the hon. Member for Yeovil suggested. We have explored whether to take
benefits away, but very few young people satisfy the criteria for
benefits&#151;unless they are in extreme hardship&#151;so I am
unhappy about the idea of an enforcement system that is based on
benefits.</div>
					<a name="0802221000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that helps the Committee and that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div>

							<a name="0802221000700"></a>Mr.

						</b> I am rather disappointed with the Minister&#146;s
response. I thought the ideas that I advanced on behalf of Rainer were
so convincing that he would want to go away and reflect. In the light
of that response, I might want to press amendment No. 81 to a
Division.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000701"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Again, we have heard a weak case from the Minister.
The essence of his argument is that the civil system is not appropriate
to deal with young people so, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton suggested, the Government are going to use a
still less appropriate set of procedures. The difference is that the
option preferred by the Minister will leave the young person with a
criminal record. That is what it boils down to. A number of the most
disadvantaged and challenged young people, who we are trying to
encourage back into learning so that they will return to civil society
and hopefully obtain employment, are going to be put through a criminal
procedure. That argument does not stack up.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column623" />Column number: 623</div>
					<a name="0802221000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">A reasonable
person, looking on objectively from outside the orbit of the Committee,
would scarcely believe that a Parliament was going to put people
through a criminal court for not turning up at college. That is what it
boils down to&#151;that the Government believe in such a policy. Yet
again, I urge the Minister to
reconsider.</div>

							<b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): Does my hon. Friend share my
concern about enabling a fine of up to &#163;200 to be imposed on a
person who is highly unlikely to have any financial means? What about
the effect that that might have on their intention of seeking
employment, given that the fine outstanding would be attached to future
earnings?</div>
					<a name="0802221000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000703"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> We know how such a fine might be paid ultimately,
because the explanatory notes on the Bill made that clear: it could be
paid through a deduction of money from subsequent earnings, and I guess
it could even mean seizing people&#146;s assets, although I do not
know if a young person would typically have any assets. However, it is,
as my hon. Friend said, curious to the point of being bizarre that we
are going to consider taking 17 and 18-year-olds, who may be acutely
disadvantaged, and put them through a criminal process. As I said, that
does not stack up, because it is not reasonable.</div>
					<a name="0802221000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister went on to say, as
justification, that going through the civil procedures would cost the
local authority money. Given that he has told us that it will only
happen in a small number of cases, that is not the most powerful of
arguments to draw from his armoury. Because it will cost the local
authority a few bob, it is better put those young people through the
criminal courts
instead.</div>
					<a name="0802221000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard a
series of pretty unconvincing arguments in response to what was a
measured and reasonable case for sensible amendments that would improve
the Bill. On that basis, I am inclined to press the matters to a vote
and to test the Committee&#146;s will. Those who vote should remember
this: if they vote for the amendments, they will be accepting the
advice, given in evidence to the Committee, of those who work closely
with the sort of young people that I have described; if they vote
against the amendments, they will be voting for criminalising desperate
and vulnerable young
people.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000704"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I remind the hon. Gentleman of the 10-stage
process of enforcement. That is not something we would enter into
lightly. The notion of people being criminalised for not turning up to
college is clearly nonsense. That would never be a consequence of not
turning up, but would only come into effect if a young person actively
refused to participate, without reasonable excuse and after all the
support and all the other stages had been gone through. I could go on,
but interventions must be
short.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000705"></a>Mr.

						</b> I do not doubt for a moment that the Minister is
honest in his determination to ensure that such action is the last
resort. I do not challenge the idea that the 10-stage process will, for
the most part, allow young people to participate who have not done so
thus far. However, if the Minister is so sure about that, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column624" />Column number: 624</div>without anticipating our next debate, I wonder&#151;I am
only guessing&#151;why I feel in my heart that he
is unlikely to accept the amendment that means that this offence will
not be part of a police record. If the Minister does not want young
people to be branded as criminals, he has a
chance&#151;</div>

and that should be encouraged. We will do everything we can to remove
the obstacles and difficulties that might prevent them from
participating.</div>
					<a name="0802221000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are series of safeguards&#151;the hon. Gentleman anticipated that I
would say that&#151;built into the system to ensure that an
attendance notice will not be issued if it is not appropriate, and that
the local authority will not be able to act if the young person has a
reasonable excuse for not participating, as outlined in clause 39. I
set out our intentions in some detail in my letter to him regarding
what is likely to be considered a reasonable excuse. The groups that he
specified in his amendment, with one exception, will not have
enforcement action taken against
them.</div>

categories (b), (c), (d) and (e) would have enforcement action taken
against them or incur penalties under the proposals. Is he confident
that that is correct?</div>

						</b> I am confident enough to say that I find it
difficult to conceive of circumstances in which enforcement action
would be taken against those groups. I cannot absolutely rule anything
out. There might be someone in those circumstances who is offered every
reasonable support and could be judged able to participate if they took
advantage of all that support. As things stand, I cannot envisage the
circumstances in which that would happen, but I do not want to rule out
enforcement action if someone in some of those circumstances
deliberately failed to
participate.</div>
					<a name="0802221000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
believe that being employed should be a defence for not participating;
that would not be considered a reasonable excuse. We recognise that
work can be a valuable experience for young people at this stage, but
we believe that they should continue their education and training too.
We discussed that at considerable length in earlier sittings. Education
and training help young people to move on to successful and fulfilling
lives and have wide benefits for the individual and society. It is
critical that all groups of young people have the same opportunities
and expectations of success. In the light of my reasoning, I hope,
although I am not optimistic, that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						</b> I was excited because I thought that I had wrung a
valuable concession from the Minister. I believe that the record will
show that he said that nobody who fell into the (b), (c), (d) or (e)
categories would be dragged through the penalty process. Of course he
cannot give us that assurance, because there is no such protection in
the Bill. It is left entirely to guidance that we have not seen to set
out how somebody will be treated who has a serious medical condition,
is caring for a family member, is terminally ill, or is unlikely to
benefit from the service offered. When the Minister was put under
pressure on that point, he quickly rode back and said that this is all
fudge and mudge. Great puffs of smoke went up in front of him and
suddenly all of those great reassurances did not amount to, as the
Americans say, a hill of beans&#151;as we say in Somerset, Ohio and
such places. On a reassurance scale, I think that my reassurance level
is about one out of
10.</div>
					<a name="0802221000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even worse than
that, we heard that the Minister can envisage that people in
employment, slogging their guts out day in, day out and learning all
sorts of useful skills could, because of some jobsworth
Minister&#151;referring back to the his comments the other
day&#151;end up being dragged through the courts and receiving a
penalty and a criminal record. That is so monstrous and so confused

						</b> It may be that the amendment in my name and those
of my hon. Friends and, indeed, the amendments in the name of the hon.
Member for Yeovil and his hon. Friends are superfluous, given what the
Minister said a few moments ago. Nevertheless, just in case I
misinterpreted his remarks, I will set out our intentions clearly. The
debate on clause 45 has focused on the fact that non-compliance is an
offence liable to a fine. That would be bad enough, but we are moving
these amendments because we are anxious about the fact that young
people may also be regarded as having committed a recordable offence
that might figure on national police records, although I think that the
Minister has suggested that will not be so. If that is the case, he
will no doubt relieve us all when he replies.</div>
					<a name="0802221000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fundamentally important
that we do not stigmatise young people who, as I said earlier, will
often 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column628" />Column number: 628</div>be vulnerable and challenged. That point was made powerfully to us by
the British Youth Council in its advice.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000762"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> It might help the Committee and speed things up if
I state categorically that the offence will not be a recordable
offence. It will not be recorded automatically on the police national
computer and will not be routinely disclosed in Criminal Records Bureau
checks.</div>
					<a name="0802221000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000763"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I anticipated that from what the Minister said
earlier, and it is good news. However, we would do the British Youth
Council a disservice if we did not flesh out its concerns, because they
relate to the broader principles that we have been debating. It
says:</div>
					<a name="0802221000551"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Young
people at risk of dropping out need support not a criminal record. The
&#145;attendance panels&#146; could still operate...without
the recourse to a penalty notice further along the
line.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">It describes the
proposals as potentially &#147;demonising young people&#148; and as
perpetuating the negative stereotype that Ministers have elsewhere said
that they wish to counter. I am relieved by the Minister&#146;s
intervention, which no doubt he will reaffirm shortly, but he will
understand why we feel so strongly about the issue. Our cause is the
most vulnerable citizens, because we are the champions of social
justice, as you know, Mr. Bercow, perhaps better than
most.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000764"></a>Mr.

him.</div>

							<a name="0802221000765"></a>Mr.

						</b> I do not want to be unkind to the hon. Gentleman
because I know that he is a thoroughly decent chap, but his grasp of
these things does seem a bit limited. Compassionate conservatism is
born of social justice. It was our party that throughout the 18th and
19th centuries, in the form of people such as Wilberforce, Shaftsbury,
Elizabeth Fry and others, did so much to advance social justice, when
his party still had members who wanted to put boys up

observations. First, it must of course be recognised that the hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings would be reading something
only if and in so far as it related to the treatment of matters
pertaining to the Bill or amendments thereto. Secondly, although the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s philosophical musings are always entertaining
to the Committee, they are sometimes at best tangentially related to,
and at worst wholly divorced from, the
Bill.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. Bercow. I will
not be put off by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. I am delighted
that the Minister is so enthusiastic about the amendments. We simply
need to ask which of the three he is prepared to accept and put in the
Bill. As soon as he has let us know that, we can safely withdraw the
amendments.</div>

							<a name="0802221000768"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I shall be brief. As I set out for the Committee
when giving evidence on 29 January, in response to question 475 from
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, only offences that
are punishable by imprisonment or specified in
regulations&#151;probably the regulations mentioned in two of the
amendments that we are discussing&#151;are known as recordable
offences and are automatically recorded on the police national
computer. The offence of failure to comply with an attendance notice is
not punishable by imprisonment and we have no plans to specify it in
the relevant
regulations.</div>
					<a name="0802221000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000769"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> But is it beyond possibility that, in a few
weeks&#146; time, after the Bill has received Royal Assent, a
Minister could, through secondary legislation, add the offence to the
list included in the National Police Records (Recordable Offences)
Regulations
2000?</div>
					<a name="0802221000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000770"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I can tell the hon. Gentleman, on behalf of the
Government, that we will not specify the offence in the relevant
regulations. It will therefore not be a recordable offence, will not be
recorded automatically on the police national computer and will not be
routinely disclosed in CRB
checks.</div>
					<a name="0802221000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is true that
young people convicted of the offence of failing to comply with an
attendance notice without any reasonable excuse would, for a short
period, have what we would understand as a criminal record&#151;but
&#147;criminal record&#148; is not a phrase that exists in law,
which is why I could not accept one of the amendments. The main factor
here is the length of time in which convictions must be
disclosed&#151;the short period of time in which someone has what we
would understand in common parlance as a criminal record. As I have
already confirmed, the rehabilitation period for a fine imposed by a
criminal court on anyone under 18 is two and a half years. After that
the conviction will be &#147;spent&#148; and will not have to be
disclosed. In effect, that means that the young person will have no
criminal record after that
point.</div>
					<a name="0802221000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a young
person had previously been convicted of a recordable offence and had
that conviction recorded on the police national computer, that would be
a separate matter; it would make no difference to this position. The
offence of failing without reasonable excuse to comply with the
requirements of an attendance notice would still be
non-recordable.</div>

						</b> Do I understand, therefore, that a young person who
had finished his education or training, but had been through the
process and committed an offence under the clause, would have to
disclose that offence in any job application made while he was 19 or
20, and perhaps even approaching his 21st
birthday?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000772"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Yes, if it was less than two and a half years from
the date of the conviction. I made that perfectly clear in evidence. I
have been consistent. I think I have said that the latest age at which
the measure could apply would be 21. I hope that I have been extremely
clear. I urge the hon. Members not to press their
amendments.</div>

							<a name="0802221000773"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Our sense of reassurance did not last long. We were
looking for two bits of reassurance. First, we sought assurance that
our proposal was so welcome and so much in line with the
Government&#146;s thinking that it could merely be plopped
immediately into the Bill at the relevant place, in which case it would
only be a matter of choosing between the two excellent amendments and
deciding whether the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings or
I should gain the credit. However, we now discover from the Minister
that the reassurance that he is offering us is not as great as we
thought.</div>
					<a name="0802221000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
following the questioning of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, we discover that young people over the age of 18 will,
for a period, have to declare the convictions for these offences when
seeking employment, which is surely not desirable and could be damaging
to their employment prospects. I cannot see that the position that the
Minister envisages is satisfactory. I do not know if the hon. Member
for South Holland and The Deepings will want to press his amendment No.
37, but I will press my amendment No. 82 if there is no indication of
the Minister having a sudden change of
heart.</div>

							<a name="0802221000774"></a>Mr.

saying that they might be superfluous. I had been gulled or persuaded
by the Minister that they were indeed superfluous&#151;until he rose
to respond to the debate. However, when he did respond, it appeared not
that the amendments were superfluous, but that they contradicted the
Government&#146;s position in as much as young people are going to be
on record, albeit only for two and a half years. However, the two and a
half years that the Minister speaks of could be critical to a young
person emerging from training and acquiring a
job.</div>

obligation to disclose for that two and a half
years.</div>

does not in any way dilute the power of the argument that those young
people, in disclosing what the Minister casts aside with a degree of
complacency, would jeopardise their chances of achieving

						</b> To continue my remarks&#151;achieving success,
perhaps for the first time, by taking those first faltering steps into
the world of work. What prospect of that could there be if they are
dogged by the necessity of declaring that they have been convicted? The
irony is, of course, that, following that conviction, they might have
participated in purposeful work or training for more than a year.
However, because the requirement to declare their previous folly
remains for two and a half years, I suspect they would be unattractive
to an employer even so.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman has extensive worldly
experience, including as an employer. If an applicant came to him who
was perfectly adequate for the job in hand, and he asked the individual
whether he had a criminal record and that person said, &#147;Yes, I
had a problem but I now want to come into work,&#148; would the hon.

him?</div>

						</b> That is an unfair question to put to an untypically
philanthropic person. The issue is not what I would do: it is what
others might do. It is true, of course, that some employers would take
a more generous view than others, but notwithstanding that, we heard
from witnesses at the evidence sessions that a degree of stigmatisation
will occur. In the words of the British Youth Council, people will be
demonised.</div>
					<a name="0802221000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">A few
moments ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton suggested to me that there is another risk. If we do not
put these matters on the face of the Bill, a Government even more
draconian than the present one, with a Minister even less sensitive to
our arguments than the Minister here today, might, through a statutory
instrument, sharpen the knife still more. Our aim is to fight for the
interests of all those young people who we all want to encourage back
to learning and
work.</div>

philanthropic employers will be inhibited in the way my hon. Friend
describes.</div>
					<a name="0802221000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because of
our doubts about the Government&#146;s good will, because of our fear
that the measure will grow into an even more vicious monster than it
currently is, and because of our anxiety to support the representations
we have had from the people who work the most closely with vulnerable
young people, I am inclined to press the amendment, even though I
acknowledge that, in its current form, it is imperfect, as is the
amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Yeovil. What we actually
want to do is deal with the matter of disclosure, which has risen in
our sights as a result of the Minister&#146;s admission that these
young people are to be labelled for two and a half years. We will press
the amendment to make the very strong point that I hope has been
transmitted, albeit imperfectly, in these few brief
words.</div>

					<a name="0802221000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a danger at this late
stage of the day of glossing over an important issue. What the
Minister&#146;s comments have highlighted is that there is a risk
that young people will have to declare what will, in essence, look like
a criminal record&#151;an offence. I think the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings is right to say that there are employers who
will be very concerned about that. I have a constituent who has a
record of low-level offences, which is having a major impact on her
ability to take a job which is not unrelated to the offences she
committed.</div>
					<a name="0802221000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why would
the Government want a situation in which these offences had to be
disclosed for two or two and a half years? Is it their view that
disclosure is useful and sensible, or is it simply an inadvertent
by-product of the way in which the Bill will operate? The
Minister&#146;s implied that a record of such offences would not
matter either way to an employer. If the Government do not think it is
useful, why not accept that it would be sensible to amend the Bill, as
we are trying to do&#151;perhaps imperfectly&#151;to ensure that
the information will not have to be disclosed for that two-year period?
If that were to be done, it would address our concerns. I also very
strongly endorse the comments made by the hon. Member for South Holland
and The Deepings that we want this provision on the face of the Bill.
It is not at all satisfactory to have it dealt with
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="0802221000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
final point to make. The Minister may want to respond and indicate why
he wants disclosure to be obligatory. If he is not prepared to respond,
his position is highlighted in its full weakness, and we shall be even
more inclined than we already are to press the amendments. If he can,
will he say whether amendment No. 178 would in any way deal with our
concern? Is he essentially saying that the words &#147;criminal
record&#148; would not have a meaning in law that would have any
application to these circumstances? I think he is, and that he is
indicating&#151;as the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
has said&#151;that we may have to table other amendments on the
matter at a later stage. For us, that would leave an unsatisfactory
state of affairs.</div>

I felt that I had made all the arguments I could. In the end, the
disagreement between us will be about whether there is some kind of
incentive for people not to break the law in having, for a brief
period, a modest level of conviction attached to them which they ought
to disclose if asked. That is the principal
disagreement.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000788"></a>Mr.

argument on its head. He is now praying in aid that a young person
might be incentivised to comply with the legislation through fear that
he or she would have to reveal the conviction at a later stage or
declare 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column633" />Column number: 633</div>their record, which could damage their employment prospects. All that

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000791"></a>Mr.

						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes the point I was about to
make. The Minister now says that the disincentive is going through the
criminal process. A moment or two ago, he said that the disincentive
was having to declare this matter subsequently. That cannot possibly be
a disincentive, because the young people concerned, as we have heard
from all the experts, are already rejecting authority regularly. This
provision will simply make them suspicious of and hostile to authority
to an even greater
degree.</div>

							<a name="0802221000792"></a>Mr.

							<a name="0802221000793"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I am delighted to say a further word on this
subject, although I do not want to test the Committee&#146;s patience
too long. There may be members of the Committee who have been convicted
for parking on a double yellow line or speeding. I was inclined,
impertinently, to ask hon. Members to put their hands up, but that
would be to embarrass my colleagues. Those things are not declarable in
the way that the Government now suggest the offence under the Bill
should be.</div>
					<a name="0802221000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
heard a very poorly structured argument. We have been told that the
measure is principally a matter of providing disincentives, but when we
spoke about the tension between civil action and criminal action, we
were told that it is principally about avoiding the inconvenience of
going through the civil system. Then we heard that the disclosure
rather than the offence was critical
in&#151;presumably&#151;intimidating people into participating.
None of that bears any relation to and can in any way be squared with
the advice we had from the experts during the witness sessions. I defy
the Minister to suggest one witness who would support the thrust of the
argument that he has made in the past few
minutes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000794"></a>Jim

function of the offence being a criminal offence. That is all it is. We
are not creating the requirement to disclose for the sake of this
offence.</div>

offence, as is speeding at 32 mph in a 30 mph zone, yet they are not
disclosable matters. People who commit such offences are not treated in
the way that the Minister wants to treat young people convicted of the
offence under the Bill. We will have to press this matter to a
Division, not because our amendment is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column634" />Column number: 634</div>perfect, but because it will send out a message that we think that it
should be clear in the Bill that young people should not be stigmatised

person for failing to comply with an attendance notice, the local
authority must consult an attendance panel. The panel has to recommend
to the local authority that proceedings be instituted. However, as we
have discussed, subsection (6) requires the attendance panel first to
invite the young person to make representations to it. The process
contains a significant number of safeguards before criminal proceedings
are started, but for some young people, even those safeguards might not
be enough to avoid an
injustice.</div>
					<a name="0802221000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
already debated the evidence of Barnardo&#146;s about further
safeguards such as that advocacy should be available where it is needed
to enable a young person&#146;s voice to be heard at the attendance
panel at every stage of the process, especially for those with learning
or communication difficulties. I will not repeat those arguments,
except to say that even young people without special needs are
inexperienced in putting their own case and may be intimidated by
proceedings, regardless of how informally they are
conducted.</div>
					<a name="0802221000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 38 would put into subsection (6) a requirement that the attendance
panel invite the young person or an advocate to make representations to
it. That is all that I will say about that amendment. Amendment No. 83,
tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil, makes a similar
point.</div>
					<a name="0802221000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 87
would require that the Secretary of State set out the rules of the
proceedings of the attendance panel in regulations. In particular, it
refers to the hearing of representations from the young person against
whom it is considering instituting criminal proceedings. As the panel
will have a quasi-judicial, or even judicial, function along the lines
of a grand jury in the United States, it is important that the
proceedings follow the rules that apply to tribunals and courts. It
should not necessarily follow the rules of formality, but it should
certainly follow the rules of evidence. It should be made clear, for
instance, whether the young person will be able to question the panel
or the local authority that is instituting the proceedings.
Clarification from the Minister on how the panels will operate would be
very
helpful.</div>

						</b> I shall say no more other than that amendment No. 83
was tabled by the Liberal Democrats and that we want the Government to
put a commitment in the Bill that gives the person an entitlement to
advocacy for the reasons that we discussed earlier. It will be
interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s response to that proposal.
Given that he considered for a while the possibility of granting
advocacy for a particularly vulnerable group of young people, we are
interested to hear his views about the wider
cohort.</div>

						</b> When the attendance panel is considering whether a
local authority should be able to begin proceedings against a young
person, it is required to invite the young person to make
representations to the panel. Under amendment No. 38, when considering
that, the attendance panel would have to invite either the young person
or an advocate for the young person to make representations to it.
Amendment No. 83 would entitle the young person to advocacy in making
those
representations.</div>
					<a name="0802221000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are placing the duty to participate on the young people, so it is right
that they should always be invited to make representations. I do not
believe that, in reality, anyone would disagree with that. I very much
agree that the young person should be able to bring someone with them
to the panel if they want to, and we shall allow for that in
regulations. The panel will also invite other people who understand the
young person&#146;s circumstances to make representations. Both those
and the young person&#146;s own explanation will be important in
helping the panel to understand the individual circumstances of the
case and the steps that have been taken to help, support and re-engage
the young person, and so decide whether everything possible has been
done.</div>
					<a name="0802221000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">How the panel
invites representations to be made to it will be set out in
regulations, as amendment No. 87 proposes. Clause 43(3) makes provision
for that. It is appropriate to put the detail of the operation of the
panel in regulations and to take time to consult on that. With those
assurances, I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton will withdraw the

unnecessary because the attendance panel is the safeguard that ensures
that the local authority has exhausted all other options for

does that by intervening at two critical stages in the process. It has
the power to dismiss or confirm the attendance notice on appeal, and it
must consider the young person&#146;s case again if a local authority
wishes to begin proceedings in the youth court. In both instances, the
panel is the mechanism that would ensure that the young person&#146;s
case does not progress to the next stage of the enforcement process,
unless it considers that all other options for encouraging the young

							<a name="0802221000838"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> The interaction between clauses 45, 46 and 47 seems
to be rather complicated. I may well not have understood it properly,
in which case I hope that the Committee will forgive me. My
understanding is that clause 45 states that a person who fails to
comply with an attendance notice is guilty of an offence and is liable
to a fine not exceeding level 1 on the standard scale, which is
&#163;200. Clause 46 prevents a local authority from taking action
under clause 45 until a penalty notice under clause 47 has been issued
and not paid. It states that the amount that can be imposed by a
penalty notice is to be determined by regulation. Clause 47(4)(b)
states that regulations may make</div>
					<a name="0802221000552"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provision as to the amount of any
penalty and the time by which it is to be
paid&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0802221000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, the
restriction of the fine to &#163;200&#151;level 1 on the standard
scale&#151;that applies to clause 45 appears not to apply to clause
47. It would therefore be helpful if the Minister could set out his
intentions for the amount and the time allowed to make the payment that
will be put in the regulations made under clause 47(4)(b).</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column638" />Column number: 638</div>
					<a name="0802221000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">Barnardo&#146;s has raised its
concern about the amount of any penalty under clause 47 and wants there
to be safeguards. In its briefing to the Committee, it stated that it
wanted safeguards that
the</div>
					<a name="0802221000553"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;level of the penalty
notice...is set at an amount that reflects the level of financial
support available to the poorest young people...and that the fine
will not increase if not paid within the specified time

					<a name="0802221000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">Barnardo&#146;s
said that it</div>
					<a name="0802221000554"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is concerned
that escalations in fines for non-payment are most likely to be
incurred by those least able to pay.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assurances from the Minster on both
points&#151;the level of the fine and an assurance that fines will
not escalate for non-payment&#151;would be helpful.</div>
					<a name="0802221000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 40 would set the
level of the fine at &#163;200 as a probing amendment to extract the
Minister&#146;s intentions. The Children&#146;s Rights Alliance
said that fines can be counter-productive and might lead many young
people &#147;into debt and crime.&#148; It also stated that this
will be</div>
					<a name="0802221000555"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;yet another trap
door through which the most alienated children may be brought into

47,
saying:</div>
					<a name="0802221000556"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;From a
practical enforcement perspective, this provision assumes ability
and/or willingness to pay, apart from other matters, notably costs to
local authorities pursuing the payment of
penalties.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802221000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be

response.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000839"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 40 and 175 deal with similar issues
and are living proof that life would be cheaper and people would be
better off under the Liberal Democrats. Although the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings talked about social justice earlier,
here we have proof that, were the Liberal Democrats to get their way,
instead of setting the maximum level of the fine at an extortionate
&#163;200, we would set it at the more modest level of
&#163;50.</div>
					<a name="0802221000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
way not only of trumping the Conservative party on the amendment paper,
but of drawing attention to the fact that the income of young people is
often very slight indeed. The level of benefit paid to young people has
been gradually eroded in relation to average earnings over many years.
There are often differentials between the levels of benefits paid to
young people compared with those paid to adults. Although &#163;200
might not sound like much to many of us in this place, it is a lot for
many of the young people who will be affected by the provision. That is
why I would suggest to the Minister that the Government should be
contemplating a much lower maximum penalty. I would like to hear the
Government&#146;s thinking on the
matter.</div>
					<a name="0802221000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
like to support the comments made and the questions raised by the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He was good enough to
indicate that he was expressing some of the concerns raised by
Barnardo&#146;s about the fact that the fines and the way they will
operate will be left to regulation. Therefore, we do not know what the
absolute level will be or how those fines will be recovered from
people. The hon. Gentleman raised most of the issues covered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 639</div>in the Barnardo&#146;s memorandum and he specifically asked for the
Minister&#146;s confirmation of what he has in mind for the maximum
amount for the fine. I second his request for clarification on that
matter. He also asked the Minister to indicate whether the fines will
escalate over time if they are not paid; that was the second question
asked by
Barnardo&#146;s.</div>
					<a name="0802221000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman referred to two other points, but he did not ask the
Minister specifically to clarify them. I would be grateful if the
Minister responded. One of those points was whether there would be a
sliding scale of penalty notices based on a young person&#146;s
income. I do not know whether the Government have ruled that out, or
are considering that it would be useful not merely to leave that to
guidance. The final point on which I request a response from the
Minister is whether young people would be able to make the payments in
instalments, and whether they would be financially penalised for doing
so.</div>
					<a name="0802221000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is evident from
the representations made by the local authorities on the clause that
they are worried about taking large amounts of money from this group of
young people, how the fines will operate, how collection will operate,
and what the cost of collection will be. They are acutely aware of the
low incomes of the young people we are talking about. Although the
Minister will be tempted to say that that it is all up to guidance and
is a minor administrative matter, it is not. It will be fundamental to
how the Bill operates, how just or unjust it is, and whether young
people will be able to pay the penalty notices or will be dragged
further in to the criminal justice
system.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000840"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I will try to set out as quickly as I can but in
sufficient detail how some of the process will work, as legitimate
questions have been
asked.</div>
					<a name="0802221000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
provides the power for the Secretary of State to make regulations about
penalty notices to be issued in the event of failure to comply with an
attendance order. The regulations relate to the form and content of the
penalty notices, their amount and the procedures for them to be issued
and paid. The scope of the regulations is limited to the operation and
administrative details of issuing a penalty notice, and will therefore
be consulted upon.</div>
					<a name="0802221000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will consider having a sliding scale, but based on subsequent penalties
rather than income. It is worth saying that it would be dependent on a
young person being in employment and so able to afford to pay the
penalty notices continuously&#151;going through the process and
paying them off one after another. The penalty could potentially be
raised with each subsequent occasion that they have gone through the
process and paid the penalties off. However, we have no plans for the
amount to increase with non-payment, as the case would simply proceed
to the next step, for obvious
reasons.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000841"></a>Mr.

						</b> Will the Minister tell us roughly what the rate of
payment is for penalty notices generally? Is it correct that about 60

need to.</div>
					<a name="0802221000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulatory
power will be subject to the negative procedure. The regulations may
also make provision for penalties of different amounts to be payable in
different cases or circumstances, as I have just set out. The amount of
the penalty must be prescribed in regulations to provide the
flexibility to increase the amount to respond to changing costs, rather
than put in primary
legislation.</div>

levels that apply to
it.</div>
					<a name="0802221000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">It appears that 37
per cent. of 16 and 17-year-olds issued with fixed penalty notices do

							<a name="0802221000845"></a>Mr.

about right. According to those figures, how many young people will not
pay these penalty notices and what will happen to those who do
not?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000846"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> We have made some assumptions on that matter. We
have assumed that half of that figure&#151;18.5 per cent.&#151;will
not pay their fixed penalty notices; they will subsequently go to a
youth court and receive a fine. A lower rate of non-payment is assumed
for the reasons that I outlined in relation to fixed penalty notices
and attendance notices; those reasons relate to the nature of the
offences and the way in which the discussions about support will
work.</div>
					<a name="0802221000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said,
the amount of the penalty must be prescribed in regulations to provide
the flexibility to increase the amount to respond to changing costs.
The provisions relate to the operational arrangements and so are not
specified in the Bill. A similar model is in operation in the case of
penalty notices issued to parents of pupils of compulsory school age
under section 444 of the Education Act 1996 and section 105 of the
Education and Inspections Act
2006.</div>
					<a name="0802221000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">The figure of
&#163;50, which has been used and commented on, was used by the last
Secretary of State for Education and Skills when the Green Paper was
launched. It has no more status than that. As we consult on the
regulations, we will consult on the figure and bear people&#146;s
views in mind when the regulations are drafted. It may be a little
while before that
happens.</div>

							<a name="0802221000847"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The Minister mentioned the figure of &#163;50, but
I do not understand the point that he is making. Is he indicating that
the level of the penalty notice is more likely to be at or around
&#163;50 than
&#163;200?</div>
					<a name="0802221000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000848"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The figure of &#163;50 has been suggested for
the fixed penalty notice. The maximum penalty of &#163;200 applies in
the youth court. That is currently the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column641" />Column number: 641</div>maximum penalty on conviction of an offence attracting a level 1 fine.
If there is confusion in people&#146;s minds, &#163;200 applies to
the youth court and &#163;50 was the figure used by the previous
Secretary of State when the Green Paper was launched. Others have
suggested, for example, that it could be set at the same level as the
weekly educational maintenance allowance. There are some interesting
ideas and we will consider them. I hope that that information is useful
for the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and that he will
withdraw the

penalty notices based on a young person&#146;s ability to pay. I
think he said that there will not, but that if people do not pay them,
they will rise for those who can afford to pay because they are in

treatment for people in employment. I used that as example of someone
who, because they are employed, could afford to keep paying off the

his answer is that there would be no separate treatment of any type in

					<a name="0802221000467"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may have missed this as
well&#151;perhaps I am not attentive enough at this stage of the
day&#151;but did the Minister make any reference to the question of
paying 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column642" />Column number: 642</div>in instalments? Whether young people will be able to pay in instalments
was one of the concerns raised by Barnardo&#146;s. Also, will the
amount payable escalate if the penalty notice is not paid within a
certain period of time? That was another general issue on which we
wanted clarification; we did not simply want it to turn up in the
guidance note without having had any indication at all.</div>
					<a name="0802221000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the first point about the
level of the penalty fine, I was a little reassured when the Minister
spoke about a lower figure or the amount of the EMA. That indicates
that the Government may have a more realistic amount in mind for the
penalty than the figure of &#163;200, which is in one of the
amendments that we are considering. On that basis, I shall not press my
amendment to a Division, but I would be grateful if the Minister was
able to clarify the two other points that were
raised.</div>

						</b> That was an interesting response from the Minister.
As I mentioned at the outset, this was a probing amendment to ascertain
the likely parameters of the fixed penalty notice. The Minister
indicated that the sort of figure being looked at is around
&#163;50&#151;perhaps slightly more because of the time that has
elapsed since the publication of the Green Paper, but certainly not in
the realms of the figures that Barnardo&#146;s was concerned about.
That is very welcome.
</div>
					<a name="0802221000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was slightly taken aback by the Minister&#146;s assumption that only
18.5 per cent. of people would not pay the fixed penalty notice. In his
interventions, my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire
made the point, using information obtained from the National Audit
Office report, that about 37 per cent. of people do not pay, as the
Minister confirmed. That assumption is rather an odd one, but as Alison
Wolf has pointed out, there are a number of odd assumptions about cost
in the regulatory impact assessment on the measures in the Bill. Given
the Minister&#146;s assurances, I shall not press the amendment to a

Littlehampton and I can reach an understanding on this. I agree with
the intention behind the amendment. I think it right that the most
appropriate forum where such enforcement action is required, except in
one or two rare cases that I shall specify, is almost always the youth
court. Under the current youth justice system, a person below the age
of 18 would not appear before an adult criminal court solely because
they had failed to pay a fine. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.
Enforcement action other than that in the youth court would be taken
only where a young person was being prosecuted for other offences
alongside the offence of failing to pay a fine.</div>
					<a name="0802221000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">Magistrates courts may deal with
cases that involve people under 18 but only if they are tried with an
adult. Young people may appear in the Crown court if they are jointly
tried with an adult whose case needs to be heard in that court or where
the charge is very serious and the sentencing powers of the youth court
are felt to be inadequate. Homicide and rape cases, for example, are
always be heard in the Crown court. Because it is right that there
should be flexibility in our court system to deal with the most serious
offences, or those involving young people together with adults, in
courts other than the youth court, I cannot accept an amendment and I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw

purpose of the amendment is to ensure that regulations are introduced
that direct both the procedures for making appeals and the hearing of
such appeals. As drafted, the clause says that the Secretary of State
&#147;may&#148; make regulations about the procedures for appeals
and the powers of the attendance panel in hearing appeals. The
Secretary of State could therefore decide not to publish such
regulations or lay them before Parliament for scrutiny and debate. The
rules relating to appeals and the procedures of the attendance panels
could, de facto, be decided by Executive action. On matters that are
clearly judicial or quasi judicial, there should be clear rules that
are scrutinised by the House in some form. The amendment replaces the

that regulations &#147;may&#148; be made by the Secretary of State.
I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that it is absolutely the

prescribed ways of working, to reflect different circumstances. One
effect of this clause is that persons who are not normally regarded as

voluntary
work)&#148;</div>

						</b> When we come to apply the duties on employers in
chapter 3 to ways of working where there is no contract of employment,
we might need to make some modifications to suit particular
circumstances, so that everyone is clear about what is expected. The

way, and the House will have the opportunity to scrutinise the
regulations when they are subjected to the affirmative procedure, which
the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings so
loves.</div>
					<a name="0802221000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many young
people want to start working and earning money at 16, and some of them
want to do so full-time. I recognise that they can gain extremely
valuable skills, knowledge and experience from the world of work, but
we do not believe that it is acceptable for them to leave formal
learning altogether and go into casual low-skilled work with no
opportunity for learning or progression. Participating in education or
training part-time while working will enable them to have their
learning accredited. Their achievements will be recognised and it will
be easier for them to change direction or to progress in their careers.
Volunteering and self-employment are valuable experiences and should
count as working for those purposes. Clause 5 enables us to make
regulations to allow for that, and young people occupied in those ways
for more than 20 hours a week should only be required to participate in
learning part-time, in the same way as those employed under a contract
of employment. The regulations under the clause would allow us to make
that clear. I hope that that helps the hon.

employment and therefore included in references to working in this way.
We do, of course, want this kind of work to count for the purposes of
the duty to participate. The clause makes that clear, and it removes
the legal doubt about the status of Crown employees. However, the
definition of normal weekly working hours in clause 5 needs to be

							<a name="0802221000879"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Given that this is likely to be my last contribution
to the debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow, may I say
how fair, objective and precise you have been in chairing our
proceedings and how grateful we are for the time that you have devoted
to them? We wish you all the best in your future endeavours in the days
ahead.</div>

						</b> Oh
dear.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802221000881"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Indeed&#151;the weeks, months and years ahead. I
meant your remaining time in Committee, Mr.
Bercow.</div>
					<a name="0802221000519"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendments is to remove a conflict of interest that
would be created if the local authority received the proceeds of any
financial penalties rather than the Treasury direct. The old adage of
administrative law is that he who levies the fine should not benefit
from the proceeds of that fine. Alas, it is an adage that has been
honoured more in the breach than in observance in recent decades. If a
body benefits from the proceeds of its own fines and penalties, there
is an inbuilt incentive and pressure to impose those penalties that
removes impartiality from the process. It makes it less objective and
opens up the authority to accusations that it is simply revenue-
raising.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column648" />Column number: 648</div>
					<a name="0802221000520"></a><div class="hs_Para">The classic example is parking
fines. When the power to levy parking fines was transferred to local
authorities, together with the proceeds, we started to see parking
attendants patrolling quiet residential streets at 8.31 am waiting to
catch residents who had not moved cars that had been left overnight on
parking meters. Westminster council raised &#163;38 million through
parking fines that way last year. I do not contend that penalty notices
under the Bill will be issued solely for revenue-raising purposes or
that they will raise hundreds of thousands of pounds&#151;or even
millions&#151;for local authorities. I am just arguing that, as a
matter of principle, all fines should be remitted directly to the
Treasury with no re-remittance back to the body that levied them in the
first place. It is an important principle that Governments of both
parties have ignored during the past 20 years to the chagrin of the
hard-pressed public.</div>

							<a name="0802221000883"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> I support my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. Those
of us on the Back Benches, too, are grateful for the way in which you
have allowed us to intervene, Mr. Bercow, and to take part
in the proceedings even when we were a bit lengthy. It might be of
interest to you that the subtitle of William Morris&#146;s book,
&#147;News from Nowhere&#148;, to which my hon. Friend the Member
for South Holland and The Deepings referred is what you are about to
enjoy&#151;&#147;An Epoch of
Rest&#148;.</div>

							<a name="0802221000884"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> It would be wrong of me not to take this
opportunity to thank you for your stewardship of the Committee over the
past few weeks, Mr. Bercow. I, too, hope that you have a
restful time next week while we wrestle with the rest of the Bill.
However, if you miss our musings on Proust, liberalism and William
Morris, your presence in the Public Gallery to observe our proceedings
would be more than
welcome.</div>
					<a name="0802221000524"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
92 would require all money received by local authorities as a result of
penalty notices to be paid directly to the Secretary of State and could
risk funding being diverted from other local authority services to
cover the cost of penalty notices. The effect of amendment No. 100
would be to leave it unclear to whom any money received by a local
authority and not used for the purpose of administering the penalty
notice should be paid, but I accept that it is a probing amendment that
sets out a few things and asks a few
questions.</div>
					<a name="0802221000525"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should the
financial penalties that we have provided for under the Bill ever be
used, it is important that the money received from them can be used to
cover the costs of administering the notices, so that funding is not
diverted from other services to cover those costs. It is usual practice
for money received by the Government from the payment of fines to be
used in that way. It is also important that money received from
financial penalties can be used only for the purposes of administering
the process, and not used by local authorities in the way in which the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton described. That is why
we will specify in regulations that the only function for which the
money can be used is the administering of penalty notices themselves. I
hope that the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column649" />Column number: 649</div>Gentleman will welcome and celebrate those regulations when they are
published, perhaps through an early-day motion. The clause, as drafted,
therefore requires any money not used for that purpose to be paid
directly to the Secretary of State in accordance with regulations. That
is entirely consistent with the way in which unused funds from penalty
notices issued in respect of unauthorised absence from school have been
handled since 2004. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
