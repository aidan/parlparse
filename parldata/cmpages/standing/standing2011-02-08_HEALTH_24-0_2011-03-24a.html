                           </span> This morning, I was explaining
that the purpose of clause 113 is clearly to introduce
insolvency and company law into the NHS, to allow a more efficient
entry and exit from the marketplace for NHS providers. I suggested that
a legitimate interpretation of that was that it would
allow—albeit as the last resort, after all the appropriate
interventions had been followed—hospitals to close more
efficiently.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was going to say that the second critical piece of evidence—of
information—required to interpret the clause in that manner is
in paragraph B114 in the Government’s impact assessment for the
Bill. It says that to address the weaknesses in the current system,
this insolvency-based regime will be introduced so
that<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
taxpayer will be protected from political pressure to rescue
providers—public funds will not be used to support unviable
providers”.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000857">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is extremely clear. The Government are being very open and transparent
about the issue, and it is because they have been so open and
transparent and the clause is so clear that we are very worried. That
worry has been compounded by the Minister’s remarks to the
Committee on Tuesday, because it is clear not only that under the
clause and the new regime it will be easier to close hospitals, but
that the Minister believes that in the past too many hospitals have
been propped up when they were
unviable.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000063">&#160;</a>

because he does not understand, or does not want to understand, that
the whole purpose of the Bill and the clause is to protect, not close,
essential services. I say to him, in the nicest possible way, that if

                           </strong> I am grateful to you, Mr Hancock. Of course I would
not dream of going back over the issue. I have made my position clear.
I will merely say in response that it does not do the Minister great
service to offer such a cheap jibe. I have come to expect better of
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000071">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Opposition
Members are worried. I fully accept the position of the Minister and
other hon. Members that it is not their intention to close hospitals. I
fully accept that it is their view that safeguards are being placed in
the system that will militate against the closure of hospitals. All I
am suggesting is that closure becomes more possible with competition,
because some hospitals and providers will be deemed unviable. Under the
clause, the insolvency regime makes it physically easier for such
hospitals to be closed and such providers to exit the market.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
B149 of the impact assessment makes it crystal clear that that is
precisely what is under consideration. It simply says:<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“In
the new regulated market, providers will succeed or fail based on their
ability to offer high quality, efficient services. Successful providers
will be able to expand as they attract new patients to their services
or win new contracts. However, some providers will struggle to attract
patients to their services or win contracts. These providers will need
to restructure their services and those who are unable to improve the
quality and efficiency of their services may
fail.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000860">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Therein
lies the issue at the heart of this morning’s debates and, in
many respects, the issue at the heart of the Bill. The Minister
believes that competition, in effect, allows resources to be allocated
more efficiently in the NHS, as in other markets; that is the
Bill’s underpinning ethos. The flip side of that is that in a
market where some bits see resources efficiently allocated, other bits
fail, and the option for those inefficient bits is exit. That is what
will happen, and this insolvency clause makes it
easier.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000074">&#160;</a>

                              <strong>John
Pugh</strong> (Southport) (LD):<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000965">&#160;</a>
                           </span> I have three brief points. The
first is on consultation. The Minister legitimately said that, after
the previous Government, consultation has a poor name; the fact that
there is consultation gives nobody any reassurance, given its political
history. The consultation on the White Paper did not necessarily
improve the name of consultation, because it was a consultation about
how to do things, not whether to do them. However, we will pass over
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1035<a class="bkMark" name="Column1035">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, when
the hon. Member for Halton discussed the clauses, his key point was
that they offer a shell that will be followed by secondary legislation.
The Minister adroitly replied that such provisions were exactly what
the previous Government had. That is like the argument that we have
when an Opposition Member tables a rational amendment, and we say that
we are doing exactly what the previous Government did. However,
repeatedly doing what the previous Government did is not necessarily a
good basis for forward-looking policy. I might be ploughing a fairly
lonely furrow, but I think we can do just a wee bit
better.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
quite a good example of that. In the Committee that considered a
previous, very contentious bit of legislation—the Mental Health
Act 2007—it was clear that a lot of clauses would lead to
secondary legislation, which would clarify what those clauses were all
about. In Committee, Members pressed for some kind of draft regulation
by Report to clarify where the legislation was taking us. That does not
strike me as a bad precedent to follow, and the Minister might comment
on whether such an arrangement is a distinct possibility, because it
would be helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, I
was grateful to the Minister for setting out the errors in the
explanatory notes, because we could all have gone down a sidetrack
talking about level playing fields and the intention of the clause
being to put Bupa hospitals on the same footing as other hospitals.
Clearly, that is obviously nonsense, and the Minister has revealed it
as such. There never can be a level playing field, because the
Government or some state agency—Monitor or whoever—will,
presumably, interfere when a foundation trust starts to get into
trouble. We will not do that at all with a Bupa hospital.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In any case,
there should not be a level playing field, because a Bupa hospital and
an acute hospital are different entities; one is paid for by taxpayers,
and we have a public interest and investment in it, while the other is
purely a private venture. In any case, the Bill will not treat the two
sorts of hospital evenly.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000079">&#160;</a>

am listening closely to my hon. Friend’s argument and I want to
make sure that he is clear about the designation regime, which we have
discussed. Designation does not apply simply to state-funded and
state-based organisations; it also applies to any provider providing a
designated service, and a Bupa hospital could have a designated
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000080">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am indebted to the Minister. I did not realise
that; I thought that designation was only for traditional A and E

can also be designated for whatever purpose. That is an interesting

                           </strong> I bow to your superior judgment, Mr
Hancock, but if I am out of order, so are many other members of the
Committee—possibly including the Minister. If the same regime
for decommissioning hospital foundation trusts is to apply to Bupa
hospitals, there will be knock-on consequences in further legislation.
However, I do not to want extend the argument, because in addition to
having independent hospitals we are now going to have independent state
schools, and presumably similar rules will apply to those at some
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
return to the key point. The Minister sensibly explained that the Bill
will give us a serviceable and manageable regime for closing hospitals
in place of an outdated, inapplicable and almost unworkable regime. One
does not need to be terribly bright to draw the logical conclusion that
it will be easier to close hospitals as
a result. That is the inevitable conclusion. In supporting
the clause, one has to go with the inference, and I see no point in
pretending different. However, that is not necessarily the intention;
the intention is to put in place a regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000089">&#160;</a>

is on record as saying that the present scheme is unworkable and
outdated, and that it cannot be applied when closing foundation
hospitals. The Government are putting in place a model that can be
used. Moving from a model that cannot to a model that can will make the
process easier, and the fact should be acknowledged.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000090">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not intend to take long on this amendment; I
just want some more detail. The provision refers to the transfer of a
going concern to another licence holder. The Bill changes the current
legislation by allowing a transfer to any licence holder, which could
mean a private sector organisation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have a
number of concerns, including how Monitor will view such a transfer. I
know that its view could depend on the scale and size of the services
involved, but will Monitor try to get an NHS foundation trust to take
over the work? That may not be possible, of course, because there might
not be a NHS foundation trust nearby, but that probably does not matter
in this day and age, in that the management could be done elsewhere.
Does the work have to go out on a tender basis to both private sector
and NHS providers, and what would be the criteria behind such a
decision?<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000127">&#160;</a>

accident and emergency unit and its supporting services were
designated—we would want to protect them from
bankruptcy—they could be handed over to a private sector
provider. The buildings, the estate, the accommodation and the
equipment would obviously be being paid for by the taxpayer; they were
run by the foundation trust and they would be part of the wider NHS
family. How would the ownership system

                           </div>work with regard to such property if the work was transferred to a
private sector licence holder? What would be the consequences of that?
Is it right—the Opposition do not think so—that
state-owned property and equipment should be transferred out in such a
way?<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000128">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If a failed
foundation trust is handed over, it appears that a private company
would physically own the hospital. I am sure that not many of the
public are aware of that or would support that. I come back to the
point that I made in the previous debate about the wider NHS family,
which all work together to support each other and put in different
management systems, although it all still remains under NHS ownership.
Will the Minister expand on that and tell us how the system will work
and whether there is a difference between designated and non-designated
services in respect of this
clause?<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000129">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The objective of any health special administration
would be to ensure the continuity of designated services, and would be
achieved either by turning around a failed provider so that it was able
to exit health special administration as a going concern, or by
transferring designated services and associated assets to another
provider or a number of different providers. As we have already
discussed, the priority would be to achieve the former, but if that was
not possible it might be necessary to transfer essential services and
associated assets to another local provider to ensure continuity of
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000130">&#160;</a>

618 to 621 would mean that when a provider of designated services
—a foundation trust or a private company—failed and a
going-concern rescue was not feasible, the services could be
transferred only to a foundation trust or to the Secretary of State.
That would not be in the patient interest for two reasons. First, if
there was no alternative foundation trust within easy reach, the
service would close, even if a local willing provider or voluntary
sector provider that was providing high-quality care was prepared to
take on the delivery of the designated service. I cannot see how it
would be in the patient interest to prefer closure over the
continuation of the
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000131">&#160;</a>

foundation trust would have to be nearby. There is a hole in the

be transferred to another foundation trust rather than be managed on
the present site by that trust. Will he clarify

                           </strong> I just want to be clear. Part of our
concern—I am sure that the Minister will come on to
this—is about who ends up owning the estate, the equipment and
the buildings. Is it clear that Monitor should consider allowing the
services to continue at the present site, even if they are managed by a
foundation trust some distance away, and should that be a first
priority?<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000134">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No. The overarching priority is to guarantee the
continuation of a designated service, because services are designated
for the sole purpose of ensuring the continuity of their supply.
Another foundation trust could provide the designated service, but it
would be more in the patient interest to find a local provider rather
than simply to box the service into another FT, which might be some
distance away. The service could either move physically to another
provider’s site, or another provider could come to the failing
FT’s site to provide the designated service. The crucial thing,
in the best interest of patient care, is the continuity of the
designated service. I hope that that has helped the hon.

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the amendments would mean that another foundation trust or the state
might have to take on designated service provision when a private
company had failed. That would represent a nationalisation of failed
private providers, could be an incentive to private providers to take
excessive risks, and would not be a good use of taxpayers’
money. That might well be an unintended consequence of the amendments,
but it is important to consider
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000136">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked how Monitor would determine—on what
criteria—to whom the assets were transferred. It would be for
the special administrator, working with Monitor, to determine whether
assets would be transferred, and to whom, to protect patients’
interests, because it is those interests that are paramount. For those
reasons, I hope the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000137">&#160;</a>

providing it in the current buildings and estates, rather than
transferring it

Minister mentioned that the administrator would have to make a
decision. Will he clarify the following? Due to insolvency law, the
administrator can transfer the whole estate and equipment to a private
provider, if that is the decision. That private provider would then own

                        <p class="tabbed">The point of
these amendments is clear to everyone who reads them. They would
explicitly enable health special administration regulations to include
provision for the transfer of staff, at the same time ensuring that
staff transfers under those regulations are covered by the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and 2006
protection. That would bring the clause more in line with the
protection that may be given to primary care trust staff. These are
extremely important amendments and it would be surprising if the
Committee were to oppose
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000212">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree with the hon. Lady that these are important
considerations. While I am not able to agree that the amendments should
be made, I hope that I can explain why they are not necessary.
Amendments 161 and 162 seek to provide for health special
administration regulations to include provisions for the transfer of
staff from an NHS FT, or company in special administration, to another
licence holder. We agree that that is an important issue. As I have
said, our preferred outcome of a special administration would be to
rescue the organisation as a going concern. Staff transfers would be
required only where that was not possible and would be subject to TUPE
regulations wherever
applicable.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
do not, however, consider the amendments necessary, because the Bill
already makes provision for the transfer of the undertaking of an FT,
or part of that undertaking, in clause 115. Clause 117 makes further
provision about those transfer schemes, which include the powers to
transfer rights and liabilities, which can also cover those under a
contract of employment. The important protections for staff, including
TUPE regulations, are already provided for under employment law. As a
further safeguard, the regulations to be made to implement the health
special administration regime, including transfer provisions, would be
subject to consultation. Furthermore, the regulations would be subject
to affirmative resolution. Both Houses of Parliament would have an
opportunity to consider specific proposals for regulations, including
any provision that might be made in the regulations for staff
transfers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
can sympathise with some of the principles behind amendments 163 and
164. It is right that the interests of NHS staff should be represented
within NHS FTs and that staff should have an opportunity to have their
say in decisions that affect them and to contribute their ideas.
However, the NHS FT model already achieves that. Staff members are an
integral part of the governance of each and every NHS FT in the
country, and the Bill builds on that mutual approach. It actually
strengthens the voices of staff members and governors by giving the
council of governors greater powers and by promoting the transparency
of NHS FTs to the people that they serve. The Bill both retains the
existing statutory powers of and implicit duties on governors and gives
them new powers. Such powers include powers to approve mergers,
acquisitions, separations and other significant transactions, to
approve amendments to the constitution and to call a director to attend
a special general meeting to obtain information about a trust’s
performance. At the same time, the NHS constitution pledge to involve
staff in

We have already discussed the potential process for speeding up the
winding up of a foundation trust hospital that goes under, and the
Minister has said that the preferred option is to bring someone else in
to take over that trust and run it. In the gap in between, the terms
and conditions of workers, if they are made redundant following the
trust’s becoming insolvent, are vulnerable, and we could be
getting rid of people on reduced terms and conditions until the
preferred person comes in. I just wanted to highlight a certain element
of employment law, particularly as FTs could be treated as
enterprises.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000217">&#160;</a>

Committee wants to make progress. Part 3, chapter 7 of the Bill would
give Monitor the power to establish effective financial mechanisms to

which has the objective of ensuring the continuity of designated
services in the event of a provider insolvency. It would enable Monitor
to collect money from providers of designated services and
commissioners of those services to invest in those financial
mechanisms.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000228">&#160;</a>

financial mechanisms could only be used by the health special
administrator to cover operating costs during health special
administration associated with ensuring the continuity of designated
services. That includes any indemnities for the health special
administrator and other relevant persons in respect of liabilities
incurred, or loss or damage sustained in connection with the exercise
of the health special administrator’s powers and duties; any
costs associated with ensuring the continued operation of designated
services; and the costs associated with restructuring the provider to

129 requires Monitor to calculate the amount that each provider must
pay to the risk pool, and to notify the provider of that amount and
when it will become payable. The clause allows for the amount payable
to be adjusted if a provider has designated services for only a
proportion of that financial year. The clause also allows for the
amount payable to be adjusted if Monitor judges that the risk of a
provider failing has changed since its original determination. That
means in practice that a provider may pay less if its risk of failure
reduces, or that it may pay more if the risk of failure

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are now moving on to the changes to foundation trusts. The clause
concerns the changes to the role and appointment of foundation trust
governors. Subsection (2) removes the requirement that at
least one member of the board of governors, or council of governors, as
the Government intend to rename it, should be appointed by the primary
care trust, because the Government intend to abolish primary care
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment seeks to ensure that at least one member of a council of
governors is appointed by a commissioning consortium to which the
foundation trust provides services, and that at least one member is
appointed by a relevant health and well-being board. The purpose of the
amendment is clear. If we want to support the integration of services
across community, primary and secondary health services and across
health and social care, it would be extremely beneficial for foundation
trusts to have a governor appointed by one of those bodies, just as
foundation trusts currently have to have someone appointed by a primary
care trust. We ought to see such improved collaboration and joint
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
appointment of at least one member of the council by the local health
and well-being board would help to improve democratic accountability.
There would be accountability not only to patients, but through the
democratic process. I am sure the Minister will say that that is
something that the Government are keen to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000253">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> So that I do not begin by disappointing the hon.
Lady, she is absolutely right, the Government do want to achieve that.
Through the Bill we will further strengthen the system to encourage
integration across health and social care and between community,
secondary and tertiary services. This is an essential part of how we
ensure that patients’ experience of health and social care is
improved, and that we drive the continuous improvement that we wish to
see in the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Looking
at amendment 639, which relates to the composition of the council of
governors of an NHS foundation trust, I certainly sympathise with the
intention behind it, and I support greater transparency and
accountability in the governing of foundation trusts. That is why the
Bill includes robust provisions to increase the transparency and
accountability of foundation trusts to their governors, staff members,
patients and the public. That is why we have proposed that foundation
trusts should be free to include any organisation they choose on their
council of governors so that they can tailor their governance
arrangements to suit local circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000255">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1047<a class="bkMark" name="Column1047">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Foundation
trusts are not homogeneous; community foundation trusts or ambulance
trusts may wish to have different people on their council of governors
than acute trusts. We need to ensure flexibility so that they can
tailor their governance arrangements. Rather than specify more and more
compulsory governors, we feel that, beyond the absolute minimum
requirements, decisions on the composition of the council of governors
are best left to local discretion. Some foundation trusts may wish to
invite voluntary sector partners on to the council of governors, others
may want one or more commissioners on the council; in any case, public
and patient governors -would remain the
majority.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000256">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Lady knows and has indicated, health and well-being boards are
part of the local authority. Placing a duty on them to make an
appointment to the foundation trust council would duplicate an existing
local authority duty, which will continue, and which gives the local
authority flexibility over the most appropriate representation. It is
also important to recognise that health and well-being boards are about
influencing commissioning decisions, rather than supervising individual
provider organisations. As we discussed when we debated part 5 of the
Bill, while individual commissioners would remain responsible for their
commissioning plans, the role of health and well-being boards would be
to create an overarching framework within which the plans are
developed.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Requiring
health and well-being boards to make appointments to foundation trusts
would require the board to be involved in the governance of some
providers while not having that type of influence over
others—for example, any provider that is not a foundation trust.
That could involve community interest companies of the sort established
as part of the spin-out of community services from PCTs, which started
under the last Government and continues under this. The requirement
would therefore raise questions of fairness and equity between
providers, and also go significantly beyond the original role of health
and well-being boards, which were widely supported during the
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly
foundation trusts should continue to engage commissioners;
the hon. Member for Leicester West is absolutely
right about that. That relationship is very important in order to
understand what commissioners want, so that they can respond
in the best interests of patients. Consortia have
influence by virtue of their commissioning
decisions and contractual arrangements, and it would continue
to be in the interests of foundation trusts to
involve commissioners appropriately. We have not
imposed foundation trust representatives on
consortia, nor do we seek to impose consortia
representatives on foundation trusts. If foundation trusts decide that
they want representation from other bodies in their governance
structures it is up to them; the Bill provides for greater autonomy in
the way that foundation trusts
operate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000259">&#160;</a>

Minister’s view that there is a good likelihood—let us
put it that way—that the council would wish to involve
commissioners from the GP consortia that it wants to sell services to?

the Minister expect that it is likely it would put them on the

                           </strong> The clause—as do those which we will
discuss shortly—makes the responsibilities of governors much
clearer and more transparent. It clarifies the purposes of these
organisations and makes them visible to both the communities they serve
and the governors, so that what they are meant to do is much clearer.
The clause also clarifies what they are meant to do in terms of framing
their constitution. This matter will not be left to one side,
unconsidered. In future, as part of the process of reviewing
constitutions, governors would have to consider whether they wanted to
include the possibility of membership of commissioners in the
constitution. However, the question of commissioners being involved
with providers on the design of appropriate care pathways is not
necessarily best solved by membership as governors of the body. It is
dealt with in a host of other ways and through other relationships, not
least the clinical relationships between clinicians in the trust and
clinicians in the consortia. I hope that the hon. Lady is reassured,
and that she will not press her amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000262">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I also hope that foundation trusts will seek to
involve GP commissioning consortia and health and well-being boards in
a host of ways, not least, as I hoped they would, through the council
of governors, because that is the overarching body with responsibility.
There is a strong argument to say that it would be in the best
interests of foundation trusts to ensure that the body that has overall
responsibility for that trust includes the people it has to work with.

                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(5) requires foundation trusts to ensure that governors are equipped
with the skills and knowledge they need to carry out their duties. Such
duties are set out in subsection (4):<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“(a) to hold the

                        </p>
                        <p>Those
provisions are welcome, because they provide clarity and spell out, in
detail, the role of governors, showing that the line of accountability
goes from the council of governors to non-executive directors, who
themselves have to hold the board of directors to account. It is useful
to have such details in the legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000267">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Foundation Trust Governors Association represents about 3,000 governors
across England. It believes that the provisions do not go far enough in
establishing how the effectiveness of governors will be assessed on an
ongoing basis. As hon. Members know, I have raised the point several
times that, as Monitor loses its responsibility for foundation trusts,
the governors of foundation trusts are where the buck stops in terms of
responsibility for them. Ensuring that governors are

			Column number: 1049<a class="bkMark" name="Column1049">&#160;</a>
                           </div>inducted and trained by their foundation trust is absolutely critical to
the overall effectiveness of their governance, so that needs to be
assured on an ongoing basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would give the Care Quality Commission a responsibility to assess the
effectiveness of foundation trust governors, as Ofsted assesses the
effectiveness of school governing bodies as part of its school
inspection regime. The amendment attempts to provide some kind of
proportionate outside check or balance on foundation trusts.
Organisations go through a rigorous process to become a foundation
trust and to ensure that they have the governors in place. Anyone who
has worked with such trusts as they do that knows that it is a rigorous
process. The argument, however, is that assessment needs to happen on a
continuing basis. It does not need to be over-burdensome—Ofsted,
at least once every five years, I think, looks at the effectiveness of
how school governors run their schools. The amendment allows for the
CQC to take on a similar role for foundation trusts. It is an important
and not over-burdensome requirement, which would be helpful for
foundation trusts. Without removing their independence, it would
provide some reassurance to patients and the public that the body
responsible for running these trusts is, at the very least, effectively
trained and has the right
skills.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I certainly have some sympathy with the points
made, and I welcome the hon. Lady’s appreciation of how the
clause has been drafted to ensure that there is greater visibility for
the wider public of the governors’ responsibilities. It is clear
that we listened to the responses to the White Paper. We made some
significant changes, which were reflected in the Command Paper and are
now in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
640 relates to provisions on the council of governors and the NHS
foundation trusts and concerns who is responsible for ensuring that the
skills are there to perform the role effectively. I agree with the hon.
Lady’s point about the need for good induction and ongoing
training.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We agree that
foundation trust governors must have adequate support to fulfil their
role. Governors already play an important role, and it will be even
more important in the future. They will be responsible for holding
their board of directors to account as representatives of their
foundation membership—the public and staff of the foundation
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is equally
important that there is clarity about who in the system is responsible
for ensuring that governors are fully equipped for their role. If the
same responsibility is placed on the Care Quality Commission, which is
the effect of amendment 136, we run the risk of having a situation in
which it is no longer clear where responsibility lies and we end up
weakening rather than strengthening the responsibilities. We want it to
be beyond doubt that this is a responsibility of the organisation
itself—that it sits with the directors to ensure that they are
providing the necessary support and ongoing development so that
governors can fully discharge their responsibilities. It would be a
great pity if this clear responsibility on foundation trusts, as set
out in clause 136, were to be diluted. Foundation trusts themselves are
best placed to identify the skills and knowledge of their governors and
to make the arrangements to achieve that—whether by 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1050<a class="bkMark" name="Column1050">&#160;</a>
                           </div>providing training or information themselves or by buying it in from
other suppliers—and supporting governors to take up the
opportunities available to them. Transferring this responsibility to
the Care Quality Commission would allow foundation trusts, effectively,
to blame someone else if things go wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Foundation
trusts are best placed to help governors focus on specific issues
affecting their own organisations. Governors will continue to need
information from a variety of sources and on a wide range of issues,
including governance, clinical quality and finance and local priorities
and needs. Foundation trusts will be able to help them access
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
the wish to involve the CQC. There will be increased emphasis on
quality of patient service, but CQC’s important role as a
quality regulator of providers of service is to provide assurance that
the care is being delivered safely to patients and people using the
services and meets the standards set out in registration regulations.
The CQC should not be distracted by being drawn into discussions about
the governance of boards or
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady talked about the Foundation Trust Governors Association. We
are certainly aware of the need to provide support for foundation trust
governors. We are working with the Foundation Trust Network, the
Foundation Trust Governors Association and Monitor, in its current role
as foundation trust regulator, to see how best that can be achieved.
Although the intention is one that we share and understand, the means
that the hon. Lady is suggesting is not the right way to achieve that,
so we resist the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000276">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I shall be extremely brief. I
support the idea behind the amendment, which is that it is vital that
foundation trust governors have training. Our experience in Mid
Staffordshire clearly shows what an important role governors have, and
they must be supported. They are elected and may have great skills, but
not necessarily all the skills that such groups might need. It is vital
that they obtain skills by the most professional means possible. The
Minister says that we would not want to constrain how it is done or
make it too bureaucratic. Perhaps the Department could consider some
kind of qualification or specific course for governors that is of a
higher order than what is currently available, such as that mentioned
by the hon. Lady, so that they are trained in the best possible way. I
note that the impact assessment mentions provision for funds to be made
available for such training. Will the Minister assure us on that
point?<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000277">&#160;</a>

muddy the water. In all seriousness, however, my real concern is that
we need some kind of periodic outside check, not one that is
over-burdensome, to be sure that the governance of foundation trusts is
effective. The amendment tries to ensure that the matter is dealt with
in the same way as Ofsted deals with the governance of schools. It is
an important outside check and balance.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000281">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
are real concerns about removing Monitor’s role in regulating
the foundation trusts. It currently has the ability to step in if a
foundation trust does not have the necessary governance arrangements to
prevent or deal with a whole range of problems: it can direct trusts to
do things, stop them from doing things and require them to add
individuals to or remove individuals from trust leadership. All NHS
trusts have to become foundation trusts by April 2014, and although
Monitor will retain 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1052<a class="bkMark" name="Column1052">&#160;</a>
                           </div>some regulatory powers over some of the most challenged trusts during a
transition period, from 2016 all foundations trusts will be on their
own. That is a major change, and it is important that we discuss
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000312">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
need to ensure that foundation trusts have governors with the necessary
skills and experience will be even more important in the future. The
NHS faces its tightest ever funding period, and will be under huge
pressure to maintain and improve quality of care at the same time as
making efficiency savings worth £20 billion. If the Bill is
passed, the NHS will have to do that within a much more competitive
environment, with many more providers challenging foundation trusts and
the services that they offer. Also being abolished are the strategic
health authorities, which have the ability to step in and help to
prevent trusts and foundation trusts from starting to fail. Many hon.
Members will know
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000313">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
also need to be aware that there will have to be many more governors,
because all hospitals, mental health trusts, ambulance services and
community services will become foundation trusts, and they will all
need governors with the necessary skills and experience to have the
ultimate responsibility for very complex organisations. As we all know,
Dr David Bennett is the new head of Monitor. He told a recent meeting
of the Westminster health forum:<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000314">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It is
a very, very major step up for the governors of these trusts and one
thing we would say is that we think a lot of thought and effort needs
to go into how we make the governors of these foundation trusts ready
to take on that extra
role.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000869">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to illustrate that point by giving an example. Government members
of the Committee are not concerned about using specific examples and I
hope that the hon. Member for Stafford will bear with me, as I realise
that he knows far more about these issues than I do. Nevertheless, I
want to highlight some of the key issues and challenges that have
emerged from both the independent inquiry and the public inquiry into
Mid Staffordshire, although the public inquiry has not yet reported. I
have very carefully read the evidence that has emerged from both
inquiries so far and it is important that we are aware of some of these
issues about governance, because they are very pertinent to the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to use these examples not because I want to suggest that the
problems in Mid Staffordshire are widespread. Far from it—I know
that there are a huge number of foundation trusts with very strong
governance arrangements, and excellent working between governors,
directors and non-executive directors, with rigorous scrutiny and
challenge. Nevertheless, it is important to understand what can happen
if the governance of an FT is not strong or effective, and I want to
highlight just a few points from the Mid Staffordshire case.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000316">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
independent inquiry, which took place before the public inquiry,
clearly found that the governors of the Mid Staffordshire trust
struggled to provide effective oversight of the trust. Witness M11, as
she is referred to, had been a chaplaincy volunteer at Cannock for
several years. She stood for election as a governor after there had
been some very poor care of her father before he died. She told the
inquiry that, despite the very high volume of paperwork involved in the
role of governor, it was not clear to her what the position involved.
That is why I am grateful that there is some more clarity in the Bill
about the role of governors.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000317">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

			Column number: 1053<a class="bkMark" name="Column1053">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Witness M11
said that, in her view, the information that was provided to the
meetings of governors was “not truthful”—that was
the phrase that she used. On mortality figures, for example, she said
the governors were simply told by the directors that there was a coding
problem and that it was a very complicated situation. She said that the
directors did not go through those figures in detail with the
governors. She felt that governors were not encouraged to express their
views or opinions, or to challenge the board. She also said that the
governors were often told, when they asked questions about something,
that it was an operational, not a strategic matter. But of course, if
someone is going to understand strategic challenges they often have to
understand the operational detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000318">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It was hard
for the governors of the Mid Staffordshire trust, but the non-executive
directors also said that they experienced problems in getting the right
information from the directors of the trust. The executive summary of
the independent inquiry into the trust said:<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000319">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
was noted that the non-executive directors recruited by the Trust were
on the whole inexperienced in NHS board positions. While this may be
inevitable in a relatively small
trust”—<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000870">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We
should not forget that, as we move forward, it is the smaller trusts
that are becoming foundation
trusts—<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000320">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“it
does give rise to a need to call on more training or outside
assistance.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000871">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point is about what the public inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire
trust has said about GPs so far. Although the Minister has not yet made
this argument, one of the arguments for GP commissioners is that they
will hold foundation trusts to account for the services that they
provide. It is obviously at the heart of the Bill that GP commissioners
will drive those changes. I want to read the opening statement, dated 9
November, from Tom Kark, the counsel to the public
inquiry:<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000321">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
inquiry team has made repeated attempts to engage the local GP
consortium with the work of this inquiry. The inquiry team has written
directly to local surgeries. Unfortunately, until last week that effort
had produced very little response, even from those who frequently
referred patients to the trust and who must have something relevant to
say of their own and their patients’ experiences, both of care
and complaining…In short, the serious and global nature of the
concerns about the trust do not appear to have been picked up by the
surgeries…The extent to which general practitioners are in a
good position or not to identify concerns at the local hospitals is of
particular significance to this inquiry, bearing in mind the proposals
for GP-based commissioning to take a far more front line role in the
NHS.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000872">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
think that the oversight of foundation trusts can be left simply up to
governors themselves, when we know it is a huge challenge with all NHS
trusts becoming foundation trusts—or to GPs. Dr Ian Wilson, one
of the GPs who gave evidence to the public inquiry, said on 18 January
that,<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“committed
GPs are very, very busy people and to try and keep a grasp of all of
the changes that are going on and to make sure that you are on top of
all aspects of what you should be doing as a professional is very, very
difficult.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000873">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
urge the Minister to think again about how we ensure effective
governance over trusts to make sure that the very real problems in Mid
Staffordshire are not
repeated.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000323">&#160;</a>

published his report. I want to come to that later. Hard cases make bad
law. If it were simply one instance of a trust that had problems with
its governance and all other trusts around the country were in good
shape, we could say that it was a problem for Mid Staffordshire and not
something that we should be too concerned about from the legislative
point of view. However, I do not believe that is the case. The hon.
Lady is perhaps too generous to trusts around the country as I think
there are more hard cases than we realise at the moment. Therefore it
is important that, as legislators, we look closely at this.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000324">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
highlight the danger of the transition, which the hon. Lady has already
mentioned. As I understand it, and the Minister will correct me if I am
wrong, once the Bill is enacted, Monitor will no longer be responsible
for the monitoring of existing foundation trusts. It will still have
the responsibility for the approval of new foundation trusts, but not
for the monitoring of existing foundation
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000325">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Just to be clear, all foundation trusts will come
under the licensing system that we have been discussing, so they will
be subject to the same conditions that would apply to any provider. So
there will be monitoring in the context of their licence

                           </strong> I am most grateful for that. It gives some comfort
although I suspect, given the number of providers compared with the
rather small number of foundation trusts at the moment, the extent to
which Monitor will be able to oversee that and the amount of work that
it will be able to do on each one will probably be less than at the
moment. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it means that the onus
is very much on the board, as many Members have already pointed
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000327">&#160;</a>

we have this transition between the consideration of the Bill and

of the most significant inquiries into the health service in decades. I
welcome the fact that the Minister has already given an assurance that

account and, where necessary, put on a statutory
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000328">&#160;</a>

do not know how long that interim period will last, but what transition
arrangements will there be? The proposals and recommendations of the
Francis inquiry could be quite radical. I know that Sir Robert Francis
is taking a particular interest in both the independent and public
inquiries. Is there a way in which the
recommendations—particularly on governance, as that is
key—can be brought forward, or indicated, so that they could
even be incorporated into the Bill? If that is not possible, will the
Minister give an assurance that there is a way in which they could be
very rapidly implemented? As we know, waiting for a second Session Bill
could take a couple of years, and I do not think we have that amount of
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000329">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford
and the hon. Member for Leicester West for their important points. They
go to the heart of how we ensure that the system put in place by the
Bill is entirely about delivering the best possible results for
patients: safe, quality care. That is at the heart of the vision and
purpose of the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will try to address several of the key points. First, I will reflect
quickly on the objective of moving NHS organisations to foundation
trust status. This is not the first time that such an objective has
been set, but it is the first time that it has been set so clearly in
statute. It was set by Alan Milburn in 2003, when the aspiration was to
achieve it by 2008. That was revisited in 2007, with the view taken
that it should be achieved by 2010. Those dates have been missed. We
have been ensuring that we learn from the experience of the previous
Government in not achieving those deadlines, and that we proceed in a
way that secures the patient interest, which is to have well delivered
quality care that is value for money for the taxpayer. That is in a
context, as the hon. Lady rightly said, of a tight but none the less
significant financial settlement for the NHS, which the Chancellor
confirmed in yesterday’s Budget statement. That, alongside what
is now called the Nicholson challenge, provides an extra year for the
NHS to respond to the quality, innovation, productivity and prevention
programme initiated by the previous Government, which this Government
are committed to carry through.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000332">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
programme is about ensuring that health care resources are allocated to
delivering the best possible results for patients. It is about asking
whether we are necessarily delivering care in the right place. For
example, it is about ensuring that care for people with long-term
conditions and co-morbidities is increasingly delivered in community
settings. It is also about ensuring that unscheduled care is reduced
and that more appropriate interventions are provided. There are
inevitable changes to the way in which services are provided to deliver
that agenda, which is one shared throughout the Committee. Both this
Government and the previous one see it as essential to changing the
services that are there to meet patient need.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000333">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In response
to the challenge about governance rightly made by the hon. Lady and my
hon. Friend, the clauses try to elevate the status and profile of a
governor’s responsibility, and make that clear to governors,
directors and others with an interest. That is a very serious and
important responsibility. As the legislation is enacted, we will see
that responsibility become even clearer. That is why the clause does a
number of things. First, the clause defines the role of the council and
the governors more clearly than ever before. They will have a duty to
hold the directors of the foundation trust to account and to represent
the interests of the membership and the public. Secondly, it gives
governors a new power to challenge and question directors about the
performance of the organisation at a special general
meeting.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000334">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">While
the new duty and power will be a relatively small legislative change,
it has a big cultural impact. The hon. Lady referred to the inquiry,
and recommendation 9 identified a cultural issue. It is partly about
training, but it is also about attitude and behaviour. The Francis
report highlighted several failings of the board of directors at Mid
Staffordshire, including the recruitment of inexperienced non-executive
directors, who failed to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1056<a class="bkMark" name="Column1056">&#160;</a>
                           </div>fulfil their role. Directors were complacent and isolated themselves
from outside influences. The provisions in the clause aim to open the
board up to greater influence from outside, not least from governors
and the membership. Our reforms ensure that directors cannot hide away
from those outside influences. That is an important assurance that I
can give to my hon. Friend and the hon.
Lady.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000335">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also asked about the role of GPs, but if we talk about it
solely in terms of “GPs” and not GP commissioning
consortia, we would be misdirecting ourselves. We are discussing the
role of a public body—a commissioning consortium—that is
led by GPs. That body will have clear responsibilities about its
contractual relationships with providers, including foundation trusts,
which it must ensure that it is fully and completely undertaking. The
NHS commissioning board will be undertaking assessments of such
consortia to ensure that they are discharging their functions
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000336">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not saying more than what other hon. Members
have already said, but this is a hugely important issue. When I sat on
the board of the mental health trust, in the aftermath of the Mid
Staffordshire events we regularly discussed how we could be sure that
something like that was not happening at our trust. The Mid
Staffordshire board sat down every month and looked at all its
indicators, at its dashboard, at all the targets that it had been set
and whether it had ticked all the boxes, but we know what was happening
out in the wards. As a board, we fundamentally reassessed how we
gathered information and how we interacted with our partners, both
within the trust and externally. This is a hugely important issue, and
I am reassured greatly by what the Minister has
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000337">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Indeed, one of the points made in the report was
that there had been a corporate focus on process at the expense of
outcomes. That was a key failing, which the Bill is trying to change.
We want to shift the focus more decisively on to
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000338">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are placing the onus on governors, but we are not excluding other
actors, such as GP commissioning consortia. Taken together, the
provisions significantly strengthen the internal governance of
foundation trusts. They make them more accountable to their governors,
and as a result foundation trusts will be more responsive to the
interests of their members and the communities that they serve. The
provisions respond to the feedback that we received during the
consultation on the White Paper, particularly from our discussions with
the Foundation Trust Governors Association and the Foundation Trust
Network. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Member for Leicester
West and my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford are

                           </strong> I sympathise with the intention behind the
amendment. The Government fully support a focus on improving health
care outcomes, as I have said, which is at the heart of what we are
trying to achieve in the Bill. That is why we are making foundation
trusts more autonomous and removing existing constraints, leaving them
free to focus on innovation and improving health care outcomes for
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000345">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The
director’s general duty is to promote the success of the
foundation trust while maximising benefits for members and the public.
The amendment seems to be intended to ensure that directors promote the
success of the corporation in order to focus primarily on improving
health benefits for the public and members, as opposed to any other
benefits. By implication, however, that is already the case, because of
the definition in existing legislation, which the Bill does not
repeal.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000347">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The benefits
referred to in the director’s general duty are likely to be
related to health, improved quality of care, more efficient services
and better integration of care, which I think all Members on both sides
of the Committee want. Maximising the benefits for the members and the
public might also be about promoting the long-term sustainability of
the organisation—a concern echoed in the Committee. The Bill is
about ensuring that we have thriving, successful organisations, but
inevitably it has to provide for those rare circumstances where
organisations do not succeed. There is no need to state explicitly in
the Bill that the benefits are likely to be health benefits. The
amendment is therefore unnecessary and does not add anything.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000348">&#160;</a>

principal purpose are other safeguards to ensure that foundation trusts
act appropriately. Because they are statutory bodies, they cannot
distribute any surplus externally, which means that any surplus or
profit must be reinvested in the organisation. I hope that the hon.

to send the minutes to the council as soon as is practicable
afterwards. That is a welcome legislative change as a way of trying to
provide more information for governors. As I have said, that is
extremely important because it is not possible to hold the board of
directors properly to account without the information that is needed to
scrutinise its work. However, as the Foundation Trust Governors
Association says in its written evidence to the Committee, it

Foundation Trust Governors Association understands that there will be
confidential and sensitive matters that will need to be discussed by
the board of directors in closed sessions, but the association believes
that that could be addressed by splitting board meetings into a part 1
and part 2 arrangement. In part 1, the board of directors would meet in
public, and part 2 would be held in private. The scope of the part 2
meetings would need to be carefully assessed to ensure its
appropriateness and foundation trusts would need to establish a process
for reassuring their governors that the items in the private, part 2
sessions really need to be there and to provide an outline of why they
are there.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000355">&#160;</a>

amendment, which flows logically from some of the findings and
recommendations of the Francis inquiry in that we need to foster a
culture of openness and a general belief in the practice of
transparency in FTs’ operations. My concern about the amendment
is that its approach is to add to the Bill a provision about having
meetings in public. The hon. Lady referred to the equivalent situation
in local authorities. I will refer directly to Mid Staffordshire by way
of
example.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000359">&#160;</a>

which they discuss the business and come to a collective view on how to
proceed. That is a part of local authority practice that goes back many
years. They then discharge the formal part of their business in a
committee. A concern that emerged during the Francis inquiry and led to
its recommendation 8 echoes that: the inquiry report highlighted the
lack of openness in the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust as a contributing
factor to a culture there that was not conducive to providing good
patient care. However, that lack of openness predated Mid Staffordshire
becoming a foundation
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000360">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At
the moment, foundation trusts are not under a statutory obligation to
meet in public. In the past eight years and on the three occasions when
health legislation has been before the House, Governments have not
taken the view that there is a need to open up the committees of
foundation trust boards in that way, so the hon. Lady’s proposal
is novel. It is important to bear in mind that the Mid Staffordshire
organisation was an NHS trust, and although such trusts are under a
statutory duty to meet in public, discussions and meetings there took
place in private so, in that sense, the statute does not give the
comfort that the hon. Lady seeks. We have to find other ways really to
ensure that governors have the ability to scrutinise, call to account
and do everything we discussed under clause
136.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000361">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am interested to hear the Minister’s
argument about why bodies that make important decisions on behalf of
the public should not meet in public. Although there might always be
caucusing in advance of meetings, just as justice needs to be seen to
be done, so does proper democracy. That major decisions can be made
behind closed doors when there is no reason to do so is an odd position
for the Minister to argue, given his party’s history and its

course, a member of the previous Parliament and, therefore, would have
been in the House when the 2009 legislation was considered. There would
have been ample opportunity for that concern to be addressed at that
time, but it was not. The view seems to have been that it was entirely
appropriate for such matters to be dealt with in a way that was
considered by the organisation itself to be appropriate. The point,
which we discussed under clause 136, is that we want to ensure that a
foundation trust’s governing document, its constitution, is the
place where such issues are worked
through.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000363">&#160;</a>

behalf of the FTGA, the hon. Member for Leicester West asked how
governors would find out there is a meeting and how they could obtain
the papers. Directors must send governors the agenda in advance of a
meeting, and if governors are not told of any meeting, they can
challenge the directors at a special general meeting. There is,
therefore, a transparent route by which the material, the papers, the
agenda and the minutes are sent to governors. There is no way that that
would be hidden simply because directors do not meet in
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000364">&#160;</a>

that meet in public and there are foundation trusts that do not. The

debate such issues with their director colleagues and, if necessary,
call directors to account on them, too. The Bill moves the arrangements
significantly in the right direction toward a framework that is much

that that the members of the new FT in my Winchester constituency will
be putting a great deal of pressure on governors, who will also be
members of the FTGA in due course, to hold their meetings in
public—their Member of Parliament will certainly be doing so.

clear to FTs that they need to have clear and separate accounts
relating to the income derived from charges for private patients, and
the income derived from NHS services. In a later clause, we will
discuss removing the cap on private patient income, and I am sure that
there will be a vigorous, lively discussion then. The amendments seek
to place a clearer, more formal requirement on trusts for their
accounts to be kept separately for the two pots of income, which is
often best practice in some foundation trusts. The proposals would
ensure that foundation trusts are very clear about how much money is
coming in from the private sector and how much from the NHS, and clear
about not allowing any subsidy between the two.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000382">&#160;</a>

would be quite natural, in decent accountancy terms, for foundation
trusts to give the different sources of income, although I grant that
NHS accounts are not as transparent as one might wish. If the

that the private and public revenue streams are separately accounted
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000387">&#160;</a>

becomes clear. There is a series of issues here. What is the best way
to require foundation trusts to have very clear accounting
arrangements? Is it to give the Secretary of State a power to determine
the content of the annual report that he does not have to exercise? Or
is it to put the requirement clearly on the face of the Bill, as the
Government say they are doing with many other aspects of their reforms?
It is important that foundation trusts show that they have taken steps
to ensure that their membership is representative of the people that
they serve. That is a basic requirement. I would like the Minister, at
the very least, to explain the anomalies in the approaches that the
Government are taking on these points, and I look forward to hearing
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000388">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will start with amendment 643. We agree
absolutely with the hon. Lady’s point that there should be
separate accounts for private income. However, the amendment is not
necessary to achieve our shared goal, and indeed it could prove to be
ineffective or unduly restrictive. Monitor already requires separate
reporting and, as we said in the Command Paper response to the
consultation on the White Paper, we accept the arguments for requiring
foundation trusts to produce separate accounts for their NHS and
private services. We consulted, listened, understood, acted, and we are
now fulfilling that in this
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000389">&#160;</a>

benefit NHS patients. In short, we want foundation trusts to be able to
earn additional income to improve services, like other providers. We

issue guidance about separating accounts remains; it is who exercises
it that changes. The ability to issue that direction remains within the
legislative framework that we are providing. It is simply that Monitor
will not be the body that exercises that in future. If the hon. Lady
wishes, I can provide her with further clarification. That is the
purpose. There is provision and it is maintained: it is just who
exercises it that

                        <p class="tabbed">I
can understand why amendment 644 was tabled. The ambition is to ensure
that we have a fair playing field for providers so that we can deliver
the best possible results for patients in terms of services. While the
ethos and the values of foundation trusts provide a powerful protection
for NHS services, I want also to see clear reporting on private income
and to ensure that foundation trusts can be held to account. Amending
clause 141 would not have the intended effect of increasing
transparency about the impact of private patient work on the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000395">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
first part of amendment 644 would require the annual report to
duplicate information contained in the annual accounts; the accounts
and report are published together so that is unnecessary. As I have
said, clauses 139 and 140 will allow requirements on separate
accounting for NHS and private income to continue and we are committed
to ensuring that that happens. This information would be available to
foundation trust governors and our proposals to strengthen the role of
governors would give them the power to take steps if private income was
not helping the trust to fulfil its principal purpose. I will later
highlight some of the benefits of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000396">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second part of amendment 644 is unnecessary and again, due to the
precise definition, potentially unhelpful and restrictive. Foundation
trusts are likely to want to use the opportunity of their annual report
to explain the role played by any private income, but we do not dictate
that or set out the details in the Bill. As I have said, the principal
purpose of a foundation trust is already set out in primary
legislation. It is to provide goods and services to the NHS in England.
The governors’ role, therefore, is to hold the board of
directors to account for its performance and that is being made 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1064<a class="bkMark" name="Column1064">&#160;</a>
                           </div>more explicit. The board’s role will be clearly defined as
promoting the success of the organisation in the interests of its
members and the public. So governors would hold the board of directors
to account for fulfilling this principal purpose. In summary,
foundation trusts are already subject to the scrutiny that the hon.
Lady quite rightly says is
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000397">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is right that the Secretary of State should not have any kind of
operational control over foundation trusts. That is a view that has
developed in policy terms over a number of years. Such interference
would run entirely counter to the purpose of our reforms on the
provider side. Our reforms give foundation trusts greater autonomy so
that they are free to focus on improving outcomes and being more
responsive to patients and to innovate. Before I say why amendment 645
is not needed, let me briefly explain the important role of annual
reports. Annual reports will be increasingly important as a way of
providing summary information to governors and to the public about
foundation trusts. It is important that in the short term the contents
of annual reports are able to evolve and develop so that they can be of
most use to governors of foundation trusts and the public.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000398">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 645
misunderstands the purpose of a vision in clause 141. The Secretary of
State would only take on the power to determine the contents of
foundation trusts’ annual reports if and when greater certainty
about them could be provided by setting them out in secondary
legislation. That is the point. It is only at the point that we think
there is clarity and certainty and we have a perfect annual report that
such a power would be taken. Then it would be dealt with through the
processes of secondary legislation. Our intention is that this power
for the Secretary of State would not be commenced immediately or,
indeed, in the near future. For the moment we think that
Monitor’s role in specifying the content requirements of
foundation trusts’ annual reports is very important. It helps to
ensure that the annual report can continue to become ever more useful
to governors and the public. The powers proposed for the Secretary of
State could not be used arbitrarily to impose operational controls on
foundation trusts. For those reasons I hope that the hon. Lady has been
reassured and will withdraw her amendment. If not, I will urge my
colleagues to resist
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000399">&#160;</a>

There was one bit of it that I did not understand. Would he therefore
write to me to clarify that the Secretary of State has the power to
require foundation trusts to keep those separate accounting streams? I
raise that because any foundation trust that does not, could be subject
to challenge from competitors in the independent sector, who may think
that they are not facing a fair playing field, if a foundation trust is
using its private patient money to subsidise its NHS services. That is
a real risk. Having very clear accounts that show that there is not
that cross-subsidy would be important to protect those
FTs.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000400">&#160;</a>

the answer now. Monitor currently has the power to require that clear
separation. With the Bill, we are repealing Monitor’s role in
that regard. That responsibility will come back and sit with the
Secretary of State. The assurance that I have given the hon. Lady

                           </strong> Perhaps I can start by setting out what the
clause is about. Following the changes in the Constitutional Reform and
Governance Act 2010, foundation trusts will move to within the
Department’s accounting boundary under the cross-Government
clear line of sight initiative, so that it is easier for Parliament to
understand Government accounts. The clear line of sight initiative
requires that foundation trusts’ annual accounts are
consolidated into the Department of Health’s accounts from
2011-12. The Department needs, therefore, to be able to specify the
form, content and timing of foundation trust accounts. We have
discussed some of that
already.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000425">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
direct answer to the hon. Lady’s question about who accounts for
the use of public money is, as we indicated in discussion on the
amendments that we moved earlier, that foundation trusts will continue
to be responsible for laying their own accounts before Parliament.
Their accounting officers, therefore, will be accountable for those
accounts. The NHS as a whole, through the NHS commissioning board and
its accountable officer, will be accountable for the moneys for which
it is directly responsible and for which it accounts to the Department.
The Department will be responsible, with its accounting officer, for
accounting for the consolidated accounts. I hope that that has answered
the hon. Lady’s question; it is the most direct answer, I hope,
that she has had for a
while—<em>[</em>

Secretary of State could, for example, change the size of a majority
required for approving mergers or for making changes to the

                        </p>
                        <p>That
seems pretty clear on the face of it, but the powers could presumably
ensure the opposite of what is suggested in those two examples. I am
not saying that that is the case, and I do not want to scaremonger in
any way, but we ought to give the Secretary of State such powers only
if we really deem it necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000435">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
draw the Committee’s attention to clause 153, which
would be affected by clause 143. Clause 153(2) states quite
clearly:<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000436">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“An
application under this section may be made only with the approval of
more than half of the members of the council of governors of each
applicant.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000891">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
do not know exactly what that means, because we are giving massive
powers to the Secretary of State to move the majority around, which may
be very necessary in mergers and acquisitions—I would probably
argue that that is the case; maybe two thirds ought to be able to take
such decisions—but we are saying in the Bill that it has got to
be a majority. Will the Minister tell us exactly where the power lies:
in regulation or in what is in the Bill? I hope that he can clear this
matter up. If he does not, it seems to me that if we take the wording
in the Bill, which states that it is a simple majority—not even
of those in attendance, according to the explanatory note—at
least we know where we stand. If regulation can ride roughshod over the
simple majority mentioned in clause 153, maybe we should not give the
Secretary of State the power under clause 143 to determine the matter
by regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000437">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have been
talking most of the afternoon about foundation trusts: their shape, who
should be on them, what powers they should have. The Government
consistently talk about the localism of decisions in the Bill, but they
are leaving powers in the clause for the Secretary of State to bring in
by regulation something—we know not what—that will affect
mergers, acquisitions, separations and dissolutions. I hope that the
Minister can reassure the Committee. The power that we are about to
give the Secretary of State could ride roughshod over what many of us
thought was to be the real decision making in our health service, done
by GP consortia and the local trust delivering the
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000438">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is worth
saying that the regulations in the clause are given effect only by
affirmative order, open to a lot of scrutiny by the House. The clause
enables the Secretary of State for Health to amend the new voting
arrangements—just the new voting arrangements—provided
for in the Bill. That is to ensure that the arrangements could be
modified if necessary in the light of how they are working in practice.
Part 4 introduces a range of new voting
arrangements for members, governors and directors of foundation trusts.
Those arrangements are important measures to strengthen, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1069<a class="bkMark" name="Column1069">&#160;</a>
                           </div>quite rightly, the internal governance and to place genuine
responsibility on foundation trusts to enable them to become more
autonomous and accountable to their local population. I will get to the
point, but I think it important to develop the argument first, if the
right hon. Gentleman will forgive
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000440">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill would allow a foundation trust to change its constitution if a
majority of the governors and directors voted to approve the amendment.
Governors would have the power to approve mergers, acquisitions and
separations on a majority vote. Members could approve certain
constitutional amendments on a majority vote. The power in the clause
will enable the Secretary of State to modify the provisions if
necessary. For example, he could make regulations changing the size of
the majority needed to change the constitution from a simple majority
to a two-thirds majority—I think the right hon. Gentleman
suggested that might be in order—or he could require a majority
to be a majority of all those entitled to vote, as opposed to a
majority of those actually voting.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000441">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
confident from our discussions with stakeholders that the voting
arrangements we have provided for in the Bill are robust and would
prove effective in practice. They strike a balance between the
appropriate accountability and not having unnecessary
bureaucracy that could impede the organisation’s operational
effectiveness. We do not, therefore, expect to use the power. However,
it is prudent to ensure the necessary changes could be made to respond
to unforeseen or exceptional circumstances. In order to ensure proper
parliamentary scrutiny, these matters will be dealt with by an
affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. I hope I have
reassured the right hon. Gentleman that the provisions are
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000442">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Nice try, but as the Minister just pointed out, it
is the Secretary of State to whom we are giving the power to alter the
voting patterns, not foundation trusts. The Secretary of State will
have the power to bring in regulations to direct foundation trusts on
what they can and cannot do. The Minister has not answered my question.
Clause 153, which will be affected by clause 143, refers to a majority,
not even the majority in attendance. What takes precedence: something
in the Bill, which will become law, or a regulation that the Government
propose?<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000443">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clearly, unless the Secretary of State, on the
basis of advice and in the exceptional circumstances I just referred
to, believes there is a need to amend the arrangements using the power
in clause 143, of course clause 153, which sets out the requirement of
a simple majority, would be the operative clause in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000444">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> So it could be that foundation trusts, under
clause 153, need a simple majority for mergers, acquisitions,
dissolutions or separations. On that basis, I am unhappy about giving
the power to the Secretary of State. I just do not know where it goes.
If the Bill requires a simple majority, why are we giving the Secretary
of State the power to alter that? Presumably he cannot alter it, and I
am misinterpreting what the Minister has
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000445">&#160;</a>

light of experience and the representations he might receive at some
point in future on how the provisions we will go on to discuss are

That is what the clause will provide for. FTs will be able to specify
higher voting thresholds when framing and approving their constitution
if they wish to do so; the Bill provides for the minimum
amounts.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000446">&#160;</a>

am conscious of the time. Obviously, we want to spend some time on some
of our amendments, but I will move through them as fast as I can. The
clause deletes a safeguard that was included in Labour’s
National Health Service Act 2006. Under the existing legislation,
foundation 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1071<a class="bkMark" name="Column1071">&#160;</a>
                           </div>trusts are authorised by the regulator. That authorisation directs some
of the particular services that a foundation trust will supply as part
of the existing planned and integrated health care service. The
authorisation, which is an important part of our legislation, also
designates certain trust property as protected on the grounds that it
is necessary to provide services for which the foundation trust is
authorised. That property might, for example, be a hospital building or
specialist health
facility.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000478">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill sweeps away the wider system of authorisation by making all NHS
secondary providers foundation trusts and removing the need for
authorisation to include specifications of particular services that
must be provided. Instead, foundation trusts may provide whatever
services are economically viable in the new health care market.
Presumably the Government will say that the provision is part of
removing the wider system of authorisation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000479">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
2006 Act, the foundation trust could not dispose of any property
designated as protected in its authorisation without the permission of
the regulator. That measure is a safeguard against, for example, a
foundation trust selling off vital assets—which, after all, have
been paid for by the public purse to provide public services—to
plug short-term deficits or create a surplus. The measure acts as a
disincentive for borrowing irresponsibly against publicly owned assets.
It is one of a number of asset locks designed to ensure that public or
community assets remain in public or community ownership for the use of
the wider public.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000480">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
that does not seem to be accepted by the Government, who have created
numerous ways in the Bill—and in other policy areas for that
matter—in which public or community-held assets and services may
soon end up being owned and run by private companies, as we discussed
this morning. That is driven by profit rather than the public interest,
or in this case the interest of the national health service. The wider
system of authorisation may have been swept away, but retaining the
measure would at least provide a safeguard for foundation trusts that
have protected
property.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000481">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              </span>
                           </strong> I understand why the Opposition have raised the
point—we all want to be confident that patients’,
taxpayers’ and public interests in foundation trust properties
are protected. I hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the amendment
is unnecessary because there are already strong safeguards built into
the new regime that the Bill creates.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000482">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor’s
new economic licensing regime will ensure that property needed for the
delivery of essential NHS services designated for additional regulation
will be protected. Clause 69 sets out the Government’s proposals
for the designation of services—I recall that we spent a
significant amount of time on Tuesday analysing that clause. Monitor
will be able to use its licensing powers to protect assets for services
that commissioners regard as essential to the delivery of NHS services.
The licensing regime will protect patients more effectively than the
current legislation. Monitor can protect the property needed for the
delivery of essential services by all providers, including foundation
trusts, charities—this comes back to the point made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Southport—and others in the independent
sector. The protection can include Monitor’s approval being
required for the disposal of property needed for the provision of
essential NHS services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000483">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also want
to protect taxpayers’ investment in foundation trusts in a much
more transparent way than has been the case until now. The previous
Government gave foundation trusts the freedom to sell their
assets—I stress that point. We want to be sure that property
sales do not lessen the value of that investment—the interest
that we, the taxpayer, have. We propose to create an operationally
independent investment management function to protect the
taxpayer’s investment. That function will manage the
taxpayer’s investment in foundation trusts and clause 148(7)
will give it powers that it can use if necessary to prevent a
foundation trust from disposing of
property.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000484">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are also increasing the local oversight of foundation trusts by
legislating to ensure that, for the first time, governors can have a
role in approving significant transactions. That would increase public
scrutiny and accountability and ensure that transactions have local
support. For those reasons, the amendment is unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000485">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
provides for more explicit and transparent safeguards than those in the
legislation passed under the previous Government. There will be strong
safeguards in the system that will ensure that the property needed for
the delivery of essential services is protected, irrespective of the
provider. There will also be strong safeguards to protect the
taxpayer’s investment in foundation trusts. Finally, governors
will need to be satisfied that significant transactions are in the best
interests of their local population. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman
to consider withdrawing the amendment. If he chooses not to, I urge my
colleagues to resist
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000486">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The difference between this Government and the
previous Government is that we are moving towards a market-oriented
health service, where competition will be king and profit will have an
increasing role to play, not just with private providers but with NHS
commissioners, who will need to ensure their viability. That is why I
tabled the amendment, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw

greatly worries the Opposition. The investment that the Labour
Government put in, the massive reduction in waiting lists and the
improvement in waiting times had an impact on the private sector. Our
view is that this Government’s proposals, not just in the Bill
but on funding, will lead to much greater pressure of demand on the
NHS, so we might well see, as we have before, an increase in the
private market share and opportunity for the private market to take
advantage of what is happening in the NHS. It is against that
background that I move the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000493">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We believe it
is wrong to lift the private patient cap. The organisations that became
foundation trusts are NHS organisations—they have NHS buildings,
NHS equipment and NHS-trained staff. Their principal purpose, which the
Bill does not repeal, is to provide services for NHS patients. Removing
the private patient income cap would lead foundation trusts to change
from being NHS organisations that treat some private patients to being
the same as a private provider that can also treat NHS patients. That
is a key part of our argument: what the Government propose would change
the nature of foundation trusts in terms of the number of private
patients they treat. That is not what patients or the public want; it
is unwise and unnecessary and the Government have no mandate to make
such a fundamental change. That is not what any of my constituents
voted for—nor yours, I am sure, Mr
Hancock.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000494">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Government presented a cohesive argument for the remedy of
anomalies and inconsistencies within the system, we would of course
give it our full consideration, but that is not what the clause does.
Instead, it makes a wholesale change to the system that Labour
introduced. Removing the cap would fundamentally, and perhaps fatally,
alter the fabric of the NHS. If the Government truly wished to explore
the possibility, they should have at least conducted widespread
consultation, first nationally on the principal, and then in every
locality where a change is proposed. I am quite sure that local people
in areas with foundation trusts would have a very strong view on what
the Government are proposing in one line of the clause. The policy, set
out in just one line, would make a massive, fundamental
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000495">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the patient cap was removed, the door would be open for a foundation
trust to generate as much income as possible from private patients.
When budgets become tight, as they undoubtedly will given the policies
and cuts that we will see from the Government and the cost of the
reforms, foundation trusts will be encouraged to increase income
generation as soon as they become more dependent on private
patients. As opposed to being an additional source of income for
foundation trusts, that could become the lifeblood of some,
particularly when the impact of competition is felt and if the
Government give help to private providers to deal with
“distortions in the market” as laid out in the impact
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000496">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Additionally,
elsewhere in the Bill we see the role of European Union competition
law. The impact on foundation trusts, whose services will increasingly
fall under those rules, must not be underestimated. In the Select
Committee on Health sitting on Tuesday, I understand that the Secretary
of State was at best unsure how EU law could impact on the NHS. If so,
our concern is even more pressing. Without a cap, the nature of
foundation trusts begins to shift, and they change from being
predominantly NHS providers to being something else. A key part of our
argument is that without a cap, they become more like undertakings,
which implies that EU procurement law will penetrate far further into
the system.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000497">&#160;</a>

that the proportion will continue to creep up, and as the Minister

said, it would have been helpful if he and his fellow Minister of State
had also taken that view on the many occasions when we have asked for
detail to allow us to consider the implications of their policies.
Given that they keep telling us that that information is not available,
such comments are a bit rich coming from a Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000506">&#160;</a>

susceptible to EU law to a greater extent. That is the key point. There

amendment. The clause is an important part of the Bill, because lifting
the cap clearly risks changing the ethos underpinning NHS trusts. They
have traditionally been not-for-profit bodies that are not concerned
about the bottom line and making money. There is a clear risk that if
that cap is removed, the temptation—or necessity in times of
economic constraints—might be to look for activities that the
trust can perform that are revenue generating, but are perhaps not in
the best interests of patients. That may not happen—trusts may
not pursue such avenues—but the change raises the possibility
that it could be a real temptation, and if it is, it could negatively
change the priorities of NHS trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000508">&#160;</a>

simple question for the Minister. Have the Government, in considering
the impact of the change, conducted any sort of assessment or review
that gives them evidence of what proportion of the revenues received by
NHS trusts in future might be derived from private patients or private
activities in public hospitals? If he has not undertaken that analysis
and so cannot provide us with some insight into what he thinks the
level is likely to be, he should have
done.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000509">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The college was one of
many organisations that responded to say that lifting the cap was
necessary, which is why the Bill does that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000516">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We know that
the proposal to repeal the private patient income cap has provoked
strong views, which have been voiced in Committee. Some people are
concerned that foundation trusts would stray from their fundamental NHS
purpose, but that concern is misplaced. What we want for NHS patients
is the best possible care from the best possible providers. To achieve
that, foundation trusts have told us that they must be freed from
unnecessary constraints, including the private patient cap.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000517">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Removing the
cap is about allowing foundation trusts to earn more income to improve,
expand or support NHS services. If foundation trusts are to innovate
and to drive sustainable improvements in outcomes and efficiency for
the NHS they must be free from an outdated, unnecessary and blunt legal
instrument that locks them into maintaining income from private charges
at arbitrary historical levels.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000518">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
current arrangements, several NHS trusts have been dissuaded from going
into the pipeline to become foundation trusts because of the
constraints of the cap, which is an historical cap, imposed at one
point in time. For example, Great Ormond Street hospital has
privateincome today of 7.8%; Imperial College Healthcare NHS
Trust—4.6%; and the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and
District Hospital NHS Trust, 4%—the list goes on. There are many
NHS organisations that, unencumbered by the cap imposed on foundation
trusts, are generating private income, which they are reinvesting into
their NHS purpose for the benefit of NHS
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000519">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will give one other example of a foundation trust where that frankly
bogus argument is exploded completely. The Royal Marsden earns the most
income from private patients: it has the highest private patient income
cap in the country, fixed at nearly 31% of its total patient income,
yet that trust has been consistently rated by the Care Quality
Commission and its predecessor bodies as a top-performing NHS provider.
It has not strayed from its NHS purpose. It has used that money to
deliver better results for NHS patients, which is what our proposal is
fundamentally
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000520">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
reasons for removing the cap are compelling. First, the rule is unfair,
with a few foundation trusts having much higher caps and hence much
more flexibility than the majority. Indeed, all foundation trusts are
constrained compared with NHS trusts, which do not have a cap on
private income in the first place. Secondly, the cap is detrimental to
NHS patients because a substantial and growing part of the NHS provider
family is hampered from bringing in additional funding to support their
core NHS work. That includes some of our internationally respected
providers, which wish to generate overseas earnings.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000521">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, the
cap’s legal definition is highly restrictive and, frankly,
absurd. It includes not only treating private patients, but joint
ventures and activities such as sales of technological developments and
drugs to private health care providers. Foundation trusts have said
that the position is highly undesirable as they cannot widen services
to the NHS through innovative partnerships with other providers.
Fourthly, we do not want foundation trusts to be at a disadvantage
relative to other providers to which no such restriction
applies.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000522">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1077<a class="bkMark" name="Column1077">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me try to
reassure the Committee about the robust safeguards that will ensure
that foundation trusts protect and prioritise investment in NHS care
and resources. In essence, that is the concern that Opposition Members
have about the provision. First, NHS commissioning consortia and the
commissioning board will be responsible for ensuring that NHS patients
are offered prompt and high-quality care and that good use is made of
NHS resources, whoever provides care, through robust contracts and
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000523">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
principal legal purpose of a foundation trust is and would remain the
provision of goods and services to the NHS. The Bill will put directors
under an explicit duty to promote the success of the organisation with
a view to maximising benefits for its members and the public. Failure
to pursue the principal purpose will mean that a foundation trust is
breaking the law and would be liable to face the legal consequences.
Thirdly, foundation trusts cannot distribute services externally, so
all proceeds from non-NHS work will continue to be reinvested in the
organisation. Fourthly, the Bill promotes greater transparency and
public scrutiny of foundation trusts, strengthens their governance
arrangements and introduces economic regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000524">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To support
public scrutiny, we will use the powers in the Bill to ensure that the
accounts of foundation trusts identify NHS income and private income
transparently. We discussed that issue earlier. Governors elected by
the public and NHS staff will be responsible for holding directors to
account on their duty to promote the success of the organisation with a
view to maximising benefits for members and the public. They will have
new powers to help them to do that, and they will retain the ultimate
power to remove the chair and the non-executive
directors.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000525">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
all of those reasons, and for the simple fact that Monitor, as the
economic regulator, has a duty to promote and protect the patient
interest, I hope that Members are reassured and that we can lift the
cap so that the improvements to public services can continue along the
lines that many foundation trusts have said are
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000526">&#160;</a>

principle with the Bill; when the Bill was published, however, they all

raised, including this one. That is the
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000558">&#160;</a>

now understand what the Bill is about and what it is going to drive
through, even to the extent that the Government have got into trouble
over their pricing, competition and designation policy. People did not
know the consequences. It is against that same background that they are
making this change. They are pressing for competition. There will be
more competition. I keep repeating that the Minister of State said that
the laws will increasingly be applicable to the NHS. So there will be
more competition. That is being done differently from how we did it. We
did it in a controlled way for particular purposes. The Government
eventually want unfettered competition in the NHS. That is what they
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000559">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That

number of overseas patients who can be treated in the NHS. It is
interesting that the policy is to try to stop the number of overseas

patients coming from abroad. I do not know where that leaves us in
terms of capacity. The impact assessment also
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000561">&#160;</a>

treatment “just affordable”. That is the

a wider point, we need to look at this in the context of Government
funding because that will obviously impact on foundation trusts. There
will be a drive to get as much income as possible when foundation

times and to delay operations due to financial problems, and what I am
saying is all in that

                        <p>That
is where the nub lies, and how the situation differs from that of the
Labour Government. We put money in to reduce waiting lists and get more
people seen and treated. That is not what will happen under this
Government’s
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000566">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
think that top-down targets are pretty important. The Government keep
telling us that they will not have them, so we believe that waiting
times will go up. If they go up, it benefits the private health sector
and impacts on the hospital. The Minister needs to look at that
position. In terms of capacity, why would hospitals not want a vast
increase in their share of the private sector in order to maintain
themselves? Why would they not want to do that? How would it affect
services?<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000567">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
number of years ago in my constituency, we found that some consultants
in my NHS trust spent more time treating private patients than NHS
ones. I am not saying that that necessarily would happen, but there is
a risk that hospitals and foundation trusts might decide to shift the
balance to maintain themselves and their stability. That would impact
on the resources and facilities that we use for NHS patients. We could
have private patients coming in the front door, while NHS patients
queue at the back door waiting for operations. That is the
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000568">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
finish by reiterating the following point to try to get
across to the Minister that the difference between when the Labour
Government were in power and now is that the Bill
promotes competition and brings in private providers to a
much greater extent. The policies that the Government are pursuing
today put hospitals at risk. We have already discussed the serious
concerns during our deliberations on the Bill, and they come not only
from the Opposition side, but from the Government side in some areas.
There is significant concern among many health organisations, trade
unions and representatives of doctors and nurses throughout the health
service. It is not only the Opposition who have these
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000569">&#160;</a>

supported Tony Blair and Alan Milburn’s proposals as a Minister?

of the Labour party fought so hard against it that Tony Blair and Alan
Milburn were forced to compromise. His view changed only because he

are even more likely to find themselves being second-class patients in
their own hospitals. Representations from the NHS Confederation, the
Royal College of Nursing, UNISON and Unite have made us aware of the
pressures that the foundation trusts are facing. The trusts are already
struggling to balance their books with the unilateral tariff reduction,
and they will face further pressures under the new system that is set
out in the Bill to trade at a profit. If they fail, they could be taken
over or even closed.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000576">&#160;</a>

Members believe that NHS patients will lose out. Private patients will
occupy the beds and use the diagnostic facilities and other services.
NHS waiting lists and waiting times might rise while patients will face
the option of paying to jump the queue. Indeed it might create a
perverse incentive deliberately to do that, cutting against even the
Government’s limited concept of the NHS as a health care system
provided free and allocated according to
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000577">&#160;</a>

point about lifting the cap and pushing foundation trusts into the
private health care market is that care will be based no longer solely
on the needs of the patient but on the needs of the financial trust to
make a profit and survive. My hon. Friend the Member for Halton has
already described the three cases set out in paragraphs B153 to B156 of

new arm’s-length body, NHS Global, was set up by the previous

play a role in international development by providing a shop front for

now with the tariff reduction of 1.5% that NHS foundation trusts are
facing in the current financial year. For a big trust, that might be
£20 million or £30 million. In the new world
set out in the Bill, trusts will be under pressure to balance the
books, just as they are currently. They were constrained by the cap
that was in force, but when that lifted there was an opportunity. Would
a director of finance of an FT not seize an easy opportunity to balance
the books by taking more private patients? It is a simple choice and
the line of least resistance.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000590">&#160;</a>

will move on in a moment as I do not want to drag the point out, but
there are certain key areas that affect quality of life, and
life-changing clinical interventions for things such as cataracts, hip
and knee replacements. I am old enough to remember people waiting 18
months or longer in my locality. Through using the private sector
because we did not have capacity in the NHS, we drove down the waiting
times. There should be some acknowledgement of that positive
move.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000592">&#160;</a>

the incentive to generate new sources of income will be even stronger
in the context of the market in health care created under the Bill;
after all, the entire policy is predicated on that. The Department of
Health’s chief executive, Sir David Nicholson, has said that the
NHS constitution enshrines the 18-week waiting time as a right, so
commissioners will need to give due regard to whether providers honour
it. The Government are using that argument to say, “Well,
although we don’t have an 18-week target, it is enshrined in the
NHS constitution.” In practice, however, there is

Ministers have removed the duty for the Department of Health to pursue
the targets, as part of the move away from Labour’s targets.
However, I wonder whether even an 18-week limit will be effective over
the next few years. I have already mentioned some of the problems with
cataract, knee and hip operations; an 18-week wait is too long, given
the life-changing interventions that need to be made.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000600">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government also suggest that patients will choose providers that treat
them sooner, and that that will incentivise providers to shorten
waiting lists and keep waiting times down. Again, that argument is
flawed. In many parts of the country—I am thinking of the
north-east and the north-west—there may be only one willing
provider within convenient travelling distance. Indeed, we touched on
that aspect this morning. Any choice will be illusory. Instead, the
choice will be between being an NHS patient at the local hospital or a
private patient who can pay to jump the queue.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000601">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the face
of financial pressures, commissioners may find providers deliberately
lengthening rather than shortening waiting times in order to control
costs. I have some knowledge of that, having worked in an NHS
foundation trust. Being a non-executive director, I understand that
they are sometimes manipulated, for reasons that many of us would
question. In financial terms, the loss of income from NHS patients may
not be a problem for foundation trusts if private patients occupy the
same beds but bring in a higher income. Again, it is a recipe for an
even greater share being taken by private patients, while NHS capacity
is reduced and waiting times lengthen across the board.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000602">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government argue that the plans currently being implemented are
intended to substitute community-based care for acute provision in many
cases, and that it would open up new capacity for the providers. Again,
however, there is some scepticism about whether it will happen. Even if
it did open up new capacity, it is not a strong enough argument to
leave the clause unamended, because there is no provision for limiting
the expansion of private provision to fill spare capacity. In short, it
is an argument for raising the cap rather than abolishing it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000603">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have advanced another argument. They say that most FTs do
not operate to their PPI limit. Evidence suggests that many FTs do not
automatically use their ability to earn private income, but the
argument that foundation trusts have not maximised their private income
ignores the realities of the situation. The planned market expansion
relies on a period when demand for private health care was dramatically
falling as NHS waiting times went down.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000604">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is
strong evidence that reduction of waiting lists and times in the NHS
had a knock-on effect on the private sector. People were not compelled
to wait long periods so they did not feel that they should
pay—where

                           </div>they had the means—for a private operation. That would suggest
that as waiting times rise again—as we suspect they
will—demand for private health care will rise, creating a
completely new context. Furthermore, as noted in the impact assessment,
the Government envisage non-EEA foreign patients being a major growth
area, so domestic demand may be irrelevant. That could undermine
community cohesion, given the likelihood of media stories about health
tourists blocking NHS patients,
with—potentially—effective taxpayer subsidy in the form
of
overheads.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000605">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
short, the Government plan to create new demand for private health care
in NHS hospitals. This is fundamentally different from previous
arrangements, where NHS patients were treated in private hospitals for
a particular purpose—because the capacity was not there. The
argument that previous levels of demand were not high enough to cause a
problem obviously does not hold. The Government admit
that<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000606">&#160;</a>

is not possible to predict how FTs will behave with the lifting of the
caps”.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000902">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>To
proceed with lifting the cap on the assumption that foundation trusts
will choose not to use the power that they are being given, based on
very flimsy evidence, is not only illogical but reckless. Combined with
the forced opening of NHS facilities to private companies—which
we discussed on Tuesday in the debate on clause 89 on licensing
conditions—this is another step towards opening hospitals to EU
competition law, especially if a major part of their income is private,
in which case it might be deemed an undertaking, rather than primarily
performing a social
purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000607">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also a legal opinion, although the Minister challenges this and is
at pains to say that European competition law will not apply. However,
there is a legal opinion from Beachcroft which suggests that expanding
private provision would leave NHS foundation trusts open to a state aid
case, due to the effective cross-subsidy of private patients given that
the wider hospital infrastructure was built and is maintained using
public funds. There is every reason to believe that this proposal is
fraught with risks at many levels, some of which the Government admit
to in the impact study, and there are few reasons to accept the
reassurances that they have given so far. I believe that this clause is
a Trojan horse, driving privatisation into the heart of the NHS, and I
urge Members to vote against
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000608">&#160;</a>

some of my suppositions about the clause, and in particular about the
cap, are wrong. I want to make some of the points made by the hon.
Member for Easington, but without the conspiracy theory
attached.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000614">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
remarks do not apply to any private establishment that is simply hosted
by a foundation trust, but exclusively to the occasions when
NHS-trained and employed staff drawing NHS pensions and within an NHS
asset appear to work as part of a private unit that is in turn part of
a foundation trust. I do not have a problem with not putting a limit on
the amount of funding that trusts can acquire; as far as I am
concerned, they might want to provide expensive operations for people
who are prepared to pay way over the odds in a limited amount of time,
and that would provide an excellent cross-subsidy for the NHS. I do not
think that any of us have a particular problem with that, even though
we may think that they should spend 100% of their time on their NHS
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000615">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, the
problem appears to be that the crude financial cap is almost a proxy
for other things, although I accept that it was a crude financial cap,
and I promise the Minister that I will look carefully at the responses
to the consultation. The cap did one thing: it put some sort of limit
on the amount of time that could be spent by NHS staff—I will
call them that, broadly speaking—and the amount of space that
could be given to NHS assets. A financial cap is one way of doing it. I
would have a concern where a foundation trust that is a public
hospital—despite being called a foundation trust—has no
limit on the time that staff spend on or the space that it affords to
private medicine. That is a genuine difficulty, and where my difficulty
starts; it is not with the cap itself, but what the cap is proxy
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000616">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
was not wholly persuasive. I do not think it was his fault; it was
probably my lack of attention. I think he said—he can certainly
correct me—that there are various restraints on getting the
balance badly wrong, which is where a foundation trust spends too much
of its staff’s time and too much of its space dealing with
private medicine for profit; I think we would all regret that and do
not want to see it happen. However, the restraints appear to be
relatively
weak.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000617">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On that very point, the purpose of foundation
trusts in the Bill is clear—to provide goods and services for
the NHS. Straying from that significantly would break the law and be
subject to

                           </strong> I understood the Minister. The problem with that is
that it is almost the nuclear option. If a foundation trust was seen to
subvert its function of being an NHS hospital, it would be subject to
legal challenge. Quite who would make the legal challenge I am not
perfectly sure, because presumably Monitor would have lost some of its
role in that respect, although it may come back as an economic
regulator.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000619">&#160;</a>

are in a weak position to prevent that from happening. The possibility
of getting the balance wrong is clearly left open—and getting it
badly wrong in certain circumstances. That might mean diverting

                           </div>traffic from the public sector to the private sector, for reasons that
only mean anything to the consultants, or even giving an indirect
cross-subsidy to the private sector. That would create some interesting
competition issues with the other elements of the private
sector—private hospitals and the
like.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000620">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
we accept that there is a concept of getting the balance wrong, and
that we need to have constraints in the process to ensure that
hospitals do not get it wrong—they will not get it absolutely
wrong; it will be fairly transparent and action can be taken—we
need to identify mechanisms for preventing it. We might believe from
time to time that a particular foundation trust diverts away from the
path of absolute rectitude too much and simply becomes obsessed with
profit and doing things that pay—which is the point made by the
hon. Member for Easington. If we accept that that is a possibility, we
need to identify clear mechanisms for preventing it. The financial cap
was, I accept, one very crude mechanism for doing that, but—it
is with this condition that I would wish to support the clause—I
am at a loss to see whether there is a better
restraint.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000621">&#160;</a>

am not sure it is good enough to simply say, “Well, they
can’t do that, because it’s not their purpose. Somebody
at some point in time can take action.” I would much prefer an
immediate remedy to something that I would regard as a nuclear option.
Will the Minister satisfy me that there are immediate remedies and
restraints? We are not getting the balance absolutely wrong, but we are
getting it clearly wrong. We are spending too much time using a
national asset to promote private medicine. If the Minister could
identify a restraint, I would be obliged to support
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000622">&#160;</a>

“arbitrary” cap, which is how it was described in the

not an arbitrary cap at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000623">&#160;</a>

many years some parts of the national health service have managed and
treated private patients. There was a big debate back in the
’80s about private wards and private beds in NHS hospitals. It
has been going on for a long time. In 2002-03 the then Government
looked at what was happening in the national health service and
introduced not an arbitrary cap, nor a crude cap, but a cap on how much
could be earned based on what was happening on the ground.

on Health looked at the introduction of new drugs two years ago, and it
has looked at parts of the NHS treating private patients on wards with
NHS nurses and doctors. That has been happening for a long time, and
the previous Government did not want to disturb it, but there was some
concern inside the national health service about the introduction of
the independent

history, some of it is in paragraph 858 of the explanatory notes. He
might want to educate himself a bit and read why the measure was
introduced in that way. If the Government wanted to lift the cap, I
would have no objection to the percentage by which it was lifted, but
people out there are right to be concerned about what is going to
happen in the NHS under the Bill. Some people thought that a rise of
even 5% threatened destabilisation, but the cap is to be lifted
completely. We are going to have competition law brought into the NHS.
Some NHS reconfigurations are going to be decided by the Office of Fair
Trading and the Competition Commission. That is why people are worried
that the cap will be lifted
altogether.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000629">&#160;</a>

Government could have been a bit wiser in doing what they wanted. I am
afraid that by throwing things into the marketplace—real market,
real competition, to remind the Minister of what he said a few months
ago—the Bill is destabilising our NHS now. The Government are
fundamentally wrong. If they wanted to move into areas where the NHS
has private patients, as some of them have for a long time, they could
have done so, but they should not be throwing away the cap. I hope the
Minister is reading that
section.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000630">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
all know very well that there are an enormous number of private
patients in the NHS. Independent sector treatment centres do
orthopaedic surgery and if there are any complications post-surgery,
patients go to the local hospital. That has been going on for many
years. I am not in favour of getting rid of that; that is the reality
of what happens on the ground. The reality is that there are private
patients in the NHS; they are managed quite well alongside NHS patients
and it does not destabilise. I argue that that is because of the cap.
By getting rid of the cap, instead of lifting it and maybe giving the
NHS time to adjust, clause 150 is just throwing it straight out of the
window and bringing in competition law. The Government are
fundamentally
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000631">&#160;</a>

point about competition law now and how it applies is that we know,
from the evidence of research, that some of the previous
Government’s competition-oriented reforms delivered real
benefits for patients—shorter waiting times and other
improvements of that sort. We are determined to make sure that we
continue to deliver those sorts of
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000635">&#160;</a>

is why the Bill makes it absolutely clear that we are not interested in
introducing laissez-faire into the NHS. We are interested in giving
Monitor a specific responsibility to promote and protect the patient
interest. That is the bit of the clause that Members often forget to
mention in debates on the Bill. They move to the second bit, the
subservient, ancillary part, which says that the regulator does that in
some circumstances by promoting competition where that is appropriate.
The key task is making sure that the patient interest is always
promoted and protected. That is what the regulator’s job
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000636">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Thank you, Mr Hancock. This is an evolution of
policy. I want to answer the questions posed by my hon. Friend the
Member for Southport as they are important. Today in the NHS, there is
more competition on price than there will be under these reforms
because the focus, through amendments that we have already debated in
Committee and which hon. Members seem to have forgotten, will ensure
that competition is increasingly on the basis of quality. The focus of
the Bill is therefore on quality and continuous improvement.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000650">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
difference over the impact of lifting the arbitrary cap is that the
Government are interested in expanding choice for patients and the
Opposition feel that the job was done in their time and does not need
to be progressed further. That seems to be the nature of the
difference. The Opposition have articulated a reason for not allowing
the clause to stand part of the Bill that is a fantasy and not the
reality of what the clause does.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000651">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
lifts the cap. There is a primary purpose in law for foundation trusts.
It is to provide goods and services for the NHS. Foundation trusts
cannot depart from that purpose and the governors’ role, which
we have already debated today and which we have strengthened
significantly through a number of clauses, is to protect that interest
and the public interest as a result. The fact that we are also clear
that we need to keep separate accounts for both private and public
income is a further safeguard and assurance of
transparency.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000652">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Then
there is the role of commissioners in terms of their contracts and the
contract monitoring that would guarantee quality and speed of service.
Indeed, the contracts that currently exist—this answers the hon.
Member for Easington—already contain a contractual requirement
to uphold the rights under the NHS constitution. It is not just a
right. It is a contractually enforceable right through
commissioners’ contracts.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000653">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the concern
about balancing the books and the fear that, by not having a cap, NHS
foundation trusts will somehow behave differently, it is curious, given
the Opposition’s anxieties, that there has been no attempt to
place a similar cap on NHS trusts. We know that a number of NHS trusts
have incomes in excess of the cap that currently applies to foundation
trusts, so why was that inconsistency of policy allowed to survive
throughout the whole time that the cap has been in
place?<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000654">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point is that the purpose of foundation trusts is to provide
goods and services to the NHS. If they make any surpluses, including
those that arise from private activity, those moneys must be reinvested
within the organisation to help to deliver its primary purpose. In
every way, the changes are beneficial, and they mean that there will be
more resources to meet patient demand. One example of that is the
buying of leading-edge technology. Private patient income was the means
by which one FT bought such technology and equipment. As its PPI cap
remains in place, it makes it more difficult for the FT to do that. NHS
patients are, therefore, losing out on that benefit. Buying out private
competitors to bring them into the NHS is another example. A mental
health FT wanted to expand its capacity and services by buying out a
private sector competitor, which was going out of business. While the
competitor provided most of its services to NHS patients, it had a
private client paying for the service. The PPI cap meant that the FT
was unable to take over that business. As a result, it lost the
opportunity to develop services that were of benefit to its own
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000655">&#160;</a>

it is not like other markets. Secondly, the Minister mentioned the
Royal Marsden’s 31%, so what threshold is acceptable to the
Minister? Is it 50%, 60% or 70%? Or is it
30%?<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000661">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend was making a very good point about
foundation trusts, but such practices are also continuing in other
hospitals. Is it not the case that the private sector has helped to
keep other loss-leading services in NHS hospitals afloat? The money
that was made from the private sector under the previous
Government’s policies has been pumped back into those
loss-leading services. There is no reason why that would not be the
case under these reforms or why it would not be greatly beneficial to
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000663">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Will the Minister clarify one point? I understand
that all the money from private sector enterprises within the FT is
ploughed back into the public sector side of the operation, and one
assumes that money cannot be put back into the private sector, on the
grounds that it would further enhance the public sector. That argument
will not work. However, let me ask the Minister about a hypothetical
situation: is it possible, within an FT, for a consultant who gets 100%
of his pension from the NHS, to spend the majority of his
time—51%—doing private work at the same
hospital?<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000665">&#160;</a>

its relevance needs to be explained. It is about how cross-subsidy
works in the public and private sector. If we are paying the pension of
somebody who is able to work in the private side of the
operation—perhaps the FT wishes him to—and earn good
money, while simultaneously drawing that pension, I would be distressed
to hear it. The Minister is free to contradict me and say that that
would not happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000667">&#160;</a>

gives the Secretary of State very broad powers to require information
from foundation trusts, without identifying in the Bill what the exact
nature of the information is. The explanatory notes make numerous
references to information relating to financial management and
reporting, and therefore, the intention appears to be that access to
patient information would not be required under the clause. Specifying
that fact in the Bill would provide reassurance. If patient information
is required by the Secretary of State, the reasons should be specified
and the usual rules of confidentiality must apply. That issue has been
raised in submissions to us.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000698">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Confidentiality
plays a fundamental role in the relationship between health
professionals and their patients. The requirement for confidentiality
allows patients to divulge sensitive information to their doctor,
without concern that it will be disclosed to others without their
consent, except in limited and exceptional circumstances. Significant
damage could be caused to health care in general, if trust between
doctors and patients is eroded. Fears that data may be shared with
central Government without their consent may result in patients
withholding information from health care professionals, which would be
to the detriment of their
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000699">&#160;</a>

prevent confidential information about individual patients being given

inappropriate, if that were the case. The hon. Gentleman and others do
not need to worry in that regard. It is neither necessary nor
appropriate for the Secretary of State to receive such information. He
does not need it and clause 151 already restricts the Secretary of
State to collecting only information appropriate to the performance of
his functions for the purpose of the health service. The collection of
individual personalised information is excluded and outwith what the

disposals of property are disposals of property

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is an alternative way of approaching the same issue, of
protecting what the public will rightly view as a public
asset—that is, their hospitals—rather than simply
property to be bought and sold and used for private business, if
economic actors so decide. This would take a different approach from
the Bill’s very weak protection of significant assets and
strengthen it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000706">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 152
allows foundation trusts to determine in their constitutions that
certain types of transaction are significant. Those will then require a
vote of the governors before going ahead. That might allow at least a
minimum level of protection for assets, but as it stands leaves the
decision to the foundation trusts themselves, much like the provisions
on the conflicts of interest in consortia. It lets the regulated not
only regulate themselves but write the regulation. There is a clear
case to set up some minimum expectations as to what the significant
transactions might be. The Minister might want to explain his own view
on that, and how the Government intend to communicate to the foundation
trusts and Monitor to take up the
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000707">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment is unnecessary and would not
achieve what it intends. Let me try to explain why. The purpose of the
amendment appears to be to ensure that the public and staff of a
foundation trust are involved in any decision to dispose of important
property. As worded, it would not work. The first part refers to
property protected in the authorisation. The Bill removes the term
authorisation and introduces a system of economic licensing. Clause
144, which we have already debated, removes terms of authorisation 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1094<a class="bkMark" name="Column1094">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and clause 148, also debated, repeals the power to use them to designate
property as protected. The key elements behind the amendment would,
therefore, no longer exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000708">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
part of the amendment refers to property necessary for the foundation
trust to fulfil its principal purpose. The property in that context
refers not only to land and buildings, but other assets such as
equipment and licences held by the trust. Governors would have to be
consulted on which property they saw as necessary for the foundation
trust to fulfil its purpose. That would mean that they would have to be
involved in every decision about property. There is a danger that
disposal of any equipment could require governor consideration. Such a
heavy-handed statutory requirement is unnecessarily prescriptive and
would impact adversely on the governors’ role, potentially even
obscuring their responsibilities in other matters. That is why we think
it would also have the effect of potentially obstructing day-to-day
operations within the foundation trust. Foundation trusts need to be
able to decide for themselves what is a significant transaction for
that organisation. That will differ between trusts. Some trusts will
have assets not used for services, for example. One size does not fit
all. Some governors may decide that it is best for their trust to
approve the disposal of major items of property. Others may decide that
they need to approve smaller property disposals, or disposals of
certain pieces of equipment. It will be far better to give foundation
trusts the discretion over when governors become involved than to use
legislation to put them in a straitjacket. Local discretion and
flexibility are more appropriate and effective in such circumstances,
particularly because of the changes that we have made to the governance
arrangements, which strengthen them and make much clearer the role and
responsibilities of governors and
directors.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000709">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the amendment is prompted by concerns about continuity of
service—I am not certain that that was the main
thrust—such concern is misplaced. The regulatory licensing
regime would give Monitor powers to prevent the disposal of property
essential for the provision of designated services. Clause 90(1)(j)
would give Monitor the power to set licence conditions for the
disposal<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000710">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

services”.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000903">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore,
the taxpayer investment would also be protected. The investment
management function, to which I referred earlier and that we intend to
create, would be able to set the terms of Government investments in
foundation trusts. Among its powers, it would be able to prevent the
disposal of property where this would have a material detrimental
impact on the value of taxpayers’ investments, as set out in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000711">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

amendment would ensure that the application for merger must describe
the goods and services that it is proposed should be provided by the
new trust. The clause would change section 56 of the National Health
Service Act 2006 so that the application for merger between foundation
trusts or between foundation trusts and NHS trusts would not need to
describe the goods and services that it is proposed should be provided
by the new trust. We believe that a description must still
occur.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000720">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The intention behind the amendment is one that I
think members of the Committee will have sympathy with. I am sure we
can all agree that it is important to protect patients and ensure that
essential services continue to be provided in the event of a merger
between two foundation trusts. We also agree that regulation is
necessary to ensure continuity of essential services. However, the
amendment is unnecessary. The new system will go even further in
protecting patients’ interests in relation to mergers than the
hon. Gentleman’s amendment would.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000721">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In its new
role as economic regulator, Monitor will ensure that services
designated for additional regulation would continue to be provided in
the event of any merger of providers, not just those involving
foundation trusts. If a merger were to threaten the provision of a
designated service, Monitor would have the power to stop it going
ahead. That would protect patients’ interests to a greater
extent than do the current arrangements. In the new system,
Monitor’s functions in relation to mergers would simply involve
ensuring that all legal requirements had been met relating to the
merger. After that, it would issue the orders that would give effect to
the changes taking place because the foundation trusts remain statutory
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000722">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is not
appropriate or necessary for Monitor to have controls over foundation
trusts that it would not have over other providers, because that could
disadvantage foundation trusts in relation to those other providers;
that takes us back to the concept of the fair playing

			Column number: 1096<a class="bkMark" name="Column1096">&#160;</a>
                           </div>field. It is likely that Monitor, as an economic regulator, would want
all providers from all sectors to describe their goods and services
when they apply for a licence to provide NHS services, and when there
are significant changes to those services. Requiring merging foundation
trusts to describe separately what goods and services a merged
organisation would provide would place an additional and unnecessary
bureaucratic burden on
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000723">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments address concerns felt by organisations such as the British
Medical Association, which also is opposed to any changes that would
undermine the national terms and conditions for staff who deliver
publicly funded care. That applies also to the trade unions, which have
done a lot of work over the years in negotiating with the NHS and the
Government. The concerns are essentially about maintaining an equitable
spread of doctors across the UK; safeguarding against variable and
substandard working conditions; and avoiding the creation of a market
in which doctors move around the UK. The local pay bargain is also very
wasteful in both management and clinical time. Local pay bargains
produce a huge extra administrative burden for hospitals at a time when
the Government claim to want to cut back on bureaucracy. Every time a
new pay round takes place, local employers are to be found in
negotiations rather than letting such things happen centrally and
cascade down.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000734">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The British
Medical Association’s point about the need for an equitable
spread of doctors across the country applies equally to
other professions. The Government are taking another step towards
removing the “national” 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1097<a class="bkMark" name="Column1097">&#160;</a>
                           </div>from the NHS; perhaps the Minister will reassure me about that. The
whole point of the agenda for change was to achieve equality and equal
pay across the NHS work force. Once employers move away from that, the
prospect of equal pay claims escalating becomes a distinct reality.
That is further evidence that the Government are taking the NHS down an
increasingly litigious route, unless the Minister can reassure me that
that is not the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000735">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">These are,
essentially, probing amendments, and if the Minister can reassure us we
can move on. If not, we may well press amendment 627 to a

                           </strong> I hope that I can offer the hon. Gentleman some
reassurance, because we have sympathy with the intention behind the
amendment. It is not necessary, however. Foundation trusts cannot merge
with, or be bought outright by, an independent sector provider whether
private, voluntary or social enterprise. The Bill would not change
that. The clauses on mergers, acquisitions and separation only allow
organisational changes involving NHS foundation trusts and other NHS
foundation trust, or NHS trusts, while they remain in existence. They
would not allow an independent sector organisation to merge with or
take over an NHS organisation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000737">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The effect of
clause 153 is simply to enable the NHS organisations to adapt and form
anew where governors elected by the public and NHS staff decide that
such changes are in the best interests of the public and staff. The
amendments are unnecessary, because the organisations that would exist
after such organisational changes would still be NHS organisations.
Clauses 153 to 155 specifically detail the process that an NHS
foundation trust must undertake to effect mergers, acquisitions and
separations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000738">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In relation
to this group of amendments, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the concerns
that staff might have. He spoke about removing the
“national” from NHS. We should be clear that the last
Government gave NHS foundation trusts freedom on pay policies so that
those organisations could decide how best to adapt to local
requirements and deliver high-quality health care provision. NHS
foundation trusts therefore already have the right to determine pay for
their own staff. The Bill will not change that. It is likely that many
providers will continue using national contracts as a basis for their
local terms and conditions. The position of individual staff after
transfer will depend on their existing contracts. In those
circumstances, the amendment would make no difference whatever. If he
wishes to intervene, I am happy to give
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000739">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendments are useful for putting the
Government’s position on the record. I am sure that they will be
considered elsewhere and that whatever action is appropriate will be
taken, but it is useful to have these matters on record.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000748">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again, in
that spirit, the current position before reform is that any mergers of,
significant acquisitions by or separations of foundation trusts must
have the approval of Monitor. That requires a thorough business case,
including setting out the clinical benefits and any consultations done
with the public, commissioners and so on. Effectively, the local
strategic health authorities and primary care trusts would have been
involved centrally, and would almost certainly have had to support the
move for it to be approved.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000749">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
Bill, Monitor’s approval will no longer be needed, so neither
Monitor, commissioners nor the health and well-being board will have
any power to prevent mergers, acquisitions or separations of financial
trusts. If such a move could affect competition significantly, the OFT
might investigate, but beyond that it would be left up to the
foundation trust governors to decide whether a merger, acquisition or
separation should go ahead. We have discussed whether governors are
properly able to do that job, so I will not raise that issue
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000750">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our amendment
would require foundation trusts at the very least to consult health and
well-being boards when deciding on a merger, acquisition or separation.
Health and well-being boards could bring up the concerns of the local
population or the fact that the move did not fit in with the joint
strategic needs assessment. That would help ensure that the merger
benefited local people and fitted in with the joint strategic needs
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000751">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The health and
well-being board could, for instance, bring up local concerns that a
merger might lead to the shutting down of services that local people
consider vital, or the provision of which is vital as part of the JSNA.
Their input would ensure that local people had a say. Surely the
Government would not want to object to that. We are not saying that
they would have formal approval powers, but it is important to have the
facility for input. Again, the point is to involve the wider public in
major changes to hospitals, but the health and well-being boards might
be the appropriate way for that to happen. I would welcome the
Minister’s comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000752">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> Health and well-being boards are rightly
acknowledged as an important innovation. They will have an important
leadership role in influencing the commissioning of health and social
care services. That will include a strong role for local councils in
shaping local commissioning. At the same time, councils will have a
separate scrutiny responsibility enabling them to scrutinise local
health and social care services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000753">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Changes in
services affect local people, and we expect health and well-being
boards to have a say in such changes. However, in our view, the
amendments are misguided. The clauses under the heading
“Mergers, acquisitions, separations and dissolution” are
simply about changes to organisational form, not to services, and they
provide for a range of contingencies that we would not expect to be
used frequently. They are, however, the logical progression of a policy
initiated by the previous Government to free providers to innovate and
deliver better patient care. That policy was not completed, so that is
what the legislation does.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000754">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where such
organisational changes might have material impacts on the
provision of services, safeguards are already in
place. As the economic regulator, Monitor would have an interest in
such changes in relation to public and patient interest in the
continued delivery of services designated for additional regulation. In
addition, the amended regulation-making powers will enable the local
authority scrutiny function to scrutinise those services that are
subject to substantial change and reconfiguration and are designated.
As we have discussed, those can be referred to the NHS commissioning
board and the Secretary of State, and power exists for the scrutiny
function to call on any provider to scrutinise any aspect of its work.
The scrutiny is real and ongoing.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000755">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where a
foundation trust considers that an organisational change would help it
successfully pursue its purpose, it should be able to get on with that
change with the agreement of the governors who are, after all, elected
by the public and staff and hold the board to account. The public
accountability about which the hon. Gentleman wanted assurance is in
the system.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000756">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Imposing
consultation requirements could cause unnecessary delay and is neither
necessary nor appropriate. In this case, the role of health and
well-being boards is different. It is about giving councils a
leadership role on health by bringing together locally elected
councillors, public patient representatives and health and social care
commissioners to assess needs and develop joint commissioning
strategies for which commissioners must have regard. For those reasons,
we do not believe that the requirement in the amendment would help if
placed in the Bill, and I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000757">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments will make changes to the savings provisions that will enable
any NHS trusts in franchise deals to retain their status after the
repeal of the NHS trust legislation. They will do three things: first,
they will define a franchise agreement more precisely than in the
original wording; secondly, they will enable trusts to retain their NHS
trust status for a period after the end of the franchise agreement; and
thirdly, they will confirm, in the Bill, the key sections of the
National Health Service Act 2006 that will be saved.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000779">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are committed to all NHS trusts achieving foundation status
by April 2014. Such status liberates trusts to focus on improving
outcomes in order to be more responsive to patients, and to innovate.
As a signal of the Government’s commitment to allowing all
patients to benefit from treatment by an autonomous, innovative
provider, the clause abolishes NHS trust status from 1 April
2014.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000780">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We anticipate
that a small number of NHS trusts will not be able to achieve
foundation trust status by that deadline. We are therefore developing a
range of options to deal with such trusts—some might merge with
other trusts to become viable foundation trusts and others may be
required by an existing foundation trust. A further option is being
developed, the concept of which originated under the previous
Administration. That option is to develop the notion of a franchise
arrangement under which another organisation takes on the operational
management—I stress operational management—of an NHS
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000781">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Franchise
arrangements might offer significant benefits to the NHS. They might
bring in private sector expertise and dynamism, and might help to
address some of the problems in the NHS. Hinchingbrooke Health Care
will be the first of what we expect to be a small number of NHS trusts
to work with partners, including partners in the independent sector, in
successful franchise agreements. These are early days, so we need to
see how the franchise market develops. In the case of Hinchingbrooke,
the Secretary of State would use his intervention powers under section
66 of the National Health Service Act 2006 to create a
unique Government structure for the trust. Similar flexibility might be
needed in the future for other franchise
deals.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000782">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
635 and 636 will define a franchise deal more precisely than the
original wording. They make it clear that the savings provision would
apply only to NHS trusts and franchise contracts under which the
franchisee performs the main functions of the trust. They would ensure
that the savings provision would not catch NHS trusts with only part of
their services contracted out, such the NHS trusts with contracted-out
laundry
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000783">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
637 will enable a trust to retain its NHS trust status for up to three
years after the franchise contract has finished. That is needed because
a trust wanting to apply for foundation status would need to
demonstrate to Monitor that it could operate autonomously after the end
of the franchise contract to be authorised as a foundation trust.
Alternatively, another solution would then need to be found. If there
were a situation in which a franchise contract had to be terminated
early, the amendment would ensure that a trust could continue to
operate while alternative arrangements were being
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000784">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
amendment 638 would make the scope of the savings provision explicit in
the Bill. The original wording left some room for doubt about whether
certain key sections of the National Health Service Act 2006 would be
saved. To avoid doubt in future, the savings provision will be amended
to make its extent
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000785">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The reason why I asked the Minister to speak to
these amendments is that they are significant. The clause, too, is
significant because it deals with the abolition of NHS trusts. The
Minister confirmed that 20 trusts were in
difficulty.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000786">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> When my right hon. Friend the other Minister
referred to that figure, he had in mind the exchange that took place in
the Public Accounts Committee involving Sir David Nicholson. He
indicated that the current estimate is
20.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000787">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are just not clear from what the Minister has
said and from the detail in the Bill how this will be done given that
there are already 20 trusts in difficulty, what the time scale is and
how the consultation will be managed. Perhaps the Minister has some
more information. We are concerned about how this process will be
managed and what the time scale is. Will it be completed in the
proposed timeframe? It is important to know who will lead the
consultation and when it will take place. I would be grateful if the
Minister could say more on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000788">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall try to address that point. This clause
makes provision for the possibility of franchise arrangements and for
those franchise arrangements to operate and, when they come to an end,
for the organisation to move to a foundation trust arrangement. The
hon. Gentleman is asking what arrangements we are making to support all
NHS organisations move to foundation trust
status.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000789">&#160;</a>

identified as needing additional support to get them to a point where
they can become foundation trusts. This is a difficulty that any
Government would have, especially one that had a commitment to move to
a position where all NHS organisations are foundation trusts. In the
coming year, the strategic health authorities that have a provider
support function will continue to do their work, working with
commissioners at a local level and with provider
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000791">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is best if I elaborate and then I will give
way to the hon. Lady. Strategic health authorities will be working on
that and coming back to the Department in the next month or so with
detailed proposals, tripartite agreements in effect between the
organisations I have just mentioned, to enable views to be formed. No
view has been formed yet because that work is in hand and is not
concluded. Therefore, the 20 figure is an estimate and not a final
figure. It would be wrong for anyone to think that it
was.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000793">&#160;</a>

addition, once strategic health authorities are abolished, the
responsibility for driving the pipeline of foundation trusts would move
to a special health authority that will continue delivering support to
those organisations. We wish to see NHS trusts achieve foundation trust
status by April 2014, and we will take the necessary steps to support
organisations moving in that direction. The amendments would deal with
situations when there may be a need to bring in additional support from
the private sector through a franchise arrangement of the sort
envisaged in the past, and which we wish to carry
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000794">&#160;</a>

accountable people. Another specific problem is to do with SHAs and
PCTs. We are getting rid of the SHAs by 2012, so there will be a gap of
two years. I would be interested if the Minister has information on
that. If it is a problem, I would be happy for him to write. If he has

the hon. Gentleman’s question on how the public are to be

already spoken to the local overview and scrutiny committee. They are
being very open about the process. In answer to his question about the
role of the NHS trust development authority, which is the body that we
are discussing, we have already touched on the subject. Indeed, it is
well documented in our proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000800">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What the hon.
Lady said was wrong, and I hope that she will not leave the Committee
and give a different impression. I was explaining the general process
of supporting NHS trusts in moving to foundation trust status. I
described my experience as a constituency MP of how it is being done.
It is not one of those basket cases about which the chief executive of
the NHS spoke.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000808">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I shall now
say two other things in response to the hon. Lady’s
intervention. She suggested that I had said that this was the clause in
which we would deal with special health authorities. In our earlier
exchange, I thought that we were talking about the banking function,
which was dealt with in clause 148, but the Opposition did not raise
questions on it. I am happy to write to her on that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000809">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also asked about the NHS trust development authority. It will play a
crucial role in ensuring that NHS trusts become, or are part of,
foundation trusts following the abolition of SHAs on 31
March  
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>next year. We will ensure continuity, consistency and focus on the
support for NHS trusts in developing foundation trust applications. It
will provide business continuity to the functions provided by strategic
health authorities, including supporting NHS trusts to achieve FT
status by April 2014, managing clinical quality, governance and risk
for the remaining NHS trusts and performance managing NHS trusts
against quality performance and financial requirements and
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000810">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
relation to supporting delivery of the FT pipeline, concerns about the
authorisation process––for example those following the
events in Mid Staffordshire, which have rightly prompted intervention
at various points in Committee––have been taken into
account in the design of those processes to ensure that quality is a
key component. That, as the hon. Lady rightly identified, is intended
to be a short-life special health authority running from late 2011 to
the close of 2014, working to the same timetable as that of achieving a
full foundation trust sector—something that I hope we share
because it was a commitment in the Opposition’s manifesto as
well as part of the coalition
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="11032488000811">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not know whether the Minister will grant
us this information. Are any of the 20 hospitals that may go into
special measures before becoming foundation trusts in London? Will he
give us their names? Furthermore, for those of us who are constituency

move all organisations to foundation trust status, and we have the
necessary means to do so and support them; if not, we have the
necessary means to deal with that as well. That is what we have been
discussing in the clauses over the past hour. There will be
arrangements that will deal with that transition. With that, I urge
