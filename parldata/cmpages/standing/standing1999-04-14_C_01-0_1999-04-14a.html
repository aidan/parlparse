<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Members of the Committee may remove their jackets if they so wish. In the interests of energy conservation, I have agreed that the lights be left off, but if any hon. Member finds it difficult to see, please let me know and I shall ask that they be turned on. There is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. There being no amendments to the Bill, its consideration will form a series of stand part debates.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Tests of satisfactory condition of vehicles</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): First and foremost, thank you for presiding over our proceedings, Mr. Gale. Your experience and wisdom are widely acclaimed. I apologise to you and members of the Committee for any inconvenience or confusion caused by the unusual starting time of 11.30 am. I had promised to serve on the Committee stage of another private Member's Bill, which ran on into a further sitting this morning, and I decided against the option of seeking another slot for this Committee.
<P>
My first observation on the clause is to remind hon. Members of the wider context within which it stands. The explanatory notes state that the Bill's main purpose is to provide a statutory framework for the establishment of a central computer database of MOT test status vehicles. That is intended to aid enforcement and facilitate the option of introducing paperless vehicle relicensing. The Bill also enables information on the database to be sold to help offset the cost of computerising the scheme. I make that wider point because I regret that the Bill did not have a substantial Second Reading. I have experienced that before with private Member's Bills and trouble can be caused in the Bill's later stages by the absence of a full Second Reading debate. I hope that that will not occur in this case.
<P>
The MOT testing of vehicles is governed by the Road Traffic Act 1988, which I shall refer to from time to time as the 1988 Act or the Act. The Act does not refer to ``nominated tester'', although in practice that category of person carries out most MOT tests. Clause 1(1)(a) inserts a new paragraph into subsection 3 of section 45 of the 1988 Act and, thereby, puts nominated testers on a statutory basis. Subsection (1)(b) replaces the existing subsection (3)(c) of section 45 of the 1988 Act and, thereby, provides for inspectors whose names are put forward by designated councils to be approved by the Secretary of State.
<P>
Clause 1(2) amends subsection (4) of section 45 of the 1988 Act, which provides that, when a test certificate is refused, the examiner or inspector must issue a notification of the refusal stating the grounds of the refusal. In practice, however, the authorised examiner does not often personally conduct the MOT test. The task is carried out by an employee or assistant whom the Bill categorises as the nominated tester. One of the advantages of computerising MOT testing is that it will enable the Vehicle Inspectorate to monitor testing standards more efficiently and, thereby, to oversee and control testing standards and procedures more effectively. It is, therefore, important that the computer programme should identify individual testers.
<P>
Subsection (3) adds two new subsections to section 45 of the 1988 Act after the existing subsection (6). The first, (6A), will enable the Secretary of State to provide or to make arrangements for the provision of courses of instruction in connection with MOT testing, as he does under the present administrative arrangements. It will also enable him to charge fees for attendance on such courses. This is a new provision, designed to make those who benefit from such courses responsible for paying for them.
<P>
New subsection (6B) will require the Secretary of State to establish and maintain records relating to MOT tests. The main objective of the MOT computerisation project is to establish and maintain a central record of the MOT status of every vehicle subject to MOT testing.
<P>
I commend clause 1 to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Ms Glenda Jackson): I begin, Mr. Gale, by saying what a privilege it is to serve under your chairmanship yet again.
<P>
The Government welcome the Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter). The Committee will be aware that we are in the process of modernising the system of MOT testing. The Bill will assist us greatly in obtaining the maximum benefits by introducing computerisation. We commend the Bill to the Committee today, as we did to the House on Second Reading.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulations under s. 45 of Road Traffic Act 1988</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Clause 2 is lengthy. I propose to take the Committee through it, even though it may be a rather tedious exercise. I shall be as brief as I can. It is important, in the absence of a Second Reading debate, to put on record some comments about the Bill that can, if necessary, be considered during the Bill's later stages.
<P>
Clause 2 is a substitute for section 46 of the 1988 Act. It re-enacts the existing provisions and adds further provisions. Section 46(1)(a) of the 1988 Act empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations that provide only for the authorisation of examiners. However, as we have already acknowledged, other categories of people are involved in MOT testing. New subsection (1)(a) will ensure that those people are treated in the same way. It will empower the Secretary of State to provide for the nomination and approval of nominated testers, the appointment and approval of inspectors and the designation of councils.
<P>
New subsection (1)(b) will provide that regulations made under section 46 of the 1988 Act may establish conditions to be complied with by authorised examiners, nominated testers, inspectors and designated councils. In the 1988 Act, that provision is included in section 46 (1)(a). The sort of conditions that I have in mind are the successful completion of a course of training and the payment of the prescribed fee.
<P>
New subsection (1)(c) deals with the termination of approved status. Regulations may establish the circumstances in which a person ceases to be an authorised examiner, a nominated tester or an inspector, or in which a council may cease to be designated.
<P>
New subsection (1)(d) is identical to section 46 (1)(b) of the 1988 Act. It will enable the Secretary of State to prescribe the conditions under which, and the apparatus with which, examinations are carried out, the maintenance of that apparatus and the inspection of premises at which, and the apparatus with which, MOT tests are carried out.
<P>
New subsection (1)(e) deals with the supervision of examinations and the premises where examinations take place.
<P>
New subsection (1)(f) is identical to the comparable paragraph in the 1988 Act. It will empower the Secretary of State to make provisions for how to apply for a test and, if necessary, appeal against its outcome.
<P>
New subsection (1)(g) closely follows section 46(1)(d) of the 1988 Act and will enable the Secretary of State to prescribe the form and particulars of paper test certificates and notices of refusal.
<P>
New subsection (1)(h) also closely follows the 1988 Act. It will empower the Secretary of State to provide what the fee should be for duplicated or copied test certificates.
<P>
New subsection (1)(i) will permit the Secretary of State to provide in regulations how factual errors in MOT test certificates should be corrected.
<P>
In conjunction with new subsection (4), new subsection (1)(j) deals with charges payable to the Secretary of State by authorised examiners or designated councils on the issue of a test's results, on the issue of duplicates or copies of test certificates and on the correction of errors in test certificates.
<P>
New subsection (1)(k) is about the keeping of records. It will empower the Secretary of State to provide how authorised examiners and designated councils shall keep registers of test certificates that they have issued.
<P>
New subsection (1)(l) is identical to one in the 1988 Act. It will permit the Secretary of State to prescribe what returns and information authorised examiners and designated councils should provide.
<P>
New subsection (2)(a) will empower the Secretary of State to require that persons connected with MOT testing should successfully complete training courses. New subsection (2)(b) will enable the Secretary of State to require that persons connected with MOT testing pay such fees as may be prescribed in connection with applications for authorisation, approval or designation.
<P>
In conjunction with new subsection (1)(e), new subsection (3) deals with nominated supervisors and will enable the Secretary of State to make provision for the supervision of MOT testing stations.
<P>
I can accelerate to new subsection (5), which is about access to MOT database information. It will permit the Secretary of State to make information available from the MOT records to prescribed persons on payment of a reasonable fee. The provision will allow the Secretary of State to disclose information from the database in accordance with regulations. It is envisaged that regulations could, on the payment of a reasonable fee, provide for details of a vehicle's MOT history to be issued to people who could demonstrate that they had reasonable cause for wanting such information. The regulations could also provide for the issue to the police of information relating to the MOT status of vehicles, free of charge, via the police national computer.
<P>
This is a lengthy clause. New subsection (6) also relates to the disclosure of information from the proposed MOT database, but in rather different circumstances. Regulations made under this provision would enable the Secretary of State to sell anonymised information from the database to such persons and on such terms as he thought fit.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mark Oaten </B>(Winchester): Will the hon. Gentleman list the types of organisations that information from the database could be sold to? Does he envisage that any organisations would be precluded from purchasing information from the database?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Under both new subsections (5) and (6), there are identifiable markets. I would not claim to be an expert, but I have been shown motor car sales advertisements in which the company making the sales had acquired information about MOT status of vehicles. On commercial grounds, scope may exist for demand for information from the database. To some extent, the availability of the information may itself create demand that is not yet foreseeable.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): Will my hon. Friend take the opportunity to clarify a matter that I think is beyond question, but that should be put on record? Will he make it clear that in the disclosure of information about vehicles from the database there will be no question of disclosing the owner's details?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Yes, I can give that unequivocal assurance. Although my hon. Friend's anxieties have been expressed by others, they are unfounded. Personal information will not be available through the MOT database.
<P>
Information that might be disclosed under clause 2(6) might include vehicles' recorded mileage or the record of performance of particular makes and models at MOT tests. Such information would be sold for a price that reflects its commercial value to organisations interested in it.
<P>
Clause 2(7) is a standard provision to enable the Secretary of State to apply the Bill's provisions in rather more flexible terms than we can necessarily envisage now. After that rather lengthy amble through the clause, I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Use of Records of Vehicle Examination, etc</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I can be briefer in this case.
<P>
Clause 3 will insert a new section 46A into the 1988 Act. The proposed new section establishes how the Secretary of State may use records in the proposed MOT database and the database of vehicle records held by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.
<P>
Proposed new subsection (1)(a) establishes that proposed new section 46A will apply to the records of MOT tests that the Secretary of State is required to maintain under section 45(6B) of the 1988 Act. Proposed new subsection (1)(b) establishes that proposed new section 46A will also apply to the DVLA database.
<P>
Proposed new subsection (2) will allow the Secretary of State to use information from the MOT database to check the accuracy of information on the DVLA database and vice versa and, where appropriate, to amend or supplement information contained in the other database. Proposed new subsection (3) provides for the Secretary of State to use information from the DVLA database to promote compliance with the requirement to hold a valid MOT certificate, which could include sending out reminders to registered keepers that their vehicles need MOT tests.
<P>
Proposed new subsection (4) merely makes it clear that the Secretary of State's powers in relation to the databases are not affected in any other way by the provisions in new section 46A. I commend clause 3 to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Evidence from records of vehicle examinations</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Clause 4 will insert a new section 46B into the Road Traffic Act 1988. At present, a vehicle's MOT test status is usually proved by producing an MOT certificate. In future, it will be possible to use records from the proposed MOT database. Clause 4 makes provision for admitting evidence from those records in court. Legislation to effect that is necessary because such use of information held by a centralised computer database falls outside the provisions of the 1988 Act.
<P>
Proposed new subsection (1) provides that the database records are an authoritative statement of the test status of a vehicle. Proposed new subsection (2) establishes that a document purporting to be part of the database, a copy of a document forming part of the database, or a note of information from the database shall be authoritative if it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``authenticated by a person authorised to do so by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Proposed new subsections (3) and (4) define ``document'', ``copy'' and ``statement'' as for England, Wales and Scotland. Proposed new subsection (5) provides that proceedings under proposed new section 46B can be either civil or criminal proceedings in Scotland, as they can in England and Wales.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Satisfying conditions for grant of vehicle excise licence</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Clause 5 will add a paragraph to section 66(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Under that provision, a vehicle may be relicensed without producing an MOT certificate because the Secretary of State may use information from the proposed MOT database.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Orders relating to fees chargeable byvirtue of s. 46 of Road Traffic Act 1988</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The clause enables the Secretary of State to make consequential amendments to the Department of Transport (Fees) Order 1988, arising from the Bill, by negative resolution regulations, rather than by affirmative resolution. The reason for that is to save time. It could be argued that the enactment of the Bill is, in itself, an affirmative procedure, so there would be little point in repeating the process in a few months' time.
<P>
Subsection (1)(a) and (b) define the terms that feature in the next two subsections. Subsection (2) refers to the Department of Transport (Fees) Order 1988, which includes a provision relating to fees chargeable by virtue of section 46 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. It will require amendment as a result of the Bill. Subsection (2)(a) and (b) will enable an order that relates only to section 46, and which is made within 12 months after Royal Assent, to be made subject to negative procedure.
<P>
The purpose of the time limit is to ensure that the procedure can be used only for matters that flow from the Bill. Subsection (3)(a) removes the requirement for the affirmative resolution and subsection (3)(b) emphasises that it can be subject to negative resolution.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Consequential amendments and repeals</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The clause is self-explanatory. It introduces a schedule of consequential amendments and repeals two elements of redundant legislation.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Financial Provision</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The substance of the clause was the subject of the money resolution debate, so it has had the attention of the House. The clause makes provision for the possibility of new resource demands, however remote, and new income streams.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Short Title, Commencement and Extent</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The point to note is that the provisions of the Bill that relate to operational matters are subject to commencement by order. Clauses 6 and 8 are not subject to commencement by order because their effect is directly linked to implementation of the other provisions of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule</center></H4>
<H4><center>Consequential amendments</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The schedule contains consequential amendments relating to the Transport Act 1982, which remains prospective legislation. It was passed when the privatisation of the Vehicle Inspectorate was possibly on the agenda. That never materialised but the legislation remains. The passage of this Bill demands amendments to that unused 1982 Act.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on piloting his Bill through the uncharted waters of the Committee stage with a remarkable degree of unanimity.
<P>
Bill to be reported, without amendment.
