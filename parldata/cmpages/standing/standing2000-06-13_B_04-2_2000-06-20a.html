<P>
[Continuation from column 158]
<P>
<H5>9.36 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming-
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I should explain that it was in the interests of everyone for me to move to another seat. I could not hear properly, which meant that the air conditioning had to be turned off. That put me at two disadvantages: I was being criticised for the lack of air, but I was still unable to hear properly. No symbolism can be attached to the move.

<P>
I think that my points on compliance with the code of ethics were conclusive. There is a clear distinction between requiring the Policing Board to monitor compliance with the code of ethics and keeping the code of ethics under review. Amendment No. 129 would make arrangements for the inspection of custody and interrogation suites. That recommendation in Patten is unusual. It is specific not only on what should be done but on who should do it. The report explicitly stated that the Policing Board should have that role. I understand that the Government might be considering that recommendation. It makes no sense not to include it.

<P>
Amendment No. 130 would establish arrangements to monitor police performance in public order situations. It, too, is designed to ensure full and faithful implementation of the Patten report. The recommendation is also unusual because it specifically states that the Policing Board should have that role. Given our experiences over many years, it would be incongruous not to include the monitoring of public order situations in the list of 12 specified in the clause. The issue is crucial. We have seen how often the management of such situations affects the whole north of Ireland. We see it year after year, beginning around Easter and lasting until some time in October. Drumcree is not just a matter for Portadown. It concerns people throughout the north of Ireland and the well-being of the entire political process there. The purpose of the amendment cannot be achieved obliquely or by implication. The Bill implies it in places, but to obtain the Policing Board and arrangements that we want, we should make matters specific in the Bill.

<P>
The amendments faithfully represent the views set out by Patten. I am convinced that to omit from clause 2 any requirement to deal with the code of ethics, public order and interrogation centres would be to leave a huge gap-not just legislatively, but in terms of credibility.

<P>
<B>Dr. Jenny Tonge </B>(Richmond Park): I support amendments Nos. 128 to 130. I have studied the question carefully and it is important not only to adopt a code of ethics but to ensure that it is complied with. I have much experience, in the context of international development, with transnational companies. They all have codes of ethics and know how they should behave, but those codes are not always legally binding, so the companies do not always behave as they should. In a nearby Committee Room we had a similar argument about the Commonwealth Development Corporation Bill and its code of ethics.

<P>
I do not know whether it is appropriate to mention at this stage that my hon. Friends and I would, in supporting amendments Nos. 128 to 130, withdraw amendment No. 149.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) moved the amendment, he is the only one who can withdraw it. As he is not here, it will have to be put.

<P>
<B>Dr. Tonge:</B> I understood that before he left he cleared the question of my withdrawing it for him.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is not in order for anyone but the mover of a motion to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh raises the question of monitoring three aspects of policing: public order performance, compliance with the code of ethics and the inspection of holding centres. I am not sure that there is a great deal between us in those matters. I understand that the hon. Gentleman considers them crucial to the operation of the Bill. Despite not being a pedant, he made rather a lot of the difference between monitoring and reviewing. My understanding, from the dictionary, is that to review means to look at, or examine, again. I hope that that deals with the hon. Gentleman's worries. I have found a definition of monitoring, but it is very long and does not shed much light on the matter, so I shall not bore the Committee with it. We are, in the light of the hon. Gentleman's concern, willing to keep thinking about the question and keep it under review. We take serious note of what he says. There will be a further opportunity later to revisit the relevant issues.

<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The code of ethics, to which the hon. Member for Richmond Park also referred, is, we accept, very important. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State and I have thought about it and we intend to amend the Bill to require the board to approve and issue a code of ethics. The board will therefore have the final say on its contents and be able to keep it under review-or monitor it.

<P>
I have said that we will consider the appropriate way of dealing with holding centres under the clause. I do not want to rush at this stage into a formulation that might not fulfil the requirements of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh or the service. We shall return to the matter if we can find a suitable approach. Although he feels strongly about all the issues that he has raised and wants to deal with them as a question of principle-I do not dispute his right to do that-there is scope for discussion and I think that, in all three cases, we can reach conclusions that will satisfy him and the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I know that the Minister is trying to be helpful, and I appreciate that; I do not want to sound as if I do not appreciate it. However, I should like to make a distinction. The code of ethics can be reviewed, but it is important that the way in which it is complied with should be monitored. That is a different issue. In addition, the question of visiting the suites in interrogation centres is no big deal. Either those concerned go to see them or they do not.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The intervention is becoming lengthy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thought that you might say that, Mr. O'Hara. I see no reason why those who will be involved in the Police Service through the Policing Board do not go in to see them. The third point is especially important.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I appreciate the courtesy with which my hon. Friend continues to disagree with me. I accept that he distinguishes between reviewing a code of ethics-at which point, he agrees, there is such an opportunity-and reviewing compliance with a code. His concern is about effectiveness, rather than content. I have made it clear, and will do so again, that we will consider seriously the distinction that he makes and will revisit the issue constructively during the later stages of the Bill if we can.

<P>
I suspect that I have not said enough to satisfy my hon. Friend; I regret that my powers of eloquence are inadequate to the task this evening. He must accept that I make these observations in a spirit of trying not simply to dispose of the amendments but to enter a constructive dialogue with him and with other hon. Members concerned about the matter. We hope that we can narrow the differences to the point at which we all feel that we have reached a consensus.

<P>
Amendment negatived.

<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Orders 68 and 89, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question agreed to.

<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Police support staff</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 159A, in page 3, line 23, after ``Board'', insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after consultation with the Chief Constable and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 160A, in page 3, line 23, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8) A person shall be disqualified from being a member of the police support staff if he has been at any time in Northern Ireland or elsewhere convicted of any offence and has had passed on him a sentence of imprisonment (whether suspended or not).

<P>
(9) A member of the police support staff shall have his employment terminated if he is at any time in Northern Ireland or elsewhere convicted of any offence and has had passed on him a sentence of imprisonment (whether suspended or not).

<P>
(10) A senior employee shall have his employment terminated if he is declared bankrupt or he makes a composition or arrangement with his creditors.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 161A, in clause 4, page 3, line 37, leave out ``and (6)'' and insert ``(6) and (8)''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not intend to take much of the Committee's time with the amendments. Amendment No. 159A refers to the board and to arrangements for the provision of administrative, secretarial and other assistance for the police by persons employed in the civil service. The amendment is simple. Arrangements should be implemented after consultation with the Chief Constable. That is reasonable; it makes sense that the Chief Constable should be able to submit his requirement to the board before decisions are taken on the deployment of civil servants to work with the police.

<P>
I doubt that I need to say anything on that matter with regard to amendment No. 160A. The amendment might evoke a little opposition because it would affect senior employees, who are defined by subsection (7) as those of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such class or description as may be specified for the purposes of this section by the Board with the approval of the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important that some criteria are applied to senior employees in relation to matters that we have already discussed. Such people should be disqualified from the support staff if, at any time, they have been guilty of an offence in Northern Ireland or elsewhere and have received a sentence of imprisonment, whether or not it was suspended. We believe that a member of the police support staff should have his employment terminated if he is found guilty of an offence after his appointment. Again, it is important that the bankruptcy criterion should apply to senior employees, who might handle large amounts of money or be responsible for financial matters. After our debate on the issue, I need do no more than emphasise the need for instituting some way of dealing with that situation in relation to police support staff.

<P>
Amendment No. 161A results from 160A and provides that subsections (6) and (8) shall apply to persons transferred to the employment of the board as they apply to persons employed by the board and to those who are not senior employees. The bankruptcy provision would not apply, but people who have a criminal conviction would be disqualified. I do not wish to take up any more of the Committee's time. The amendments introduce essential measures relating to staff who will handle the most sensitive issues with and on behalf of the police, where one would hope that propriety would be the order of the day.

<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made clear, the amendments would change the Bill's provisions relating to police support staff. Amendment 159A requires the board to consult the Chief Constable before exercising its power to appoint police staff. However, under clause 3(5)(b), that function is required to be exercised by the Chief Constable. Therefore, the amendment would require the Chief Constable to consult himself. That is a novel concept. Sir Ronnie Flanagan is a man of great talents, but he may have philosophical difficulties with such a dialogue. Although I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, his suggestion is inappropriate.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 160A and 161A include-

<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I was reflecting during our break for the two Divisions in the House that we are dealing with the power to dismiss employees. I do not wish to share all our secrets with the Committee, Mr. O'Hara, but you will recall that before you and I were elected to the House, we had considerable experience of dismissing employees. That does not make us ruthless capitalists. As party activists, we were responsible for some social clubs that suffered dishonesty among their employees, and we occasionally had to dismiss people. It is not beyond our experience.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> They never caught you, did they, George?

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Had they caught us, Mr. O'Hara, they would not have found anything. I am not sure that the same can be said of my hon. Friend.

<P>
Before the sitting was suspended, I referred the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone to clause 3(5)(b). Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The following functions of the Board shall be exercised, on behalf of and in the name of the Board, by the Chief Constable, namely  (b) the power to appoint and dismiss other employees, the power to direct and control such employees and all other powers and duties of the Board as employer of such employees.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That defines the role of the Chief Constable. Having studied the matter in detail, the hon. Gentleman then pointed me to subsection (5)(a), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the power to direct and control senior employees of the Board and all other powers and duties of the Board as employer of such employees, other than the power to appoint and dismiss.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman pointed out that those provisions may not be entirely consistent. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Board may, subject to the following provisions of this section, employ persons to assist the police force.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Senior employees shall be appointed by the Board-

<P>
(a) with the approval of the Secretary of State and after consultation with the Chief Constable; and

<P>
(b) on such terms and conditions as the Board may, with the approval of the Secretary of State, determine.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Even in those circumstances, the Chief Constable is to be consulted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not want the Minister to confuse himself, or me, but he has strayed back to subsection (1), which deals with people appointed by the board, rather than those appointed under subsection (4), which refers specifically to civil servants. We must not confuse the two. Subsection (1) refers to normal appointments; subsection (4) deals with the appointment of people already working in the civil service. The Minister could resolve the issue by dropping in the few words of amendment No. 159A. He would not then need to extricate himself from a trap that does not exist. I am not setting a trap. I am talking about senior civil service employees-perhaps architects or engineers. If the Minister misunderstands, I reassure him. I misunderstand things from time to time, but I own up to it. Let him do the same, so that we can get on.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If I were confused and got matters wrong, I would own up, and it is in neither my interests nor the Committee's for me to pretend that I possess knowledge that I do not have. However, the hon. Gentleman has revealed part of the source of his own confusion. He referred to subsection (4), but I was talking about subsection (5). I do not intend to repeat the argument, but as the hon. Gentleman sees it, the crucial difference in respect of senior employees relates to the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>other than the power to appoint and dismiss.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I was saying, senior employees are defined elsewhere in the clause. It also states that, even in such circumstances,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Senior employees shall be appointed by the Board  with the approval of the Secretary of State and after consultation with the Chief Constable.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We are talking about three grade 5 civil servants from a total of 3,000 employees. If the hon. Gentleman wants to continue to discuss those individuals, we can do so; I am sure that they will be very grateful. However, I cannot accept that this is a particularly serious point that requires further debate. I put it to the hon. Gentleman that the general principle holds true, and I do not believe that he wants to detail the Committee by debating three individuals of a certain grade who serve in the RUC and will serve in the service.

<P>
Before we suspended, I was saying that, in respect of those convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to imprisonment, whether or not that sentence is suspended, amendments Nos. 160A and 161A would debar, or automatically remove, them from the police support staff. They would also provide that a senior member of the police support staff be sacked if declared bankrupt, but I should point out that that is already custom and practice. In no circumstances would it make sense to do otherwise, and there is no need to reiterate the point in the Bill.

<P>
In my view, the route taken by the amendments is not a desirable one. Police support staff of whatever rank are subject to the normal terms, conditions and statutory provisions applying to employees and civil servants. For example, paragraph 4 of schedule 1 to the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Exceptions) Order (Northern Ireland) 1979 exempts
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Persons employed for the purposes of, or to assist-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I use this phrase at the risk of upsetting my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the constables of a police force.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the law already takes into account the special position of those employed to assist the police with the disclosure of criminal records. As we would expect, the police will also carry out character tests on those appointed to work with them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Under-Secretary may recollect that, during last Thursday's deliberations, I said that certain categories of individuals did not benefit from rehabilitation legislation. Will he confirm that, in respect of support staff for police forces, the circumstances in Northern Ireland that he describes simply mirror those in the rest of the United Kingdom? As I understand it, support staff would fall squarely within that category.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My understanding, from memory, is that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield is right. However, in Northern Ireland the specific exemption that I have just described applies to police officers. Not only are there separate arrangements-and properly so-for those supporting the police service in England and Wales, but there are special provisions that apply specifically to Northern Ireland.

<P>
I am advised that a member of the police support staff who was imprisoned or who received a suspended sentence would invariably, and rightly, lose their job. On the question of financial probity, if the reliability or integrity of a member of staff were compromised, swift action would be taken as a matter of custom and practice. I see no advantage in including provisions such as those proposed by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, although this debate has been helpful because we can now be entirely satisfied that the necessary provisions are already in place in separate statutes or in the interpretation of the Bill.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to be concerned about the probity and suitability of police support staff, and we share those concerns. However, those issues are already adequately covered and, in thanking him for giving us the opportunity to visit this matter, I respectfully ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I do not wish to labour the matter, because it seems that the Under-Secretary is correct in identifying the current existence of the rules governing the employment of support staff in Northern Ireland; I would expect them to be the same for the rest of the United Kingdom. I am also satisfied that there are no special provisions in the rest of the United Kingdom of the kind that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone seeks to include, which specifically exclude such categories of people from employment.

<P>
However, the hon. Gentleman has an understandable point. The Committee has discussed the circumstances in which persons who have previously had terrorist convictions might find themselves playing some part in the administration of Northern Ireland. Particular reference was made to serving on boards. I have already expressed my views on that, and I shall not go into it in further detail. It is understandable that clarification should be sought in such circumstances as to the position in relation to police support staff.

<P>
The Under-Secretary made the interesting comment that any member of the police support staff who committed an offence would lose their job. I have no doubt that that would be the case. However, that neatly sidestepped the other question implicit in what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone was asking: what would be the position in terms of employing as support staff someone who had a previous conviction that he would have to declare because, by virtue of the provisions in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, it would not be considered spent for the purpose of working in police support?

<P>
The Under-Secretary has said nothing in Committee to suggest that the rules that will be applied in Northern Ireland will be any different from those applied in the rest of the United Kingdom. I have no idea whether there are police support staff working in England, Wales or Scotland who may, at some point in the distant past, have been given a conviction. That is quite possible. I can think of several respectable people in similar circumstances, including a friend who is a senior member of the civil service, who has a minor conviction for criminal damage dating from his days at university. Indeed, I may not have been 100 yards away from him at the time of the offence being committed. This is a pertinent issue. I assume that the same rules will apply and, as long as that is the case, we should stop worrying too much about this.

<P>
However, I understand the hon. Gentleman's fear that, as we move into uncharted waters, if we do not spell out absolutes-as the amendments seek to do-we will allow the Government to wave a magic wand to enable four convicted murderers to appear the following day as support staff in the Northern Ireland police service or the RUC, call it what you will.

<P>
The Minister cannot be specific, because exceptions can always be made for circumstances. Those who employ must make judgments, but the reassurance that the rules as applied elsewhere will be applied in Northern Ireland will go a long way towards providing reassurance that that is what the Government intend. I should be grateful if the Minister would amplify his comments to explain whether he might be in a position to provide that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman assists me in so far as he goes and I was interested to hear of his near brush with the law-

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I hasten to add that I played no part in the incident. Although the hon. Gentleman is subject to all the privileges of being in Committee, I can assure him that there is nothing that I need to reveal to the Committee that stands to my disadvantage in respect of the matter, but I remember it happening.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> They all say that, Mr. O'Hara.

<P>
I thought for a moment that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, like the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire earlier today, was going to reveal himself in his true criminal colours so that he would qualify for one of the political places on the Policing Board. Obviously, I have misunderstood.

<P>
The reality is that in explaining how things should be, the Minister alluded to custom and practice-those two words have surfaced a couple of times recently in Northern Ireland. We must consider the possibility that policing may become a devolved matter and that we may have a justice Minister who ignores custom and practice. That is already happening in Northern Ireland-for example, the normal courtesy of flying the flag on the Queen's birthday is being ignored. We cannot rely on custom and practice when it comes to law and order.

<P>
Ministers have admitted that the Bill arises from political pressures. I wish that it were different. I know that they do not like being reminded of that and I wish that the purpose of the Bill was law and order and protection of society. It is not. It is about political accommodation and, like the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, the Minister should take cognisance of my point about amendments No. 160A and 161A because, having listened to him, we probably need them in the Bill.

<P>
The Minister plucked from thin air the figure of 3,000 employees, of whom only three transferred civil servants are senior employees. He may know that, but I do not.

<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> You know now.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman is making an intervention, it should be from a standing position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Under-Secretary said that I know now. In that case, perhaps I should not refer him to subsection (7), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In this section and section 4 ``senior employee'' means an employee of such class or description as may be specified for the purposes of this section by the Board with the approval of the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not three out of 3,000; it is a moveable feast. Senior employees can be those on whom the board decides, with the approval of the Secretary of State.

<P>
I return to the dilemma that I faced in relation to subsection (4). I simply wanted to ensure that because he could not appoint or dismiss senior employees being drafted in from the civil service, the Chief Constable should be consulted. That is not unreasonable. If the Minister had accepted that simple point in the simple terms in which I initially expressed it, I would not have had to detain the Committee by going into more detail. The Minister can throw out figures such as three out of 3,000-it is all there in tablets of stone-but what about custom and practice? In the context of the real world that I live in, none of these matters are sufficiently certain or properly enshrined in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Let me deal first with the point that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield made about the checks that are necessary on a statutory basis. There are certainly proper safeguards; I quoted the relevant legislation earlier. All such employees are subject to character checks-that is, checks on any criminal convictions and security vetting. People have to undergo a high level of tests as part of the recruitment process.

<P>
Devolution and policing is not really a matter for us to discuss. If, at some point in the future, the criminal justice system passes over to a devolved Administration, the Ulster Unionist party would, in the right circumstances, probably welcome that. There is certainly a desire for that among many of the political parties. It would be the prerogative of that Administration, having acquired the necessary powers, to make changes to the arrangements.

<P>
The Committee should not formulate legislation on the basis that the criminal justice system may become a devolved matter, and that we should therefore try to circumscribe matters so that the Administration could not carry out the kinds of activities about which the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is concerned. The Administration could introduce their own Bill to achieve their aims, and the hon. Gentleman's colleagues in the Assembly could have their say on those proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I really should not rise to the bait. In a previous debate, the other Minister alluded to the possibility that one day there may be devolution, and built his case on that eventuality. There is no point in the Minister deploying that argument to answer points that have been put if the Under-Secretary then uses the opposite argument to say, ``It doesn't really matter. We will do it like this now and, if it is a hotchpotch, don't worry. When you get hold of it, you can make it better.'' We should be making it better now; we should be setting standards now; we should be trying to ensure that, however political its motivation, the Bill should contain safeguards that prevent two Sinn Fein Ministers being perverse-grossly perverse-on another issue about which he knows well.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I do not want to get into a debate about the merits or otherwise of the Sinn Fein Ministers who serve in the Executive. This is not the place for us to do that. The hon. Gentleman, for whom I have a great deal of affection and admiration, should not put words into my mouth. He is suggesting that I said something entirely different from what I did say. He says that I am defending an indefensible set of arrangements on the ground that, at some time in the future, it might become a devolved matter, and at that point the devolved Administration-the Assembly-can alter it. I did not say that. I said that, if it became a devolved matter and the Assembly wanted to do that, that would be its prerogative. We cannot sit here now anticipating the changes that it, and that includes the hon. Gentleman's party, might want to make in those circumstances. It would be crystal ball gazing of the most futile kind, and I do not want to go down that road. I am prepared to defend my arguments on different terms, but if the hon. Gentleman wants to trade blows on this issue, I am willing to do so. I am sure that he does not.

<P>
Amendment No. 159A requires the board to consult the Chief Constable when it appoints support staff under subsection (3), but subsection (5), as I said earlier, already gives the Chief Constable that power, and he exercises it on behalf of the board. Therefore, if we were to accept the amendment, we would require the Chief Constable to consult himself.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> No, no. Will the Under-Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman if he will let me-

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am on my feet. I will give way to the hon. Gentleman in a minute.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister is not giving way at this time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That would be the effect of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. I ask him to read through it and check it again. It would be a logical absurdity to ask somebody to make decisions and then to go away and consult themselves about the decisions that they have already taken.

<P>
I can see what the hon. Gentleman is driving at in principle, but, in drafting the amendment, he has not considered the other subsections of the clause that provide for the same to happen in different circumstances. The Chief Constable already has that power, and it would be absurd to require him to consult himself.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Under-Secretary is beginning seriously to confuse me. He had accepted that we were talking not about that which related to subsection (5)(b) but about that which related to subsection (5)(a), relating to senior employees, where the Chief Constable does not have the power to appoint or dismiss. The Under-Secretary knows that he does not have the power to appoint or dismiss senior civil service employees. That is why he said that there were only three out of 3,000. It does not matter what it is: he does not have that power. Therefore, the board, having that power exclusively vested in it, should, on that small issue, consult the Chief Constable.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been generous with the hon. Gentleman's interventions, which were rather lengthy. He has made his point, and I plead with him to keep his interventions reasonably short.

<P>
<H5>11 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If it seems that I am confusing the hon. Gentleman, I apologise, but the confusion lies with him. I was talking about amendment No. 159A, which is tabled in the hon. Gentleman's name, so he must have some knowledge of it. The amendment would require the board to consult the Chief Constable before exercising its power to appoint not senior staff, as he has just claimed, but police support staff, so my point was entirely valid.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> We dealt with the issue of senior staff a few moments ago. I realise that the hour is late, but if the hon. Gentleman is unable to appreciate the impact of his amendments, we shall have to have a vote, in which he will vote for amendments that do not meet his intentions. I am giving him clear advice, but he seems unwilling or unable to comprehend it.

<P>
I repeat that he must not put words in my mouth. I was talking about amendment No. 159A, rather than another amendment, but he chose to ignore-or neglected to acknowledge-that fact.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I am rather loath to join in this debate, and I shall be brief.

<P>
I am beginning to wonder how all these terrible people who will be seconded were able to get into the civil service undetected. [
Interruption.]

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I have no problem with giving way, but it is customary to wait until one has heard what a person has said before disagreeing with it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The trite remark by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh engendered some humour, but he forgets that it was a civil servant who set up Mr. McConnell, who was an assistant governor at the Maze prison, and had him murdered. If hon. Members find that amusing, I can assure them that it is not. Mr. McConnell was a friend of mine. There are terrorists in the civil service. Mr. Collins, who was himself murdered, was a terrorist working within the civil service. If the hon. Gentleman tries to decry that point, whether through triteness or humour, he does this Committee no service.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I would have liked to thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I understand his feelings on the matter, but surely the person to whom he refers was vetted by a Chief Constable. Surely people are not employed in such positions without a cursory glance first being given at their backgrounds. In all fields, there are always some people who get through the net, and perhaps that was the case in this regard. However, I have no doubt that a Chief Constable was asked to vet the person in question.

<P>
I would be a lot happier if I knew for sure what the hon. Gentleman was getting at, although I suspect that I do. [
Interruption.] I realise that I should not indulge sedentary interventions, Mr. O'Hara.

<P>
I begin to understand what he might be getting at, given his interest in devolution. The use of the phrase ``civilian support staff'' substantiates my suspicions. There is a difference between what I believe is his view and the real situation involving the Policing Board.

<P>
I would like to have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's position, even after his trite accusations. I hope that I have not made trite comments on this serious matter. It would be easier for all of us if he said exactly what he means. That would give us a clearer understanding of his position and-possibly-more sympathy with it. Until he does that, we can only surmise his view.

<P>
There is more to the amendments than appears at face value. The hon. Gentleman has not got round to making his point. It is not for me to make it for him-it is for me to understand it. If his suggestion is that closet members in the civil service are waiting for the Policing Board to be set up so that they can sabotage the dispensation, he stretches credibility incredibly. There will be problems if devolution comes. I can foresee many, but that is a different matter. I suspect I know what the hon. Gentleman's real view is-if so, no provision in the Bill could cater for it.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone seeking leave to withdraw the amendment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I thought that the Under-Secretary might want to speak. Although we are all tired, he does not appear to be able to understand my point-he grasps at it but lets it go. We are getting nowhere fast. It is a pity that he trips backwards and forwards and does not respond to the fact that a senior employee could be regarded as an employee of such class or description as may be specified. That is an abstract description of senior employees. If he had said that he would consider the matter-

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I have taken the trouble to check the situation. I have told the hon. Gentleman that we are talking about three grade 5 civil servants out of 3,000. Unless the Chief Constable or the board have peculiarly aggrandising qualities and there are significant expansions, only a tight group rather than scores of people will be involved. If the Chief Constable or the board began to try to increase that number significantly, we would have questions to ask. Certainly the public would want to ask questions if they thought that money that should be spent on policing was being spent on unnecessary administration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Under-Secretary still has not agreed to look at the definition. It is a red herring: he says that it is only three. Even if the number were increased to six, the principle is not established in the Bill, as I have asked for it to be. We all know that there is no point in my pushing the amendment to a vote at this time of night, but I shall not sit down conceding that the Under-Secretary is right on this point. He is visibly wrong.

<P>
While I shall seek the leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment instead of putting it to a vote, I do not concede the point. I am disappointed that the Under-Secretary, who is usually generous in the way in which he goes about his work and deals with those of us who represent Northern Ireland constituencies, has drifted from one point to another, backwards and forwards, until he has let slip the significant issue that I wish to deal with.

<P>
He may, on reflection, think better of it and return on Report with this gap closed. If he does, I shall be grateful to him, even belatedly.

<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Orders Nos. 68 and 89, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question agreed to.

<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 162A, in page 4, line 3, leave out from ``Board'' to end of line 4 and add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`may for the purposes of its functions provide and maintain buildings and equipment'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 163A, in page 4, line 10, after ``section'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, insofar as they relate to police purposes,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 164, in clause 6, page 4, line 19, leave out from ``land'' to end of line 20 and add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after consultation with the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 165, in clause 6, page 4, line 22, after ``compulsorily'', insert ``for police purposes''.

<P>
No. 166, in clause 9, page 6, line 9, leave out ``police purposes'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the purposes of its functions'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> These five amendments deal with the board's powers in relation to its own functions and to its functions in relation to the police. Section 5 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Subject to the following provisions of this section, the Police Authority may for the purposes of its functions provide and maintain buildings and equipment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Subject to the following provisions of this section, the powers of the Police authority under this section in so far as they relate to the provision or maintenance of buildings and equipment wholly or mainly for police purposes shall be exercised on behalf of and in the name of the Authority, by the Chief Constable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, only two years ago, the 1998 Act made a distinction between the authority's powers in relation to its own functions and to police functions.

<P>
In the Bill that distinction no longer holds. Subsection (1) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Board may provide and maintain buildings and equipment for police purposes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not, however, seem to cover the particular functions that relate specifically to the board itself. The amendment would make the provision state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Board may for the purposes of its functions provide and maintain buildings and equipment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such power is comparable to that which the authority exercised under the 1998 Act.

<P>
Amendment No. 163A deals with subsection (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The powers of the Board under this section shall be exercised, on behalf of and in the name of the Board, by the Chief Constable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To clarify that provision, the amendment would insert after the word ``section'' the term
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>insofar as they relate to police purposes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 164 would change clause 6(1), which deals with the acquirement of land and which currently states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Board may acquire, hold and dispose of land for police purposes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would ensure that land may be dealt with in that way only
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>after consultation with the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
instead of for police purposes.

<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We believe that the board should have power to acquire land compulsorily for police purposes, but we do not believe that it should have such power in relation to its specific functions and the needs that they involve, such as its buildings or its administration centre. Accordingly, amendment No. 165 would make clause 6(2) state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The power of the Board to acquire land includes power to acquire it compulsorily for police purposes in accordance with subsections (3) and (4).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That amendment also makes it clear that land can be obtained compulsorily only for police purposes. Amendment No. 166 seeks to clarify the board's own distinctive powers, as opposed to its powers for police purposes. It proposes the removal of the term ``police purposes'' from clause 9(1)(a) and the insertion of the term
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purposes of its functions<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in order to make the provision clear.

<P>
The amendments are necessary to clarify the Bill and I commend them to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Clauses 5, 6 and 9 to 11 deal with the financing and resourcing of policing. By and large, they reflect the provisions of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. It may help the Committee if I make a few general points before I deal with the amendments specifically, in order to aid its understanding of what the Bill is about.

<P>
The 1998 Act made important changes to the resourcing, financing and management of policing support functions. It placed management of service delivery in the hands of the Chief Constable and strategic direction and accountability in the hands of the authority. That remains Government policy. Indeed, paragraph 5.13 of the Patten report supported that approach. It said that the relationship between the police and the board should be one of a service provider and a regulator and that the previous arrangements, which conflated the two roles, were seriously flawed.

<P>
The Bill makes two significant changes to the 1998 Act. Both are designed to implement the Patten recommendations and to further the aims of Government policy. The first change relates to the way in which the Bill separates the roles of the board and the police. We tried to clarify the relationship between different legs of the tripartite relationship in the 1998 Act. Some people did not think that we succeeded in that, which is why we have returned to the issue. Clauses 5 to 11 deal only with police buildings, land, estimates, funds and accounts. Schedule 1 deals with the board's responsibility in respect of those matters. There is a clear separation. Amendments Nos. 162A, 163A, 165 and 166, which attempt to differentiate between the roles of the board and the police, are not required. I think that the amendments were spawned by a misunderstanding. The point of agreement is that we want to separate the responsibilities.

<P>
The second important change is to remove the Secretary of State's detailed controls over land, building and finance. The change, although not specifically mentioned by Patten, is in the spirit of the report and allows the board greater autonomy. It reflects allegations that the Bill transfers power from the police authority to the Chief Constable or Policing Board. The reverse is true. We want power to be allocated at the appropriate level.

<P>
Amendment No. 164 would reinstate one of the controls over land. I am at a bit of a loss. We were charged during debates on the Police Bill with giving too much power to the Secretary of State and insufficient responsibilities to the police authority. Hon. Members are reversing that argument by trying to give powers to the Secretary of State. There would also have to be unnecessary consultation with the Chief Constable who would have sought approval for the acquisition of land from the board in the first place. The amendment would impose another layer of consultation, which is undesirable.

<P>
I hope that I have explained the way in which we are trying to separate the responsibilities that were conflated. We want to make it clear when land, buildings and so on will fall directly within the board's responsibility and when they are acquired for policing purposes. We have tried to clarify the roles by expanding the principles argued by Patten.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am puzzled. The Minister suggested that the amendments would return a power-possibly a greater power-to the Secretary of State. That is not their purpose. The intention, certainly in amendment No. 162A, is to ensure that the board has the authority to provide and maintain buildings and equipment not solely for police purposes but for all its functions. I wonder what objection the Minister has to that.

<P>
Amendment No. 163A provides that the powers of the board shall be exercised on behalf of, and in the name of, the board by the Chief Constable, but only when the Chief Constable acts to acquire land or maintain buildings and equipment for police purposes. It does not cover all the functions of the board. Referring back to the 1998 Act, we are simply trying to ensure that responsibility is placed specifically rather than in general terms.

<P>
I accept the Minister's point that amendment No. 164 is unnecessary, in so far as clause 6(1) refers to the board acting in response to a request by the Chief Constable. However, nothing in the Bill suggests that that is the case. If the Bill stated that the board may acquire land for police purposes at the request of the Chief Constable, we would understand that security considerations pertaining to that specific piece of land had been taken into account. That is not stated in the Bill, but the Minister seems to suggest that we should somehow be able to deduce that that is the case. Will the Minister clarify that one way or the other, and will he do the same in relation to the other two amendments? I find it not a little strange-perhaps it is the hour of the evening-that the Minister is being dismissive when specific points need to be made in relation to each of the amendments. The practical aspects of acquiring land compulsorily and the vesting of land are matters that require considerable care. I ask the Minister to reconsider the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone. I see the validity of my hon. Friend's argument and I would be disappointed if the Minister failed to do the same.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's reply and took his point that there might be a separation of those matters in the Bill, with the board's powers in relation to non-policing purposes being defined elsewhere-I think he said that that was defined in schedule 1. Perhaps he could clarify exactly where that is defined so that we can be sure that that is the situation. If it is, I shall concede that the clarification that we have sought in the amendments has been fully answered.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am tempted to say, ``Trust me'', but I do not think it would get me very far. Paragraph 1(2) of schedule 1 provides that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Subject to the provisions of this Act, section 19 of the Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 shall apply to the Board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the power that enables them to do that. The best way to deal with the matter would be if we wrote to the hon. Gentlemen and to other members of the Committee, setting out what that means. I appreciate that the meaning of the provision is not clear from reading it. The hon. Gentlemen could have received advice, which would have drawn attention to the matter. It will also be known that we have offered access to the team advising Ministers; if hon. Members need clarification, they need only pick up the phone.

<P>
For ease of passage, we were right to lay out the matter, no doubt setting hon. Members' minds at rest. Criticisms about lack of clarity between the two separate functions-that required for policing purposes and that required for non-policing purposes-have been levelled in the past and have been dealt with in the Patten report. Separation has been made in the Bill to ensure clarity. The fact that clarity is still not manifest to all is a matter of regret. I hope that we can explain the point in a letter. I ask hon. Members to trust me on this. We have taken on board the issues that hon. Members have raised.

<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I do not doubt that we will obtain that clarification, which we welcome. The Minister will recognise that we did not see clarification in the clause, which seems to apply to every Act. We therefore look forward to clarification. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
No. 151, in page 7, line 13, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) The Board shall be responsible for carrying out audits of all aspects of police activity, and in exercising this function the Board will be empowered to investigate any aspect of police policies, procedures and practices as it deems necessary and will have access to any information which it requires including that which relates to expenditure of the police grant.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Dr. Tonge:</B> The group of amendments is intended to explore the relationship between the board and the Chief Constable. We have many concerns. The Bill states that the responsibility to keep records and to prepare accounts will move from the Policing Board to the Chief Constable. That, coupled with the fact that there is to be no statutory post of secretary or chief executive on the new board means that sub-accounting responsibility will move from the board to the Chief Constable. The transfer of responsibility is not in line with the position of police authorities in Great Britain and is a damaging blow to the credibility of the new Policing Board. Further, the proposal goes much further than Patten's proposals. There could be an extremely damaging effect on the authority's internal audit function, currently conducted by the authority, which should have been continued by the board.

<P>
If sub-accounting responsibility were removed from the board, there would be no requirement for it to have an internal audit service as specified by Government accounting rules. A crucial investigatory and oversight function would be removed from the board. The proposal also makes nonsense of clause 2, which states that the board will secure that the police force, the police support staff and traffic wardens are efficient and effective. It might be difficult for the board to ensure that the police are efficient and effective if it is not able to keep records and to prepare accounts for them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The amendments address the technical but important issues of police finance accounting and accrual. Most of them would take detailed financial management of the policing service out of the hands of the Chief Constable and put it into the hands of the board in the manner explained by the hon. Member for Richmond Park. Government policy is to place management of the policing service in the hands of the person who is most responsible for it-the Chief Constable. It is also Government policy to ensure that the police authority and the board regulate the police service and that they hold it to account and ensure that community consultation occurs. That is not to say that the authority and the board should not have powers to ensure proper financial accountability. The authority can exercise them, and the board will continue to have such a power, in line with Patten's recommendations.

<P>
One of the aims of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 was to separate out that responsibility. We had very detailed debates on the matter-[
Interruption.] A noise from my right has thrown me somewhat. We sought in the 1998 Act to achieve a separation of responsibility between the Chief Constable and the police authority. We took the view that it was important for the decision on the distribution of money to rest with the Chief Constable rather than with the policing authority, which should have a higher status and responsibility and not delve into the minutiae of financing. The person who was responsible for spending the money was the Chief Constable, who was in charge of the overall area. The police authority and now the Policing Board therefore have that responsibility of making the Chief Constable accountable.

<P>
That is what the Bill sets out to achieve, as did the 1998 Act. The amendments, however, seek to return us to different circumstances. I accept the argument that some of the provisions are not consistent with those that apply to the rest of the United Kingdom, but, as we keep saying, Northern Ireland is different. There is only one police authority or Policing Board in Northern Ireland and only one Chief Constable. That is not the case in England, Wales or Scotland. Different relationships exist in the tripartite structure that we are discussing. England and Wales have a clear procedure involving the Secretary of State and the dispersal of responsibility downwards. Northern Ireland, however, has a one-one-one relationship, which we have sought to clarify.

<P>
The amendments would not help to achieve the clarity of thought process that we sought to establish in the 1998 Act and which we have advanced in the Bill. I hope that the hon. Member for Richmond Park will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> Like many of our amendments, those selected in the group that is currently under consideration are designed to ensure full and faithful implementation of the Patten report. I know that their subject matter is dry, especially at this time on a rather dry evening, but its importance must be considered because of the huge policing budget.

<P>
Patten recommended many improvements to bring about greater financial accountability. His principal recommendation was to give the Policing Board a strong role on financial control and auditing. However, clause 11 transfers responsibility for keeping proper accounts from the Policing Board to the Chief Constable. With clause 26, it undercuts the current functions of the police authority on financial matters. Clause 11 goes beyond the enhanced role in ensuring financial accountability for the Chief Constable. In effect, it gives the Chief Constable the lead role and diminishes the powers of an already weak Policing Board. As such, it has been vigorously criticised by the police authority on the ground that under the new dispensation it will reduce the role of the police authority and the Policing Board.

<P>
Amendment No. 76, which I share with the Liberal Democrats, returns the function of keeping accounts to the Policing Board. That is in line with current arrangements under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. However, in recognition of the enhanced role that the Chief Constable is to have under Patten, amendment No. 132 would allow the board to delegate responsibility to the Chief Constable, subject to such conditions as the board might determine. I believe that that allows for a proper allocation of responsibility.

<P>
I note that the Liberal Democrats have proposed a similar wording in amendment No. 183, which has gained considerable support. Given that, I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 132 in favour of amendment No. 183.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Once again, I remind the hon. Gentleman that he has not moved the amendment, so he cannot withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank you for that advice, Mr. O'Hara; I am sure that it is correct.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I conclude by saying that I support amendments Nos. 150 and 184, which are consequential on amendments Nos. 76 and 183. I also support the Liberal Democrat amendment, No. 151, which clearly establishes the auditing role of the Policing Board and its related right of access to all information on financial matters held by the Chief Constable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> This is an old debate. In many ways, one wonders whether there will be a difference of opinion. It was clear from the way in which Patten addressed the issue that a detailed examination of it was needed.

<P>
I do not know whether the hon. Lady's amendments, which were supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh, drew on Patten or were the result of representations from the police authority. Neither of them is the fount of all wisdom and knowledge. We have to make a judgment. It may take some time to go through the detailed arguments set out in the Patten report, but it is worth alluding to it because it sets out why he alighted on his recommendations-and why we have remained faithful to it.

<P>
Paragraph 5.13 of the Patten report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Police Authority has also been hampered in its accountability function by having been responsible, until this year, for providing executive services to the police and managing more than three thousand civilian support staff working with the police. The combination of being at once part of the policing service and also required to monitor that service and hold the police to account was seriously flawed. As a result of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, the civilian staff have now been transferred to the Chief Constable's responsibility (from April 1999), but at the time of writing the complete separation of functions between the Police Authority and the police has not yet been achieved, and the relationship between the two bodies is still in some respects that between executive collaborators rather than one between a service provider and a regulator.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That refers to accountability and management function. Paragraph 5.21 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The police service in Northern Ireland costs the taxpayer more than £600 million per year. The size of this budget and the importance of getting good value for public money call both for good management within the police service and for close, expert scrutiny by those responsible for holding the police accountable. Neither of these requirements seems to us to have been adequately met.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
There was criticism of what we were trying to achieve. We have tried to clarify the matter, but the amendments would take us back to the previous position. Paragraphs 5.22 to 5.24, 6.46 and 6.47 explain the reasons for this part of the Bill.

<P>
<H5>11.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is good management practice for the Chief Constable to have responsibility for the budget. The Policing Board should be responsible for accountability and for ensuring that the Chief Constable discharges his duties properly. If the Policing Board becomes involved in the minutiae of the daily spend, it will no longer be on a higher level of authoritative judgment-making. The hon. Member for Richmond Park may want the Policing Board to enter the guts and the minutiae of police spending, but I do not believe that that is the purpose of the board or what Patten envisaged and I do not believe that it would be good management practice. Others may argue differently, but we are trying to be consistent with Patten.

<P>
<B>Dr. Tonge:</B> The intention was to try to separate the functions. The Chief Constable should be responsible for running the force and spending the money, but the Policing Board should have responsibility for overseeing that and auditing the accounts to ensure that they are in order.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The argument is there. At what level would the hon. Lady want the Policing Board not to be involved? We are discussing the overarching responsibility. Another party to the tripartite relationship is the Secretary of State, through whom the initial £600 million plus will go to the Policing Board for distribution. The Secretary of State must also ensure value for money. We need that detailed examination, but, at the end of the day, the Secretary of State is accountable to the House and to taxpayers.

<P>
We are discussing the separation of powers and the parties should carry out the functions for which they are best suited. The debate will continue because those who are appointed may want to take more power to themselves and away from others. Centralisation is not desirable and decision-making should remain close to the person with responsibility. The provisions were designed for that and underline the ethos of the devolution of powers. I thought that the hon. Lady's party supported the concept of devolution, but she seems to be backing the centralisation of power.

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Will my right hon. Friend give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I think that I may not have convinced my hon. Friend of the merits of my argument. If the debate continues, he may have an opportunity to contribute to it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I agree with this part of the Bill. When one is operating a body such as the police, there is nothing worse than not to have control over money and to have to get approval for all expenditure. An analogy can be drawn with the education system, in that schools have a certain amount of leeway in terms of spending money, but the board actually spends it. The whole situation is unsatisfactory.

<P>
In this instance, the Bill gets the balance right. The Policing Board and the Secretary of State should have that auditing role to ensure that the money is spent wisely and properly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> This important clause establishes district policing partnerships. Will the Minister clarify whether, under subsection (4), there will be one district policing partnership for each local government area, and whether that will include Belfast city council?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Patten refers to four substructures within the city of Belfast. We are considering whether it is desirable for the Bill to take account of that aspect of the report. The main part of the hon. Gentleman's question concerned whether there is one DPP per local authority. The answer is yes. The way in which the Bill is drafted is not wholly consistent with Patten in that regard, and we are considering the matter in the light of representations. If the Government decide to amend the Bill accordingly, we shall do so on Report.

<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

Amendment proposed: No. 168, in page 47, line 36, after ``expires'', leave out ``or who has resigned''.-[Mr. Thompson.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 169, in page 47, line 37, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) A political member who has resigned shall not be eligible for re-appointment until after a period of 1 year from the date of his resignation'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 171, in page 48, line 2, leave out ``council'' and insert ``Board''.

<P>
No. 172, in page 48, line 4, leave out ``or who has resigned''.

<P>
No. 173, in page 48, line 5, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) An independent member who has resigned shall not be eligible for re-appointment until after a period of 1 year from the date of his resignation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Amendments Nos. 168, 169, 172 and 173 in the names of the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone are similar to those tabled in relation to the Policing Board. They would limit the discretion of the council and the board by making them unable to reappoint a political or independent member who has had to resign, perhaps for personal reasons, until a year has expired.

<P>
As I said in the debate on the Policing Board, the amendments seem reasonable, but their consequences are not. They would not allow for a person to resign for perfectly good reasons, although with perhaps only a temporary application, and they would render him ineligible for reappointment until a year had passed. Furthermore, if the resignation ocurred in the last year of a district council, he would not be able to reapply. We established in our earlier debates on the Policing Board that such a restriction was unreasonable and unnecessary. Therefore, I ask the hon. Members not to press those amendments.

<P>
Amendment No. 171, as with later amendments, seeks to excise councils from the appointment process for independents to district policing partnerships. Concern was expressed during the consultation process on the Patten report, and we tried to take it into account when the Bill was drafted. We are satisfied that appropriate and sensible precautions and safeguards are in place. Before setting them out, I want to make it clear that the fundamental issue at stake, and the principal reason why I hope the Committee will resist the amendments, is that they seek to cut councils out of the appointment arrangements. I want councils to be involved in the process, as Patten wanted. I find it strange that although the amendments seek the appointment of local people, they cut out of the process local councillors-those who are elected to represent the area.

<P>
The Government have included a number of important safeguards in the appointments process, which I hope will reassure the hon. Member for West Tyrone. First, the Secretary of State will issue a code of practice on the appointment of independents, which will promote best practice. It will be based on the guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. While candidates should be representative of their area, we expect appointments to be made on merit. Advertisements will be open and interview panels will include one or two independent members.

<P>
Secondly, a significant safeguard is provided by the Policing Board. Councils must nominate twice as many candidates as the number of independents to be appointed. The final decision rests with the Policing Board. Patten recommended the agreement of the board, but we have provided for it to make the appointments. That approach is favoured by the Police Authority for Northern Ireland and should help to ensure consistency of approach across DPPs.

<P>
The third safeguard is clause 14, which enables the Secretary of State to intervene where a council does not adhere to the appointments process. He can direct the council to comply and, if it does not, can ask the board to override the DPP.

<P>
Given those safeguards, together with the functions of the district policing partnerships and the Chief Constable's operational independence. I hope that the hon. Member for West Tyrone will be assured that councils should retain the role in the appointments process that the Bill maps out for them. Given the safeguards that exist, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Amendment No. 168 deals with councils' appointments of members, and seeks to ensure that a member who resigns cannot be re-appointed within one year. Amendment No. 171 would require an independent member to give notice in writing to the Policing Board rather than to the council if he wished to resign.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Although the hon. Gentleman's amendments apply to different bodies, they seek to impose precisely the same limitations that we discussed earlier in relation to the board. He appeared to be convinced by the earlier arguments, and as we have just made the same case against these amendments, perhaps he will feel it appropriate not to pursue them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> We were not convinced by the arguments put forward by hon. Members relating to the Board. The amendments would have the same effect on proposals for the district policing partnerships. I understand from what the Under-Secretary has said that the Government will not concede the issue, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
