							<b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): I welcome you back to the
Chair, Sir John. I am sure that the Minister recalls exactly what I was
saying when I had to call a halt to my remarks this morning. To recap
briefly, I am in favour of the levy in principle, but we need to know
far more about how it will work and how it will be negotiated. The
document that was handed to us does not fill in a great deal of detail.
I appreciate that there is a lot of negotiation and consultation to
come, but there is bound to be some dissatisfaction, given that the
provision will not be amendable and will instead be subject to the
affirmative resolution procedures for secondary legislation.</div>
					<a name="08013189000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
ensure that we are not jeopardising other calls on planning gain, for
want of a better phrase. We will return to that issue in our debates on
a later clause. I hope that the threat to impose a planning gain
supplement will recede into the background as we move towards a
satisfactory principle on which the levy could work. We had a
discussion earlier, prompted by the right hon. Member for Skipton and
Ripon, on whether it is a hypothecated tax. If one wanted to go
further, one could call it a tithe&#151;the taking of a percentage of
the increase from which developers benefit.</div>
					<a name="08013189000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key to this issue is that
we need more detail on the levy. We have the opportunity to debate what
little detail there is in subsequent clauses, and I look forward to
doing so. I hope that the process by which the levy is framed will be
an open one and that everyone will have an opportunity to comment, so
that what comes out the other end is workable and does not have
unfortunate consequences regarding communities&#146; aspirations for
their future development.</div>
					<a name="08013189000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000376"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (John Healey):
						</b> Welcome back
to the Chair, Sir John. You missed the wide-ranging debate that we had
this morning, before we even got to the clause stand part debate,
despite Mr. Illsley&#146;s best intentions to keep us in
order. Let me deal with the main points that have arisen. I am grateful
to the hon. Member for Beckenham for setting out clearly the
Conservative party&#146;s position on community infrastructure. The
hon. Member for North 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column596" />Column number: 596</div>Cornwall made it clear that the Liberal Democrats support the provision
in principle, and I welcome that. Both hon. Members added their general
support to the wide range of bodies that are interested in and support
a levy, while being anxious that we should get its design and
implementation right. I shall return to that point, because it is the
reason why we are tackling the legislation, implementation and
introduction of the levy as we
are.</div>
					<a name="08013189000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for North Cornwall stressed the importance of revenue from the levy
being additional. We have consistently stressed the importance of that
approach, which reflects the Government&#146;s intentions. He also
stressed the importance of sub-regions and referred to his experience
in Cornwall. He is right to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to
that point, which we will come to.</div>
					<a name="08013189000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Attercliffe queried why we were making the power one that
local planning authorities can, rather than should, choose to take
advantage of. He also expressed concern about infrastructure planning.
It has been established as Government policy, captured first in PPG12
and now in the draft PPS12, that local planning authorities should look
systematically at their infrastructure needs. Whatever the extent of
the formal incorporation of a community infrastructure levy process in
the local development plan framework, it provides a good basis
for ensuring that the preparation process and
introduction in those areas that want to take advantage of the powers
are
right.</div>
					<a name="08013189000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08013189000377"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Clive Betts</b> (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab):
I thank my hon. Friend for dealing with that issue.
What I was trying to get at was that sometimes, local authorities have
not used section 106 powers not because of a definite decision, but
because they do not get around to it or have not seen its importance,
and have not done what their neighbours have often done effectively. My
hon. Friend is right in saying that a local authority may choose not to
use CIL powers, but will it have to go through a local development
framework process of considering whether those powers would be
appropriate in view of the development needs of the area, and come to a
view that they would not be&#151;if that is the decision that they
eventually come to&#151;in a positive way and through a proper
process?</div>
					<a name="08013189000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000378"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> There will be a proper process for considering the
introduction and appropriate charging level of a CIL. Our starting
point and intention for when that seems possible and appropriate is to
link it into the local development planning process. We are discussing
that in detail with the interest groups, because the local development
planning process might not be quite flexible or adaptable enough if it
were the only route for a CIL. I shall come to that in a moment, and in
considering further
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08013189000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08013189000379"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con):
There might be a commercial development in part of a
city where a supplementary business rate had been agreed. To be
effective, there is likely to be a 10-year programme to raise funds for
the sort of projects in mind, which are also infrastructure projects.
Would such a new development 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 597</div>automatically become eligible for the supplementary business rate, its
not having existed, perhaps, when the decision was
taken?</div>
					<a name="08013189000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000380"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The right hon. Gentleman illustrates why we are
approaching the levy&#146;s development as we are. Within the
framework set out in the Bill, there will be much detailed examination
of how it might work in practice, and we must determine what the
regulatory framework should be. That is one question that might be
appropriate for that part of the
process.</div>
					<a name="08013189000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
our discussion this morning, the hon. Member for Beckenham said that
the Government seem to be&#151;she may even have said that the
Government are&#151;setting up the community infrastructure levy to
fail so that they can introduce the planning gain supplement. That is
completely ridiculous. Having led the Treasury&#146;s work on the
planning gain supplement for at least two years, I am conscious of the
concept&#146;s strengths and weaknesses, and of the concerns that
exist about that
proposal.</div>
					<a name="08013189000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
strongly of the view that the proposal to develop a community
infrastructure levy, as we are doing in the Bill, is a better approach.
It certainly has sufficiently widespread support to mean that we have a
good chance, if we get the details right, of introducing a measure that
could make a significant contribution to meeting the costs of some of
the infrastructure that we will need in almost all our local areas in
the coming years to support housing and economic growth and, therefore,
the prospects and prosperity of local
people.</div>
					<a name="08013189000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08013189000381"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Jacqui Lait</b> (Beckenham) (Con): I am grateful for that
assurance. Does it mean that, in the interest of speedily getting
through the remaining stages of the Bill, the Minister will accept all
our amendments that refer to land values, and particularly the
amendment that asks for repeal of the Planning-gain Supplement
(Preparations) Act 2007? If he will accept the spirit of those
amendments, I will happily not move them.</div>
					<a name="08013189000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000382"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> My starting point with all amendments tabled by
the hon. Lady, and her arguments, is not necessarily to say no but to
see whether they have any merit. Without wanting to raise expectations
or hopes too high, the answer is, &#147;Wait and
see&#148;&#151;on some of them, at
least.</div>
					<a name="08013189000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000383"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> The Minister mentioned housing growth. I believe
that I am right in saying that if there were a development of market
housing and social housing, the old section 106 agreement would
continue to exist in respect of the social housing. After all, that is
what has delivered more than 50 per cent. of social housing in this
country over the past few years. Presumably, the community
infrastructure levy would apply to market housing, and section 106
would apply to social housing, but no properties would be subject to a
double imposition. Is that the
case?</div>
					<a name="08013189000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000384"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Not precisely. We will get on to
social housing and the interplay between section 106 agreements and
what may be appropriate and allowable infrastructure to be funded
through a community infrastructure levy. Suffice it to say that our
intention and policy aim is to continue to have sufficient levels of
affordable housing, principally negotiated through section 106
agreements. However, it seems sensible to have a provision&#151;we
will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 598</div>discuss it on a later amendment&#151;such that, if we saw instead a
drop-off in the levels of investment and affordable social housing that
we need in almost every part of the country, we could at least make the
contribution to the funding of affordable housing an allowable element
for expenditure that may come from the levy
revenues.</div>
					<a name="08013189000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that I was making to the hon. Member for Beckenham was that this is not
the planning gain supplement by stealth. The community infrastructure
levy is different in principle, in design and in the purposes for which
it is being
raised.</div>
					<a name="08013189000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08013189000385"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): Further
to the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, I believe that
the hon. Member for North Cornwall referred to the Government&#146;s
menacing words about framework legislation for the planning gain
supplement remaining on the statute book and being used at some future
date. If they are doing something so radically different, what is the
point of keeping that measure in the background like a sword of
Damocles?</div>
					<a name="08013189000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000386"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> We are at risk of pre-empting a debate that we
will certainly have on one of the hon. Lady&#146;s amendments, but
just so the hon. Gentleman is clear, the legislation for planning gain
supplement that is on the statute book is not framework legislation. It
would not and could not allow the planning gain supplement to be
introduced. It is narrowly drawn paving legislation intended
specifically to allow Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and
other specified authorities the power to spend money in preparation for
a possible planning gain
supplement.</div>
					<a name="08013189000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the provision that is on the statute book. It has not been used, no
expenditure has been made under its provisions, and when I was the
Minister responsible for the Bill in question, I gave an undertaking
that such things would not happen unless a policy decision was taken to
go ahead with a planning gain supplement. I hope that that is helpful.
The hon. Gentleman was talking about its being a framework Bill, rather
as one might describe this legislation as being a framework Bill for a
community infrastructure levy, but, clearly, it is completely
different.</div>
					<a name="08013189000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
basis on which we proceed with the proposal for a levy is that the
industry has stated that it accepts the case and that it is willing to
make additional contributions for infrastructure. It supports the levy,
which builds, as many urged us to do, on the existing practice through
planning obligations under section 106
agreements.</div>
					<a name="08013189000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question is how best to do that; that is the nature of the discussion
that we are having about the Bill&#146;s provisions. Industry has
strongly backed that, as members of the Committee heard in the evidence
sessions. The framework in the Bill is designed to give us the powers
to introduce a levy, the detail and design of which, we propose and
have always proposed, will be set out in regulations. The hon. Member
for Beckenham described that as cavalier, but I would say that, on the
contrary, it is cautious and consultative. The British Property
Federation and the Home Builders Federation jointly said that they
welcomed the fact that the CIL clauses in the Bill are enabling
clauses, because that will provide the necessary flexibility to
implement the levy through regulations and guidance as its full details
are
developed.</div>
				
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column599" />Column number: 599</div>
					<a name="08013189000340"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08013189000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
precisely what we are doing and what we intend to do, and I want to
make it clear to the Committee that regulations to introduce a levy
under the provisions in the Bill will be subject, as clause 171 states,
to affirmative resolution. Therefore, the House will have the chance to
debate and scrutinise the proposals we intend to lay later, and those
regulations will be laid only after detailed, continuing discussions
with those with a direct interest and others and consultation on the
drafts of the
regulations.</div>
					<a name="08013189000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
with regard to timing, I say to the hon. Member for Beckenham, who
urges that the regulations should somehow be done and dusted and
available in draft by the time the Bill goes to the Lords, that we have
been consistent and clear from the start. I had hoped that publishing
the policy document on Thursday would have given her a chance to read
it over the weekend, as paragraph 83 of that document makes it clear
that we aim formally to consult on draft regulations this autumn with a
view to finalising them in spring 2009. Regulations will need to be
explicitly approved by the House of Commons before becoming law. I
commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

Betts:
						</b> I will not detain the Committee
too long, as this is a point of clarification to ensure that the
authority that can collect the levy is the planning authority. That is
useful with regard to any symmetry that we need to develop between the
LDF process and the CIL, notwithstanding the comments that the Minister
has just made about the consultation that is going on about how the two
relate to each other. However, there are also concerns within local
government and the Local Government Association that the primary body
must be the accountable and elected local planning authority for the
area. When Sir Simon Milton gave evidence to the Committee, he made the
point that local government in general was supportive of the
collaborative arrangements between local authorities when they would
come together to look at the infrastructure needs of a wider area, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column600" />Column number: 600</div>typically a city region. I have been a long-term supporter of the
concept of city regions and welcome the approach that the Government
have adopted of allowing the development of city regions to come about
organically, with local authorities determining the best way forward
for that area on a voluntary and collective basis.</div>
					<a name="08013189000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is still concern that at
some point the Government might decide that a city region authority,
rather than a local planning authority, could have the power to decide
on and collect the levy, which would be against the spirit of city
regions developing by collaboration and collective agreement and could
lead to some imposed organisation funding itself through the
levy.</div>
					<a name="08013189000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
concern is probably that, given a regional development
association&#146;s new strategic planning powers, it might be
possible at some stage that the Government will consider it as an
authority that could collect, or even determine, the levy for its area.
My amendment seeks to specify absolutely and clearly that the authority
in question is the local planning authority&#151;&#151;the local
elected body in the area. It should be responsible not merely for
planning policy, but also for the determination and collection of the
levy.</div>

							<a name="08013189000390"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> Welcome back, Sir John. I have great sympathy with
the proposal of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe. As he
succinctly put it at the end, we have always maintained that only
democratically accountable bodies that are capable of raising taxes
should be charging
bodies.</div>
					<a name="08013189000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we see from
the Government&#146;s new clause, they are hoping that RDAs will take
over responsibility for planning as well as housing and they will need
to fund those responsibilities. The concern is that the RDA could
insist on a charge that it would levy as part of the community
infrastructure levy, but it would not be democratically accountable to
the people from whom it is raising the money or to whom things will be
done.</div>
					<a name="08013189000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
592 would delete any body other than a local authority from the list of
charging authorities in the regulations, including the local planning
authority, which I think the Government try to define in Government
amendment No. 537. I will leave that to the Minister. The list goes on
to specify the Secretary of State, the Welsh Ministers, the Mayor of
London, and</div>
					<a name="08013189000064"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other
authority with responsibility for town and country
planning.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013189000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the RDAs are being given responsibility for planning under the
Government new clause, it leaves open the opportunity for them to
charge. It also leaves open that opportunity for the Mayor of London,
who, as we know, notoriously has control over the London Development
Agency on housing and planning under the Greater London Authority Act
2007, which we fought all the way through the Commons, will continue to
oppose and do so
here.</div>
					<a name="08013189000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may speak
on behalf of hon. Members from Wales on this side of the Committee, I
do not think that in principle they would wish Welsh Ministers to have
control over local authority expenditure in Wales. Empowering the
Secretary of State is possibly the most dangerous of all, because it
ties in with our concern, which has not been allayed by the
Minister&#146;s comment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 601</div>that, as he was responsible for the Planning-gain Supplement
(Preparations) Act 2007, he can say that there is no way that it will
ever be invoked. My view would be that if it remains on the statute
book, it can be invoked. It concerns a wider audience than Opposition
Members that the possibility is, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Newbury said, hanging like the sword of Damocles over the development
industry. The last thing that we want is the Secretary of State being
able to get their hands on the community infrastructure levy and
dictate what it should be and to whom. Therefore, we strongly wish to
see that only local authorities should have the power to charge. That
is not to say that they cannot work at sub-regional level, or that they
cannot cross local authority boundaries, which more and more local
authorities are willing and wishing to do, so that they can develop in
a way that suits all their communities, but only the local authority
should be the charging body, and no other body should be able to levy
the charge.</div>

							<a name="08013189000391"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady
and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe for raising this issue
because it will concern a lot of people, particularly with regard to
the regional development authorities. Does she think that local
authorities will have the power, if they are making the charge, to
spend it or to hand it over to other bodies? Earlier, I raised the
question of health facilities, which would be provided by the PCT or
the strategic health authority. The concern is that there would be a
desire in the community for a health facility, but the only people who
could charge the money would be the local authorities. Do they have the
power to hand over that
money?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000392"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> It is not for me to interpret the non-existent rules
and regulations for the community infrastructure levy or even the
guidance, sparse as it is. However, as I understand it more and more
local authorities are working closely with the health authorities, the
police and a range of other bodies to come to a coherent view on what
is required within their communities. That is certainly developing in
the outer-London suburbs and I hope that it is the same in Cornwall.
Provided that that situation remains robust, there is no reason why the
local authority cannot be the agreed charging authority on behalf of
all those who are looking towards the community infrastructure
developments.</div>
					<a name="08013189000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
situation would apply for a jointly agreed road. I will cite the
example of a road going from Bexhill to Hastings, which involves Rother
district council, Hastings borough council, East Sussex county council
and even the South East England Development Agency. The local county
council will build the road and will be tolling it. That is already
working on a property basis and there is no reason why it should not.
That should free up the sort of housing that the Minister wishes to
see.</div>
					<a name="08013189000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis,
when we get to it, I would like to press amendment No.
592.</div>

Curry:
						</b> I am still confused about who does what in all of
this. There is such a thing as a charging authority. In my
constituency, Harrogate council and Craven council are the charging
authorities, but there is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column602" />Column number: 602</div>a whole raft of precepting authorities, of which the county council
accounts for the biggest chunk of the council tax bills. There are also
the police, fire services and flood defence agencies, so a string of
people have the right of precept. What will happen in practice? Even if
it is called by another name, will other authorities be able to precept
the levy?</div>
					<a name="08013189000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
levy be an accumulation of the needs of different authorities? After
all, if a housing estate is built in some parts of the world, issues
such as refuse collection will fall on one tier of local authority and
other issues, such as highways and schooling, will fall on a different
tier. Will that be worked out by an informal agreement, or is there
some mechanism by which costs will be apportioned to permit
precepting?</div>
					<a name="08013189000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">What will
be the role of organisations like development corporations? Just as a
detail, does the Olympic delivery body have the right to precept or
levy the charge? The biggest development in the country is probably the
Olympic development in the east end of London. I guess that Hackney is
the lead authority on
that.</div>

I am that my constituency is 250 miles north of London. The second is
that if the Conservative candidate were to win the mayoral election, it
would be regarded as a victory by both sides of the House. I would like
the Minister to clarify some of these matters. He says it is a
framework Bill, but it is difficult but it is difficult to understand
that until we know what is to happen inside it. The detail is
everything in this sort of legislation. In the case of a project that
makes calls upon infrastructure for which different bodies are
currently responsible, is there a precepting mechanism
for the allocation of that, or is it done by
collaboration? It sounds like a tedious, bureaucratic question, but
tedious bureaucracy lies at the heart of many of the things we have to
deal
with.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): I add
my voice to the note of concern raised by the hon. Member for
Sheffield, Attercliffe and my right hon. and hon. Friends. According to
subsection (2), one of the potential charging authorities is the Welsh
Ministers. The Welsh Ministers are a very acquisitive bunch of people.
They are acquisitive both in terms of legislative competence&#151;we
shall shortly debate potential framework powers to give them
legislative power in this area&#151; and finance. The Local Transport
Bill, which is before Parliament, seeks to give them the right to
impose road charges on trunk roads in England and Wales. When I see the
Welsh Ministers are a potential charging authority, I immediately react
with alarm.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 603</div>
					<a name="08013189000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also concerned that the
clauses relating to the application of the proceeds of any levy are
very widely drawn. I am worried that a CIL charge, referable to a
project in my constituency of Clwyd, West, could find itself being
applied to a project in Cardiff, or even Cardiff, South and Penarth.
That is not the sort of result that I would be keen to see but it seems
to be a consequence of the very wide terms in which the application
powers in the clause are
drawn.</div>
					<a name="08013189000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek
reassurance from the Minister that if the Welsh Ministers were indeed
to be the charging authority in respect of any CIL charged in Wales,
they would be obliged to apply the proceeds of that levy to the local
authority area in respect of which it is referable. The Minister said
this morning that this was an important power that the Government
intend to put in the hands of local planning authorities. I seek
reassurance that that power will remain with the relevant local
planning authority and not disappear into the coffers of Cardiff
bay.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000398"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Perhaps we can start at the starting point. There
is wide recognition that the sort of infrastructure that we shall look
to this levy to help support and fund can often be outside the local
authority&#146;s boundaries. That infrastructure can be just as
critical to the potential growth and prosperity as infrastructure
within those boundaries and in some cases can relate to the specific
development
site.</div>

							<b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I
endorse entirely what my hon. Friend is saying. It makes the reference
to Cardiff, South and Penarth a few moments ago quite appropriate. The
impact on traffication and access to rail services as a result of the
development in the Sport City in Cardiff bay has serious implications
for the traffication in the Vale of Glamorgan council area. Indeed, one
of the strengths of the recent arrangements is that payments from the
Cardiff Bay development were applied to
it.</div>

which often come up with new, ground-breaking terms.
&#147;Traffication&#148;, which my right hon. Friend has just
introduced into our debate, is one that I will treasure and savour. I
may even find an opportunity to use it at a later stage if I can find
an appropriate way of doing so.</div>
					<a name="08013189000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The starkest
example of the argument was made by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes,
South-West (Dr. Starkey), the Chair of the Select Committee on
Communities and Local Government, which shadows the work of the
Department. On Second Reading, the hon. Lady pointed out the importance
of junction 13 on the M1 to Milton Keynes. As she said, the junction is
critical to the future success and growth of Milton Keynes, but it is
in a different local authority area, a different county and a different
region, hence the argument for having a system that is capable, in the
right circumstances 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column604" />Column number: 604</div>and in the right way, of delivering a portion of the levy that can
support such infrastructure. That is what the provisions in this part
of the Bill are designed to do, as our policy document, which was
published last week, set out
clearly.</div>
					<a name="08013189000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000402"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> The Minister for Local Government and his fellow
Ministers regularly say that they want to devolve powers to local
authorities. If that junction on the M1 is so important, the local
authorities will be well aware of it. Why will the Minister not allow
the local authorities to come together across county boundaries and
artificial regional boundaries to decide themselves what they want to
do and let them get on with it? Why does he not trust
them?</div>
					<a name="08013189000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000403"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Indeed we do. We are giving them the power
to choose to introduce a community infrastructure levy and the
potential to collaborate and pool some of the proceeds of it from their
areas. That is our starting point and the main basis of the Bill.
However, there may be circumstances in which that approach will not
work and in which there is a stronger case for having a community
infrastructure levy at a regional or sub-regional level, and the
amendments provide the means to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08013189000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is precisely that tricky territory that we are discussing in detail at
the moment. We are consulting on how best to ensure that we have a
community infrastructure levy regime that could be used in such
circumstances to support the infrastructure. It is important to retain
the flexibility that is set out in clause 164(2) to allow that to be
done.</div>
					<a name="08013189000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
592 seems designed simply to prevent the Mayor of London becoming a
charging authority and being able to impose a community infrastructure
levy. I am not sure whether the hon. Lady consulted the hon. Member for
Henley (Mr. Johnson) about removing that power, and I do not
know whether she is aware that, were she to do so, she would create a
&#163;300 million black hole in the potential finances of the
Crossrail scheme. The consequences of the hon. Lady&#146;s pressing
her amendment to a Division could be much wider than she might realise,
and it would rule out the possibility of an important element of
Crossrail funding.</div>
					<a name="08013189000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady gave us the
lovely image of the Mayor of London taxing to infinity to support the

and beyond.&#148; The hon. Lady may not have children as young as
mine and those of some of my hon. Friends and she may not know that
that was a reference to Buzz Lightyear. I thought at the time that

					<a name="08013189000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister referred to the Mayor of London&#146;s plans and to
Crossrail. Nothing under our amendment would prevent the London
boroughs through which Crossrail will run from levying the community
infrastructure levy and entering into an agreement with Transport for
London or the Mayor as to any apportionment between them. That works
frequently under section 106 agreements. Does he accept that it is a
bit of a red herring to raise the loss of Crossrail? Will he also find
time to read the very interesting remarks made by the hon. Member for
Henley, in which he talks about his determination to work as a partner
of the boroughs, rather than in confrontation with them? That approach
would fit exactly with the proposition that we
make.</div>

so.</div>
					<a name="08013189000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 37 and 592 would prevent other bodies that have town and country
planning responsibilities from being empowered to charge the levy. That
would remove the flexibility that we think will be important to
encompass possible future changes to planning responsibilities. For
example, we are consulting with interested parties about whether the
IPC should be able to charge the levy for nationally significant
infrastructure projects. I stress that clause 164(2)(e) will not permit
the Secretary of State to make regulations empowering regional
development agencies to become CIL authorities, which the hon. Member
for Beckenham was very exercised about. That is because they currently
have no responsibilities for town and country
planning.</div>

							<a name="08013189000409"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> I thought that we had finished discussing the IPC a
little while ago. I had not realised that it might be a taxing
authority. The Minister has just told us that the IPC might raise the
levy. Should we not have been discussing that when dealing with the
IPC? It is a rather big
afterthought.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000410"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> It is not an afterthought at all. I am making the
case for the flexibility that we propose in the Bill for decisions that
we will take, after the required discussions and consultations, over
which authorities should be appropriate planning authorities. Those
will be set out in regulations and will be subject to the established
scrutiny and debate process through the affirmative resolution
procedure of this
House.</div>
					<a name="08013189000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to deal
with the question of the regional development agencies and to reassure
the hon. Member for Beckenham as far as I can. Because of the
amendments that we propose to make to the Bill, it may be that in
future an RDA could take on some of the planning functions that are
currently carried out by regional assemblies. Subsection (2)(e)
gives a discretionary power for the Secretary of State&#151;it is
discretionary rather than a requirement&#151;to
make</div>
					<a name="08013189000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other authority
with responsibility for town and country
planning&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013189000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">a charging
authority. That could not apply to RDAs at present. It could apply to
them in a region where there is an agreement between an assembly and an
RDA for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column606" />Column number: 606</div>the RDA to take on some of the planning functions, as we have proposed
in a new clause. We have no intention of empowering regional planning
bodies, whether in their current form or as regional development
agencies, as CIL charging
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08013189000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 438 would also prevent the regulations from permitting or requiring
charging authorities to act jointly. We need the regulations to be able
to enable or require authorities to act as a charging authority as if
they were one body, without being challenged for acting under the
dictation of another, or for fettering their discretion. For instance,
if local planning authorities have developed joint core strategies, it
may make sense for them to be joint charging authorities for the
purpose of the CIL. I would have thought that the hon. Member for
Beckenham and her right hon. and hon. Friends would be looking to
encourage that sort of thing, rather than prevent
it.</div>

					<a name="08013189000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment No. 438 appears to remove the possibility that the
regulations could allow a different approach to deciding on the
charging authority in different cases or circumstances. Given that not
all areas are the same, administratively, geographically, or
economically, a certain degree of flexibility seems reasonable and
justified. That is why Government amendment No. 537 enables regulations
to empower certain local authorities that are not local planning
authorities to charge the community infrastructure levy. In that
instance, we are responding to concerns that have been raised with us
by bodies that might come into that category, such as national park
authorities.</div>

							<a name="08013189000411"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I do not know the answer to the question that I
asked the hon. Member for Beckenham earlier on, but the Minister may be
able to provide it, as it is a crucial question for me. Under section
106 agreements currently, are the moneys collected by the local
authority, then handed over to other service providers, such as those
for health? That is only an example; there may be other key areas that
it wishes to fund. Or are those side agreements brokered as part of the
section 106 process by the local
authority?</div>
					<a name="08013189000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is
felt necessary to set down in the Bill exactly which authorities can
have a call on that money, and if some authorities that are not
planning authorities, such as primary care trusts, are not specified,
does the local authority have the power to hand money over to them as
opposed to brokering an agreement whereby the developer pays the money
straight to the PCT? I appreciate that that may be a technical
question. Health facilities are mentioned in the document that has been
published so far, so I am assuming that local authorities are able to
do that. I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that that was
the case.</div>

not with the provisions of the Bill but with the operation of section

to do as the hon. Gentleman suggests. I will check that matter out and,
if I need to, I will contact him further about
it.</div>

the matter of the sub-regional arrangements, along with the LGA, my
feeling is that charging authorities should come together as a planning

said that, essentially, the powers in amendment No. 164 are
discretionary for the Secretary of State, and that there will be
ongoing discussions with the LGA and other interested parties to find
the most appropriate way to achieve those objectives. On the basis of

Rogerson:
						</b> We have discussed the issue of rising land
values a little so far. Indeed, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant
Conwy mentioned the issue of capital gains tax and we explored the fact
that there might be issues that increase land value other than the
planning permission being granted at that point, such as the gradual
increase over time. I am hoping to probe the Minister&#146;s view on
that issue.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column608" />Column number: 608</div>
					<a name="08013189000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">When one talks to the volume
house builders, they all claim that land banking does not occur and
that it would not be in their interests because it would be terrible
for them to take on land and leave it sitting when they could be
building houses on it. However, anecdotally, one hears of areas of land
on which builders not only have an option but have bought up and have
planning permission for but which has not been built on for some time.
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned an area in his
constituency where planning permission had been granted but that had
held back other development because it met the demonstrated need in the
area, even though the properties were not built for a number of
years.</div>
					<a name="08013189000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the level
of CIL and its implications are determined in any way according to the
land value at the time when planning permission is granted and the
development does not subsequently occur for some time, my concern is
that that could be an incentive to get that CIL agreement early, even
though costs will rise in the future. There might be a concern that
that the costs will be higher later, when builders seek to carry out
the development, and smaller developers will not want to incur the cost
earlier on, but will want to do so at the time when they are getting
the return on the investment. However, that might not be an issue for
bigger developers who decide that they can carry the cost as part of
their overall financial management and would rather take the cost of
the CIL earlier. A later increase in land value would mean that the
cost of the CIL could be higher, but they will not have to worry about
it because they will have paid it at a lower rate. The purpose of the
amendment is to see whether the Minister has considered that
possibility and thinks that it should be taken account
of.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000433"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I seek some information from the Minister. Much of
the levy appears to be based on the fact that land values will continue
to increase, but they may at least mark time and could go down. If land
values go down, I wonder whether the levy will go down, how flexible it
is and whether the Minister has done any modelling&#151;I use the
word advisedly&#151;to see how effective a levy would be if the land
values and the value of the development went
down.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000434"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The developers say that they want certainty about
how much will be payable. They want that before they start development.
They want that as far as possible while they are arranging their
financing. That is why they are keen, as we are, to see the CIL set out
in a charging schedule rather than calculated on a site-by-site basis
as in the previous proposal for a planning gain supplement. So they
want certainty about how much is payable. They want the certainty
before they commence the development or arrange the financing. That is
often only possible after the grant of the permission. We are linking
the levy to the planning permission.</div>
					<a name="08013189000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the hon. Member for
North Cornwall, under town and country planning provisions, planning
permission is generally limited to three years, unless the development
is then commenced. We are not talking about an infinite period. There
is also provision, and we are looking at the appropriate way to do
this, for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column609" />Column number: 609</div>indexing a charging schedule. Were that indexing or some form of
buoyancy to be attached to the charging schedule over time, it is
certainly conceivable, were the market or inflation to go down, for it
to be reflected in that way. As the hon. Lady will appreciate from the
provisions in the Bill, these are areas of quite fine detail. We are
looking at them closely at the moment. They will develop as we find a
sensible way forward when we have had the chance to discuss this in
detail with those who have an interest in the
provisions.</div>

Rogerson:
						</b> I was interested to hear what the Minister had
to say about indexing. We have discovered a little bit more about the
proposals that are under discussion so it is all part of the ongoing
revelation of how the levy can work. On the question of planning
permission being valid for only three years, the case that was brought
to our attention by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy was on
the basis that enough development had occurred to allow the planning
permission to remain live, even though the rest of the development was
halted. I accept that that is a rare case. My concern was that in terms
of financial considerations over the levy, it does not provide any form
of incentive for that sort of thing to happen further. I am grateful to
the Minister for his response. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08013189000438"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> This is a probing amendment. I understand that the
Minister will be reluctant to agree categories of exemptions from CIL.
Indeed, it was interesting that during our hearings into the planning
gains supplement, although probably not agreeing with the details and
some of the complications of the PGS, a number of organisations were
supportive of the idea of some form of charge being levied on those who
benefited from planning permission that allowed them to develop a
particular piece of land. At the same time, they were very much in
favour of exemption for themselves and similar organisations from such
charges. That is often the case with such
proposals.</div>
					<a name="08013189000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to tease out the possibility of the law of unintended consequences
applying to CIL and whether there might be one or two perverse
developments as a result. The issue was initially raised with me by
Network Rail, which, by definition, is a developer and maintainer of
infrastructure. As I understand it, because of the way CIL will be
constructed without any exemptions, it is entirely possible that when a
new railway is developed or an existing railway expanded, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column610" />Column number: 610</div>Network Rail could be charged for a CIL that contributes to improving
the road system in the area. With the Government policy of encouraging
the development of public transport, it would seem a little perverse if
the development of railways gave rise to extra funds to build new
roads. That is only an extreme example, but it is a
possibility.</div>
					<a name="08013189000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div>
					<a name="08013189000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue has also been raised by the National Housing Federation and the
Home Builders Federation. They asked whether a development by a housing
association, which by its very nature is not seeking to make profit out
of the development of land, will be subject to CIL. We are trying to
use section 106 to encourage the provision of more affordable housing,
but on the site next door there could be a housing association
development that has to pay CIL. That would reduce the resources that
the housing association has to provide social housing. Is there any
scope for Ministers to look at the unintended effects that CIL might
have in reducing the resources for the provision of social housing when
the general intention is that there should be a greater provision of
social housing through funds available from the benefits of
development?</div>
					<a name="08013189000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final issue goes a little further than the amendment, but is in the
same spirit. In a situation where a house builder wants to build a
private development, but negotiates a section 106 arrangement to build
a number of social housing units as part of it, will CIL be levied on
the social housing as well? In other words, will the developer be asked
to pay section 106 money on the social housing as well as the CIL,
particularly if CIL is a levy based on the roof tax, as in the Milton
Keynes
arrangement?</div>
					<a name="08013189000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are
interesting issues that probe the consequences, which might not be
intended, of what I think is the very good proposal of CIL. However, it
is one that we need to get right in detail, as the Minister has said
repeatedly.</div>
					<a name="08013189000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000439"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> Amendment No. 593 would go further than the
amendment No. 444 and would bring in another category for exemption. We
are seeking clarification from the Government on charities. All of us
as MPs and as subscribers to charities know how strongly they feel
about having to pay VAT, and one has a great deal of sympathy with that
view. They are asking whether they will also have to pay CIL, given
that many charities wish to make property
developments for things such as church halls, school halls, new houses
for their vicars and ministers, and community sports facilities.
Historically, charities have built many social housing developments, of
which there are a number in my
constituency.</div>
					<a name="08013189000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Charities
are rightly asking whether they will be asked to pay CIL when they are
using charitable money donated by the public that was not foreseen to
be used as a contribution towards infrastructure. Much of what the
charities will do in developing property will be to provide social
infrastructure out of their own pockets. It will be a double whammy for
anyone who contributes to charity fundraising. Again, it is another
consequence of sparse detail, and I hope that the Minister can reassure
the charities in the wider world, and me.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column611" />Column number: 611</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000440"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> For reasons that I will explain in a moment, I
cannot give the hon. Lady the reassurance that she thinks she wants.
She says that she supports the levy in principle, and I therefore
encourage her to reflect on its purpose and the justification for it,
which is that the basic goal of a community infrastructure levy is for
every development to pay a fair share towards the infrastructure that
may be required in the area in which it is located. At this stage of
our thinking, we believe it is right that most types of development are
liable to pay a levy, subject to what is a low, but important, de
minimis threshold, because almost all development has some impact on
the need for infrastructure, services and amenities.</div>
					<a name="08013189000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current system of planning
obligations does not have any automatic exemptions for a specific type
of developer or development. That reflects a planning system that is
blind to what developers do with their profits or to whether a
developer is also a registered charity, because it is irrelevant to the
impact of their development on the local community.</div>
					<a name="08013189000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The range of
interests and representative organisations that believe they have a
special case for an exemption is much wider than Network Rail, housing
associations and registered charities. That is not surprising;
virtually everyone feels that they have a case for the levy not
applying to them. However, at some stage this year, when we have been
able to discuss the matter in more detail&#151;it will be the basis
for a public consultation&#151;we will set out our approach to
exemptions. In doing so, we will ensure that any potential
qualification for exemption must be fair and justified and refer to an
objective set of criteria or there may, at least, be a risk of falling
foul of state aid
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08013189000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
reassure the hon. Lady that we will discuss in detail with charities
and others&#151;that includes those that have already approached us
or those she might wish to point in my direction&#151;whether they
could qualify for an exemption from the levy. Our approach is linked to
the purpose of CIL and our starting point is that the large majority of
developments, irrespective of the developer, should justifiably be
liable to pay the
levy.</div>
					<a name="08013189000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000441"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I am slightly concerned and I hope that the Minister
takes this on board. Let us suppose that a new faith school is needed,
the community recognises that need, the school is built, property
prices in the area go up and so do the number of cars that go to that
school. If the faith organisation involved in building the school
worked with the local authority through the local development framework
and was a recipient of the community infrastructure levy, would that
organisation also have to pay the
levy?</div>
					<a name="08013189000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000442"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I hoped that that was clear from what I said
earlier. I cannot give the hon. Lady a categorical answer to a
&#147;What if?&#148;
situation.</div>
					<a name="08013189000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
principal starting point is that almost all developments will have some
imposition and impact on the need for associated or related
infrastructure in the area, and some call on the services or amenities.
Our rationale for the basic goal of the levy is that every development
should pay a fair contribution towards those costs. If we are to
consider any categories for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column612" />Column number: 612</div>exemption, we must do so carefully and with sound debate, as they would
have to be in keeping with the purposes that we have set out for the
levy.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000443"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> Again, we have returned to the Minister saying that
there are further discussions to be had. I generally accept his premise
that the presumption is that everyone will pay a levy unless there is a
good reason for a particular type of organisation not to. However, I
still think that there is a discussion to be had about the effect on
social housing in particular. He has said that concerned organisations
that have approached the Department, or which do so in the near future,
will be party to the discussions, without any promises as to their
outcome. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendments.</div>

of my comments about whether it is the regional development strategy or

infrastructure levy is not used to replace spending that should come
legitimately from bodies outside the local region and is not spent on
projects that are not local. If he can reassure us on that, I will be
happy to withdraw the amendment. It is designed to get an assurance on

we have been consistently clear that the purpose, intent and effect of
the levy will be to raise funding that is additional to what the

the document is clear about that. Secondly, it will be done
specifically to support infrastructure and is not, as she put it, for

						</b> Government amendment No. 540
will ensure that CIL regulations can make provision for liability to
arise in relation to general consents, such as those granted by local
development orders under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
Essentially, we are seeking for development permitted under such orders
also to be able to pay the levy, because such development could clearly
give rise to infrastructure but would automatically be exempt without
the amendment.</div>

amount of CIL to be paid is correctly calculated with reference to the
scheme that is permitted. I hope that that is

							<a name="08013189000452"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I hope that I will not detain the Committee for
long. Some questions arise on the clause as a whole. We dealt with it
in small pieces, but there is the bigger picture. Could the Minister
enlighten us on the question of liability to pay? Precisely what size
of development does he think should be liable for the charge? There was
some merriment earlier when I referred to building a retirement house
in the garden. Would that one house be liable? Would a farmer who has
permitted development rights be liable to pay CIL if he wanted to
change his buildings and processes?</div>
					<a name="08013189000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was also a reference to
Network Rail. Most of the infrastructure developers have put forward
very eloquent pleas not to be liable for CIL. I can understand that
liability where they are building the actual development, but
associated developments might be opened up to it because of the
infrastructure development. Would there be a difference between the
infrastructure provided and the potential opened up by the fact that a
new road needs to go into a port or nuclear power station, or round a
generating station or grid provider? If land is opened up that belongs
to that infrastructure developer, would they be liable for CIL on that
land? Would the developer of the land opened up be liable because, say,
a road has gone in? Could the Minister enlighten us on those broader
questions?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000453"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Our starting point is that, as I
have said before, the liability for CIL should apply widely to almost
all developments, unless we become convinced that there is a strong
case for exemptions. We are looking at that and we will make decisions
and proposals later. But as we stated in paragraph 78 of the document
published last week, we do not want complexity for those very small
developments, so there will be a de minimis threshold. I said earlier
that it would be a low de minimis threshold but as the document states,
we do not intend the liability to arise in relation to householder
development by homeowners and, subject to further consultation, some
further permitted development, such as walls, roof extensions and so
on, might also not be liable for CIL.</div>

							<a name="08013189000454"></a>Mrs.

be liable for CIL if they build a room in the roof, but they would be
liable if the garden was big enough for them to build their retirement
home
in?</div>

introduce a low de minimis 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column615" />Column number: 615</div>threshold. Nevertheless, it will be a de minimis threshold below which

							<a name="08013189000460"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> There is nothing like being defeatist, but we are
unlikely to get very far with this issue. However, we believe that
local authorities should set the amount for the infrastructure levy,
not the Government. We are considerably concerned about how flexible it
will be. We have tabled that proposal in the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08013189000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see from
Government amendment No. 38 that the Minister and I are of one mind,
technically, although I suspect that we are coming at the issue from
different angles. I am therefore very interested to hear what his view
is. We are looking to take out the references to land value, as part of
our continuing campaign to ensure that the planning gain supplement
cannot be brought back in any way, shape or form. I cannot imagine that
the Minister will use that
argument.</div>
					<a name="08013189000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 600 would ensure that there is a right of appeal against the CIL.
Currently, that can be done through the planning appeals system and we
would like to hear whether the Government are prepared to incorporate
an appeals system that is part of a well-known process, such as the
planning appeals process. This point was put to us quite forcibly by
the Home Builders Federation, and I am sure that the Minister has also
heard its arguments. That is somewhat ironic because the Home Builders
Federation is one of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column616" />Column number: 616</div>organisations that succeeded in persuading the Government to go down
this route. If the Minister would clarify that point, I would be
grateful.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000461"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> I want to raise two issues: first, land values,
which is of great concern to me. There has rightly been a lot of
discussion in Committee of the fact that we have not received the
detail of the regulations, which will eventually determine whether, and
how well, CIL works.</div>
					<a name="08013189000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our very useful evidence
sessions we heard from a range of different organisations that will
ultimately be involved in the levy implementation: the British Property
Federation, the Home Builders Federation and the CBI, which represent
those who will have to pay it; and organisations such as the Royal Town
Planning Institute, whose members are likely to be involved in its
calculation and collection. One thread of concern that ran throughout
those sessions was the issue of valuation.</div>
					<a name="08013189000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Select Committee considered the planning gain supplement some time ago,
there was support for a mechanism to collect some of the private gain
that results from planning permission being given. But virtually every
organisation that gave evidence expressed concern about how it would
operate, especially on the issue of valuation. Both the evidence given
to the Select Committee and the Committee&#146;s report reflected
genuine concern about how the calculations would be done. The Committee
considered the options that had existed on land in the past and how
they would affect the calculations, but no one had an answer to how to
deal with the
issue.</div>
					<a name="08013189000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
proposals were introduced, the Minister said that we would proceed with
them, but that if someone had a better idea they could come forward
with it. Some organisations got together and suggested a planning
charge, which has become the community infrastructure levy. What drove
them was the wish to get away from trying to calculate increases in
value as a result of planning permission being granted on particular
sites.</div>
					<a name="08013189000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not a
valuer and I do not understand some of the complex issues that were
raised in the Select Committee, but what clearly emerged from the
evidence was that everyone was worried that the levy would become as
complicated as the planning gain supplement if the issue of value
remained. The intention of all those who proposed an alternative to the
planning gain supplement was to get away from the issue of value. Will
my hon. Friend the Minister therefore explain why it was essential to
include value when so many other variables can be used to determine a
levy at local level, although I agree that that can be done differently
by different authorities to reflect the needs of their areas in
different ways?</div>
					<a name="08013189000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is about locality, which may be covered by a Government
amendment. Another point that emerged in evidence was that what might
be appropriate in trying to raise a levy in one part of a local
authority area&#151;for example, an affluent suburb where there is a
new housing development&#151;might be a very different matter in,
say, a housing market renewal area. The local authority might try to
encourage developers into a renewal area with a view to uplifting the
general value 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column617" />Column number: 617</div>of housing, and it might be inappropriate to levy such developers at the
same level as those in a more affluent area. A local authority needs to
be able to vary the levy according to the locality in which the
development takes place. Government amendment No. 549, which
will</div>
					<a name="08013189000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;permit or require
charging schedules to operate by reference to the nature or existing
use of the place&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013189000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">would
allow that variation between different areas where development might
take place. Could my hon. Friend reassure me that that variability
between developments in very different areas will be possible under his
proposals?</div>
				
					<a name="08013189000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000462"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> On the question of value, to which we keep
returning, I am clear, as is the industry, that viability is a central
concern when setting the community infrastructure levy. It is a central
feature in the design of the system and has to be if we are concerned
that a levy might choke off development rather than support it.
Industry representatives and others, from the British Property
Federation to major developers, have told us what we believe to be the
case: that it is important to have some reference to value, and
therefore viability, in the Bill, and it is hard to see how any
assessment of viability can take place without some reference and
consideration to land value.</div>
					<a name="08013189000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in discussion with the
industry about whether a more appropriate indicator or a better
proxy&#151;my hon. Friend referred to this&#151;could be used for
the value that is created by development. As things stand, however, we
believe that it needs to be an element of the design of a charging
structure. For it to be capable of being taken into account, it needs
to be referred to, and that is why I continue to encourage members of
the Committee not to accept amendments that would knock it off the face
of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08013189000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to infrastructure planning, local authorities will need to
produce a draft charging schedule that sets out the rate, and perhaps
also the formula, for determining how the levy might be calculated in
their area. To answer my hon. Friend&#146;s second point, it is
conceivable, in the terms that we intend the levy, that if the
infrastructure requirements of different areas within the same local
authority boundaries require and justify a different levy charge, that
could be incorporated and reflected in the charging schedule.</div>
					<a name="08013189000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also made it clear that
the process of setting charges should ideally be embedded within the
development plan process, which is something that we will look to do
and that my hon. Friend is keen on. However, the process for setting
the community infrastructure levy must at the same time also be
flexible enough to respond to changing market conditions. While we are
clear that there needs to be a thorough and proper expert testing of
the charging schedule, I am keen to avoid a situation in which further
delays could be caused to local authorities bringing their development
plans up to date.</div>
					<a name="08013189000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is still a question that
we need to settle: whether incorporating the development of the
charging schedule entirely and solely within the development plan
process might be too slow and unresponsive to allow us to design it in
the way that we want. We are  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column618" />Column number: 618</div>clear, however, that it has to be plan-led and based on an
infrastructure plan, and that devising a charging schedule is the way
in which we will avoid one of the principal pitfalls that people saw in
the planning gain supplement, which is site-by-site valuations with all
the complexities and some of the uncertainties that would come as a
result.</div>
					<a name="08013189000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
amendment No. 600 is also a probing amendment, as it would remove the
requirement for regulations to provide an appeal mechanism on matters
of fact against the calculation of the levy in individual cases. We
intend the provision that the amendment would otherwise compromise to
be a safeguard for resolving factual disputes about the basis of
charging CIL in an individual case. For instance, it might be that the
charge is calculated by reference to the square meterage of different
uses in a development proposal, and there could be a disagreement
between the developer and the local authority about the quantum of that
square meterage. Otherwis,e judicial review would be the only means to
resolve a dispute that was based on facts about the correct level to
pay. I hope that those comments are
helpful.</div>

Healey:
						</b> The amendment sets out the types of infrastructure
for which CIL could be used. The list includes items of infrastructure
that are currently commonly secured through planning obligations. The
list is intended to be illustrative, rather than exclusive or
exhaustive. It includes items over which some doubts have been raised,
such as &#147;open
spaces&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08013189000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members will note that the list includes affordable housing. To be
clear, our intention and preference is that affordable housing should
continue to be delivered on-site through negotiated section 106
agreements, which have proved successful in many areas in ensuring that
we secure mixed communities in important developments. However, the
Campaign to Protect Rural England and other bodies have expressed the
concern&#151;indeed, the CPRE expressed it in its evidence to the
Committee&#151;that the community infrastructure levy should not lead
to a reduction in the provision of affordable housing. While we do not
initially intend to include affordable housing within the scope of what
may be funded by CILs, we propose to include it within the definition
of infrastructure so that if it is later demonstrated that affordable
housing is necessary, it could be included as part of
CIL.</div>
					<a name="08013189000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise that
the priorities for infrastructure may change over time. Several years
ago, few of us would have put flood defence as high up the list of
infrastructure priorities associated with growth as it is now. The
Government amendments provide for the definition of infrastructure in
the Bill to be revised to reflect changing needs. Such changes will be
subject to the affirmation of this
House.</div>
					<a name="08013189000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Flexibility is
important, but so are safeguards. The Government amendments will enable
the creation of regulations that specify what should not be funded by
CIL and regulations to require local authorities to publish and make
available for public inspection the list of projects to be funded by
the levy. Perhaps the converse power to that is the power to create
regulations to restrict the ability of local authorities to use the
levy for projects that are not included on the list of infrastructure
that they draw up.</div>
					<a name="08013189000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that hon. Members will see that these provisions are designed to
provide greater clarity about the purposes to which the revenue from
the levy will be put to deliver the infrastructure that is required for
local communities, developments and growth. I am happy to deal with any
questions that hon. Members may have and will respond to any points
that my hon. Friend wishes to make when he speaks to amendment No.

Betts:
						</b> I seek reassurance. The Local Government
Association is concerned to try to ensure that, fundamentally, it would
be for each local authority to come to a view about which
infrastructure it wanted to be developed and supported by CIL in its
area. The Government amendment includes a wide range of infrastructure
that it may be appropriate to fund from CIL. Presumably, as we
previously discussed that the process is still to be finally
determined, will each local authority look at the needs in its area and
be able to select the most appropriate requirements for the development
of infrastructure from the list of possibilities that amendment No. 556
indicates will be appropriate?</div>

							<a name="08013189000469"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I find myself in a bit of a
quandary. On the one hand, we have access to very little information,
yet the Minister has set out in the Government amendment the list that
will be in the Bill of potential projects for which CIL could be used.
I thank him for that. The list includes medical facilities&#151;the
hon. Member for North Cornwall may wish to raise this point&#151;so
the point about the primary care trust is, in a sense, covered. I would
like the Minister to clarify whether within
&#147;recreational&#148; he includes cultural facilities, so that
we can know whether theatres and art galleries will be included if the
local community agrees that it would like to have a theatre or art
gallery that cannot be paid for in other ways. That would be
helpful.</div>
					<a name="08013189000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
worries me is that on the one hand we have so little information, and,
on the other hand, the information that we are given, particularly in
the list, is prefaced by the Minister saying, &#147;We may not need
to invoke it now, but we cannot know whether we will need to in the
future. Therefore, the widest possible powers are needed.&#148; We
could find ourselves agreeing to something that initially sounds
reasonable, but, as he himself said about flood defences, who would
have thought 10 or 15 years ago that they would be as important as they
are now? We could suddenly find ourselves with a piece of legislation
that could be distorted, changed or widened in a way that none of us
ever thought of or expected. With the best of intentions, the Minister
is trying to cover as much as he can, but by so doing he leaves us open
to turning something into legislation that might have consequences
which none of us can begin to dream of at this
stage.</div>
					<a name="08013189000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
grateful if the Minister could confirm that small point about whether
cultural facilities are included in the list under
&#147;recreational&#148;, and just be warned about the concerns
that I am beginning to feel about the whole approach to this piece of
legislation and the fact that we are being asked to put on the statute
book the widest possible powers for CIL. That could cause long-term
problems.</div>

the theatre were used for recreation, it would obviously fall directly
within the terms of the amendment. I think that this matter probably
requires further discussion and reflection with those with cultural and
recreational interests, as well with as local authorities and local
planning authorities. Indeed, because we are considering a Bill on the
practice of planning obligations, we need to look at the current
practice of planning obligations. Should we need to make the list any
clearer to deal with any wider concerns, we certainly
will.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000475"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> The amendments would insert simple wording to ensure
that the community infrastructure levy is additional to other streams
of infrastructure development funding, and that the organisations
providing that other funding do their bit.</div>
					<a name="08013189000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is easy to
envisage a situation in which there might be a sudden call on the funds
of the relevant governmental body or of an infrastructure developer, so
that the funding promised to the community infrastructure levy for the
delivery of a project suddenly dries up. That could be because the
Chancellor of the Exchequer has decided to reduce that
organisation&#146;s budget, or because the financial calculations of
the money available for the project were less than
robust.</div>
					<a name="08013189000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
we want reassurance that the community infrastructure levy is in
addition to the other streams of funding and is not seen to replace it,
and that the other funders carry out what they have promised to do, in
a timely way. Anyone who has worked with local authorities that are
working in partnership with a variety of different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column623" />Column number: 623</div>bodies will know the difficulty of ensuring that all the money promised
to a project is delivered when needed. If the levy is to work, we need
to ensure that everyone plays their part at the right time, in the
right way, and without penalising the funding of other projects. Our
goal is to ensure robust financial management within all the
organisations.</div>
					<a name="08013189000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment No. 604 excludes administrative expenses. It is easy to see
that a project&#146;s funding could be top-heavy on administration,
which could absorb a greater share than it should; or that, by sleight
of hand, perish the thought, some administrative charges on an
area unrelated to the CIL-funded project could suddenly be offloaded on
to it. It is important to ensure that the money raised from CIL is not
spent on administration when it should be spent on the
project.</div>

							<a name="08013189000476"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> The hon. Lady makes a good
case for questioning that potential problem. Amendments Nos. 575 and
576 were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and
Wallington and me. They concern the principle of additionality, to
which the Minister referred under an earlier clause. I certainly
welcome his comments on that. We are concerned that money that had been
identified for a local project might now be funded through CIL&#151;I
cannot think why we are using a soft rather than a hard
&#147;c&#148;. Making a &#147;cilling&#148; does not sound
quite so dangerous as the
alternative.</div>
					<a name="08013189000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
pleased to hear what the Minister had to say. We would not like to see
funding, which had already been identified and hard won after long
campaigning or much prioritisation for a particular project in a local
area, being diverted away. Our amendments would look at funding
infrastructure which is particular to the changing situation and the
grant of planning permission. I suspect that the Minister will tell me
that that is already what is intended. If he does, it will be good to
have that on the record once
again.</div>
					<a name="08013189000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000477"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I am sympathetic to the spirit
of some of the amendments, but not convinced that they are the right
thing to do or that they would help. I shall try to respond to the
substance of the points that the hon. Lady and the hon. Gentleman have
made. The clause provides that the regulations that we make must
require authorities collecting the levy to apply it to infrastructure.
It provides that the regulations may specify what does and does not
constitute infrastructure. Furthermore, clause 163 makes it clear that
infrastructure funded from the levy should support an area&#146;s
developments. That is the essence of the levy
itself.</div>
					<a name="08013189000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
603 appears to seek to establish the principle that CIL spending should
be additional to existing infrastructure spending. I am not convinced
that it is sensible to legislate for that, but let me say a little bit
more about additionality, in addition to the points I have already made
which the hon. Gentleman has kindly welcomed.</div>
					<a name="08013189000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we have said publicly
and consistently that it is not our intention for the levy to work in
isolation from other revenue streams. It cannot be expected to pay for
all the infrastructure required, although as paragraph 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column624" />Column number: 624</div>47 of the document we published last week indicates, we expect that it
could make a significant contribution in some areas to some
infrastructure. Secondly, we want to give authorities the flexibility
to determine both their infrastructure priorities and how best to
allocate their funding streams to ensure that they are properly
delivered.</div>
					<a name="08013189000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The local
authorities will need to assess. They will need to cost the
infrastructure they require to support development. In doing that, they
should have regard to the level of funding that is likely to be
available from other national and regional or local funding sources,
including how they use funding sources that are not ring-fenced. It has
always been our expectation that the levy will be additional,
particularly for larger pieces of infrastructure. In many cases it will
provide only a part of the funding required. To underline that I quote
directly from our document:</div>
					<a name="08013189000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Government believes
that CIL should not be used for general local authority expenditure,
nor to remedy pre-existing deficiencies in infrastructure provision,
unless these have been, or will in time be, aggravated by new
development.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08013189000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000478"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I understand the point with regard to local
authorities. However, we have already debated how it might be
appropriate for the money raised to be spent through other agencies. It
would be good to have it on the record that it would also cover the
Highways Agency or any other Government agency, rather than just
picking on local
government.</div>
					<a name="08013189000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000479"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. The
principle that I am seeking to establish is that we want the levy and
the revenue raised from the levy to be additional. I hope that a
combination of the provisions in the Bill and the consistent
declaration of that intent will give the hon. Gentleman the
reassurance that he seeks. Also, &#147;additional&#148; would be
difficult to define and to put in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08013189000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 604 relates largely to the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns. Subsection
(4)(c) permits the application of the levy to administrative expenses
related to the infrastructure concerned or to the levy. I understand
the hon. Lady&#146;s argument, but the measure will help to give
charging authorities the resources that they need to set, collect and
enforce the levy, and to plan and deliver the infrastructure that can
be funded by the levy. The levy builds on the existing provisions and
practice of section 106 and, in a sense, the provisions mirror those
under many of the section 106 agreements. They provide, in many cases,
for local planning authorities to recoup costs related to negotiations
or monitoring of the section 106 agreements, for example. Giving
authorities insufficient resources to operate the levy would ensure
that the levy is not effective.</div>
					<a name="08013189000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady&#146;s concerns
about administrative expenditure and efficiency are right, but to
preclude levy-related revenues from supporting the sort of work that is
necessary to make the levy operate effectively would be a mistake. I
hope that her amendment is probing and that she will not press it to a
Division. Ensuring that charging authorities have sufficient resources
is clearly central to their ability to deliver the levy but, more
importantly, to the infrastructure that it is designed to
support.</div>

Lait:
						</b> It is not often that I wish to be prescriptive in my
dealings with local authorities&#151;or anyone else, for that matter.
However, I want assurances from the Government that the community
infrastructure levy does not necessarily need to be paid in money when
there are other ways of reimbursing a community. For example, someone
could donate land, or construct a facility that does not involve the
community other than to ensure that it is what the community wishes. By
tabling an amendment that proposes to replace &#147;may&#148; with
&#147;must&#148; and by trying to build flexibility into the
community infrastructure levy, it makes the levy more easily
deliverable by those who are being asked to pay.</div>
					<a name="08013189000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 606 would make
the levy payable at the beginning of the development. That then begs
the question that if money is paid over, will it be used immediately?
If it is not going to be used immediately, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column626" />Column number: 626</div>who is liable for the funds? If it is a large development and it takes
two or three years before the infrastructure is in place, or even begun
to be built, who benefits from any investment income or interest? What
is the flexibility of being able to invest the money? Those sorts of
boring practicalities are possibly more in the Minister&#146;s
Treasury remit than in the remit of the Department for Communities and
Local Government. If the project goes wrong and a poor investment is
made, there could be problems. Will he enlighten us on those two very
techie
points?</div>

							<a name="08013189000486"></a>John

						</b> The hon. Lady puts her points
down by describing them as techie. They are both rather important. On
amendment No.605, which is designed to probe the issue of payments in
money or payments in kind, we are discussing the matter with local
authorities and the development industry. We are anxious to get their
view on how this might best work. At this point in the process, I
believe that the amendment would remove any flexibility for us to draw
our conclusions at the appropriate time. I will ensure that she is kept
fully informed on any progress that we
make.</div>
					<a name="08013189000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
606 raises a very important point, which is not just techie but is of
significant interest in both senses of the word. We believe that the
powers under the provisions for local authority investments cover what
the hon. Lady wants. However, I will reflect further on the amendment
and if necessary will come back with observations and reflections. We
may return to the matter at a later stage if further amendments are
required.</div>

circumstances require it, a number of authorities may collect the levy
on behalf of a charging authority. They also make it clear that
authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column627" />Column number: 627</div>empowered to collect the levy on behalf of a charging authority may be
other public authorities and not just charging authorities. The other
public authorities would collect but not set the levy; the
responsibility for setting would remain with the charging authority.
The amendments will permit regulations to give us the flexibility to
provide for specific local
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08013189000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of amendments Nos. 562 to 565 is to provide greater detail on
possible enforcement measures. They confirm and clarify that surcharges
may be imposed, provide for the enforcement of payment through civil
proceedings, and allow regulations to empower charging authorities to
stop development until a community infrastructure levy liability is
assumed.</div>
					<a name="08013189000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, in
the interests of fairness for all those who pay the levy, acts or
omissions may warrant criminal prosecutions in some circumstances.
Before there is a sharp intake of breath across the Committee, examples
might include persistent evasion of payment or the provision of false
information relating to payment, and the obstruction and assault of
charging authority officers who may be trying to carry out their duty
to investigate non-payment, all of which the Government believe could
apply to the levy. They are set out in the amendments.</div>
					<a name="08013189000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there is a question
about the proper limits on the term of imprisonment that could be
imposed for criminal offences under the levy, and we shall return to
that, probably on Report.</div>

						</b> Will the Minister enlighten us on the nature of the
discussion he has had with the industry about those proposals and where
he has got to on that, because while there are good developers, there
are also those who are perhaps less than satisfactory? That question
arises from a case in my constituency. We discovered a developer who
had run out of money and was unable to finish the development, and
there is no effective enforcement against him.</div>
					<a name="08013189000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we will have a
community infrastructure levy, there is no effective way to force a
developer who runs out of money to finish a development. There is
technical enforcement, but no effective enforcement. If a bust
developer has paid the community infrastructure levy and is committed
to it but does not complete the development, would the powers that come
into play then force him to complete the development, and how can that
be done when they have paid the community infrastructure
levy?</div>

purpose behind the amendment was brought to our attention by the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors. It is a very reasonable question to
ask and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s answer. There could be
instances in which there is a failure to deliver the infrastructure
that has been promised. In previous debates I have cited some possible
reasons for failure, such as changes in Government priorities and poor
financial control. Will the developers be able to claim back CIL if the
partners fail to deliver their part of the bargain? Would the developer
have to take the other organisations to court, would there be an
automatic repayment, would the developers be expected to go ahead and
provide the infrastructure or would the levy automatically transfer to
another project? I would be interested to hear the Minister enlighten
us with his views on this
matter.</div>

							<a name="08013189000498"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> The amendment raises an interesting point.
However, I am a little concerned about the way in which it is drafted.
The phrase &#147;in accordance with agreements&#148; is a little
wide. I can see the point that is being made. An important development
might be held up by the lack of infrastructure promised by CIL.
However, to say that it must be in accordance with the original
agreement implies that it should be in accordance with it to the
letter. Issues might arise in the course of delivering a development,
for example, through further planning considerations, which mean that
it is delivered in a slightly different way. I would hate to see the
developer in question being able to take the money back by saying that
the result is not exactly to the letter of the
agreement.</div>

						</b> If I had the resources at my command to get all of
my amendments right, I would probably get on a lot better. The
same is true for the hon. Gentleman. However, if the Minister is
prepared to accept our arguments, we will be very happy to amend the
drafting of the

							<a name="08013189000500"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I accept the hon. Lady&#146;s point and I am
glad that a fine-toothed comb has not been run over the amendments that
stand in my name because I am sure that they are not perfect. I can
understand her question, but the CIL provisions must be written in a
tight, binding way to ensure that developers cannot slip away from
their
obligations.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000501"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I, too, am a little concerned about the hon.
Lady&#146;s drafting, but I understand the point that she makes in
her defence. I am also concerned about the points of substance that the
hon. Gentleman mentioned. It is difficult to see how the amendment
would work when agreements are not part of the CIL. It will be raised
whether or not the owner or developer agrees. As we discussed under the
previous clause, an authority might raise and collect the levy
liability but then bank it for some time before allocating it to a
scheme some way down the track. We would not want the developer to be
able to challenge and reclaim the money that they have paid in such
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08013189000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">To deal
with the spirit of the hon. Lady&#146;s point, it is a central
element of the design of the levy that it should be raised to support
the development of infrastructure. Although we are discussing clause
169, the hon. Lady will see that clause 167(5) provides for regulations
to set out requirements on an authority to monitor and report how the
levy funds have been raised, how the levy funds have been transferred
and how they have been spent. Those requirements to report publicly
should help to ensure that authorities charged with delivering planned
infrastructure&#151;as a contribution to which they raise the
levy&#151;are held to account and can be publicly challenged. I
appreciate that that is a different form of accountability from the
contractual accountability that the hon. Lady
seeks.</div>

							<a name="08013189000502"></a>Mrs.

						</b> Let me give the Minister a &#147;for
instance&#148; that might help him. Some years ago, we had bad floods
in the south-east after which it was recommended, and agreed by the
Environment Agency and the Government, that various flood alleviation
works would be carried out. We then had the debacle of the Rural
Payments Agency, and the Environment Agency was required to forgo some
of its budget so that it could bail out the RPA. That meant that the
flood defence works were politely postponed. How would that situation
play into what is, I accept, the poorly drafted spirit of the
amendment, given that the Environment Agency could not carry out its
work? It does not have to be the Environment Agency&#151;it could be
any stream of funding&#151;but the Environment Agency could not carry
out, for whatever reason, the commitments into which it had
entered.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column630" />Column number: 630</div>
					<a name="08013189000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not a comparable position
because we have said consistently that the levy could be spent only on

						</b> I want to make the general point that the clause is
controlling and centralising, and we are unhappy with the powers it
gives to the Secretary of State to direct charging authorities. It also
provides the potential for the Secretary of State to reduce
Government funding, although we keep being told that that will not
happen. In the interest of brevity, we will probably return to the
matter on Report, but I wanted to put it on record that the clause
gives too many powers to the Secretary of State to direct

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013189000508"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The hon. Lady is right that the
provision provides powers of intervention to the Secretary of State
that could be used to control the imposition, collection or application
of the levy. We would envisage using those powers only in exceptional
circumstances and as a last resort, if the spending proposed by a
charging authority did not meet the purpose of the levy: to provide
infrastructure to support an area&#146;s
development.</div>
					<a name="08013189000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause also provides for regulations, which would also be a reserve
power that we would use only in exceptional circumstances and as a last
resort. It is, nevertheless, important to cap the amount that an
authority could levy. We would not anticipate that authorities would
set the level of the levy to the extent that it would choke off
significant development, but the risk of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column631" />Column number: 631</div>circumstances in which that could happen remains. Therefore, the powers
are important safeguards for both developers and local communities. I
understand the hon. Lady&#146;s reservations. None the less, I hope
that hon. Members will accept that the powers are important and that
the clause should remain part of the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="08013189000509"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I do not think that I will get terribly far with my
objections to the clause. I have already asked whether the draft
regulations will be available for the Lords to consider, as we have not
had them, and received a fairly dusty
answer.</div>
					<a name="08013189000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that we are signing a blank cheque in the legislation. I am
concerned that the House will have no input into the draft regulations,
as we all know that it is, in effect, extraordinarily difficult to
amend the regulations when they come before the House through the
affirmative 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column632" />Column number: 632</div>or negative procedure. Therefore, I would wish the Lords to have draft
regulations, so that they can have a positive debate on much of the
detail that we have been unable to obtain from the Minister; although
he has been slightly more co-operative than in previous sections of the
Bill, and we are beginning to get a bit of a feel for the details. When
the regulations do come forward to the House for approval, I hope that
the Minister will put them forward under the affirmative
procedure.</div>

							<a name="08013189000510"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I have two points to make. First, we will
absolutely ensure that when the Bill goes to the other place, the Lords
are fully informed about the development of thinking behind it, and
that they have the maximum information possible, depending on the stage
of the discussions and conclusions and any formal consultation
required.</div>
					<a name="08013189000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, as
I indicated previously, we intend the major regulation-making
provisions in this part of the Bill to be subject to the affirmative
procedure. Whether through the negative or affirmative procedure, the
House will get the chance to re-examine the provisions that may be
proposed under secondary
legislation.</div>
