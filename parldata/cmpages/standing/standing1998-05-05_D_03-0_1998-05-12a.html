<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): May I begin by thanking you, Mr. Welsh, for joining us this afternoon and by welcoming you to the Chair? I know that Opposition Members have been waiting anxiously since 1 o'clock for my comments on their various amendments and suggestions, and I am delighted to have the opportunity of putting them out of their misery--only as far as the amendments are concerned, of course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor </B>(Esher and Walton): Not put down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> That was the suggestion of the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway).
<P>
Amendments Nos. 17 and 63 would bring membership of business and professional associations as well as--in the case of amendment No. 63--guilds and masonic lodges, under the sensitive data unmbrella.
<P>
As Committee members will know, the Government's general approach to implementing the directive is to go no further than it requires. We want to protect individuals' personal data properly, but we do not want to do so at the cost of putting unnecessary additional burdens on data controllers. Clearly, that would involve extra costs for a wide range of businesses. It is precisely in the area of sensitive data that the directive imposes the greatest burdens. I hope that Opposition Members accept that we should be wary about adding to the categories of such data and that we should be extremely reluctant to do so.
<P>
Several Opposition Members mentioned the different approach to the directive as far as trade unionists are concerned. The Bill treats information about trade union membership as sensitive. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) made the point that there was clear evidence that individuals had been discriminated against for their trade union membership. There is no clear evidence that members of the Ryedale rotary club have been discriminated against because of their membership of that club. That, in essence, is the distinction that I seek to draw. It is made in the directive, and the Government have faithfully carried it through into the Bill. There is no requirement in the directive to extend its terms to other categories, and the Government do not consider it necessary to extend the scope of the sensitive data provisions in the way that the hon. Members for Poole (Mr. Syms) and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) suggested.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 would amend the reference to health and sex life to follow more closely the wording in the directive. The Government intend to adopt a slightly different explanation in this case. There may be a temptation among Opposition Members to throw back at me the explanation that I have just set out, but there is a clear distinction between the two situations. The previous amendment would have added extra categories of information to the sensitive data regime; the wording used in the Bill in relation to health and sexual life clarifies the wording used in the directive. It is not our purpose to extend the sensitive data definition. The Government find the wording in the directive uncertain. We have sought throughout the Bill to find more effective and clearer definitions to assist those who will have to implement its terms when it is passed.
<P>
We know that the directive is intended to cover all the things mentioned in clause 2(e) and (f), but we thought it essential to spell that out. I hope that there is no dispute about the fact that data about our health and sexual lives are of a most deeply personal nature and that it is essential that we deal with them properly as the directive intends. We believe that that is what clause 2 now does.
<P>
One question was why the word ``condition'' is used in the Bill. There was a fear that, without the use of that word, the expression in clause 2(e) might not deal properly with the circumstances of a person who is disabled and permanently suffering from a specific condition that is not necessarily part of that person's general health. That may seem a fine distinction, but we judged it important that disability and health were covered.
<P>
For the benefit of the hon. Members for Esher and Walton and for Hallam, I confirm that the directive's reference to health data is intended to cover genetic data. Similarly, clause 2(e) is intended to include a specific reference to genetic data.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 19 would remove information about criminal offences from the sensitive data category in clause 2. I hope that the Committee does not accept that that is necessary.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale rightly mentioned the important anxieties expressed by City institutions and other organisations, including charities, about whether the Government will make an order under paragraph 9 to schedule 3 allowing those bodies to process sensitive data. We are aware of the problem and we shall listen sympathetically to the worries of organisations that are anxious to process data about criminal convictions.
<P>
Obviously, City institutions are keen to combat fraud, but charities such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds have also said that they need to be able to identify people who have committed offences against wildlife. We accept that there is a problem, and we shall handle sympathetically any approach with regard to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway (Ryedale):</B> I do not think that this morning's debate about philosophical beliefs was conclusive. I am sorry to resurrect it, and the Minister's responses have been reasonable, although his view may not always be shared by Conservative Members. However, I have a specific question for him.
<P>
The word ``philosophical'' does not appear in the Bill. The Minister has explained the meaning of Government amendment No. 110, which would replace the phrase ``or other beliefs'' in clause 2(c) with the phrase ``beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature''. That has a fairly narrow interpretation. Do the Government believe that that definition will satisfy the directive's requirements? It is important that we reach agreement about that, regardless of whether we are on all fours about the wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising an important point. I shall not repeat our previous discussion, save to say that the Government want to reproduce faithfully the principles in the directive. We believe that our suggested wording addresses the sensitive matters that ought to be properly protected--religious belief or those beliefs that are close to religious belief--without dealing with the wider examples of philosophical belief that I set out for the hon. Gentleman this morning and which did not seem to be appropriately sensitive in this context. I am perfectly prepared to leave it on this basis. The hon. Member for Ryedale referred this morning to a burden of proof. If he can set out to my satisfaction a set of philosophical beliefs that ought to be considered sensitive but which are not religious, I am confident--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> Socialism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Marxism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Both those matters are of acute sensitivity, but I am not sure that they are entirely relevant in this context. If the hon. Member for Ryedale can come up with philosophical beliefs that are worthy of protection, the Government will consider them extremely sympathetically. However, the burden of proof is on the hon. Gentleman rather than the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister has given us a tempting challenge. As I said, this is one of the key parts of the Bill and it would be extraordinary if other hon. Members did not have some comment to make on it when the Bill goes back on to the Floor of the House. Inevitably, the issue will be raised again.
<P>
I do not want to tempt the Committee with other examples, but sensitivity varies with the passage of time. There were occasions when membership of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament might well have been considered extremely sensitive, but perhaps that is not so any more. On the other hand, maybe past rather than current membership is sensitive. That would give an indication of belief. It is important that the directive is adhered to, so we will think about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Perhaps I may assist the hon. Gentleman to this extent. The three examples that have been set out so far, either formally to the Committee or in noisy asides, concern political opinions, which are already covered by clause 2(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We accept that. There is no doubt that much philosophy has a political connotation. We will go away and think about it. For now, we have successfully brought the issues out into the open.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's explanation of the Government's intentions with regard to the words ``or condition''. I am not 100 per cent. sure that a wider interpretation within the courts might not prove possible in the future. Again, we might want to return to the matter.
<P>
I am particularly grateful for his comments on subsections (g) and (h) and the importance of that issue. One way of dealing with it is via an amendment to schedule 3 paragraph 9. I may have already tabled such an amendment, or am about to do so. The Minister will be aware of that proposal, and he has acknowledged that it is a matter of concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I want to raise one slight concern in respect of the definition of religious groups or similar. There are cults in our country. They claim to be religious but cause tremendous problems. We have all had people in our surgeries who have got into difficulties. Perhaps we should come back to this issue later.
<P>
We should be careful about protecting organisations that may not have the best interests of their members and families at heart. In Poole there are many Scientologists. I am sure that individually they are very nice people. There are organisations, however, that hide under the cloak of a particular philosophy or religion. Before the Bill complete its passage, we should think very carefully about definitions regarding this topic because we believe in protecting freedoms, as unless we are very careful, we could allow those with fewer scruples to use the system.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms). He raises an interesting question which, I suspect, contains the seeds of considerable difficulty. To put it crudely, one man's cult may be another man's religion. I invite the hon. Gentleman, along with the hon. Member for Ryedale, to consider whether he can give a definition of a cult that is not to some extent akin to a religious belief, and would therefore come within the terms of sensitive data. I do not consider it appropriate to pursue the point at this stage, but if the hon. Member for Poole can devise a workable definition, I will be delighted to consider it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>The special purposes</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> May I raise the question of music rights? The Minister may be aware of a letter from British Music Rights whose director general has also written to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth).
<P>
British Music Rights is concerned about definitions and is after sufficient assurance that music publishing in particular will fall within the categories in clause 3. It stresses the importance of the British music publishing industry. British collecting societies and music publishers trade abroad substantially, not only in the European economic area--and this follows a theme in the Bill--but in the United States and Japan. It says that British music accounts for 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. of all global sales. The organisation's concern is to ensure that music publishing falls within that definition. I should have thought that it would have done, but as the organisation is writing about the issue--and if the Minister does not have the letter he can have mine--it requires reassurance. Clause 3 impacts on clauses 11, 31, 43, 44, 45 and 52, and it is important to get the basic definitions right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Clause 3 is another important clause. If we could have proposed an amendment that was not a wrecking amendment, we would have done so.
<P>
The directive appears not to provide any differentiation between the treatment of journalistic purposes and of artistic and literary purposes. It is fair to say that the general view is that freedom of the press and of the media are one thing, but it is another to extend wide exemptions to artistic and literary arenas, as the clause does.
<P>
In recent weeks, the book about the child murderer Mary Bell has been published and serialised in The Times. Is that serialisation journalism, or is it literary? That question demonstrates the extent to which there are grey areas. The Government and the Opposition generally agree about the need to secure freedom of the press. The matter will soon be discussed in the House in relation to the Human Rights Bill. There will be different views as to how that freedom will be ensured. The Opposition have no major concerns about that.
<P>
The provision is, however, very widely drawn. As the Minister, his officials and the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department know, anxieties are being expressed about the lack of definition of artistic and literary purposes. The Committee will have the opportunity to debate those concerns under clause 31, which provides the mechanism through which exemptions apply. The Committee should understand now, however, that exemptions granted for the special purposes about which I have spoken effectively prevent an individual data subject from gaining any right of access, any right to stop processing and to deal with inaccurate data, and even from gaining any right in respect of automatic decisions, which were briefly discussed this morning.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the Government's position. They are in a bit of a cleft stick. I do not know their view on the matter, but the directive provides for a blanket requirement. I am not happy about the blanket inclusion of literary and artistic merits. Who will judge such merits and test literary and artistic quality? Somebody might want to test the quality of this speech and award it one out of 10. Such judgments are entirely arbitrary. We are anxious because responsibility for tests of merit or quality does not rest with the Data Protection Commissioner, but--as will become clear under clause 31--with the data processor, who deals with and controls the records.
<P>
Hon. Members are only too well aware that information and records can be highly confidential. The Bill allows for such data to be kept, processed, stored and so on, provided that the person responsible intends to publish it in the public interest. The legislation will not enable much to be done about that. Such provision extends not only to freedom of the press but to any literary or artistic purpose. That should cause general concern in the minds of all Committee members. I honestly do not know how the Government can resolve that problem. If it had been possible to amend the provision without wrecking the purposes of the clause or the directive, I would have been tempted to do so. I have not been able to get my head around the problem, which I raise now so that members of the Committee can turn their minds to it.
<P>
Clause 31 provides the bedrock for a massive exemption: it is one of the Bill's most contentious elements, which the Committee will have to tackle in the days ahead. I shall be very interested in the Minister's response to some of the matters that I have raised. We shall try to strengthen the Bill when we reach clause 31, but it seemed appropriate to use this stand part debate as an opportunity to voice my anxieties about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale, who said that clause 31 raises an important point of principle and demonstrates the complexity of the matter.
<P>
Another difficulty arises with the definition of journalism in this modern, electronic age. The old ideas about how journalistic stories could be gathered and about how information could be retrieved began to be questioned some years ago. The process of printing journalists' stories direct into the final text of newspapers represents a transformation, and digital communications mean that distance is no longer an obstacle.
<P>
Amassing information is a complex business that affects the right of the individual: if it is not done properly, the flow of information could be affected, as could the ability to use it. Even so, what the Data Protection Registrar has called the Bill's ``media exemptions'' are very wide. It is convenient to use this debate to flag up our concerns, but we shall need to examine the matter again when we reach clause 31 and the related clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I have a lot of sympathy with what has been said about the clause's possible scope, especially as it affects journalism. In the modern age, one can say that presenting something on the world wide web is equivalent to publication.
<P>
The Bill does not define how artistic expression is placed in the public domain. The traditional understanding of journalistic, artistic or literary purposes is straightforward, but when we discuss clause 31, which is when the special purposes apply, we shall have to ask how to define the publication event. Will the protection afforded by the Bill be proportional to the interests of such publication?
<P>
I hope that the Minister will explain how the Government regard the publication event in the modern media. Is it sufficient for a person to define himself as a journalist, artist or litterateur simply because he has amassed a great deal of data that could be put on a web page? That would be significantly easier than the traditional methods involving publishing books, organising exhibitions or producing newspapers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to hon. Members for the interesting questions that have been raised. I hope to satisfy the Committee that we need not deal at length with all of them now: the hon. Member for Ryedale was right to say that when we get to clause 31 we will have the opportunity for a more detailed debate on the mechanisms by which such data is protected. I hope, however, that there is broad acceptance that it is right for some special purposes to be protected, notwithstanding the comments of the hon. Member for Ryedale. I hope that he will accept that journalistic, artistic and literary purposes fall together.
<P>
I emphasise that we are concerned with purposes, not with merit. No one is required to make judgments as to the quality of someone's journalistic or artistic output. The test to be applied is whether the purposes are artistic, journalistic or literary. I hope that that is helpful to hon. Members.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole is right to be concerned about music rights and the protection of music publishing in the United Kingdom. I have seen the letter to which he referred. It is specifically concerned with collection agencies' ability to enforce the collection of royalties from other parts of the world. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), who has responsibility for that, is carefully considering the letter. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it will receive a reply as soon as possible and in as sympathetic a way as possible.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale puzzled me a little. I had not realised that Ryedale was quite so remote from concerns about artistic and literary purposes. It seems difficult to distinguish as a matter of principle between the protection of journalism and that of literary and artistic purposes. Article 9 of the directive sought to balance personal privacy with freedom of expression. That is why we have clause 3. Artistic and literary purposes can raise issues of freedom of expression just as journalism can. Clauses 3 and 31 are designed to provide the appropriate degree of balance. Had the Government not accepted the terms of the directive, which was the result of a careful compromise, I am sure that we would have faced criticism for including only journalism and not extending the provision to artistic and literary purposes.
<P>
I hope that, on more mature reflection, the hon. Member for Ryedale will recognise that issues of freedom of expression are as important in relation to artistic and literary matters as they are in the context of journalism.
<P>
The hon. Members for Esher and Walton and for Hallam touched on the problem, as they saw it, of modern means of communication. Again, I am sure that, on reflection, they will recognise that the issues were just as relevant at the dawn of the age of radio or of television as they are today, when we have to deal with the world wide web and journalists providing information that can be accessed electronically on people's personal computers at home.
<P>
No one doubts that journalists in television and radio are journalists simply because they operate in a different medium from that of newspaper journalism. I am sure that those who provide information on the world wide web for the purposes of journalism would be included in and protected by the provision just as much as would a journalist working on a daily national newspaper.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Careful reflection is needed on this subject, which is why it is better to flag it up now and come back to it in detail.
<P>
How would the Minister feel if he was flamed on the internet--to use a technical expression--for the purposes of journalism? If that series of allegations against him had been in a journalistic, published format, he would have some recourse. Information on the internet, however, is distributed worldwide to anyone who wants to access it and those responsible might not be easy to track down. The difference between the various media is that the internet is global and instant. How does one trade the right to free movement of information on the internet--an anarchic network of networks in which it is difficult to define where responsibility lies--against the individual's right to protect himself or herself against the abuse of personal data?
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> That was probably an intervention, so I had better reply to it. I shall give way to my hon. Friend in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Esher and Walton is tempting me down a broad highway--
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> A superhighway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> That was very good. The Liberal Democrats get there eventually.
<P>
I have debated the issues with the hon. Member for Esher and Walton in the past. There is no necessary distinction in principle between material that is made available and published on the world wide web and material that is made available in written form in a book or a newspaper. For example, we have all witnessed the difficulties that previous Governments have had preventing the publication of a book in another part of the world. The issues in respect of enforcing rights remain identical. I accept that it is probably easier than ever to publish and reach a wide audience. Nevertheless, the legal principles that underpin the present arrangements remain the same. That is only peripheral to the present issue, however. We are dealing with the right of a journalist, artist or writer to write and publish freely and, in the case of a journalist, for there not to be too detailed an investigation into the sources, information and material that he necessarily compiles when preparing or writing an article. We need to concentrate on that, and I am not persuaded that there is any distinction in that respect between someone who intends to publish on the world wide web and someone who is writing an article for tomorrow's edition of The Times. If I have missed something, however, I am open to persuasion.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> In support of the comments that my hon. Friend has just made, I should say that there is a tendency in Committees to try to solve all the world's problems with whatever Bill happens to be at hand. The example of flaming would very much preoccupy us if we were dealing with the law of libel, but it is not really a data protection issue. A typical flame might say that the hon. Member for Ryedale was an alien. It would be a data protection issue if a list of verified aliens was published on the internet and the hon. Member for Ryedale appeared on it. The allegation itself is not a data protection issue. As the Minister said, it is reasonable to deal with different subjects in the same way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful for that.
<P>
<B> Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> They will support you in the end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am trying to win people over to my point of view. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Members who raised the point. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, who probably explained the matter better than I did. I am not sure that I need to add anything further. We are talking about balancing interests and we shall be able to discuss whether the balance is right when we discuss clause 31. I am sure that there will be amendments to that part of the Bill that we can debate in some detail.
<P>
The three purposes set out in clause 3 are expressly referred to in article 9 of the directive on which the regime for special purposes is based. The hon. Member for Esher and Walton will be able to confirm that it is the result of a protracted series of compromises at every stage in the directive's development, both in the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. It would not be appropriate, in the Government's view, to seek to disturb that careful compromise at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Not for the first time today, the Minister has confirmed my worst fears. He is saying that the test is the purpose, not the merit. We were well advised to have raised this point because it is now out in the open. It will be helpful in our deliberations on clause 31. For the moment, we progress.
<P>

Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>The data protection principles</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed. That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I wish to say only that the clause is clearly a major piece of the legislation's structure. I seek confirmation that subsection (4) deals purely with issues of national security, which we entirely support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for beginning the debate on clause 4. I have struggled as best I can to find anything particular to say about it, other than that it is essentially a technical provision that sets out the data protection principles incorporated in the schedules. I hope that members of the Committee do not find it controversial. If they have specific concerns about the contents of the schedules, we can address them later at an appropriate stage. The clause deals with the technical mechanism, and I hope that members of the Committee will accept it in that light.
<P>
Clause 4(4) is a general provision. It is not about national security but deals with the responsibilities of the data controller, and falls within the general technical structure of clause 4.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Application of Act</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 245, in page 3, line 37, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) A data controller falling within subsection (1)(b) must nominate for the purposes of this Act a representative established in the United Kingdom.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 246.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The amendments make a small change to clause 5 to bring it within closer conformity and consistency with the data protection directive. Clause 5 establishes the rules for determining to which processing the Bill applies. The rules are based closely on those set out in article 4 of the directive. The basic rule, in subsection (1)(a), is that the Bill applies to processing done by a data controller who is establised in the United Kingdom. Other EEA member states should be making similar provision, as we heard in our debates this morning, in respect of their own data protection laws.
<P>
Not all controllers carrying out processing in the EEA will be established in the EEA. That possibility is addressed in clause 5(1)(b), which provides that the Bill applies to a controller who is established outside the EEA, but who uses processing equipment in the United Kingdom. An example might be an interactive computer network with equipment in the United Kingdom which is managed from the United States. That is in complete conformity with the directive. However, what the directive requires, but the Bill currently does not, is that controllers to whom clause 5(1)(b) applies must appoint a representative in the United Kingdom. The Government see the function of the representative as essentially a point of contact. He or she will be someone to whom data subjects can turn if they have problems with the processing in question. It will be easier, therefore, for data subjects to contact a person based in the United Kingdom rather than one who is, by definition, established outside the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Briefly, the amendments would improve the clause. A similar point is addressed by the next group of amendments, particularly by amendment No. 21. A problem exists in dealing with data processing that is done outside this country.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which he uses or controls and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a technical amendment, which touches on some of the matters that we discussed this morning. Clause 5(2) seeks to catch people who have some activity in the United Kingdom but who are not based here. The amendment applies to subsection (2) (d), but it is important also to bear in mind subsection (1) (b), which deals with processing performed outside the UK that uses equipment in the UK.
<P>
The question that crossed my mind--and which the amendment may not answer--was: what happens if people do not use equipment? Let us suppose that a person working in London wanted to build a file of information on, say, Members of Parliament. If that person used a Boston-based organisation, which we might call, for the sake of argument, the Welsh detective agency, all the relevant processing would be performed in Boston. However, the information compiled would have to be fed to Boston by an agent or person based in London.
<P>
The Minister may say that the Government cannot do a great deal about that, but subsection (2) (d) seems to try to cover the contingency that I have described by referring to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any person who does not fall within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) but maintains in the United Kingdom--
<P>
(i) an office, branch or agency through which he carries on any activity''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment's phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which he uses or controls''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
came to me when I tried to establish the relationship that I had in mind. We want the clause to be as comprehensive as possible, but there are clear limitations. For instance, where is the cause of action in the circumstances that I have described? If the data controller is way beyond the jurisdiction of the commissioner or of the British courts, how do we catch him?
<P>
This is not so much a probing amendment, but more of a fishing expedition to try to tempt the Minister to tell the Committee what he thinks about the matter. Will the Bill cover the kind of situation that I have in mind? I accept that he has to respond having had no idea of the issues that I intended to raise, and it may be that what I have said is contrary to what was originally anticipated. I apologise to him if that is the case.
<P>
This morning, I made it clear that I am anxious to flag up where the holes might be. We are not worried about bona fide commercial interests that are going about their business in a proper way, and we do not wish to make life unnecessarily difficult for such operations. People around the world can now take advantage of data processing in this country. The activity may not necessarily be based here, but the contacts that they use and control will be. We have just had a discussion about flaming on the internet, and it would be nice to think that such skulduggery came under the provisions of the Bill. I get the impression that the Government had that in mind in when they drafted this part of the clause.

<P>

<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): I recently had a case in my constituency in which a web page offering sexual pictures that was based in British Guyana was advertised using a phone number that appeared to be a number in Beeston in my constituency. That is because, if one dials the number from America, one gets British Guyana, but if one dials it from Britain, one gets Beeston. Several of my constituents were frequently woken up in the middle of the night by people hoping for more than they were going to get. Fortunately, the organisation concerned has an agency in Britain, which I contacted to point out that it was losing custom. The situation was corrected overnight.
<P>
The clause as it stands states that any ``office, branch or agency'' in Britain should be covered, which is to be encouraged. However, the amendment would restrict the clause. It would amend any office, branch or agency to any office, branch or agency
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which he uses or controls''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the case that I have just described, the person who was acting for the American firm was not the owner of the Agency here but was merely employed by it. It was useful that he existed, so I would be reluctant to see this change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall bring us back from sex lines and on to something that is more common to us in our daily lives--that is, the Inland Revenue, which also falls potentially within the clause's ambit. Services like the Inland Revenue are increasingly choosing to contract out their data processing to non-UK and non-EEA companies, who may in turn choose, for commercial reasons, to have data processed in another country, such as India or the Philippines, where labour costs are cheaper. In the same probing spirit as that of the hon. Member for Ryedale, will the Minister clarify how those sorts of situations will operate under the office, branch or agency provisions of the Bill? We seek assurances that they will be brought genuinely under the control of the Data Protection Act, and that British citizens are not denied their rights under the Act because the agency is working entirely in countries outside the UK and the EEA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale said that his purpose is to flag up where the holes might be. I am sure that if he fires off enough amendments, he will eventually find one. He has not yet established the existence of a hole in the Government's views on this occasion. I hope that he will accept the necessity of our resisting amendment No. 21.
<P>
Clause 5 deals with the geographical extent of the Bill, which was mentioned in an earlier debate. Notwithstanding the entreaties of my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn, I shall resist the temptation to explain the precise geographical scope of the Bill at great length in the interests of making further progress.
<P>
I remind the Committee that the basic rule is that the Bill applies where a controller is established in the United Kingdom and the processing is carried out in that context. Subsection (2) sets out the meaning of ``established'' for the purposes of the clause. Subsection (2)(d) brings in any person not covered by the previous paragraphs who maintains in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an office, branch or agency through which he carries on any activity''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That paragraph is needed to ensure that the Bill cannot be circumvented by someone claiming that, although he has an office in the United Kingdom, he is not established here because he works elsewhere for most of the time. The point is that if he does processing in the context of an office that he maintains in the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom law must apply to him.
<P>
The amendment seeks to clarify the provision by stating that the person involved must use or control the office, branch or agency in the United Kingdom for the Bill to apply. I agree in general terms, but I am concerned, in the same way as my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, that the amendment would weaken the provision rather than strengthen it. In any event, the Bill already achieves the effect that the Opposition desire. Subsection 2(d) states that the person concerned must maintain the office. That is coupled with a later requirement for him to carry on an activity through it. Those two requirements cover the elements that the amendment would add: control and use. I hope, therefore, that there is no need to pursue the amendment, and I invite the hon. Member for Ryedale to withdraw it.
<P>
I mentioned the helpful contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe. As a regular visitor to Beeston, I am somewhat concerned about whether it is quite as exciting as he says. No doubt he has the situation firmly under control.
<P>
I am not at all sure whether I can help the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam. His example of someone transferring data for processing to a non-EEA part of the world is specifically included within the definition of who controls the data. That is part of the purpose of the Bill's structure and of the directive. Special provisions will apply to people who do not maintain adequate standards. The organisations referred to, and all organisations firmly established within the United Kingdom, such as the Inland Revenue, will remain in control of that data at all times, notwithstanding where processing occurs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That was a helpful contribution. I am reassured that there are no holes. The Opposition will think about the matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Commissioner and the Tribunal</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 4, line 16, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`following confirmation of his appointment by both Houses of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I can deal with the amendment briefly. The importance of the Data Protection Commissioner will become clearer as the Committee progresses. The Opposition tabled the amendment to question whether the appointment should be confirmed by Parliament. That question is straightforward, and there is nothing that one can add to it. The position will be extremely important and powerful. The relationship between Parliament and the Data Protection Commissioner is important given the much wider application of data protection supervision and legislation. I know from my time on the Select Committee on Home Affairs that over the years the Data Protection Registrar has always appreciated coming to Parliament and explaining his work. One way to strengthen that link is to ensure that that important appointment is approved by Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale has raised an important point, and the Government do not dismiss it lightly. We are considering the significant step of giving Parliament a role in the confirmation of appointments, and we are examining carefully how best to take the matter forward. However, such an approach would have wide implications across government, and it would be wrong to deal with the matter on the piecemeal basis that accepting the amendment would imply.
<P>
I shall begin by explaining how the Bill safeguards the position of the Data Protection Registrar and, in the future, the Data Protection Commissioner. Clause 6, which is supplemented by schedule 5, provides for the office of Data Protection Registrar to continue under the title of Data Protection Commissioner.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As a Crown appointment, the commissioner will only be removable from office by Her Majesty, and the Bill provides that that can only take place following an address from both Houses of Parliament. By these means, the commissioner will be distanced from the Government of the day and cannot be removed from office by the decision of a departmental Minister.
<P>
The Government are satisfied that the constitutional position of the commissioner, as set out in the Bill, meets the directive's requirement for the supervisory authority to be both ``public'' and ``independent''. In practice, commissioners will be appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, who in turn will be advised by the Home Secretary. That method was used, with eminently satisfactory results, to appoint the present registrar and her predecessor under the 1984 Act. The Government are not persuaded that the amendment is either necessary or appropriate at this stage.
<P>
The first report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, otherwise known as the Nolan Committee, recommended that ultimate responsibility for public appointments should remain with Ministers, the overriding principle being selection on merit. Parliament already has considerable powers to call office holders to account. The office of Data Protection Commissioner will be fully within the remit of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, whose own post was established in response to Nolan.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale and other Conservative Members accept that those safeguards will provide a suitable standard to ensure that the Data Protection Commissioner is wholly objective and independent of Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's confirmation that the Government recognise that the matter is serious. Again, we shall ponder on what he has said and perhaps return to the matter later, as a number of issues arise in connection with how orders are to be dealt with by both Houses.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 4, line 25, at end add--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 24, page 4, line 26, leave out `(a) and'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This is an important matter, which I hope can be dealt with relatively quickly. The tribunal established by clause 6 will have an extremely important role and powers. The Bill will extend the regulatory framework covering data processing, but it is vital that the tribunal recognise the needs and interest of business and commerce.
<P>
The key phrase in the Bill with regard to the tribunal's membership is found in clause 6(4)(c), which states that the tribunal shall consist of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such number of other members appointed by the Secretary of State as he may determine.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My immediate throught was, ``Give us a clue. How many, and what sort of members?''
<P>
The previous Government began the consultation process. As the Minister knows, the regulatory appraisal and cost appliance assessment identified five separate business areas as likely to experience significant cost pressures. Those five areas are listed in amendment No. 23. It therefore seemed that a good starting point for the make-up of the tribunal would be to seek a representative from each of the five sectors.
<P>
On the control of costs, I am not saying that it is an open cheque book--that would be discourteous and a gross exaggeration--but business will be asked to pick up the bill not just for the cost of implementation within its own businesses but for the running of the office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the work of the tribunal, through fees that are collected. It seems sensible for those organisations to be represented on the tribunal, because it will rule on matters of everyday practice in relation to disputes between data controllers and data subjects. Someone with the experience of working in those businesses might well have an important role to play.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): I have worked in the financial services sector and know of the differences between the different parts of that sector. I am concerned at the idea of providing for one person to represent all the different sides of the financial services sector, a concern that applies to each of the other categories. I am at a loss to understand how we could find that one person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a good point. As he knows, I, too, have wide experience of the financial services industry. The Bill does not yet provide for any representative from the financial services industry. To discover a mechanism for appointing one such person is one thing, but we are discussing whether the Government think it a good idea to have a broad church of membership representing the interests of the communities that will be affected by the Bill.
<P>
I have no doubt that amendment No. 23 is capable of considerable improvement and refinement. We do not intend to press it to the wire. We are raising these issues of concern to ascertain the Government's view and to explore whether we might want to return to the issue later.
<P>
Amendment No. 24 makes a simple point. While it is certainly right that deputy chairmen should be lawyers, I am not entirely convinced that the chairman of the tribunal needs to be a lawyer. This is not a bash-lawyer point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): Shame!
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Did I hear ``Shame'' from the silent one? This is not an anti-lawyer point. I am simply asking whether the chairman of the tribunal, given the work that he will be asked to do, need necessarily be a lawyer. There is nothing to say that he cannot be a lawyer, but my reading of the Bill is that the intention is that he would be, otherwise it would not be up to the Lord Chancellor to appoint him.
<P>
One can think of a number of people with significant business experience who might be far better placed to chair the tribunals. Their deputies might be lawyers and they would have access to all the legal advice that they required, as we have in Committee through access to the Minister. Bringing that practical experience to the chairmanship of the tribunal seemed to me to be a valuable proposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> May I briefly speak to amendment No. 23? As my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale said, the amendment does not contain a definitive list. It is an attempt to discover what is behind the Bill's drafting.
<P>
I agree with the comment by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) that the finance industry is huge. Some of us have had representations from the Finance and Leasing Association, which accounts for &#163;94 billion of business in this country and is very diverse. There are big issues at stake for industry.
<P>
I did not have a hand in drafting the amendment, although I avidly support it because it is an Opposition amendment. The phrase ``active marketing'' translates into electronic commerce--[Interruption.] At least on this occasion I am actively supporting my Front Bench spokesman, but we shall not go into that. There is an element of electronic commerce in active marketing.
<P>
I have one particular concern. In conversations with people from industries that are involved with information technology, the convergent content area and multimedia, I have been struck by how little awareness they have of some of the Bill's implications for them. The Cable Communications Association, for example, did not have its eye on the ball.
<P>
The issues might be peripheral, but there are several hidden implications for those new industries, which will find themselves conveying data. The television set will become interactive and will be indistinguishable from the personal computer. Many industries will use data in a different form--such as data mining and targeted selling--and they will all have to consider the implications of the processing, costs and handling of data. Previously, they might not have thought that they were affected by such matters. I would be interested in what the Minister says is his ideal response to the list that we have proposed in amendment No. 23.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to both Opposition Members who spoke, and particularly to the hon. Member for Esher and Walton who eloquently persuaded me of how the right the Government are to restrict our approach to the terms of the Bill.
<P>
Given the range of different businesses that could be affected by data protection legislation, it is clearly inappropriate to restrict membership of the tribunal to particular categories of people. I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Ryedale that we should have a broad church of membership. I hope, however, that on reflection he will accept that requiring the Secretary of State to appoint representatives of specific business as lay members of the Data Protection Tribunal--as amendment No. 23 does--would prevent us from allowing the wider range of people to which the hon. Member for Esher and Walton referred to be represented. That would unnecessarily limit the candidates who could be nominated--not least because no suitable candidate from any of the sectors concerned might be available. That would not be a satisfactory position in which to find ourselves. The examples specified in the amendment are all representatives of private sector data controllers. I recognise that the list is not exhaustive; nevertheless, it gives an unbalanced look to the appointments process.
<P>
More fundamentally, the amendment is not the right way to approach the matter. We cannot predict the types of case that will come before the tribunal. The issues that arise might not be sector specific. The need is to have a panel of competent, informed and representative lay members who are able to handle a range of cases.
<P>
The bill provides a flexibility that we would not want to limit. It duplicates the current Act's requirement for lay members to be persons who represent the interests of data subjects and data controllers in such numbers as the Secretary of State might determine. That has worked well in practice under the previous Administration and under the present one. The tribunal currently comprises 31 lay members, 18 of whom represent data users and 13 of whom represent data subjects. They were appointed after consulting a wide range of representative organisations. They include people from a variety of business sectors, as well as those from the public sector and representatives of consumer interests.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On amendment No. 24, I would be the last person to accept that bashing lawyers was appropriate for Members of Parliament. The amendment would remove the requirement for the tribunal chairman to be a lawyer of at least seven years' standing, or even to be a lawyer at all. By contrast, the tribunal's deputy chairman will still have to fulfil the seven-year minimum legal qualification requirement to be eligible for appointment. We believe that to be illogical. The chairman and deputy chairmen must be capable of carrying out the same functions in relation to appeals, although the chairman naturally carries a higher overall level of administrative responsibility.
<P>
The tribunal fulfils a judicial role. Its chairman must be able to make judgments on questions of law in a difficult area. He or she needs to be able to preside with authority over hearings at which the parties may be legally represented, often by experienced barristers. It would be wholly inappropriate for the tribunal to be chaired by a person with limited or no legal expertise. In practice, the exception would be that the chairman would have both legal expertise and judicial experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As to the latter, the Minister and the Government clearly believe that this is in effect a judicial appointment and, in a sense, we accept that. As to the more substantive amendment No. 23, the Minister has confirmed that the intention is that the existing membership of 31 is likely to continue. If I heard him correctly, 18 of those members represent the industries that process data. I should have thought that there would be sufficient scope to include the kind of people that we have suggested in our amendment.
<P>
On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
