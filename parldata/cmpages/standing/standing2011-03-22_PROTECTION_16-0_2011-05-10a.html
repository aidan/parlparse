                           </strong> The hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull North has asked about the fees for the
various requests and systems. New section 30A of the Safeguarding
Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 addresses information on requests—we
worked through the fees in our previous sitting, but the fees are not
finite at this point—and new section 30B addresses the
register.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000029">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked whether there are two systems. Yes, there are two
systems, but they are completely different. The first system provides
updates on the barred register; the other system, which is completely
separate, is the CRB updating system under clause 80. I want to make it
clear that the two systems are
separate.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000030">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes. They are separate systems. An employer
who wants to register for updates on barring will pay one fee, and the

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have had many discussions with employers, the Scouts and many of the
sporting bodies on whether an active arrangement, a reactive
arrangement or a proactive arrangement is better. They each have a
different way of managing their employees or volunteers. Some do it
centrally, some do it at a local level, but they all agree that either
a proactive arrangement or a reactive arrangement would meet their
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000033">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New
section 30B enables persons mentioned in schedule 7 to the
2006 Act, which includes, for example, regulated activity providers and
certain regulatory bodies, to register an interest in individuals
engaged in regulated activity. It requires the Secretary of State to
notify such persons should an individual become barred from regulated
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000034">&#160;</a>

for such information will require the consent of the individual engaged
in regulated activity and, for that purpose, any consent given by an
individual for a barred list check under new section 30A suffices for
consent for registration under new section 30B.

                           </strong> The clause inserts new section 34ZA into the 2006
Act. New clause 34ZA demands that any regulated activity provider must
check whether someone is barred under clause 70 before allowing them to
participate in a regulated activity. That also applies to agencies that
supply
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000040">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have talked a little about the obligation that will be on employers to
carry out a barred status check at the outset of employment, but it
applies only to regulated activity. My understanding is that for
regulated activity an enhanced CRB check will reveal an
individual’s barred status. Perhaps the Minister could confirm
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want the Minister to address a number of issues. What measures will the
Home Office undertake to ensure that activity providers understand the
obligation placed on them by the clause? We have talked a little about
the one-off nature of the check at the outset of employment, but I am
concerned about individual employees who become barred part way through
their employment with employer A, as a supervisor in a Sunday school
setting, for example. In such cases, I am concerned about consent. Will
the Minister explain again why she feels that the consent of the
individual is necessary for an employer to be informed of a barring
decision? What is the explanation and evidence for that? What if that
information were automatically given to the employer if a person became
barred? I am not sure why she feels that we need the extra protection
of obtaining the individual’s consent. How will consent be
established? Will a letter be sent to the employer, or will it be on
one of the forms involved when a CRB check is made in the first place?
I want to be clear about how consent will be
obtained.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000042">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What
about a situation in which someone undertakes a standard enhanced CRB
check? Employers and organisations might think that that is sufficient
to fulfil their duties under the clause. Why not reveal barred status
automatically? That would ensure that employers and organisations were
fully aware of an individual’s current status. I am concerned
that employers might be confused—not so much big employers,
which will have specialists in their HR departments, but small local
groups or organisations that might only do such applications
infrequently. How will they be kept fully up to date on what exactly to
look for and what steps to take? I am a bit concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000043">&#160;</a>

provider of a regulated activity have to pay the two sets
of subscription fees? Again, I want to be clear. I
know that there are two fees, which we discussed in the previous
clause, involved in updating, but will the Minister set it out clearly?
There is the initial application. Is there an additional fee to check
barred status at the beginning, or is that part of the general CRB
check that will be carried out for regulated activity? Will there
effectively be three fees?<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000044">&#160;</a>

requirement to keep up to date? I understand that the Government will
make things clear at the outset of employment, but where is the
requirement for an employer, throughout the course of employment, to
maintain records, check and ensure compliance? That completes what I

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is absolutely right. It is
important that we make it clear what the duty is under new section
34ZA, and we will do so in guidance. Consent is required because it is
sensitive personal information about the individual. The employer will
make a declaration saying that they have the individual’s
consent. It is up to the employer exactly how that is
recorded.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000047">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about the one-off nature. As I said previously, it is
an offence to employ someone who is barred. If an employer provides
regulated activity, they will not want to commit the offence of
employing someone who has been barred. The onus is on the employer, but
I am sure that the employer will check, because the circumstances
around those who provide regulated activities are of the genre that
requires the greatest care. It is not like any job; those who run
schools or care homes have particular
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000048">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful for that clarification. I did not
mean to imply that employers would deliberately set out not to check.
My point was that it might well be confusing for an employer: not
necessarily a big one, but one of the smaller organisations, charities
or voluntary sector groups that faces such checks infrequently. They
might get confused and think that an enhanced CRB check is sufficient,
without looking at the barring information.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000049">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is our job to make it clear in the
guidance that an ordinary enhanced CRB check  is not the be-all
and end-all where regulated activity is concerned. The form will state
what the sector of regulated activity is—children, vulnerable
adults or
both.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000050">&#160;</a>

regulated activity provider can choose to be registered under section
30B if it wants an update on barred status. The regulated activity
provider can also be informed of any updates, including barred status,
under the new updating system detailed in clause 80. There are three
different ways in which that can happen, and the provider can choose to
be part of them all but does not have to

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about consent. That relates to clause 80, so this is
slightly different. There is no requirement under the 2006 Act,
currently, for the employer to continue to check whether current
employees are barred. There are options in the Bill that enable the
employer to be told if an employee becomes barred. Sector-specific
regulations, such as teacher staffing regulations, require periodic
checks, which we believe are best left to the sector-specific
regulations and
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
72 places the duty on employers and other regulated activity providers
to check whether a person is barred before allowing them to engage in
regulated activity. That follows on from the abolition of the
requirements for employees and volunteers to register and be subject to
monitoring, as under the previously planned vetting and barring scheme.
It also replaces the provisions that would have required employers to
check that an individual was subject to monitoring. So now employers or
organisations will have to make sure; it is a duty—and it is an
offence to knowingly employ. It will continue to be a criminal offence
to allow a person to engage in regulated activities, knowing or having
reason to believe that they are barred from such activities. We want to
ensure that the public continue to be protected under the new
arrangements, and the duty ensures that people responsible for placing
individuals in positions of trust with vulnerable groups are duty-bound
to check the suitability of the people they intend to
employ.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to get on the record—the hon. Lady mentioned
this—that the provision places the same duty on personnel
suppliers, such as employment agencies and umbrella groups in the
voluntary sector, who provide people who they know will be, or are
likely to be, engaged in regulated activity. Those personnel suppliers
and agencies will be responsible themselves for ascertaining whether a
person is barred, before allowing them to work in regulated
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to make the situation perfectly clear to the hon. Lady, by
reiterating that we are ensuring that the duties are not too burdensome
by providing three equally valid provisions and means of checking.
First, information can be obtained under the new arrangements under
clause 71 which, with the individual’s consent, allow
information on barred status to be provided by the Secretary of State.
Secondly, a new enhanced criminal record certificate, with the barred
information on it, may be obtained from the Criminal Records Bureau
within the prescribed time scale in respect of regulated activity.
Thirdly, an existing enhanced criminal record certificate presented by
an individual may be checked regarding what update information has been
received in relation to that certificate within the prescribed time
scale, as provided for under clause 80 for continuously updated CRB
checks.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000056">&#160;</a>

three countries. The ISA will have access to the Scottish list, which
it will check. Individuals will be barred from regulated activities if

                           </strong> I seek guidance from the Minister about the
provisions on teachers who are no longer able to teach in the Education
Bill that is currently passing through Parliament. I have previously
raised that informally with the Minister, because I was concerned about
professional bodies that have responsibility for barring individuals
within their own professions. As I understood it, the Education Bill
proposed that the list of teachers who were no longer able to teach
would be made available to the public, and I note that the provision in
clause 74 does not mention disclosure to the general public. It would
be helpful to understand how the bodies that have the power
professionally to bar fit in with that, in terms of names and details
being given out. I know that the Minister is concerned about
people’s privacy and confidential information. How does that fit
with barring information, which is not publicly available and to which
access will be restricted?<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have already
outlined the concerns of the General Social Care Council about the
exchange of information and how its role as a regulator—a body
that can deal with professionals who are not behaving in the correct
professional manner—links with barring. Perhaps the Minister
could say something about that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000074">&#160;</a>

discussion about that earlier. I will address the hon. Lady’s
concerns about the relation to the teaching prohibition list in some
detail if that would be helpful. She has asked why there was a
difference between the proposal in the Education Bill to publish a list
of people who were prohibited from teaching and the unpublished ISA
barred list. Unlike the ISA barred list, the list of those prohibited
from teaching will relate to serious professional misconduct, not to
safeguarding. Serious professional misconduct might be helping a child
to cheat in an exam, or something that is absolutely nothing to do with
harming a child.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000075">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I would assume that the teaching
professional list, as we have said, would make that information
available to the ISA. If the level of harm and information were as the
hon. Lady describes, I would hope that both bodies would consider
between them where, what and which list such an individual was barred
from. I cannot imagine under those circumstances that that information
would not be provided to the ISA and put on the ISA barring
list.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000077">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sure that that is right, but that was not my
point. The Minister has said that the names of people who were
prohibited from teaching as a result of professional misconduct would
be available to the public, but those individuals would equally be on
the ISA barred list, as I understand it, so their names would be
publicly available for the professional misconduct but not for the
barring. I think that that was my point.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000078">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is correct. The hon. Lady is absolutely
right. The Education Bill proposes that the Secretary of State may, in
cases of serious misconduct, make an order to prohibit a person from
teaching, and must keep a list of prohibited teachers. The Bill
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>The Government’s
information note to the Education Bill Committee states that<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000081">&#160;</a>

                        <p>They
are separate things. A member of the public can access the list of
prohibited teachers, but they cannot access the ISA barred list; that
is something completely different.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000082">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The note to
the Education Bill Committee also stated that it provides a statement
of policy intentions for the new arrangements to regulate the teaching
profession, which will be a basis for draft regulations on which there
will be a full public consultation. The plan is for regulations to come
into effect when the Secretary of State’s powers for regulating
the teaching profession commence, which is planned for April 2012. The
information that is published on the list of prohibited teachers will
be very limited, and in common with the policy of enhanced disclosures
for non-regulated activity, the prohibition list will not state whether
the individual has been barred from regulated activity. Instead, very
basic details of the type of behaviour that led to the prohibition
decision will be included. For example, the list might indicate that a
teacher had been convicted of a violent assault, which goes back to the
hon. Lady’s first question, but it would not state that it had
resulted in a safeguarding bar. I hope that those comments have been
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000083">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Is the Minister worried that the measure might
lead to information about barring being made available to the public?
The intention of the clauses that we have been discussing over the past
few days has been to restrict barring information right down to only
the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 608<a class="bkMark" name="Column608">&#160;</a>
                           </div>regulated activity providers, but it seems that anyone will be able to
go and look at a list. Such a list might contain
information on violent assaults or inappropriate relationships with
pupils. Would that not mean that general barring information would now
be
available?<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000084">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Violent assault would be a criminal
conviction, I imagine, so that information would be available any which
way. That is a matter for those people who create the teaching list to
decide on. The General Teaching Council prohibition decisions have been
made public since the council started in the late 1990s, and list 99
was not published during all that period. The Opposition had an
opportunity to unify those systems when they were in government; they
chose not to do so, so I do not understand why they now want to take
issue with the system, which has not
changed.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000085">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To respond to that, we have spent a great deal of
time debating restricting barring information and I understand the
rationale that the Government are presenting for doing so. I am
pointing out, however, that in other legislation that the Government
are taking through the House at present, there is a provision under
which information that the Government do not want to make available
will be available to the public. That is the inconsistency. I am unsure
whether the Government fully understand the departmental problems that
are arising between the Department for Education and the Home
Office.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000086">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We do understand, but the professional
teaching barred list operates under a completely different system. The
sort of people who look at the list for information to see whether they
should employ a teacher will have a separate duty to find out whether
that person is barred. Professional misconduct based on an
inappropriate relationship with a pupil that did not lead to a
conviction would lead to the ISA deciding whether to bar the person. It
would not, however, by definition, always lead to a bar. In the
Education Bill, the provision concerns teaching only, not regulated
activity—some teaching is not regulated
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000087">&#160;</a>

explained when I responded to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull
North. When a professional organisation considers that it is dealing
with something worth mitigating, it will decide. It has the first call
on the situation and on the right action to take. It will then
transfer, consult with and give the information to the ISA, if there is
any concern about there needing to be a bar. The ISA and all the
relevant regulators will be able to share information where
appropriate, and I hope they will. I do not view them as organisations
that have no contact or care about what the others are doing. They are
a uniform group, who care about education for children. Some of the
information is appropriate to the teachers’ prohibited list;
other information is to do with barring, which is held by the ISA and

                           </strong> I just want to ask the Minister a few questions
about the clause, which makes amendments to the provision of
information to supervisory authorities. The example quoted in the
explanatory notes is Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools in
England, which will be one of the organisations to which information
could be provided. Subsection (1) replaces the duty on a supervisory
authority to provide information that may be relevant to a barring
decision with the discretion to do so. Why has the hon. Lady made such
a provision a discretion, not a duty? Subsection (3) ensures that any
obligation to provide children’s barred list information to a
supervisory authority does not apply if the Secretary of State is
satisfied that the supervisory authority already has that information.
Why has she decided to introduce that provision? It might, in effect,
weaken the flow of

                           </div>information, given that it makes the action to send off the information
to the supervisory authority an additional
requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(5) alters the obligation on the ISA to provide the supervisory
authority with information to a “power” to do so, and it
limits the supervisory authority’s ability to request
information under section 50 of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act
2006 to a situation in which the information is required in connection
with one of its functions. What was the thinking behind that change? Do
the subsections not weaken the ability to make sure that everyone is
kept informed and that the important flow of information actually
happens? Why not take a belt-and-braces approach to ensure that the
supervisory authority as well as the ISA knows what it needs to
know?<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000103">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are back to the same push-and-pull in
respect of what is proportionate and balanced. Clause 75 does indeed
change what was a duty to provide prescribed information when the
referral criteria are met, and amends it to a power to provide any
relevant information when the referral criteria are met. That is a
sensible and more proportionate approach to information sharing between
the supervisory bodies and the Independent Safeguarding Authority, as
it allows the supervisory body the discretion to make a referral when
it has reached a decision about whether or not it is appropriate to
make a referral and to decide what information is appropriate to
provide.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000104">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For example,
the Care Quality Commission might determine that an individual is no
longer suitable to be a registered manager because, while engaged in
regulated activity, that person harmed a patient or placed them at risk
of harm. Following investigation into the care practices of a care home
or clinic, the Care Quality Commission might decide to refer the worker
to the ISA. In other words, the Commission will be able to do what it
considers best to protect children or vulnerable adults. That is the
right approach, because the Commission is first in line, given its
responsibilities and remit. If it is involved, it can judge whether a
case needs to be referred or whether there is another way to deal with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000105">&#160;</a>

makes consequential amendments to section 47 of the Safeguarding
Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 to provide a power for a supervisory
authority to ask the Independent Safeguarding Authority if someone is
barred from regulated activity with children or vulnerable adults. The
ISA has a duty to provide that information. A supervisory authority can
seek that information only if it is required in connection with the
exercise of its functions. As ever, it is about a proportionate
response and not giving information that is not relevant, necessary or
appropriate under those
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000106">&#160;</a>

addressing. If the Care Quality Commission goes in and makes a judgment
that a case needs to be referred to the ISA for barring, it has made a
judgment to take it one stage further in relation to someone being
barred from regulated activity. If, on the other hand, the Care Quality
Commission finds another means—it has a number of remedies for
mitigating circumstances—it can apply a different and a more
proportionate circumstance, but a judgment has to be made in the first
place. Not everything is referred all the
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000109">&#160;</a>

I was saying, the information flows provided for will enable a
supervisory authority to be advised of barring decisions relevant to
their functions. Although a supervisory authority may apply to the
Independent Safeguarding Authority in relation to whether a person is
barred in connection with their functions, there is no proactive
information flow for barring decisions in all relevant cases. That
matter was raised by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North. The
Secretary of State will be able to confirm identity in relevant cases
and ensure that supervisory authorities are advised of all barring
decisions involving their professional
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000114">&#160;</a>

own initiative or in response to a request from a supervisory

relevant to the supervisory authority in relation to the protection of
children or vulnerable adults. That will provide flexibility in
relation to information flows between the Independent Safeguarding
Authority and supervisory authorities, and help to prevent any
safeguarding information
gaps.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000115">&#160;</a>

essentially technical or drafting in nature. Amendment 187
removes section 93 of the Policing and Crime Act 2009 which, if
commenced, would amend the Police Act 1997 so that criminal conviction
certificates, which include unspent convictions, would need to be
copied to employers by the Secretary of State. Such a requirement would
be contrary to the broader intention of clause 77, which will remove
the requirement to copy criminal records certificates to
employers.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000144">&#160;</a>

we will discuss when we consider amendment 208, clause 77 removes the

of the Police Act 1997, making it a requirement for a CRB
check request to state whether the CRB check was required to enable
work with vulnerable adults or children, or both. That is linked with
the portability of CRB checks, which Sunita Mason called for in her
report. The amendments would mean that the police could clearly see
what the CRB check was being requested for and thus decide what
information to release. The Minister will recall that during the
evidence sessions we heard about the problems that the
police have in deciding which information to disclose and its
relevance. Amendments 211 and 212 are probing amendments,
because the issue of how to deal with the practicalities of the police
knowing for which sector the CRB check is
required may already be in the Minister’s mind. I seek
reassurance that Sunita Mason’s recommendation will be taken up

183 to 186 are about the Secretary of State’s general power to

requested to enable the individual to work with children.
Amendment 184 would provide that an individual, when requesting a CRB
check, had to state whether they wanted it to be subject to

individual to state whether any application made under the updating
process would be for the purposes of working with vulnerable adults or

whether there will be enough information in CRB checks and how the
separate categorisation of children and vulnerable adults will work. At

am grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North for her
explanation of the amendments. I appreciate that they are probing
amendments. I do not think that they are necessary because their

                        <p class="tabbed">When
criminal record disclosures relate to working with children or
vulnerable adults, there is no need for additional legal provisions to
specify that both the individual enhanced criminal record certificates
that are issued and any updates to such certificates are only
applicable for work with children, vulnerable adults, or both.
Furthermore, there is no need for further provision requiring a CRB
application to contain a statement as to whether the applicant works or
intends to work with children and/or vulnerable adults, given that the
application form already provides for that. Eligibility for an enhanced
criminal record certificate has to be, in any case, for one of the
“prescribed purposes” that are set out in regulations.
The purposes include working in<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000160">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The
type of work to which the certificate relates will therefore be clear
to the applicant, the employer and the police when they make a judgment
about what they reasonably believe to be
relevant.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
deciding which locally held police information over and above the
convictions and cautions that appear on the national police computer
should be disclosed, the police will consider the prescribed purpose
for which the certificate is to be issued. Such a purpose might be
working with children, with vulnerable adults or with both. The update
information that will be available under the new provisions of the
Bill—we will come later to how updating will be done—will
also take account of the prescribed purpose for which the certificate
was originally issued. Therefore, if an update advises that a new
certificate should be sought, that will be either because there has
been a new conviction or new caution information since the original
certificate was issued, or because there is new relevant information at
local police level that relates to the purpose prescribed in relation
to that
certificate.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000163">&#160;</a>

broad terms, a certificate relevant to working with children will be
updated for work with children, a certificate relevant to working with
vulnerable adults will be updated for work with vulnerable adults, and
a certificate relevant to both types of work will be updated for both.
The system should not allow misuse of certificates or updates, which is
when they are issued in relation to one sector but are used to obtain
work in another sector. That is what the system is for. However, we
will ensure that there is clear guidance for applicants and employers
that spells that out and emphasises the link between the updating
system and the prescribed purpose for which a certificate was
originally issued.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000164">&#160;</a>

that information so clearly. Can she envisage a situation when, for
instance, a CRB check with information about working with vulnerable
adults is taken to an employer? Could there be confusion for the
employer or a small voluntary organisation if they are presented with a
CRB check that has information that relates to adults when there are
concerns about the person working with children? For instance, someone
who has worked with vulnerable adults may have been involved in
stealing, or there may have been allegations of theft, which means that
they are not suitable for working with children. I am trying to
understand whether there could be confusion for employers and voluntary
sector groups about when a CRB check is appropriate for a particular
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000165">&#160;</a>

activity is with children, the certificate has to clear the person to

adults, the certificate has to clear the person to work with vulnerable
adults. The guidance must ensure that it is crystal clear that there
can be no switching and no swapping, so that there is no confusion. We
do not want someone who is suitable in one sector—or unsuitable
in one sector, for that matter—somehow convincing an employer
that because they have a CRB check certificate that shows they are okay
to work with adults, they must be okay to work with children. That is
clearly not the case, and I thank the hon. Lady for putting it on

“I’ve forgotten the certificate,” or,
“I’m waiting for it to come.”? What time scale
does the Minister envisage before employers can say, “You need
to bring that certificate in today.”? I know that there are time
scales for processing CRB checks—the outer limit is 60 days,
although most are dealt with in a much shorter period—but I
would welcome the Minister’s view on how organisations would
deal with people claiming that there was a long delay in receiving

of the evidence sessions. The police felt that it was important to tell
a prospective employer that there might be an issue connected to the
individual, but did not want to disclose it in the CRB check because it
might alert the individual or cause problems for the police
investigation. The clause would remove the ability for the police to
provide information in a brown envelope. The amendments are probing

disclose. That would be wrong. We need to look to history. In the
Huntley case, for instance, Humberside police held information about a
series of allegations against Ian Huntley that did not result in
convictions, but it was soft intelligence that needed to be passed

my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull North and the hon.
Member for Northampton North, I have one or two questions for the
Minister. We are not dealing with a court of law. I am not a
lawyer—I always feel relieved that I am not—but I
understand that the issue relates more to employment law than to
criminal law. From my involvement with disputes and industrial
tribunals, when I was an elected member in local government many years
ago, I understand that a lower level of evidence is required in
employment law for making decisions about employment matters. I see
that my legal adviser on the Conservative Back Bench, the hon. Member
for Northampton North, is confirming
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Effectively,
we are dealing with people in a form of employment, albeit voluntary,
and for whom checks will be undertaken. I wonder what difference the
clause will make if the police can still pass on soft information that
is not proven or does not arise from any sort of conviction. As I have
already mentioned, my former life was in local government. I was the
chair of the social services committee when child protection issues
were very sensitive. In my local authority, but before my time, we had
the death of Kimberley Carlile, and after I entered the local authority
there was the inquiry and everything that followed. That case made
people very concerned about child protection issues, and they erred on
the side of caution in such matters. Are not the police likely to apply
that right across the board and, in effect, nullify the intentions of
the clause? In child protection issues, people are rightly loth to make
mistakes in the information they record and are likely to set a higher
standard for that information and ensure that it is passed on to ensure
that children are protected to the highest degree, even though there
might not be a conviction behind it.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000187">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s point first. Coming from Haringey, which has gone
through the cases of Victoria Climbié and Baby P, I know that he
is entirely right. When it comes to child protection, people are
extremely nervous—rightly so—of all that has gone before.

the brown envelope information to which the hon. Member for Kingston
upon Hull North referred, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton

not that they will not, at their discretion, use common law powers to
pass on information that they

Committee was of a person the police were currently investigating as a
paedophile, and who had applied for a job with children. I cannot
imagine a police force that would not use common law powers to pass on
that information to the would-be employer. That is the nature of the

changed since then, which is why the previous Government
introduced—with the best of intentions—the vetting and
barring system, and why we are scaling it back to what we regard as a
more proportionate common-sense level. The police will use the common
law powers and disclose information if it is necessary to do so, and I
argue that the example given by the police chief was a case when it was
necessary to do so and that doing so was proportionate to the aim that
was sought. It is a different test, but the police are accustomed to
using their common law

whole point of changing the system, because there would be no
opportunity for the person who had applied for a job—a job to be
given, or not, perhaps on the basis of information received—to
make representations before the employer saw what was on the
certificate. Our intention throughout is to be proportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000196">&#160;</a>

information is correct or whether there has been a mistake, perhaps of
duplicated identity. It gives

or the possibility of tampering or doctoring, the certificate is a
secure document, and it is used together with an online verification
process, which will ensure that employers are protected against
potential fraud. The certificate will be no less secure than a driving
licence, university degree or any such similar piece of

the speed of dispute resolution, which was another concern raised by
the hon. Lady, the Criminal Records Bureau anticipates that such
challenges, which it refers to as disputes, will still be completed in
about 4 weeks in the majority of cases. In March 2011, the CRB resolved
97.9% of disputes within 21 days.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000205">&#160;</a>

we are going to debate an extension of the appeals procedure when we
move on to a later clause. The procedure will be open to anyone who
wishes to dispute the accuracy or whether information should
actually  be on the CRB certificate, so if there is a
three-stage process, which is my understanding of the amendment, is the
Minister still confident that that will be dealt with within 4 weeks?
If we have another police force getting involved, a potential referral
to the independent monitor, and also potentially an application to the
Secretary of State if they believe the information is inaccurate, with
the greatest of respect to the Home Office, I know that things can take
rather longer than we would like them to take. So, is 4 weeks really
how long it will
take?<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000206">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not think we are going to put a time
limit on it. The hon. Lady is right—there may be more than one
police force and more than one process to go through. Nevertheless, it
will not be too tardy. Sunita Mason put an outside frame of 60 days on
any process in terms of disputes. That is something that we will be
working through, but I do not think it will be particularly tardy. It
is more important to make sure that that person has the right to
dispute the information so that they can deal with a false allegation
or a mistaken identity prior to the employer seeing it. Of course, they
will explain to the employer that there has been a mistake, or they
will be in conversation with the organisation about why they cannot
take up their voluntary post until they are cleared. They will be able
to have that conversation and explain why they are not able to move as
quickly as they would have liked. The employer will make of that what
they will. I am assuming that if they want the volunteer, and the
volunteer is talking to them and explaining why there is a delay and
they are taking up a dispute and asking for resolution, the employer
will understand and
wait.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000207">&#160;</a>

paedophiles can be wily people, who can use all sorts of ways to access
opportunities to be with children. If an individual wants to get hold
of children for purposes that we would all think are dreadful, they may
well be able to say, “The certificate hasn’t
come,” or “I’m considering appealing” or
whatever. They may be able to put themselves in a position where they
are getting access to children, because they are the only ones who have
seen the CRB certificate. The employer or organisation is at a
disadvantage in not knowing information about someone that they should
know.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000208">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady asked about adding delays to the process. Over the past few
months, in general terms, the CRB has made massive improvements in the
processing times for certificates. I should know, because I am the
Minister who has to sign off all the letters. People used to complain
about how long the process took, but those times have now been enhanced
considerably. In April 2011, the CRB was issuing 95.1% of enhanced
certificates within 28 days. In March 2011, that figure was 95.4%.

am grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North for the
explanation of the amendments, but she is seeking to reverse the whole
purpose of clause 77, by providing that registered bodies continue to
receive  a copy of the CRB certificate. While we accept that
clause 77 may mean that employers change how they operate
criminal record checking, we are not persuaded that it would be a
significant change. We firmly believe that any marginal inconvenience
caused to employers is outweighed by the much increased fairness in the
disclosure
process.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have to remember that it is important that all the users of the CRB
system, such as the individual applicants, employers and voluntary
bodies, have full confidence in the disclosure service. We have to
ensure that it is proportionate, so that the need to protect the
vulnerable is balanced against the rights of the applicants that use
the service to have the opportunity to question, dispute or make
representations on any information that might blight their career
chances.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
issuing of the certificates was one of the issues looked at by the
Government’s independent adviser for criminality information
management, Sunita Mason, who was appointed by the previous Government.
I have found her a most competent and able adviser in her recent review
of the criminal records regime. Hon. Members will remember that she
gave evidence to the Committee. As we have said, one of the biggest
criticisms of the criminal records process—the one that has been
recognised by the courts as problematic—is that where
information exists, particularly non-conviction information released by
a police force, the applicant does not have a chance to review and
challenge that information before it is released to an employer. Even
when the applicant is successful in disputing any information
post-issue, the problem is that once the employer has seen that
information, they do not forget. They have a no-smoke-without-fire
approach. Once the employer has seen that, the applicant can make all
the representations they want, saying, “It wasn’t meant
to be on there; it’s a mistake,” but it is extremely
difficult to believe. Some of us will have had constituents come to us
with information on CRB certificates involving some allegation made
about them to the police. I have often come across such cases. By
providing the certificate to the applicant only, the Bill puts the
applicant in control of the disclosure of the information contained in
their criminal record
certificate.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Also,
if someone receives a certificate, reads it and sees information that
they know to be true, they might simply withdraw their application for
the job. They will not proceed, because they will be discovered in the
end. They can dispute that information, but the information is
there.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 77
allows the applicant to make a request to the CRB for a review. It then
allows the applicant the opportunity to approach a prospective or
current employer and provide further explanation of a conviction or
other information contained in the certificate. One would hope that
ultimately, depending on what the conviction or caution is, a developed
employer would not simply dismiss the person but might work with them,
depending on what they thought about the other checks
and  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 624<a class="bkMark" name="Column624">&#160;</a>
                           </div>references and what else the person had been doing with their life. A
CRB check is not the beginning and end of
employment or volunteering.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The provisions
work together with the updating provisions in clause 80. The applicant
would be issued with one certificate and would use that certificate for
future applications, as an employer will be allowed to check for
updates on the updating system. As I said, that provides for a fairer
system. Some 92% of criminal record certificates are clear. In such
cases, the applicant will be able to pass a copy of the certificate to
their future employer or the voluntary body straight away. Even in the
remaining 8% of cases where the certificate contains a conviction or
other information, the applicant may not wish to dispute it, so again a
copy of the certificate can be passed quickly to the
employer.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A very small
minority of cases in which the applicant wishes to dispute the
information, will involve some delay for the employer or voluntary body
in receiving a copy of the certificate, but overall, it is a much more
proportionate approach and gives the applicant an opportunity to
dispute the information. I hope that I have persuaded the hon. Lady of
the case for the provisions and that she will accordingly agree to
withdraw her amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000217">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We had a debate about the CRB check being sent
only to the applicant and not to the employer or the charity. I
understand the position that the Minister has taken, but I want to use
this opportunity to highlight the organisations that have sent in quite
lengthy submissions. In particular, I want to refer to the submission
from Rob Dawson, who is the institutional compliance officer at the
university of Chester. His comments are based on experience in his
day-to-day work, which, he
says,<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000279">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“has,
since the inception of the CRB, involved overseeing CRB checking of
students at the University of Chester. These experiences are further
supplemented by my work with the CRB and ISA as Chair of the
CRB’s Education Consultative Group. I have also been a member of
a Universities UK/GuildHE working
party”,<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000461">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>which
has been involved in the vetting and barring scheme in previous years.
He raises a particular concern about clause 77 for higher
institutions:<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
University of Chester undertakes approximately 1,700 CRB checks per
annum, chiefly in respect of applicants aged 18/19. Most checks are on
students who enrol on programmes of study that involve regulated
activity, e.g. initial teacher training, nursing, midwifery and social
work, and most are undertaken between August and September, shortly
before the commencement of the academic
year”.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000462">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>There
is obviously huge pressure on that institution to process those checks
to ensure that all those students are properly eligible to start their
courses. Under the current system, a higher education institution
receives copies of the CRB check, and the institution can formalise
that it is appropriate for the student to be on the course and that
everything is satisfactory. His concern about the new changes is that a
great deal of administration will have to be put in place. Although he
does not say so, those 18 or 19-year-olds who are moving away from
home—perhaps for the first time—and starting at a

                           </div>higher education institution will receive the CRB checks at their home
addresses, which may be some way from the university of Chester. He
suggests that having to chase them to ensure the CRB checks are
received and processed places a logistical burden on the university.
That concern is genuine and it would be helpful if the Minister, with
the help of her officials, could give some practical thought to how the
measure will affect the HE sector that runs courses in the areas where
regulated activity will apply.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister consider the suggestion that Rob Dawson sets out in his
submission, which he thinks might be helpful? He asks for consideration

                        <p class="hs_brev">“with

                        </p>
                        <p>He believes that such a
system would be neither costly nor burdensome for the CRB and would
enable registered bodies that undertake a large number of checks at
particular periods to know whom to contact for sight of the disclosure
document. He goes on to state that his proposal accords with
recommendation 4 of Sunita Mason’s report. It would be helpful
if the Minister considered that suggestion.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000284">&#160;</a>

also comments that an impact of the change on higher education
institutions might be a loss of income, because<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000285">&#160;</a>

students.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000465">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
might mean that the university loses out on the finances for that year
for that student, but also that the student is delayed for a further
year before commencing the course. He states that it is often difficult
if a student has to wait and start a course a month or two later. A lot
of information is contained in the inductions for the types of courses
that the measure relates to, which the student will have missed. He
makes some genuine points about the effect of the clause on a
sector-specific problem and I would be grateful if the Minister
considered those.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister also have regard to other submissions, such as one that
arrived only yesterday, from the Sport and Recreation Alliance and the
Child Protection in Sport Unit, which are well respected bodies? They
raise concerns about the clause and some of the issues that I have
already discussed in relation to Girlguiding UK. They, too, are
concerned about the big administrative burden on sports groups in
dealing with the change and about chasing up CRB checks with volunteers
and individuals. Will she give some further thought to organisations,
groups, charities and sports groups that might have very limited
resources in tackling the change?<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000287">&#160;</a>

measure again include the Lawn Tennis Association, British Judo,
British Rowing, Volleyball England, the Football Association, Badminton
England, England Netball, and the British Canoe Union. That is a full
list of sports activities that take place around the country. The
organisations are obviously raising genuine concerns about how the
provision will impact on their sports. It would be
helpful to consider

be sent to the organisation or the employer. Will the Minister comment
on that suggestion?<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000289">&#160;</a>

received a submission from a local group, the Wiltshire and Swindon
Activity and Sports Partnership. It raised some clear concerns about
the one-disclosure procedure that will operate under clause
77. It believes that there will be problems. What it says in particular
about sports organisations is that<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000290">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“there can be a
less formal structure and less opportunity for the ‘handing
over’ of this information. In addition the infrastructure of
many sporting and recreation organisations relies on the centralised
management offered by a national governing body. The centralised
management by an NGB ensures consistency across a sport (from club to
club); that decisions are made by an experienced individual; and that a
club level volunteer is not overburdened with information about
individuals they know on a personal level that will affect their
relationships and ultimately may influence their
judgements.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000466">&#160;</a>

the second-largest umbrella body in England and Wales, processing
500,000 CRB applications since 2002. Its submission goes through, in
full detail, some of the problems with clause 77. It also picks up and
comments on the issue of fraud. I want the Minister to address that
again. I know that in her response to my hon. Friend the Member for
Gedling she said that she did not think that there was going to be a
problem. TMG CRB

vital part of the Registered Body (RB) administration role is to ensure
that a Disclosure has been produced for the correct applicant. This
will be even more critical with the introduction of portability. The RB
should always carry out a data matching exercise, ensuring the ID check
is carried out rigorously and personal details printed on a Disclosure
match those on the Disclosure application. We can evidence many cases
where a Disclosure has been produced with incorrect personal details
including submissions made via eBulk. This includes a case where a date
of birth error resulted in a clear Disclosure being produced for an
individual who was guilty of murdering a child. Without a copy of the
Disclosure, an RB cannot carry out this quality assurance role. The
applicant now has a ‘clear Disclosure’ to present to a
subsequent employer. Any online update would be based on this erroneous
Disclosure.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000467">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>I have become more concerned about the
clause as our discussions have gone on. I am the chair of the
management group of a voluntary organisation with 13 acres of sports
facilities, which provides a wide range of sporting activities. What
has come through in much of the evidence supplied to the Committee is
the fact that many organisations rely on centralised bodies to make
decisions relating to the information on CRB checks, one purpose of
which is to provide consistency. The example cited by my hon. Friend
shows that people, such as me, who run such organisations in our spare
time are volunteers. We rely on centralised organisations to make
decisions. Under the current arrangements, they would be the recipients
of the
information.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
system is automated, and sport is one of the areas involved because of
the wide range of volunteers who help to organise such activities in
the community for vulnerable groups and children. We must bear in mind
the loose and voluntary nature of those organisations; for example,
people who run football teams often do so in their spare time because
of the sheer pleasure that such facilities provide for young people in
the community. Such tasks are onerous, and the arrangements place the
responsibility on such people to chase up individuals who may have left
the information behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or for possibly
more worrying reasons might want to delay its
disclosure.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000299">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
all respect a person’s desire to have the opportunity to correct
information, but at the same time, we must put the protection of young
people at the heart of what we do. One of the criticisms of the
existing arrangements is that the system is overbearing and burdensome
on voluntary organisations. However, those organisations are saying
that the provisions under the Bill will do exactly the opposite and
will place a far greater burden on local sports organisers, for
example. They will have to chase up the checks to make sure that they
are provided so that they can send information to the centralised
organisation to make decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000300">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
boxing club at my youth club, and the Amateur Boxing Association makes
the centralised decisions and is the governing body. People would have
to chase up the individual, send the details to the

                           </div>body and wait for a decision, but all those involved  in the
boxing club are volunteers and help in their  spare time. Far
from being a liberating change to the arrangements, the provision will
be more onerous on the very people at the sharp end who are
volunteering and providing their
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000301">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
success will the change have? What information will be recorded on the
check? It is likely that the police, when placing information on the
checks, will err on the side of caution because of what is involved.
What are the consequences for the police if they say that certain
matters are not relevant and then suddenly they are? We all know what
follows when there are major incidents relating to child abuse cases.
Quite rightly, a review takes place to find exactly what went wrong.
Everyone involved is loth to be criticised for having let something
slip
through.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000302">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
suspect that because people will err on the side of caution, it will
negate the intentions of the clause. At the moment, they have no
discretion—they must disclose—but in future, they will
have to make decisions. If they lack the time to carry out effective,
detailed reviews of all the information in front of them, I suspect
that they will make quick decisions: “That’s relevant to
children; that has got to go in.” I doubt whether it will reduce
the amount of information not backed up by criminal convictions that is
passed on anyway.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000303">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The real
concern is the extra burden that the measures will place on the very
people we should be seeking to relieve of such responsibilities. The
Lawn Tennis Association and other sports associations have said that
due to the very nature of how sport is organised and how people become
involved in it, the opportunity for mistakes or delays that could have
catastrophic consequences is enormous. We may want to return to the
measures later. I sincerely hope that the Government will think again
and, given the evidence that numerous organisations have provided for
us, reconsider their position on the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000304">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Before I answer as many points as I can, I
bring the Committee’s attention back to the main purpose of
clause 77, which is to enable disputes to be resolved. We should not
lose sight of how important that is to the rights of the individual in
a situation where they can be deeply discriminated against in their job
prospects, with life-affecting results. That is the purpose of the
clause. There might be a slight delay every now and then, but it will
be totally outweighed by the benefits to the overall process of
enabling disputes to be resolved.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000305">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Both the hon.
Lady and the hon. Member for Eltham raised the issue of the small or
voluntary local sports group that will be greatly burdened. Those
groups can still use a larger organisation to submit CRB applications,
such as the scouts, the guides or even the local authority. That
happens now, and it will continue. The little group can use an umbrella
organisation. The CRB will still go to the individual first, but that
is how the application can be made.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I listened to
what the hon. Lady said about the burdens on higher education
institutions. She used the example of Chester university. Students must
complete a variety of paperwork before being accepted on any course.
They must get themselves together in a great many ways in which they
are not necessarily practised, but they still manage to enrol properly.
After they enrol in college or university, they must sort out their
course, their accommodation and their student loan. We should not
underestimate the ability of 18 and 19-year-olds to get their house in
order. I heard what she said about having to chase unwilling
18-year-olds to submit their certificates, but they are chased for all
the things that they must submit in order to enrol in a college. I do
not think, particularly in training colleges—I think nursing and
teaching were mentioned—that those students would be
irresponsible and not able to understand that before the course begins
they need to have cleared and gone through the CRB. There is so much to
do when someone goes to college, and that is what people do. I accept
that colleges will need to modify their processes, but I do not think
that it is for me to recommend how they should do it. I am sure that it
is not beyond their ability to deal with those issues, because the
admissions process itself is burdensome. That is one part of it, but as
I said, the pull-back is to the fairness of the situation and to the
ability of an individual to dispute any untoward, unfair, irrelevant or
wrong information or a wrong
identity.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000311">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not favour the idea of sending a letter or the certificate at a
later date. The person who enrolled might not turn up. A job applicant
might not still be doing the same thing. I do not think that a time lag
will be helpful to the safeguarding intentions that we all have for the
process that we are
developing.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000312">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It was certainly not my intention to say that any
information should be disclosed in the letter, other than that the CRB
check had been sent to the individual. I do not think that there will
be a problem with safeguarding personal information. The letter would
just tell the employer or organisation that a CRB check had been
issued. That was the purpose of the
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000313">&#160;</a>

If the information was disclosed simultaneously to the registered

and says, “I am disputing that because it is wrong,” and
it is found to be wrong and corrected, have we balanced the harm done
to that individual against the potential harm to vulnerable individuals
such as children? Are we getting that balance

getting it right and that we are rebalancing the system in an
appropriate and proportionate way. We will just have to leave that
question, because we simply do not agree with the Opposition. I was
just going on to the issue of fraud, which the hon. Member for Kingston
upon Hull North raised, but I think that I have already answered most
of the questions on that topic by saying that the checks will have the
same status, authority, safety and security that one would have with a
driving licence or similar important
document.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000316">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding
the time lag of four weeks, the applicant may have withdrawn the
application in that time, so sending a letter, or even, as I think was
also suggested, a copy of the certificate, at a later date would not be
appropriate. A situation can change in four weeks. What is quite
miraculous about the updating process, which we will come to later, is
that someone can do it literally within 10 minutes if they go online. I
think that the portability of CRB checks, which has long been an issue,
will be welcomed by all
parties.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000317">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Eltham said that the issue was about disputing not just
the accuracy of the information, but whether the information is
relevant and ought to be disclosed, because the process has to balance
everyone’s rights. There is a whole range of possibilities for
disputes, even before we get on to the processes when there is a double
identity—when a person receives someone else’s record
rather than their own because they have the same birth date or the same
name as another person. That is one of the mistakes that happens in the
CRB system from time to time.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000318">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will try to get that information. The
overriding, key point is that anyone under the age of 16 should be
closely supervised because they are not of the age of responsibility
for looking after children or vulnerable adults. They are too young to
be left in that position, which is why, I presume, Sunita Mason
alighted on the age of 16. The Scout Association and the National
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children support her
recommendation, seeing 16 as an age under which young people should not
be left alone in such
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000353">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the previous regime, if under-16s had cleared CRB checks, there might
have been a temptation on the part of the
organisation—particularly in sport, as the hon. Gentleman
said—to believe that it was okay to leave them. That would have
been a risk, because 2.47% of the 7,801 checks on people under 16
showed some criminal information. The point is that no child should be
left alone to look after another child or a vulnerable adult in such
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly,
different situations arise, for example fostering, adoption and
same-house peer exemptions, but there should not be a situation whereby
someone under 16 works unsupervised with children or vulnerable adults.
It was asked whether individuals can access their criminal record by
way, for example, of a subject access request. A 12-year-old could have
a conviction record and be unable to get a CRB
certificate.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">On
the positions that under-16s hold, 2,500 applications in the January to
December 2010 sample were for voluntary posts, and 904 were for
sports-related positions, including football coaches, referees, cricket
scorers, poolside attendants and gymnastics coaches. Another 1,180 were
for educational positions that included the words
“student” or “placement”, 157 were in
relation to fostering and adoption, and 1,219 were work-related and
included the words “placement”,
“experience”, “care”, “nursery
teacher” and “children’s”. Only 2.47% of
the checks revealed any conviction or other relevant information. I
think that that answers all the points that have been raised—or
have I omitted
one?</p>

amendment 189 will provide for any dispute application about the
accuracy of police information on an enhanced criminal record
disclosure to be referred to the independent monitor appointed under
section 119B of the Police Act 1997. That is important
because it will ensure that there is a fully independent element to the
disputes process whereby the inclusion of local police information is
challenged. In addition, the amendment will provide for persons other
than the applicant to challenge the accuracy of information in a
criminal records certificate. That merely recognises what sometimes
already happens in practice—for example, where the employer or
another registered body with an interest in the application disputes
police
information.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000368">&#160;</a>

Under-Secretary produced for the Committee setting out the background
to Government amendments 188 and 189 that an individual who had
received a CRB check and was not satisfied with the information on it
could request a review from the police force that provided the check. I
want to be clear about this; does the Minister expect that to be the
first step, so if the person still was not satisfied with the review,
they could go to a different police force to review the application and
the information provided? After that, does the applicant have a further
right of appeal to the independent monitor? I am trying to understand.

it, an applicant for a CRB check can apply to the Secretary of State
for information to be reviewed if they believe that it is inaccurate.
They also have a right to go back to the police force about information
that they think is irrelevant and should not be on the record, and a
further right to go to another police force to ask it to review the
record. At the end of that, do they also have the right to go to the
independent monitor? I am trying to understand how we have ended up
here. It is absolutely right that a criminal records check can be
challenged where information is inaccurate, incorrect or irrelevant,

process were not clear. A factual dispute would go to the police force,
but it would be a different force from the first police force, so that
is what is meant by any chief police officer. It is about not having to
go back to the force that may have chosen to include the information on
the certificate in the first place, so the proposals are strengthened
by stating “any…chief officer”.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000376">&#160;</a>

dispute would go, at the discretion of the applicant, to the
independent monitor, but perhaps it would help if I laid out the
process—it relates to the other part about the ISA,
too—because the disputes procedure in part 5 of the Police Act
is quite separate from the role of the ISA in making barring decisions.
How would someone be able to dispute information released by a chief
officer in future? If someone believes that the information released by
the CRB-enhanced certificate is irrelevant or ought not to be included,
they would now have the power to apply to the independent monitor, as
established under part 5 of the Police Act, for that to be reviewed. On
receiving such a request, the independent monitor must ask a chief
police officer to review the matter and advise accordingly. If, in the
light of that advice, the independent monitor reaches the judgment that
the disputed information was irrelevant or should not be included, the
independent monitor must inform the Secretary of State who, in turn,
must require the CRB to issue a new certificate. I hope that that

also asked about the time scale; I agree with her in the sense that
there is a process to be gone through. It will depend on how many
processes are involved, or whether more than one police force has
information. That will take time, but it will be as fast as it can be.
That goes back to the point that it is better for

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
changes the definition of an enhanced CRB check in the
Police Act, so that an enhanced CRB check will now
declare whether someone is on an ISA barred list. As the ISA undertakes
a very thorough investigation before barring anyone, and it receives
and seeks information which may not be on the police database, and
because the individual has the right to appeal to the ISA to correct
any mistakes, we believe that it is important to accept the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000384">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A large amount
of soft intelligence is not passed to the police, as we have discussed,
and in the cases of vulnerable adults, the might be as high as 50%.
Where large amounts of information have been received and assessed, and
suggest that an individual poses a threat so severe that the ISA has
decided to bar them, that person poses a threat when working with
children or vulnerable adults, even if it is not in a regulated
activity. An example might be a teacher, who has been struck off
through consistent, soft information from a number of schools and local
education authorities. Although none of that information has been
reported to the police, that person might then become a volunteer
teaching assistant, helping with reading and sport in a school. That
institution would not know about that person’s barred status.
The amendment is in line with the arguments that we have made
throughout. It will ensure that the information flow on barred status
goes to everybody who needs to know about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000385">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have debated the point fairly fully, and
I do not want to repeat everything that we have said, but I reiterate
that our key changes are to the scope and the extent of regulated
activity, not to the application of barred persons. The concept that a
barred person may still be able to undertake some activities with
children or vulnerable adults is not new. The scope of regulated
activity has never covered all possible contact with those groups. The
previous Government, for example, accepted that the test of frequency
and intensiveness should apply to regulated activity and agreed to
relax the rules on the definitions following Sir Roger
Singleton’s
review.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000386">&#160;</a>

approach the chief officers of all forces that might hold relevant

feel it is appropriate to change the test for releasing information?
What is the evidential basis for that change? Secondly, how is a police
officer meant to judge what is relevant? What conversations have there
been with ACPO on the advice and guidance that will be issued? If all
the police officer knows is that the person has requested an enhanced
CRB check, he could, one would assume, foresee what might be relevant,
but on what basis is he meant to have a reasonable belief on what will
be relevant? That is a difficult challenge for a police officer to
undertake. What steps will the Minister take to standardise the
information release across different forces? Evidence has been provided
of inconsistencies in the information release across the country. What
is her view on how that might help to standardise that information
release?<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000410">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 79 makes a number of changes relating
to the role undertaken by the police service in support of the
CRB’s processes and aims to improve the system by introducing
additional safeguards to the disclosure process for enhanced criminal
record certificates. As elsewhere in this part of the Bill, the changes
made implement recommendations from the recent review of the CRB
process by Mrs Sunita Mason.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000415">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Lady said, the clause makes four substantive changes. First, it allows
the Secretary of State to approach any relevant chief police officer to
determine whether additional information should be included in an
enhanced CRB check. Secondly, it changes the wording of the relevance
test to “reasonably believes”. Thirdly, it introduces a
provision requiring chief police officers, when making such a
determination, to have regard to guidance published by the Secretary of
State. Finally, the clause allows the applicant the right to request a
review of information released by a chief police officer on an enhanced
criminal record
certificate.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000416">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Explaining
the changes a little more deeply will answer some of the hon.
Lady’s questions. Currently, the Secretary of State must ask the
chief officer of every relevant police force to provide information.
Regulations define a relevant police force as any police force holding
information about the applicant. Often, two or more police forces can
hold information, making them all relevant
forces.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000417">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the moment, work is well advanced to provide the police with
centralised, IT-enabled access to all local police intelligence via the
new national police database. All forces in the UK are in the process
of connecting to it, and should begin using the first phase of the
system this year. It will create scope to use resources much more
effectively and efficiently by moving towards a centralised
decision-making process. For example, a few lead forces might be
responsible for taking disclosure decisions, perhaps on a regional
basis. They would be more expert as a result of having more occasion to
make such decisions. It is sometimes alleged, as the hon. Lady said,
that the disclosure service is a postcode lottery, depending on the
police force, how good it was at it and what a particular chief officer
determined as relevant. By centralising the decision-making process,
there will be a more consistent approach to determining what
non-conviction information should properly be disclosed. I am sure that
that will be helpful for what goes on the certificate and for the
police making the decisions. It is fair to say that the
“reasonable belief” test is something with which the
police are very
familiar.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000418">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second change concerns the relevance test—the change from
“might be relevant” in considering the applicant’s
suitability for the position and, if so, whether that information ought
to be included on the certificate. We believe that this requires the
disclosure of an unhelpfully wide set of information, much of which is
extremely unlikely to be relevant to employment decisions but which
places both employers and individuals in a difficult predicament when
determining the appropriate action to be taken in view of the
information
released.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000419">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
79 introduces a slightly higher test for the inclusion of information,
which, as we discussed, is information that the chief officer
“reasonably believes to be relevant” and which, in the
chief officer's opinion,

                           <em>]</em> The relevance test has just
come into my possession. An individual has applied for a post working
with adults who have learning disabilities and requires an enhanced
criminal record check. The police have information suggesting that he
was connected with an act of vandalism at the age of 15, but no charges
were ever brought. In this case, it could be that the information in
relation to vandalism might be relevant to the post applied for and, as
such, disclosed on the criminal records certificate. However, if there
was a higher threshold, it is unlikely that a chief officer would
reasonably believe that such information would be relevant for
disclosure. That is the sort of territory that we are
in.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000423">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the third change, there are no provisions for the Secretary of State to
issue guidance to police forces on the discharge of their functions
under the Police Act. While the CRB and ACPO have developed and rolled
out to all forces a quality assurance framework to document search
criteria to be used in local system searches, this does not detail the
Secretary of State’s expectations as to how decisions under the
Act should be made. The clause will enable the Secretary of State to
issue guidance to relevant chief officers about the discharge of their
functions in relation to the disclosure of non-conviction information
on enhanced criminal record certificates and places a requirement on a
relevant chief officer to have regard to any such guidance. We believe
that this guidance is necessary to ensure the consistency that the hon.
Lady spoke of in a process that must be fair, transparent and
proportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000424">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Fourthly and
finally, the clause provides a change to allow the applicant the right
to request an independent review of the information released. At
present, a dispute by an applicant about the release of information by
a chief officer is handled by the chief officer who made the original
decision whether or not to release the information. In most cases, when
such a dispute is made, the chief officer will dismiss the dispute or
might only make subtle changes to the text rather than remove the
information altogether. There is currently no further opportunity to
challenge the chief officer’s decision to dismiss a dispute and,
in practical terms, the next stage of the dispute would be by way of
judicial review proceedings, which are both costly and time consuming
for all
parties.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000425">&#160;</a>

                           </div>amendments that we have just discussed, we are introducing an
independent review mechanism whereby people can apply to an independent

of additional police information is complicated. It
can be further information that relates to a caution or conviction that
is on the disclosure or it could be information retained by the police
following an investigation that did not proceed to a criminal charge or
conviction for various reasons. Either form of information might be
relevant to disclose to a potential employer. Although local
intelligence can be vital in making decisions about someone’s
employability, the way in which that information is disclosed must be

register to receive online updates and new employers will be able to
register to make sure that a CRB check is still relevant and up to
date. However, the automatic updating has to be subscribed to, at a
fee, and I wish to question the Minister on whether any thought has
been given to the level of that fee. The individual must give consent
for that to happen. Moreover, no new information will be sent via the
online system. It would merely tell the employer that to apply for a
new certificate was the right thing to

                           </strong> I think overall there is a resounding
welcome for the portability of checks. One of the things that has come
through everyone’s post bag—certainly mine—is
endless complaints about the number of CRB checks that an individual
has to have, particularly if they are working for different agencies.
It is endless. I have to say that the remedy is ingenious. In case hon.
Members are not familiar with it, the idea is that any individual who
has a CRB check or an enhanced CRB check will be issued with a unique
number. Whenever they go to a new employer, they would normally be
asked to get a new CRB check, because CRB checks are snapshots in time.
Under this provision, they can give the employer the unique number, and
the employer can then turn to their computer and go online. The hon.
Lady is right that the system will not indicate new information in
detail, but it will either say that there is no change, in which case
there is no need to get a new CRB check, or it will indicate that there
is a need to get a new check done, in which case the person would have
to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000436">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
system updates what has been an extremely expensive bugbear for many
people. Each time they have to get a new check, they have to pay a new
fee. I commend those who designed the new scheme. It is an exceptional
way forward for the problem. On how much it will cost, the costs will
be finalised when new arrangements are introduced. We are clear that
the cost of an annual fee to enable online checking will be far less
than the cost of criminal record checks.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000437">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As now,
volunteers will not be required to pay for criminal record checks. At
present, it is envisaged that if a volunteer wants to subscribe to the
voluntary updating service, they will have to pay a subscription fee.
That is still, however, under consideration, because we understand the
position of voluntary organisations who say that a fee may be
off-putting to
volunteers.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000438">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was asked how much it will cost an employer who wants to obtain a new
enhanced criminal record check on someone wishing to work in regulated
activity. From 6 April 2011, the cost of obtaining an enhanced criminal
record check rose by £8 to £44. That rise was to fund the
changes to the current system, without placing an additional burden on
the general taxpayer. The fee increase is designed to deliver an
equitable way of funding necessary expenditure, without the income that
would have been raised from the previously proposed £64 fee for
scheme registration. It is cheaper than it was, but it has increased,
if hon. Members see what I mean. The £22 million generated
through the fee increase over 2011-12 includes the operational costs of
the ISA at £14.3 million, IT infrastructure and a contribution
towards the development of the overarching criminal records regime. As
to who pays the fee, that is a matter for the individual and
employer.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000439">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Currently, a CRB check discloses all unspent
criminal convictions. Clause 81 would amend that, so that a CRB check
will also disclose conditional cautions. What kinds of offences will
that cover? What is the rationale for doing that? Given that
conditional cautions tend to be for minor offences, will this not deter
people from volunteering to work with children where the conditional
cautions would not be relevant? Girlguiding UK has raised the
particular concern that volunteers will not come forward because of the
disclosure.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000442">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not understand where the hon. Lady is
coming from. Clause 81 amends the provisions of the Police Act 1997
that govern the information included on a basic certificate, also known
as a criminal conviction certificate. Currently, the 1997 Act provides
that a basic certificate must detail any convictions that are unspent
under the terms of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. The clause
provides that such certificates must also include details of any
unspent conditional cautions. Basic certificates are not currently
issued by the Criminal Records Bureau, but their introduction is being
examined.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000443">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If a
conviction or, in this case, a conditional caution becomes spent it
means that an individual, if asked, does not have to respond to a
question about whether they have ever received a conviction or
conditional caution. A conditional caution will become spent after
three months. Exceptions to that protection are listed in the
Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975. They
include positions, offices and activities where, due to the sensitivity
of the post or potential for risk of harm to vulnerable groups, it is
considered that being able to ask an individual a question about all
convictions is justified.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000444">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked about the type of offences. Conditional cautions could be given
for minor assaults, public order offences, thefts and so on. As I have
said, they are spent after three months, so they would not be disclosed
after that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000445">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For the
majority of positions listed in the 1975 order, the process of asking
the question on all convictions held is through an application to the
CRB for a standard or enhanced criminal record certificate. A
conditional caution is an out of court disposal where an offender
avoids being prosecuted for an offence by admitting his or her guilt
and agreeing to comply with certain conditions. Clause 81 is, in
effect, a consequential amendment as a result of previous changes to
the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, which brought the scope of
conditional cautions under the protections of that Act, and so needs to
be included
herewith.<a class="bkMark" name="1105118000446">&#160;</a>
