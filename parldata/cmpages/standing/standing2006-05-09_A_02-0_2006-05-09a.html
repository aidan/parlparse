Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): Mr. O&#146;Hara, I thank

you for calling me after the intermission. I am particularly grateful

for the point of order, too, because it has given the hon. Member for

Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) time to take his place. I was in

mid-sentence and using his intervention in the previous sitting to

illustrate not the point that he was trying to make but the reverse. If

I interpreted his remarks correctly, he suggested that it would be

possible to identify whether foreign-based manufacturers were likely to

be selling to customers who might smuggle cigarettes or tobacco

products into this country. The nature of the local market would

indicate in itself whether the sale was of sufficient scale for the

market to be prone to smuggling.</div>

<a name="06051010000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some nations are small but

active traders. This country has established most of its economic

heritage on the back of trading with other larger and smaller nations.

From my own experience, I know for example that the market of Hong

Kong, with 6.5 million residents, is an entrepot to the market of

greater China, with its more than 1 billion inhabitants.</div>

<a name="06051010000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be interested in

whether the hon. Gentleman&#146;s test was relevant to a customer of

a tobacco-importing business in Hong Kong determining whether smuggling

into this country was likely. I venture to suggest that it is an

irrelevant test. The point remains, however, that the thrust of the

clause is directed at UK-based manufacturers, rather than foreign

manufacturers where the bulk of smuggled goods comes

from.</div>

<a name="06051010000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051010000427"></a><b class="B">Stephen

Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman amazes

me, because the test that I set out in a few words is the one that is

included in the Bill and to which I referred his hon. Friend the Member

for Braintree (Mr. Newmark).</div>

<a name="06051010000046"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000428"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I am grateful for that observation, but my point

remains perfectly valid. It will be down to the measures that the

Government impose on foreign-based manufacturers to prove that the

manufacturers are not likely to be smuggling. That will be a difficult

test for the Government to establish in the absence of the greater use

of measures such as the memorandums of understanding with those

individual

manufacturers</div><a name="06051010000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

relation to the stand part debate, why are the Government seeking to

use such measures to combat 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 45</div>smuggling when they are not using the full forceof existing

laws to combat smuggling in our constituencies? I accept that this is a

Finance Bill, and that I may be referring to an example that strays

beyond its confines, but if you will indulge me,Mr.

O&#146;Hara, I want to point out that we suffer from a particular

problem in my constituency&#151;the blight of the car boot sale. I am

sure that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)

will nod his assent that it affects the area between our

constituencies. Several operators use the very limit of the law to

provide car boot sale facilities for many of his constituents, and

mine. On the rare occasions that they are raided by the police,

significant quantities of contraband goods&#151;such as tobacco

products, CDs and other goods&#151;are found in large numbers. If

effort was expended by this Government on cracking down on venues for

the sale of illegal goods, they would find that smuggling rates would

decline more rapidly than will be the case under this

measure.</div>

<a name="06051010000048"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000429"></a>Stephen

Hesford:</b> With respect, the hon. Gentleman was wrong about

his last point, but this point is even more confusing. Is it his policy

and that of the Conservative party to prohibit car boot

sales?</div><a name="06051010000049"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000430"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I shall not indulge your good nature,Mr.

O&#146;Hara, by requesting that you allow me to respond in too much

detail to the hon.

Gentleman.</div><a name="06051010000050"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000431"></a>The

Chairman:</b> It would help because I would rule you out of

order

anyway.</div><a name="06051010000051"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000432"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b><b class="B"> </b>I simply say that I do not believe that my

first point was incorrect. It was valid, and I look forward to the

Financial Secretary&#146;s response to it. I am certainly not arguing

that we should stop car boot sales. I am arguing that the legislation

that exists to deal with what is sold at car boot sales should be

enforced.</div><a name="06051010000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051010000433"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): It is

difficult to argue the case that the clause is unduly harsh on the

tobacco industry because that is not the most sympathetic of causes. We

will not often see senior politicians in open-necked shirts visiting

cigarette factories, saying what a marvellous job they are doing for

the British economy. Along with nearly all my colleagues, I am a

non-smoker. It is certainly true that the lawyers here outnumber the

smokers, on these Benches at least. It is not very often that the

tobacco industry is treated particularly sympathetically by

politicians. The only instance I can think of in recent years was in

1997 when Formula 1 was exempted from the ban on tobacco advertising,

but we know that particular circumstances were involved in that

case.</div> <a name="06051010000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend

the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) made several good

points about the difficulties that exist in the clause. It is worth

dwelling on them, not so much from the point of view of the tobacco

industry, but from the Government&#146;s point of view and that of

Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. There are one or two

circumstances where 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 46</div>there must be some concern as to whether everything in the clause will

be enforceable.</div> <a name="06051010000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

hon. Friend raised the point earlier regarding the degree of

uncertainty that must exist when determining the intention of the

purchaser of the cigarettes. It is difficult to test the intention of

that individual or that entity: in some circumstances it may be clear,

but in others it will not be. Therefore, there is a fundamental

uncertainty in the law. One questions whether the provisions might be

vulnerable to a challenge under human rights legislation, and I would

be interested to hear the Financial Secretary&#146;s views on that

point.</div> <a name="06051010000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second area

of potential concern relates to the&#163;5 million fine.

The procedures set out in clause 2 are more of an administrative nature

than a criminal one, and there may be concerns that problems will exist

under human rights legislation as a consequence.</div>

<a name="06051010000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also slightly concerned

about the broader issue of the way in which the Government increasingly

use private businesses to perform the role of policeman. There may be a

good reason for doing it. A private business, such as the tobacco

industry, may be in a stronger position to regulate smuggling than the

law enforcement authorities. However, that increasingly places great

regulatory burdens upon private business, and has one or two other

potential dangers. The police are democratically accountable, although

not as democratically accountable as some of us would like, but none

the less an accountability mechanism exists. However, no such mechanism

exists for a business in the way that it enforces rules.</div>

<a name="06051010000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for

Wolverhampton, South-West also raised the issue of judicial review in a

different context, and public bodies are liable for judicial review.

There is a different mechanism and a well established, sophisticated

way with which law enforcement and public authorities are dealt. We are

passing on public duties to private companies, which can cause

problems. </div><a name="06051010000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at

the clause earlier, I was reminded of the provision on money laundering

under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, an area of law that I once knew

somewhat better than the law on tobacco smuggling. I refer, in

particular, to the imposition of a reporting regime for the regulated

sector. There is a different approach to money laundering than is

applied to tobacco smuggling under clause 2, which says that the

businesses must avoid dealing with potential smugglers.

</div><a name="06051010000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approach proposes

a positive obligation on tobacco firms because, in doing so, they have

to draw up a policy and investigate the potential counter parties. It

is more than simply avoiding matters; it is a positive duty. I am not

complaining about that. However, it does cause difficulties. Within the

money laundering regime, if the private business is suspicious, it does

not have to be judge and jury about whether the entity or transaction

that it is dealing with involves money laundering. The private business

must follow the rule and report the matter to the

authorities.</div> <a name="06051010000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for

tobacco smuggling, rather than the potential difficulties involved with

imposing a duty toavoid entering into certain transactions,

has any consideration been given to whether the problem should be

looked at on the basis of reporting? The memorandum of understanding

might already contain 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 47</div>details of the reporting obligations, but could the Government consider

beefing them up? That may prove to be a more satisfactory way for

tobacco companies to deal with the matter.</div>

<a name="06051010000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems reasonable to say to a

tobacco company, &#147;You should have suspicions in these particular

circumstances. You are entering into a transaction and you should

inform us, the law enforcement authorities.&#148; It should then be

for the law enforcement authorities to pursue the matter, rather than

for the tobacco industry to say, &#147;We have to decide. We may have

some guidance, but we are not really in a position to make a

judgment&#148;.</div><a name="06051010000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

may already be some provision on how reporting works that I am unaware

of. However, I wonder whether clause 2 is going down the wrong route.

Given the considerable uncertainty that exists within the current

provision, it may be difficult for tobacco firms to comply with the

clause. For example, they may face difficulties at a human rights law

level and, therefore, the Government should establish a reporting,

rather than an avoiding,

regime.</div><a name="06051010000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051010000434"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): I shall be brief because

I can tell from the looks of those onthe Government Front

Bench that they are anxiousto proceed. I thank the hon.

Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, who taught me, almost a year ago

in my first debate on the Finance Bill, the wonders of explanatory

notes.</div> <a name="06051010000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was

intrigued when my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire

(Sir George Young) pointed out that there were annual revenue losses of

&#163;2.9 billion, which an extraordinarily large figure. In note 31

of the explanatory notes to clause 2, there is mention of a package of

measures to reinforce the tackling tobacco smuggling strategy. There is

a lot of conversation about cigarettes, and we read in the notes that

it is estimated that one in six cigarettesis smuggled, which

is an extremely high number. However, what really struck me was that

half of all hand-rolling tobacco for roll-your-owns is actually

illicit. That is an extremely high figure. I would like to draw out

from the Financial Secretary which of the measures referred to in note

31 focus particularly on the smuggling of hand-rolling tobacco, because

that figure of 50 per cent. seems extraordinarily high. I look forward

to his

response.</div><a name="06051010000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): You,Mr.

O&#146;Hara, and the Financial Secretary were absolutely right to say

this morning that our consideration of this issue has been curious in

thatour debate on the amendments has preceded a stand part

debate on the substance of the clause. However, our debate on the

amendments had in part to address the substance. Following your advice,

Mr. O&#146;Hara, I propose to speak to clause stand part. The

Financial Secretary will then respond, and then I will make it clear

whether we intend to press our amendments to a Division. I welcome the

hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) to the

Committee, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div>because we did not have the chance to do that this morning, although the

Paymaster General welcomed her in absentia.</div>

<a name="06051010000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I turn to clause stand

part, I point out that&#151;as the Committee has already heard, and

as my hon. Friends have already all made clear when touching on points

of real substance&#151;these are important and controversial clauses.

This morning, I listed the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the

Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Institute of Directors, all

of which have concerns about the measures. In fact, in the break

between the morning and afternoon sittings, I found among my e-mails a

further briefing from the Law Society that was not present when I left

for Committee this morning.</div>

<a name="06051010000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial Secretary made

the point that all those bodies are involved directly with taxation and

are not tobacco manufacturers, and I make two brief points in response

to that. First, obviously, it does not follow that their concerns are

mistaken&#151;nor did he suggest that. Secondly, tobacco

manufacturers have privately related concerns about some of the

provisions to me, although I say plainly to the Financial Secretary

that there have not been as many from those manufacturers as from the

other bodies.</div> <a name="06051010000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

concerns basically fall into four parts. First, the organisations are

concerned that the proposals may be unnecessary in that they appear to

duplicate existing information-gathering powers, money-laundering rules

and parts of criminal law relating to aiding and abetting and

conspiracy. You will already see,Mr. O&#146;Hara, that this

debate is another paradise for lawyers. Secondly, the organisations are

concerned that the proposals may be ineffective in that they

appear&#151;certainly in the view of the Chartered Institute of

Taxation&#151;to contravene EU treaties and the European convention

on human rights, a point that my hon. Friends referred to earlier.

Thirdly, in so far as the measures are necessary and effective, they

are none the less excessively subjective. Fourthly, they

createa disproportionate administrative burden on

manufacturers and break new ground in obliging businesses to take

active steps to help to police the criminal laws intended to prevent

tax loss&#151;a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for

South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) a moment ago. However, there is no

legal duty on citizens actively to enforce laws against crimes that are

no less serious, such as crimes that cause death or injury, or theft of

private property. Let me deal with each of those points in

turn.</div><a name="06051010000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, there is

the question of whether the proposals are necessary. There are already

measures in civil law under the law of tort in England and delict law

in Scotland that would allow the HMRC to recover any damages arising

from the fact that a business had acted recklessly and as a result

allowed a person to escape duty. There are also laws such as the

Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 and the Tobacco Products Duty

Act 1979 that already apply to those sections of the

Government&#146;s proposals that require information about

importation or exportation. Therefore, I ask the Financial Secretary to

explain what parts of the proposals are not already covered by those

Acts. It is the opinion of some bodies that have commented on the

proposals that they are in part already covered in law.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div><a name="06051010000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, there is the question

of whether the proposals will be effective, particularly in respect of

EU law. That concern is shared by the Institute of Chartered

Accountants. Although excise duties are not subject to harmonisation

measures such as those found in EU directives, they are still subject

to EU VAT law in the context of the right to freedom of establishment.

The proposals may concern transactions between UK businesses and

businesses carrying on a trade in a country other than an EU country, a

point alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow(Mr.

Dunne). The proposals therefore may affect intra-community

trade.</div><a name="06051010000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">EU law does not

prevent member states from taking action to prevent fraud and evasion,

but limits have emerged from case law on what can be done to prevent

fraud. In representations made to me, the recent Optigen case has been

cited. It saw Optigen Ltd pitted against Customs and Excise

commissioners. Even though I am not a lawyer, I have some apprehension

of the principle of proportionality, which is the key legal principle

involved, as it has been imported into law in recent years. In the view

of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the measures taken are

disproportionate to the aim intended to be achieved because the size of

the penalty exigible for non-compliance, which proposed new subsection

7C(2) sets at a maximum of&#163;5 million&#151;a

considerable penalty, which my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and

Kenilworth referred to earlier&#151;is, in the institute&#146;s

view,</div><a name="06051010000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on such a scale as

to be criminal in nature. It is questionable whether it is right for

the tax legislation to convert a supposedly civil offence into the

equivalent of...aiding and abetting a crime. Accordingly, it is

improper to allow such a penalty to be imposed by what is in effect an

administrative

decision.</div><a name="06051010000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">The penalty

is exacerbated because, to the extent that a business is required to

avoid carrying out transactions likely to result in smuggling, it is

required to curtail its business with a consequential loss of profits.

While this may be justified where smuggling is almost inevitable it

will, because of the subjective nature of the decision to be made, lead

to transactions declined even though no fraud is

involved.&#148;</div><a name="06051010000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take it that

that is a reference to what could happen if a firm is involved in

legitimate activity but also in activity that may subsequently be

judged to be illegitimate. There could be an effect on the legitimate

business of the

firm.</div><a name="06051010000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The institute

continues:</div><a name="06051010000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There

would appear to be potential conflicts with other law e.g. a

transaction might be potentially reportable under the Proceeds of Crime

Act 2002 and the Money Laundering Regulations 2003 since a money

launderer might seek to use legitimate transactions such as an ordinary

sale of goods to launder money. In such cases, a business could be

faced with the dilemma that confirming a transaction is contrary to the

TPDA 1979, but not doing so might amount to &#145;tipping

off&#146;&#151;a rather more serious

offence.&#148;</div><a name="06051010000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The institute

adds:</div><a name="06051010000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is

also necessary to bear in mind the difference in the levels of

knowledge which a business might

have&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06051010000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">that

touches on another point raised

earlier&#151;</div><a name="06051010000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and

which the tax authorities&#151;who have access to a wider range of

information&#151;may have. The judgment of HMRC might therefore be

different to that of a business, yet it is HMRC...who will decide

whether&#148;&#151;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 50</div><a name="06051010000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">to quote proposed new section 7B(1) of the

Tobacco Products Duty Act

1979&#151;</div><a name="06051010000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;they

&#145;think that a manufacturer has without reasonable excuse failed

to comply&#146;. It is difficult to conceive of how a tax officer

deeply involved in countering tax fraud can place himself in the shoes

of the business to decide whether there is compliance or not. Moreover

HMRC will be operating with the benefit of hindsight, whereas the

tobacco manufacturer will not have that

advantage.&#148;</div><a name="06051010000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">What legal

advice has the Financial Secretary received on the matter of

subjectivity?</div><a name="06051010000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly,

there is the question of the administrative burden that the proposals

will place on manufacturers. Does the Financial Secretary share the

view of the Institute of Chartered Accountants that unless tobacco

manufacturers are content with the wording of the clause, it risks

being subject to lengthy litigationin the UK and at the

European Court of Justice?What legal advice has he taken,

particularly on proportionality and the relation between the proposals

in the Bill, the recent Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Money

Laundering Regulations

2003?</div><a name="06051010000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute of

Chartered Accountants points out that clause 2 has territorial

problems&#151;which relates to the point made by my hon. Friend the

Member for Ludlow&#151;that the HMRC might be open to claims for

damages and that there seems to be no adequate provision for

independent review of the HMRC&#146;s actions. What assessment has

the Financial Secretary made of any new vulnerability in the HMRC to

claims for damages? Can he guarantee that any review carried out by the

HMRC under section 7C(3) will be carried out by someone other than the

officer who authorised the report? That goes back to another point made

this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and

Kenilworth.</div><a name="06051010000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,

given that the new proposals seek to place new duties on tobacco

manufacturers, I am curiousto know the Government&#146;s

further thinking on the matter. Are they considering extending those

duties to manufacturers of other products vulnerable to fraud, such as

alcohol?</div><a name="06051010000377"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000449"></a>The

Financial Secretary to the Treasury(John

Healey):</b> I shall deal first with the series

ofpoints made by the hon. Member for Wycombe(Mr.

Goodman), and then try to answer the points made by other hon.

Members.</div> <a name="06051010000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman asked me whether the Government had taken legal advice on a

series of matters before framing the clause. The short answer is yes.

The slightly longer answer is, &#147;Of course we have.&#148; We

have taken advice on the questions of proportionality and compatibility

with European Union legislation. We have also taken advice on the

question whether other laws would give us powers to control supplies of

tobacco. Our judgment and knowledge is that such laws do not

exist.</div> <a name="06051010000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman asked about HMRC review. HMRC practice on any regime for

which it is responsible is that the review of a taxpayer is conducted

by HMRC officers independent of those who are involved in pursuing that

taxpayer or, in this case, undertaking the clause 2 process.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div><a name="06051010000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. Member for

North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) asked about the impact

ofclause 2, and about its benefit to the Treasury. The clause

is based on and complements the memorandums of agreement that are

currently in place with the three major UK-based tobacco companies,

which supply the majority of the UK market. The memorandums of

understanding, reinforced by the clause, will make it harder for

smugglers to source large quantities of cigarettes and of hand-rolling

tobacco for the purposes of smuggling and selling within the

UK.</div> <a name="06051010000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The existing

memorandums of understanding have resulted in a significant fall in the

proportion of genuine manufactured tobacco in cigarettes that have been

seized by HMRC. Because the supply of genuine tobacco is being choked

off, it has been replacedby counterfeit tobacco. In 2001-02,

85 per cent. of cigarettes seized were genuine&#151;albeit diverted,

rerouted or smuggled in some way&#151;but by 2004-05, the proportion

was about a half. In other words, legitimate sources have been choked

off at theirorigin by arrangements and close co-operation

with manufacturers. Smugglers have therefore had to adapt their

techniques and have increasingly used counterfeits as their

source.</div><a name="06051010000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was the

pre-Budget report that originally set out the impact on combined

revenue of clause 2, together with the measures and new initiatives

that were set out in &#147;Reinforcing the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling

Strategy&#148;, the document published alongside the Budget. The

report indicated that there would be positive impact of &#163;50

million this year, &#163;90 million in 2007-08 and &#163;115

million in 2008-09. If the hon. Member for Braintree wants to see our

other proposed measures, including those in relation to hand-rolling

tobacco, he should consult chapter 5 of the pre-Budget report and the

document that we published alongside the Budget in

March.</div><a name="06051010000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051010000450"></a><b class="B">Stewart

Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): The Financial Secretary said

that the purpose of the clause is to choke off the supply of large

quantities of cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco to smugglers. That is

perfectly reasonable, but the lobby notes also saythat clause

2 imposes a duty on tobacco manufacturers not to facilitate smuggling,

and that tobacco manufacturers will be required to avoid supplying

cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco to those likely to resupply to those

likely to smuggle. Do tobacco and cigarette companies have the

necessary due diligence skills to determine whether potential

resupplying companies may be functioning legally in their place of

operation?</div><a name="06051010000147"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000451"></a>John

Healey:</b> The short answer is that the memorandums of

understanding already contain a commitment on precisely that point and

the tobacco companies, working with HMRC, are increasingly able to do

that.</div><a name="06051010000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

for Rugby and Kenilworth asked about the burdens that would be placed

on manufacturers. There should not be any significant additional costs

to tobacco manufacturers that have already put agreed memorandums of

understanding in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div>place, because the clause mirrors those existing working arrangements.

In meetings with HMRC, some tobacco manufacturers have indicated that

they may incur some additional costs, because they intend to inspect

all seizures that are notified by HMRC intelligence communications.

They have not tabled any estimates, nor have they put forward any

objections on grounds of cost during the formative stages of the

clause.</div><a name="06051010000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman then argued that the provisions needed to be clearer and more

specific. He referred, in particular, to the limits that the

manufacturers may be able to exert on the supply chain when they have

sold to the principal primary customer. We accept that there is a limit

to what manufacturers can do to control the supplies beyond that first

customer, but there have been instances when the volume of tobacco

supplied to certain markets has significantly exceeded the legitimate

demand in those markets, including even the permissible requirements of

the travelling customers. As I said, manufacturers can encourage their

customers to adapt their supply chains and are doing so in some cases.

They can contractually oblige their customers to adapt their supply

chain policies and similarly are beginning to do so in some

cases.</div><a name="06051010000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall set

out more clearly some of the expectations and requirements in the

regulations and guidance that we are producing. We will do so not under

primary legislation, in order to give ourselves greater flexibility. It

will benefit the industry and ourselves to be able to change the

provisions should that be required without primary legislation in the

future. That is especially important in the area of smuggling, where

the methods, tactics and routes change

rapidly.</div><a name="06051010000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West traded on his lawyerly

background by urging more elegance in the drafting. Size of supply is

the terminology that we tend to use in the memorandum of understanding.

We have tried to mirror the clause on the memorandum of understanding.

Manufacturers are used to it; they understand it. It is a sensible

approach. The Government&#146;s lawyers are satisfied and content

that the terminology covers the purpose for which the provision is

designed. The nature of supply is broad. It is intended to include such

issues as unusual or convoluted transit routes, large cash payments and

changes in buying patterns that may warrant further

investigation.</div><a name="06051010000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for Ludlow referred to car boot sales. It is part of the

operational pattern and strategy of HMRC to tackle the illicit supply

of goods, whether at car boot sales, car parks, pubs or clubs. If the

hon. Gentleman is coming across car boot sales in his constituency

where such activity takes place, I encourage him to ring the Customs

confidential hotline on 0800 595 000. In order to tackle the supply of

smuggled hand-rolling tobacco and cigarettes, it is necessary to

intervene and clamp down at each stage of the supply chain. That is

precisely what HMRC does. It has about 2,000 operational staff who are

deployed as front-line officers at the borders and inland to intercept

and deal with the supply routes. If the hon. Gentleman consults the

Budget document that we published, he 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div>will see that an extra 200 people will be deployed this year

specifically to step up our efforts to deal with hand-rolling

tobacco.</div><a name="06051010000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the

hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire that the reason why it is hard

to argue that such provisions are unduly harsh on United Kingdom

tobacco manufacturers is that they are not arguing that themselves. As

I said earlier, they may not like the clause, but they accept that it

builds on what we have done already on a voluntary basis and that it

will make a further contribution to choke off and reduce the supply of

legitimate tobacco and cigarettes to the smuggled

market.</div><a name="06051010000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I

have dealt with the questions asked about the consistency with human

rights legislation. For the hon. Gentleman&#146;s information, the

Chancellor signs the human rights statement in respect of the Finance

Bill. I have signed the regulatory impact assessment that relates to

the provisions as being compatible with human rights legislation, so if

serious questions arise, it is I in the first instance who will have to

answer for the judgment that I have already made. In making that

judgment, we take on board careful and comprehensive advice from the

lawyers, and in respect of what the hon. Member for Wycombe is

concerned about, we are confident that the provisions of the clause are

compatible. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw

his amendment, and that the Committee will agree to clause 2 standing

part of the

Bill.</div><a name="06051010000155"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000452"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> It became evident in earlier exchanges between

the Financial Secretary and me that these amendments were intended to

be probing amendments. The Financial Secretary dealt satisfactorily

with many of the points that were raised. For example, he made it clear

that &#147;likely&#148; means</div>

<a name="06051010000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on a balance of

probabilities&#148;,</div><a name="06051010000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that

has saved the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West and I from

being locked together in some Dantean circle arguing over the matter

indefinitely. Also, in relation to amendment No. 16 and the word

&#147;state&#148;, the Financial Secretary made it clear that there

is no need to insert the word &#147;fully&#148; because

&#147;state&#148; implies &#147;fully&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051010000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there is one specific

concern arising from the Financial Secretary&#146;s response that we

may wish to raise later. He probably will not be surprised to hear that

it is in relation to the memorandums of understanding. The Financial

Secretary said thathe did not want to give an undertaking

that manufacturers who enter into memorandums of understanding will

receive any different treatment in the Bill from any other manufacturer

who has them first because he wanted a level playing field&#151;he

wanted equality of treatment for all. He then explained that there is a

process in respect of the signing of these

undertakings.</div><a name="06051010000158"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000453"></a>John

Healey:</b> Perhaps I did not make myself clear. The point I

was making was that those manufacturers that already have a memorandum

of understanding in place with us in a sense have a head start, because

they have in place the information provisions and the relationship with

HMRC on which the provisions and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div>requirements of clause 2 will be based. The point about clause 2 is that

the obligations that it will contain and the sanctions that may

potentially apply will apply to all manufacturers that may be supplying

the UK market, not just those that have memorandums of understanding

already in place. I hope that that helps the hon.

Gentleman.</div>

<a name="06051010000159"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000454"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> I was coming to that point, but if I am correct I

think the record will reflect the fact that the Financial Secretary did

say that he did not want written into the Bill any special treatment

for those manufacturers who had signed memorandums of understanding,

which would mean that they would not have to go through exactly the

same procedures as other manufacturers who had not signed. He did of

course say that those who had signed these memorandums of understanding

would be in a better position; that is

true.</div><a name="06051010000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, my

concern is about what the Financial Secretary said about writing into

the Bill a provision that if a manufacturer had previously agreed a

memorandum of understanding, that manufacturer would be exempt from

some of the procedures in relation to, for example, notices being

provided in writing. He said that that would send the wrong signal. I

am not quite so sure about that; I think it might actually send the

right signal were a manufacturer, or manufacturers, able to enter into

memorandums of understanding that would make it clear to the

authorities what they were prepared to do to counter fraud, and if they

did so it might actually be helpful to them to be able to come to that

kind of arrangementto be able to circumvent some of the

procedures in clause

2.</div><a name="06051010000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not going to

press the amendment to a Division at this stage, but we might return to

this matter in due course.</div>

Healey:</b> We now quit cigarettes and move on to

beer.</div> <a name="06051010000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 3

increases, in line with general inflation, the excise duty charged on

beer. That is part of a broader package of decisions on alcohol duty

that continue progress towards the Government&#146;s long-term aim of

achieving a fairer balance of taxation across all alcohol products

without imposing real-terms increases on those, such as beer, that

currently are more lightly taxed.</div>

<a name="06051010000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Excise duties on alcohol

provide a crucial&#163;7.9 billion a year to invest in

tackling crime and essential public services, such as schools,

hospitals and transport. Beer accounts for more than 40 per cent. of

alcohol duty receipts. The inflation-only duty increase, which,

together with VAT, is equivalent to about a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 55</div>penny a pint, is necessary to maintain that important source of revenue.

By way of background, I remind the Committee that that modest increase,

a freeze inreal terms, follows freezes&#151;actual, not

real-terms freezes&#151;in beer duty in three of the past eight

Budgets.</div> <a name="06051010000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I

am aware also of the pressures on brewers and the pub industry, which

play an important part in our economy, our heritage and, for those of

us who like a beer, our leisure. This modest, inflation-only increase

in beer duty recognises their concerns but maintains an important

stream of revenue necessary to support our long-term commitment to

continue to increase investment in some of our vital public services. I

commend the clause to the Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000456"></a>Mr.

lengthy on clauses 1 and 2. We have no quarrel with the inflation-only

increase in the price of beer, and do not oppose the

clause.</div>

Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I should like to

welcome.This morning I was at a PricewaterhouseCoopers

conference on public services reform that had been arranged prior even

to my joining the Liberal Democrat Treasury team. Unfortunately, the

conference was unavoidable and I could not be here this

morning.</div> <a name="06051010000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have no

quarrel with the increases in excise duty on beer in clause 3.

Including VAT, it represents a penny a pint and it is sensible to

maintain revenues. I should like to raise only one point. Why did the

Chancellor of the Exchequer feel it appropriate to freeze duties on

sparkling wines, in anticipation of success at the World cup, when the

majority of supporters will be drinking beer, not

champagne?</div><a name="06051010000172"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000458"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I should like to raise a brief point, to which I

hope the Financial Secretary will respond; it is the obverse of the

point that I raised about tobacco duty. There has been an

inflation-only increase on duty on beer, but there has been a freeze on

spirits for, I think, the eighth Budget in succession; I may have got

that wrong. In real terms, the duty on spirits has declined by 18.4 per

cent. since 1997.</div> <a name="06051010000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Put

that in the context of the public health aspects of excise duty, which

were part of the justification for the increase in tobacco duty. Today

we have learned that the primary justification for the increases in

excise duty on alcohol is to do with revenue, yet the incidence of

alcohol as a cause of admission to hospitals is increasing

steadily.</div> <a name="06051010000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">According

to my calculations, there was a rise of4.6 per cent. between

1997 and March 2003, the last period for which statistics are available

in the 2004 statistical bulletin. That is an increase of 8,000 to

176,100 admissions in which alcohol is cited as the primary reason, or

is referred to, in the relevant note. There is at least a case&#151;I

should be interested to hear whether the Financial Secretary considered

it during 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 56</div>his preparation for the Budget&#151;for using excise duties as a means

of improving public health in relation to alcohol-induced

illness.</div><a name="06051010000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051010000459"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Colin Breed </b>(South-East Cornwall) (LD): In a similar vein,

the explanatory notes say that since 1997 the duty on beer has fallen

by 6 per cent. in real terms. That is not a huge amount, but it is a

fall in real terms. Yet during that period we have seen clear evidence

that alcohol, particularly beer, plays a large part in some of the

antisocial behaviour, not least binge drinking, that we experience from

time to time.</div><a name="06051010000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

recently seen a relaxation of the licensing laws and availability in

terms of cost and access has increased. It would not be surprising if

we saw more antisocial behaviour, let alone the health problems that

the hon. Member for Ludlow

described.</div><a name="06051010000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

spent a lot of time discussing the smuggling of tobacco but have not

mentioned the considerable amount of beer that is imported during trips

to hypermarkets on the continent. The brewery industry is probably

right to be concerned about the amount of beer that is being imported

in that way.</div><a name="06051010000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall,

there is a case for not objecting because I think the increase is

correct, but we should recognise some of the dangers of alcohol,

particularly among young people, and recognise that price is a driver,

as it is in other areas. The Government should at least look at the

overall duty on beer not just as a revenue-raising exercise but as a

contribution to health and reducing some of the antisocial behaviour

that emanates from the consumption of large quantities of

alcohol.</div><a name="06051010000179"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000460"></a>John

Healey:</b> The reason for the decision on beer duty compared

with that on spirits is that spirits are significantly more heavily

taxed than beer and we have in place a long-term policy goal of a

fairer balance of taxation across all alcohol products. That is the

reason for the differential treatment in this year&#146;s

Budget.</div><a name="06051010000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">In reply to

the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, spirits are heavily taxed

and sparkling wine is the most heavily taxed of all alcoholic drinks.

That is part of the reason why the decision that we took in previous

years to freeze the duty on sparkling wines was taken again this year.

There may be some champagne drinkers among the officials who support me

on the Bill because I have a note that says that the freeze on the duty

on sparkling wine will affect not only the traditional champagne

products to which the hon. Lady referred, but the excellent sparkling

wines from Britain, including the 2002 Merret Bloomsbury from the

RidgeView estate in East Sussex which was recently crowned the best

sparkling wine in the world at the international wine and spirit

competition.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 57</div><a name="06051010000184"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000461"></a>John

Healey:</b> The clause increases the rate of excise duty

charged on still wine in line with general inflation. The duty on

sparkling wine is unchanged. Wine accounts for about 28 per cent. of

total alcohol duty receipts. The increase, with the VAT, is equivalent

to1p on a glass of wine and 4p on a bottle of wine. It is

necessary, as is the measure on beer, to maintain this important source

of revenue to support our investment in public services.</div>

<a name="06051010000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also aware that there are

concerns in the wine trade, which argues that the demand for wine is

beginning to weaken. We recognise that and that the wine trade plays an

important part in our economy. However, we need to maintain our revenue

and support for public services. The increase is modest and is in line

with inflation only. It does no more than maintain the real value of

the revenue from that part of the alcohol duty regime, so I commend the

clause to the

Committee.</div><a name="06051010000186"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000462"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> Again, we have no quarrel about what is proposed

in this clause, although we note the wine trade&#146;s concerns, to

which the Financial Secretary

referred.</div><a name="06051010000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a

question that arises from the point made by the hon. Member for

Falmouth and Camborne about beer, champagne and the World cup. I am

sure that the Financial Secretary will be able to give us a better

insight into the Chancellor&#146;s thinking than I can; if he cannot,

perhaps the Economic Secretary could. I assumed that the

Chancellor&#146;s thinking was that there would be good reason for

people to drink more champagne than beer because of what would happen

in the World cup. That drew my attention to a curious point that arises

because the Chancellor said,</div>

Goldsworthy:</b> Again, I have no real issue with the clause,

but I recognise the points that have been raised by various hon.

Members about the differential impacts that different types of alcohol

can have on antisocial behaviour and the negative impacts that they can

have on health. Does the Treasury have any plans to work with the

Department of Health to examine the differential impacts of different

forms of alcohol? Will differential pricing be considered as a way of

affecting

behaviour?</div><a name="06051010000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051010000464"></a><b class="B">John

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000465"></a>John

that I had responded to the points, but more emerged. I congratulate

the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)

if that is indeed a company that he chairs. I am glad to have been able

to pay tribute to it. I assume that he would have done so anyway, but I

am glad that I did just in case.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div><a name="06051010000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I say to the hon. Member for

Falmouth and Camborne that we work closely with the Department of

Health on some of the concerns that exist for all of us about the

impact of excessive drinking and the antisocial behaviour, aggression,

violence and damage that often flow from it? Tax is often a blunt

instrument. We have not been convinced that using alcohol duties would

be an effective way of trying to reduce the harms caused by excessive

alcohol consumption. That is not a feature of Government policy and in

my judgment the case for it to be has not been

made.</div><a name="06051010000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the

hon. Member for Wycombe that the Chancellor is extremely well informed

about football. The fact that Scotland has not qualified for the World

behind England in this World cup. I believe that he made that clear in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000466"></a>John

Healey:</b> This clause is of a rather different nature,

although it falls within the broad chapter of excise regimes. I am

pleased that we are able to introduce it. It reflects the

Government&#146;s commitment to simplifying and updating tax

administration thatis outdated, outmoded and causing

unnecessary complications for taxpayers. Those complications can also

add to businesses&#146; compliance costs, and sometimes act as a

barrier to entry to market. The clause allows us to remove from the

statute book a number of provisions that fall into that

category.</div><a name="06051010000379"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

pm</div><a name="06051010000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

amends the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 by removing a number of

provisions that are either obsolete or no longer serve any practical

purpose. Some of them restrict businesses&#146; legitimate commercial

freedom while frankly no longer serving any useful purpose in terms of

revenue protection. The clause is part of our wider package of changes

to the alcohol duties regime, under which we will repeal or simplify

over 40 provisions in alcohol legislation. It has been welcomed by the

drinks industry. We are discussing in detail with them whether there

are areas where we could go further. I commend the clause to the

Committee.</div><a name="06051010000199"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000467"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> We have received no representations suggesting

that any inappropriate changes are being made under the clause, or that

any changes are being made in error, so we will assume that the clause

is in order and shall not oppose

it.</div><a name="06051010000200"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000468"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> We have no issue with the clause, and welcome

the fact that it simplifies and updates tax 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>administration that causes unnecessary complications. It is just a shame

that the same cannot be said of many other clauses in the

Bill.</div><a name="06051010000201"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000469"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I rise to ask the Financial Secretary for

clarification on subsection 1(o), which removes section 82&#151;which

is on the power to make regulations with respect to stills&#151;from

the 1979 Act. I ask him to clarify precisely what powers are being

removed, and shall explain why I have an interest in the subject.

Naturally, I welcome deregulatory moves of any kind, and particularly

those that scrap unnecessary regulations. I would particularly welcome

the measure if it encouraged further agricultural diversification,

which is how I read it.</div>

<a name="06051010000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I represent a rural

constituency where agriculture remains an important economic driver.

Many farmers are looking to establish local products with higher value

added, through which they can diversify, and many smaller farmers in my

constituency still have orchards&#151;they have not been grubbed up,

as in many other parts of the country&#151;supplying apples, pears,

damsons and even cherries and soft fruits to local processors of cider,

fruit wines and spirits. The largest cider processor in the country is

located in neighbouring Herefordshire, and a lot of my farmers provide

it with fruit.</div> <a name="06051010000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope

that the Financial Secretary can confirm my reading of the clause,

which is that in future it will be possible for such growers to

establish their own mini-stills and to distil their product into

spirits, which they can sell through local markets or whatever outlets

they can find. That would be a welcome development. It might also help

to ensure that any such activity that is going on at the moment in an

unregulated and illegal fashion is brought into the realm of the above

board, which would be welcome. I have some limited experience of that

practice in other counties, because my father-in-law&#151;he is no

longer with us, unfortunately&#151;lived in Somerset, which is

another area of substantial apple production. He took me to a number of

his neighbouring farms where some activity of that kind had been under

way for decades. I am sure that that is not widespread, but there are

pockets in the country where some distillation is taking place behind

barn

doors.</div><a name="06051010000204"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000470"></a>John

Healey:</b> In response to the hon. Member for Ludlow, in many

ways section 82 of the 1979 Act is a throwback to a regime that was

largely dispensed with in the 1980s. It required, in former days,

people other than distillers, rectifiers or vinegar makers who kept

stills to take out an excise licence and this regulatory power is no

longer required. Anyone who uses a still to distil spirits&#151;this

is the point the hon. Gentleman made&#151;must nevertheless have a

distiller&#146;s licence and they are committing an offence if no

licence is held.</div>

<a name="06051010000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are other provisions in

the clause dealing with the simplification relating to stills and

distillers, and to give the Committee an example of the degree of

obsolescence in some of the provisions we are proposing to repeal, we

shall repeal section 15(4), which requires distillers to provide

accommodation for HMRC officials in the distillery. That is clearly no 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div>longer required because the pattern of monitoring and assuring the

operation of distillers has changed these days. That is an exemplar of

what we want to achieve through the clause and I hope that the

Committee will support

it.</div><a name="06051010000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

primary legislation so that they will be the same as the amounts a

person is currently liable to pay. It also provides that certain

statutory instruments introduced to adjust the liability to duty on

hydrocarbon oils and other fuels will cease to have effect. The clause

will bring about a technical change. It simplifies the legislation so

that the actual rates of duty for road fuels and oils can be easily

established by reference to one piece of legislation, rather than

sources of primary and secondary legislation, as at

present.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000477"></a>John

rising concern about climate change and the evidence about the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div>impact that aviation has on producing gases and emissions that

contribute to climate change, that is becoming a more pressing

challenge. It is one that we must confront internationally, not just

because climate change is a global problem, but because any serious

solution to the legal constraints that exist in many areas will be

found internationally rather than domestically. Owing to difficulty

with progress on the tax front, it is also the reason why we have put

such a strong emphasis on other measures leading to effective

international action that contributes to the climate change challenge.

This Government were one of the strongest supporters of establishing

<a name="06051010000219"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000478"></a>John

Healey:</b> This is a substantial clause, covering a number of

areas of excise duty for hydrocarbon oils and biodiesel. The hon.

Member for Ludlow will have a particular interest in some aspects of

it, because it offers opportunities for constituents such as his in

rural areas to diversify their production.</div>

<a name="06051010000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause changes the rate of

excise duty for hydrocarbon oils and biodiesel from 1 September. Our

established policy is that as the UK seeks to meet its targets of

reducing pollutant emissions and raising revenue to fund essential

public services, fuel duty rates rise each year at least in line with

inflation. Budget 2006, however, announced that because of continuing

oil market volatility, the inflation-based increase would be deferred

until 1 September. Not implementing the change on Budget day, but

delaying it to 1 September will cost the public purse &#163;275

million in forgone revenue this year&#151;a considerable saving to

the motorist in anybody&#146;s terms.</div>

<a name="06051010000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fuel duty rates were last

increased in October 2003, and since there were cuts in rates in

2000-01 to incentivise the delivery of less pollutant fuels, the main

duty rates for road fuels are lower in cash terms than they were in

March 1999, and 14 per cent. lower in real terms than they were in

2000. That is an equivalent saving of 8p per litre on road fuel for

motorists. Even after the September increase proposed in this

legislation, duty rates will still be lower in cash terms than they

were in March 2000.</div>

<a name="06051010000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our policy on fuel duty has

been to balance a number of competing and complex issues: for example,

our environmental improvement objectives and our concern to raise

sufficient funding for public services, with the impact on families and

businesses when fuel costs may be higher than they need to be. We have

weighed the social, environmental and economic 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div>imperatives in the duty decisions in the clause. We have been ready to

freeze duty when appropriate and to increase it when circumstances

dictated. Through that approach, we have been able to ensure that fuel

duty policy supports environmental goals while retaining flexibility at

times of high oil market volatility.</div>

<a name="06051010000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Questions have been raised

about why we increased duty rates for rebated oils from 1 September in

the Budget, after we increased them in the pre-Budget report last year.

It is important to stress that the increase merely ensures that the

existing differential between rebated oils and main road fuels is

maintained and remains unchanged. Our HMRC analysis suggests that even

a small increase in the differential offers serious fraudsters

appreciable extra profits. Freezing rebated fuel duty while increasing

the main fuel duty rates would have widened the differential by 1.25p

per litre, significantly increasing the incentive for fraudulent misuse

of rebated fuels as road fuel. That could have undermined some of the

efforts and pressure that we are exerting on oils fraud through the oil

strategy.</div><a name="06051010000380"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

pm</div><a name="06051010000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am

also aware that some industries are heavy users of rebated fuels and

that they form a significant proportion of their operating costs. We

announced in the Budget that the Government would work with sectors

that make heavy use of rebated fuels to examine the wider impacts of

the oil strategy, and those discussions have already

begun.</div><a name="06051010000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must

continue to recognise that transport is the second largest source of

carbon dioxide emissions in the UK, and that emissions are likely to

continue growing until the end of the decade as the UK economy remains

strong. Duty differentials help to encourage the use of more

environmentally friendly fuels and to stimulate the development of new

technology that can help to reduce greenhouse gases. They can therefore

help to reduce the impact that motoring may have on local air quality

as well as on climate

change.</div><a name="06051010000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, the

clause covers the duty rate for biodiesel. It is worth reminding

ourselves of the impact of the differentials that we introduced for

biodiesel in July 2002 and for bioethanol in January 2005. Several

years ago, there was virtually no market for biofuels in the UK. It has

grown to 118 million litres, or 0.25 per cent. of the total road fuels

market. That is still a low base and there is still a long way to go,

but the measures that we are taking will increase usage to 5 per cent.

by 2010-11. The 2006 Budget proposes to encourage the wider take-up of

biofuels by announcing the extension of the 20p per litre duty

incentive for biodiesel and bioethanol until 2008-09, which will add a

degree of certainty for those who are planning to invest in and develop

the industry.</div><a name="06051010000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also

set out in the Budget further details on how we will introduce a

renewable transport fuel obligation, which will require transport fuel

suppliers to ensure that a percentage of their sales are from a

renewable source. It will be introduced in 2008-09 with the obligation

level set in the first year at 2.5 per cent. and in the following year,

2009-10, at 3.75 per cent., reaching the target of 5 per cent. in

2010-11.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div><a name="06051010000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The renewable transport fuel

obligation is a significant new measure that will give long-term

certainty to the development of the industry. Hon. Members may be

interested to know that it will also deliver savings of some 1 million

tonnes of carbon a year by 2010, which we estimate is the equivalent of

taking 1.4 million cars off the roads in Britain. I commend the clause

to the Committee.</div>

<a name="06051010000229"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000479"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> We acknowledge that the Financial Secretary and

the Treasury have to balance several competing demands in this clause.

One is in respect of the impact on the environment. If there were no

increases in duties, the Treasury would be subject to criticism on that

score. Another demand is in respect of the impact on agriculture, about

which my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow is extremely concerned. If

there were increases in duty, the Government would be criticised on

that score, so it is difficult for them to strike a

balance.</div><a name="06051010000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then there is

the question of fraud. The Financial Secretary and I considered the

matter previously, during a debate in January on a statutory

instrument. I asked him what the impact on fraud had been of reducing

the differential between main road fuels and rebated fuels. I wanted to

know to what degree any reduction in fraud had been the result of

beefing up fraud detection by the recruitment of more inspectors,

rather than narrowing the differential. I want to give credit to the

Financial Secretary, who said with commendable honesty that he could

not answer the question. He went on to say

that</div><a name="06051010000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;analysing and

estimating the scale of fraud generally is a relatively inexact

science. Very often, it is not really possible to isolate the impact of

individual measures.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Third Standing

Committee on Delegated Legislation,</i> 9 January 2006; c.

10.]</div><a name="06051010000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">That raises the question of

how effective the anti-fraud element of the measures will be.</div>

<a name="06051010000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the increases will not be

implemented before September and will generally be in line with

inflation, we shall not oppose them. I return, however, to the question

of balance. We are concerned, as is the National Farmers Union, about

the effects of rises on agriculture. The Financial Secretary and I know

that the NFU announced in the wake of the Budget that it intended to

write to the Chancellor seeking an exemption from the increase in the

cost of red diesel. I do not think that the Financial Secretary

confirmed that he received such a letter, but I should like to know

whether he did and, if so, what is the Government&#146;s

response?</div> <a name="06051010000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall

not oppose the clause. We have serious concerns about the effects of

the rises on agriculture, and we will be watching closely what happens

in the run-up to next year&#146;s

Budget.</div><a name="06051010000234"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000480"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> I begin by commending the Financial Secretary

for the clause&#146;s welcome measures to encourage more

environmentally friendly vehicle use. I hope that the introduction of

greater certainty to the duty differentials on biofuels will make a

difference and will encourage more people to make the necessary

conversions.</div> <a name="06051010000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

I would appreciate it if the Financial Secretary provided clarification

on the definition of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 64</div>biodiesel. Any confusion about the definition could hinder the

development of the market. I understand that biodiesel must be

&#147;of diesel quality,&#148; which

means:</div><a name="06051010000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It must

be a liquid&#151;not gaseous at a temperature of 15° C and

under a pressure of 1013.25 millibars; and</div>

<a name="06051010000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">It must be made from biomass or

waste cooking oil;</div>

<a name="06051010000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">The total ester content must

not be less than 96.5 per cent. by weight; and</div>

<a name="06051010000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">The sulphur content must not

exceed 0.005 per cent. by weight or be

nil.&#148;</div><a name="06051010000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to the

Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979, &#147;diesel quality&#148; means

that when blended with ordinary diesel, biodiesel will run an engine

that would normally run on diesel. Biodiesel does not have to be used

exclusively in the fuel tank, although that is

possible.</div><a name="06051010000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand

that vegetable oil is not perfect for cars. In order to make it

suitable for car use, the oil must be modified in some ways. One way to

do so is through transesterification, which involves cleaning the

vegetable oil so that it can be used in a diesel engine. That uses a

great deal of energy and some methanol, and leaves glycerine as a

by-product that must be disposed of. It is also possible to add certain

things to vegetable oil to make it usable. On the other hand, it is

possible to make changes to the car so that it can accept vegetable oil

as it is.</div><a name="06051010000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does adding

chemicals make vegetable oil of diesel quality? If the car is modified,

does that make unmodified vegetable oil of diesel quality? There is

clearly an element of confusion that could lead to perverse tax

incentives for people to use changed vegetable oil, which has to go

through a damaging process that could harm the environment, while those

who go to the expense of modifying their engines or using additives

might have no similar incentives. If such incentives exist, does the

Treasury intend to make them

clear?</div><a name="06051010000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the

deferred increase in hydrocarbon fuel duty rates. I understand that the

increase will not take place until 1 September 2006. When the

re-valorisation kicks in, it will represent an increase in line with

inflation. It will not be a real rise but will prevent a real-terms

fall. That is welcome; since 2000, when fuel duty began to decline in

real terms, the rate of increase in greenhouse gases has doubled. The

take of green taxation as a percentage of national income has also

fallen during that time. In 1999, green taxes represented 3.6 per cent.

of national income; that has now fallen to 3 per cent. Fuel duty

accounts for two thirds of the total take of green taxation, so the

rise will help to counter the decline.</div>

<a name="06051010000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, a question similar to

those raised during our discussions of other measures on vehicles

arises: what changes will the clause make to behaviour? What other

measures is the Department considering to fulfil its environmental

obligations? The proposals are okay as far as they go, but is the

Treasury considering longer-term ways of producing changes that will

impact on behaviour, pollution and the environment?</div>

<a name="06051010000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes in the clause will

not achieve that; neither will the changes proposed for vehicle excise

duty. What meetings has the Treasury had with the Department for

Transport, which is considering proposals for road-user

charging&#151;a real way of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 65</div>making the polluter pay and relating vehicle use and the impact that it

has on

behaviour?</div><a name="06051010000242"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000481"></a>John

Thurso:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that

road-user charging is the most effective way to tax road use; it

impacts on those who create the most environmental problems&#151;in

other words, cause congestion. It has the added benefit of reversing

the current problem: people who live in far-distant places such as the

north of Scotland pay 12p more for their fuel than those in

metropolitan centres. Road-user charging puts more tax on people in

areas with congestion and therefore with alternatives.</div>

<a name="06051010000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Implementing that will take

five or six years at the very least. In the interim, what could my hon.

Friend offer my constituents? Would she favour using the EU derogation,

which would permit such remote areas to have a lower fuel

duty?</div><a name="06051010000244"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000482"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> I can put my hon. Friend&#146;s

constituents&#146; minds at ease; I shall support the use of the EU

derogation on that issue. Amendments were tabled in respect of other

measures that would ease the burden of those in rural areas who have no

alternative but to use a car. Unfortunately, they were voted down.

</div><a name="06051010000245"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000483"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> The hon. Lady seems to be contradicting herself,

as she did during Committee stage in the House. She criticised the

Government for the fact that the proportion of green taxes has fallen,

but now agrees with the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and

Easter Ross that they should fall further through an EU derogation on

fuel duty. Her position seems entirely contradictory, although that is

not surprising in a Liberal

Democrat.</div><a name="06051010000246"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000484"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman may have

missed the point. The derogation refers only to a tiny, very isolated,

minority of areas. If alternatives such as improved public transport

were provided in such areas, they would probably end up being less

environmentally friendly than allowing the people there, who have no

other option, to continue to use their cars.</div>

<a name="06051010000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to impact on

behaviour, we have to change the behaviour of those who have other

options. As has been mentioned, any changes would have a massive impact

on the pockets of those living in rural areas, but would not influence

their behaviour. The only reason for using pricing mechanisms to change

behaviour is to make people use an alternative; if they do not have

one, they will have to continue to pay and the objective will not be

achieved.</div><a name="06051010000248"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000485"></a>John

Thurso:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend and shall not

intervene on her again. The question to ask the Government is as

follows: why should increases in fuel duty be capped when they reach a

certain point so that people are not adversely affected, when it is all

right for the prices people pay in remote areas&#151;they pay 5 per

cent. more&#151;not to be

capped?</div><a name="06051010000249"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000486"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I shall

close my remarks by expressing my hope that the Minister will provide

clarity on the time scale 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 66</div>to which he will work with the Department for Transport on introducing

road-user charging, so that the changes in the clause represent only a

holding measure rather than a long-term

strategy.</div><a name="06051010000381"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000487"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> I welcome subsections (3) and(4), which

maintain the differential that the environmentally friendly biodiesel

and bioethanol have in the whole regime. Together with the renewable

transport fuels obligation, the provision is providing a significant

incentive for both the domestic and European production of these

fuels.</div> <a name="06051010000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">In last

year&#146;s Standing Committee on the Finance Bill, I referred to the

excellent farmers&#146; co-operative, Farmway, which is on the border

of my constituency and that of the Prime Minister. These measures are

of environmental benefit. They are of benefit to the farming community

because they are providing an alternative outlet for it. They also have

significant employment benefits. In fact, as a result of the additional

incentives, there is a chain of petrol stations called &#147;One

green route&#148; throughout the constituency where people can

specifically buy biodiesel and

bioethanol.</div><a name="06051010000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have

some questions on the capital allowance treatment of biodiesel and

bioethanol on which I hope we can have a move to more generous

treatment. As for subsection (2)(c) and the ultra-low sulphur petrol

rate, I understand from the explanatory notes that it affects the rate

of duty on aviation gas as well, which is charged at one half of the

rate set aside for light oil.</div>

<a name="06051010000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier, the Financial

Secretary explained reasonably that we are constrained in what we can

do on aviation fuel due to a network of international treaties. I am

sure that he is aware that the fastest growth in aviation fuel is on

domestic flights. Therefore, does the hon. Gentleman know whether

international treaties apply to fuel bought for domestic as well as

international

flights?</div><a name="06051010000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051010000488"></a><b class="B">Sir

George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I want to

follow the hon. Lady by focusing on subsections (3) and (4), which

maintain the differential rates. The Financial Secretary approached the

matter from a number of angles. He mentioned the agricultural angle.

Like my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow, I have a rural constituency

where there is enormous interest in diversification&#151;an appetite.

They have got to have either a new crop of houses or a new crop of

biofuels. Within an appropriate balance, I would prefer to have the

biofuels rather than an excess crop of houses in some of the scenery.

Two points arise from

that.</div><a name="06051010000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the

Minister mentioned enhanced capital allowances. What progress have the

Government made in the application for state aids clearance? Is the

Minister still confident that he will get the necessary clearance and

that the scheme will be up and running by 2007? Because without that,

the infrastructure to support the diversification may not be

available.</div> <a name="06051010000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to

raise a second, broader issue. The Minister is maintaining a 20p

differential, but what is the logic behind 20p? Why has that figure

been chosen? Is there any flexibility or are we stuck with 20p for ever

and a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 67</div>day because that figure was put in initially? Some targets in the Red

Book seem to be rather modest against a background of 0.25 per cent. of

road fuels being accounted for by biofuels. That does not seem a high

base, but the targets are to hit 5 per cent. by using the RTFO by

2011.</div><a name="06051010000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

said that the RTFO was a new invention. In a sense it is, but it is a

close relative of the non-fossil fuel obligation, which was introduced

by the previous Administration and applied to the supply of electricity

and fuel. I welcomed that. However, if the Government are serious about

reducing carbon dioxide emissions, will a target of 5 per cent.

deliver? The higher target of 5 per cent. after 2010 and 2011 is

heavily qualified. Page 766 of the Red Book

says:</div><a name="06051010000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Government intends that the target should rise beyond 5 per cent. after

2010-11, so long as infrastructural requirements and fuel and vehicle

technical standards allow, and subject to the costs being acceptable to

the consumer.&#148;</div><a name="06051010000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is

important small print. Should not one approach the matter from the

other direction? Given that there is a strong commitment to reduce

carbon dioxide emissions and that transport costs account for such a

high percentage, should we not find out the percentage reduction that

has to be achieved through the RTFO and work backwards through that

and, perhaps, end up with a different differential from the one that we

have at the moment? Perhaps we should do that, rather than starting

from where we are and arriving at a solution that may not enable the

Government to hit their carbon dioxide emission

target.</div><a name="06051010000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like

to know whether there would be any flexibility in the

Government&#146;s approach, if it turned out that their targets were

not ambitious enough to deliver the Kyoto targets to which I believe

they remain

committed.</div><a name="06051010000260"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000489"></a>Stewart

Hosie:</b> Some hon. Members may recall that, in last

week&#146;s Committee of the whole House debate concerning vehicle

excise duty in sparsely populated rural areas, the point was made that

the major financial pain felt by people in such areas was from the

price of fuel, not the one-off cost of vehicle excise duty. Indeed,

with petrol and diesel in the Western Isles today sitting at around

&#163;1.06 a litre, the time has come for some form of change to the

duty system.</div><a name="06051010000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Financial Secretary said earlier that he had had numerous discussions

and consultations and published a large amount of information. I want

to question him on how he got to the duty rates that will be

implemented from September 2006. I welcome the comments that he made

earlier about discussions with those who use rebated fuels. In his

discussions on setting this year&#146;s rates, did he consult the

haulage industry, particularly, which is continuing to find trading

difficult, in no small measure due to the high cost of fuel and not

least because, as Committee members know, the largest element of the

cost of a litre of fuel&#151;slightly under 50 per cent.&#151;is

duty, with the remainder, up to around 65 per cent. of that cost, being

VAT?</div><a name="06051010000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Financial

Secretary&#146;s consultations, did he speak to organisations other

than the obvious 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 68</div>ones concerned with the production, refining and distribution of fuel

and the large motoring organisations? Did he speak to some of the

smaller, sectoral and geographic interests, where the high price of

fuel is particularly punitive, being based on a high duty regime? Did

his review and his consultations and discussions not only lead him to

set this year&#146;s duty rates, but will those in any way inform

debate in future&#151;perhaps on the need for a more sensitive fuel

duty regulation regime? Will he consider in future, notwithstanding the

rates set for this year, the EU derogation option, which has been

raised on a number of occasions by the Liberal Democrats? I am straying

ever so slightly, but do the Financial Secretary&#146;s discussions

lead him, perhaps, to changes in subsequent years&#146; excepted

vehicles amendment to schedule 1 to the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979

statutory instrument? Those are important

questions.</div><a name="06051010000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

in the Financial Secretary&#146;s discussions he considered the

effectiveness of the fuel duty regime in relation to business

competitiveness, not least because a litre of unleaded petrol, at

94.6p, is cheaper in every other European country, with the exception

of Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway, and because a litre of

diesel, at 97.8p, is cheaper in every other country reported by the

European Road Information Centre, based in

Geneva.</div><a name="06051010000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like

briefly to give a few examples: the Automobile Association&#146;s

figures from April show that the 97.8p average price in the UK is

opposed to 73.2p in Austria, 78.91p in Belgium, 77.84p in France,

69.27p in Spain, and so on. Is the Financial Secretary confident that

those increases, delayed as they are until September, remain the only

way to proceed, or does he keep an open mind about whether a more

sensitive regulatory regime may be appropriate and whether future

derogations may be appropriate? Will he consider options to help

sectoral and remote geographical interests?</div>

<a name="06051010000265"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000490"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I shall take a slightly different focus. I notice

from the explanatory notes that the decision to defer the increase

until 1 September was expected to cost &#163;275 million to the

Exchequer in revenue forgone in 2006 and 2007. Part of the rationale

for the delay, as I understand it from the Government&#146;s

announcement regarding the 2005 Budget, was that the increases would

not go ahead because in the short term uncertainty and the risk of

price volatility remained high, with oil trading at the end of the week

preceding 6 June at above $59 per barrel. That was a year ago. The

price of crude has gone up, and I believe that it is more than

&#163;70 now.</div>

<a name="06051010000266"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000491"></a>Stewart

Hosie:</b> Dollars.</div>

<a name="06051010000267"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000492"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I am sorry. The price is fairly close to $70, so

it has gone up and volatility has gone up. I read from the explanatory

notes:</div>

<a name="06051010000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Changes in oils duty

rates would normally take place on Budget day, but, owing to continued

volatility in the oil market, the Government has decided to defer

increases in fuel duty rates until 1 September

2006.&#148;</div><a name="06051010000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Volatility has

increased since the production of that document and since the report

last year, and prices are even higher than they were in 2005. So, I am

curious 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 69</div>about why 1 September 2006 is still the magic date for increasing duty,

when the situation has not only remained the same, but gotten worse. I

look forward to the Minister&#146;s

response.</div>

<a name="06051010000269"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000493"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> It was an interesting exchange with the hon.

Member for Falmouth and Camborne, because principles are all right for

the Liberal Democrats until they are inconvenient. We heard the

principle that the proportion of taxes from green tax should rise until

it is a bit inconvenient to her hon. Friend from the north of Scotland,

the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John

Thurso), when the proportion would drop&#151;but we heard that that

is all right, because it is only a tiny drop. There go the principles.

I understand: it is pragmatism.</div>

<a name="06051010000270"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000494"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> It is an issue of reconciling principle with

fairness. If we are going to take difficult decisions with a view to

having an impact on consumer behaviour, we must consider the areas in

which the burden will fall heaviest. It will fall heaviest on those who

are least able to afford it and have no alternative. I see no

contradiction in pursuing fairness and greater environmental

measures.</div>

<a name="06051010000271"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000495"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I agree with the hon. Lady&#146;s general

proposition that there is no contradiction. Unfortunately, in the

proposition that she set out earlier, there was just that

contradiction, which is what I highlight to the Committee.</div>

<a name="06051010000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the biodiesel and

biofuel chemistry lesson was helpful&#151;esterification and all that

stuff. It would be interesting if the hon. Lady explained her

party&#146;s view on the E85 fuel, which is being pioneered in her

region. I am happy to take an intervention.</div>

<a name="06051010000273"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000496"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his invitation

to intervene. Of course we fully welcome the fuel. I was asking for

clarification, because there is confusion among consumers about what

rebates they may be entitled to and what support may be available to

them to make a more environmentally friendly conversion to their

vehicle.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000497"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> No details on E85 then either.</div>

<a name="06051010000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a question for the

Financial Secretary. In terms of the renewable transport fuel

obligation target of 5 per cent. by 2010-11, to which he and other hon.

Members referred, what proportion of arable land in the United Kingdom

would be required to provide the bio part of the biofuels? It is all

very well talking about such targets, which is very laudable in terms

of cutting emissions, but if it means that we will have crops for fuel

at the expense of crops to eat, there may be a limit to how far we as a

relatively small country can go because of the amount of arable land

that we have. Was that availability of land, or lack thereof, taken

into account in setting the 5 per cent.

target?</div><a name="06051010000382"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000498"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I will be brief as many of the points that I wanted

to raise have been covered by other Members. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 70</div></div><a name="06051010000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the level of oil

prices and the relationship between duty, VAT and price, which the hon.

Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) went into in some detail, when

these measures come into force at the beginning of September we are

likely to face a point of extreme political sensitivity. When I filled

up my car with petrol over the weekend, I paid 98.9p per litre. Once

this duty comes into force the price, assuming everything else stays

the same, will tip over the symbolically highly significant &#163;1 a

litre point. A couple of years ago, the Chancellor responded to

pressures&#151;in particular from the haulage industry, as was

referred to earlier&#151;by deferring an increase in duty. However,

as my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree said, oil prices have now

risen considerably above the point of the 2005 Budget when that

deferral was introduced. I confidently predict that we will be living

with petrol and diesel prices that will rebound on the Government. That

could be good news for those of us who are not members of the

Government, but I am more concerned about the consumers who will have

to pay these prices to help the Chancellor with his public accounts

problems.</div><a name="06051010000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to

touch briefly on two other points: rebated oils and biofuels. In

respect of the rebated oils, I served on the Standing Committee that

discussed the last increase in January, when I declared an interest as

a farmer and therefore a consumer of red diesel, which I should do

again. I expressed the concern that at a time when agricultural incomes

are under great pressure we are adding to the difficulties of farming

for food in terms of making a profit by raising the Government&#146;s

take of that endeavour. Yet again, I plead with the Financial Secretary

to consider whether it is really appropriate to maintain a duty

differential. I heard his arguments in relation to fraud on rebated

oils, but I am

unconvinced.</div><a name="06051010000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

biofuels, I wish to make a point that followson neatly from

something that the hon. Memberfor Wolverhampton, South-West

referred to. The renewable transport fuels obligation is welcome. It is

starting from a very low base, as my right hon. Friend the Member for

North-West Hampshire suggested. However, what is not included in these

measures, and in my view should be, is any suggestion that the

percentage of renewable fuels that the Government are rightly

encouraging should come from a sustainable source. At present, the

cheapest biofuels come from parts of the world where palm oil can be

produced, and palm trees, out of which palm oil is extracted, are being

planted in areas that hitherto were sources of the greatest

biodiversity on the planet&#151;parts of the equatorial forests. We

should not put in place measures that will encourage the further

despoliation of forests in Brazil and elsewhere along the equator.

There should be a measure&#151;if not in this Bill, then in the next

Finance Bill, which I look forward to discussing with the Financial

Secretary&#151;that ensures that we are only supporting the use of

sustainable renewable

fuels.</div><a name="06051010000280"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000499"></a>Stewart

Hosie:</b> In discussions with the National Farmers Union

Scotland last year, I was told that many of its members were desperate,

willing and able to grow oilseed rape to turn into biodiesel but the

processing capacity simply did not exist. Is the hon. Gentleman

suggesting that the processing capacity to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 71</div>build up secure supply in this country should be addressed in a future

Finance Bill, so that we do not have the despoliation of the third

world by the growing of trees for palm oil there to provide cheap

supply to the

west?</div><a name="06051010000281"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000500"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I am grateful for that intervention but I suspect

that the Financial Secretary will respond by saying that that is

precisely why he announced the introduction of capital allowances for

biofuels in the Budget, a fact that I welcome. Nevertheless, it is a

valid point that by insisting on an arbitrary duty differential of 20p

per litre the Budget is not providing the right incentives to encourage

domestic biofuel production. No reason has been given that bears

scrutiny as to why the duty differential should be maintained at 20p,

and if there is a logical analysis supporting that figure I should be

interested to hear

it.</div><a name="06051010000282"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000501"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> The hon. Gentleman may not believe that there is

any logical reason for it, but I can tell him that industry members

fully support it and see its benefits for industry

financing.</div><a name="06051010000283"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000502"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I am grateful for that intervention because I think

that the hon. Lady misunderstands my point. I am not arguing that the

duty differential should be scrapped; I am arguing that it should be

maintained not at 20p but at 21.25p. There should not be an increase in

duty on the biofuels that are proposed in clauses 3 and 4. The hon.

Lady is acknowledging that from a sedentary

position.</div><a name="06051010000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make

the following final remarks because I take a great deal of interest in

biofuels for the purposes of agricultural diversification, as the

Minister was kind enough to say. In my constituency there is what I

believe to be the very first 100 per cent. biodiesel forecourt

pump&#151;I was certainly told that when I opened it. It is in the

town of Bishop&#146;s Castle, which is a leading innovator in all

forms of green effort. The feedstock for that plant comes from waste

rapeseed oil from the catering establishments of local authority

schools, which I am told is the only source of waste rapeseed oil that

is available in this country and which is clearly a very finite supply.

To expand domestic production we must undoubtedly put farmers in a

position where they can supply on an industrial scale, and my

understanding is that that is beginning to happen, although only

slowly. There are sugar beet farmers in my area who would welcome the

opportunity to turn sugar beet into bioethanol, but at present the only

plant under construction is in Norfolk, and it is probably uneconomic

to transport material to Norfolk from

Shropshire.</div><a name="06051010000285"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000503"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I caution the hon. Gentleman on his enthusiasm for

used rapeseed oil or canola oil deriving from schools. As the Ricardo

Associates report for the Department for Transport showed, either last

year or the year before, if that fuel is put in unmodified engines, the

pollution emitted from unmodified vehicles can be significantly worse

than if they were running on diesel or

petrol.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 72</div><a name="06051010000286"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000504"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I am most grateful, and I shall not detain the

Committee by discussing with the hon. Gentleman the proportions of fuel

that should be ordinary diesel and biodiesel. Biodiesel is being

gradually introduced alongside regular diesel in Bishop&#146;s

Castle&#151;I am reliably assured that once the tank has been topped

up on a sufficient number of occasions it can be used at a 100 per

cent. level without engine damage. Fuel efficiency is also improved,

and by definition that reduces

emissions.</div><a name="06051010000287"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000505"></a>John

Healey:</b> I shall try to respond to the points that have

been made in a wide-ranging and rich debate that has reflected the

different provisions in the clause. I welcome the interest that has

been shown on both sides of the Committee in developments in supporting

biofuels, including from the hon. Member for Ludlow, the right hon.

Member for North-West Hampshire and my hon. Friend the Member for

Wolverhampton, South-West. The primary policy purpose of the road

transport fuels obligation is environmental impact: the contribution it

can make to the UK&#146;s effort to deal with emissions and climate

change. To deal with those things we want to expand the UK biofuels

market, and that is our principal purpose. The principal purpose is not

to expand the UK biofuels industry, although we hope that that will be

an important consequence of our approach and we are putting some

measures in place to support its development. There are signs that it

is expanding. A new biodiesel plant is coming into production and some

bioethanol plants are starting to be in process.</div>

<a name="06051010000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for

Wolverhampton, South-West asked whether the 5 per cent. RTFO could be

met by domestic rapeseed and crop production in the UK. The short

answer is that if he examines the studies that the Department for

Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has done, he will see that it is

confident that 5 per cent. production could be met entirely from

feedstock grown in the UK. That could be done without affecting the

production of food crops, which he is concerned about&#151;partly, I

guess, because we are a net exporter of wheat. We also have a

substantial amount of set-aside land available, which could in theory

be turned over to such

crops.</div><a name="06051010000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principal

purpose of the range of support that the Government is putting in place

is to achieve environmental gains by expanding the UK biofuels markets.

It is not designed to be a new source of subsidy for UK farmers and

agricultural production.</div>

<a name="06051010000290"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051010000506"></a><b class="B">Nia

Griffith</b> (Llanelli) (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that

there is further potential with the reform of the common agricultural

policy, particularly in respect of sugar beet? There will be more

opportunities for the poorer nations of the world to export sugar cane

sugar to the EU. Subsequently, some areas in Britain where sugar beet

has been the main source of income will be interested in turning to

biofuels in the

future.</div><a name="06051010000291"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000507"></a>John

Healey:</b> My hon. Friend is right. I do not think that she

joined the debate that I was involved in last night in the Commons

Chamber about the future financing of the European Union. The

imperative to reform the CAP further was a central part of the

agreement that was reached under the UK presidency 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 73</div>in December. On sugar, she might be aware that under the UK presidency

an historic reform of the EU&#146;s sugar regime took place to remove

some of the indefensible levels of subsidy and protectionism that were

part and parcel of it.</div>

<a name="06051010000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Ludlow made

the important point that in developing the RTFO we must be concerned

about the source of the feedstock, to ensure that there are no

unintended consequences that are environmentally damaging. He might be

interested to know that as part of the preparation for the introduction

and development of the obligation we are examining how we can put in

place a carbon assurance system that allows, on a life cycle

basis&#151;this is precisely the point that he was making&#151;an

assessment of the impact and the contribution that the obligation will

make.</div> <a name="06051010000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">You might

remember, Mr. O&#146;Hara, that the hon. Member for Braintree

promised the Committee this morning that he would never take a view

that was different from the view of those on his Front Bench. This

afternoon, he has been arguing that the inflation duty increase on road

fuels should not go ahead in September. He might have missed the hon.

Member for Wycombe saying a little earlier that the Conservatives

accepted the provisions in the

clause.</div><a name="06051010000383"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

pm</div><a name="06051010000294"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000508"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> Ever on the ball myself, I had a feeling that

that question would be asked. That is why I began my mini speech with

the phrase, &#147;This is merely a probing

question&#148;.</div><a name="06051010000295"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000509"></a>John

Healey:</b> We are only on our first day in Committee,

although it feels a lot longer than that. I look forward to the further

probing questions that the hon. Gentleman may ask the Committee that

will be directed, I suspect, as much at those on his Front Bench as at

those on ours. The serious point is that the Government keep all

options under review, but it is our intention to increase rates in line

with inflation from 1 September this year. As in the past, we shall

take full account of all the economic as well as the social and

environmental

factors.</div><a name="06051010000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.

Member for Dundee, East believes that there is a case for a different

fuel duty regulation regime, he may wish&#151;as his colleagues in

the Scottish National party did last year&#151;to frame such a

proposal as an amendment to the Finance Bill, which we could debate

fully in the future. He asked, in particular, whether we consulted

beyond what he might regard as the usual and obvious suspects,

including those associations that represent some of the essential users

of road fuels, including the haulage industry. I have met the Road

Haulage Association several times since the pre-Budget report.

Immediately before that, in part to examine the findings of the Burns

review, officials met the association almost weekly in the run-up to

the Budget. That important sector of the industry has had a fair chance

to put forward its point of view. It welcomed, as did Roger King the

chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, our decision to defer

the increase in fuel

duty.</div><a name="06051010000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend

the Member for Bishop Auckland asked me a straight question about

whether domestic 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 74</div>aviation turbine fuels are taxable. I shall give her a straight answer:

the answer is yes, with the qualification that if the United Kingdom

took the unilateral decision to raise significant rates of duty on

AVTUR on domestic flights, the consequence might be precisely the

opposite to which she wants to achieve. She is worried about

environmental impact. Were we to take a unilateral decision, there

would not only be a risk to the commercial competitiveness of some of

our flights, but a serious risk that airline companies would tanker and

refuel outside the United Kingdom and therefore fly extra air miles to

service domestic routes, but doing so on fuel that was purchased

outside the United Kingdom. Such a proposal might defeat her

purpose.</div><a name="06051010000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had not

mentioned the enhanced capital allowances for biofuel plants, but the

right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire asked me about them. We

submitted the application for state aids clearance on Budget day. As he

would expect from his knowledge of how the Government work, we had

discussed it in detail with the European Commission before we put in

our formal submission. I therefore remain confident that we shall gain

the clearance that we seek for the enhanced capital allowances. I hope

that we can start the scheme early in

2007.</div><a name="06051010000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.

Gentleman and the hon. Member for Ludlow questioned the 20p per litre

duty discount and support for biofuels. We set it at that rate because

we believe that it is a sufficient incentive to help support the

development of the biofuels market. Furthermore, because it is a

significant source of tax forgone to the taxpayer, we do not want the

public purse, in a sense, to be paying over the odds for that form of

support. If the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman consult the

Budget document, they will see that, alongside the duty discount

support for the development of biofuels, we have announced that, with

the obligation, there will also be a buy-out mechanism. That

combination of duty incentive on the one hand, and penalty or

discipline through our buy-out level on the other, will give the

obligation the kick-start that it requires. It will also give the

industry and prospective investors the certainty for the long term that

they require from Government

policy.</div><a name="06051010000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to

the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, I point out that biodiesel

is eligible for duty discount if it meets the specifications set out in

the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979. That is it. However, we announced

in the Budget that the HMRC would review the definition of biodiesel

and how it operates. I aim to report back from that review by the time

of the pre-Budget report this year, so if there are specific points

that she wishes the review to take into account, I suggest that she

lets me have them and I will ensure that they are properly

considered.</div><a name="06051010000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

hon. Lady&#146;s broader argument, we know that she wants to whack up

environmental taxes and price people out of their cars, but the hon.

Member for Wycombe reiterated my point that, when making decisions

about duty, there is inevitably a balanced judgment to make and a

balance of factors that have to be taken into account. Although the

hon. Lady is concerned for duty to be used as a way of raising prices

so as to discourage people from driving, I point out that when we made

our decision on the 2005 Budget, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 75</div>the pump price that motorists were paying for petrol was 82p per litre.

We proposed a duty increase of just over 1p per litre, being conscious

that that might contribute to achieving our environmental ends, but

also balance the other factors. By the time of the pre-Budget report,

we decided that we would not go ahead with a duty increase, because the

pump price was 6p per litre higher. In those circumstances, because of

demand, the market had the environmental impact that the she advocates

that we should seek through duty. In the circumstances, we were right

not to go ahead with the duty increase and not to load those extra

costs on to motorists and hauliers; and for those concerned about the

environmental impact, the market and the price mechanism were doing far

more of the heavy lifting than the Government could or should do

through duty

increases.</div><a name="06051010000302"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000510"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> The point that I was making was that we are

talking about a very blunt instrument. If the Government are serious

about changing behaviour&#151;and their stated intention is that they

are&#151;this is not an appropriate structure; hence my call for the

Government to consider other mechanisms and structures, such as

road-user pricing, which is being investigated by the Department for

Transport.</div><a name="06051010000303"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000511"></a>John

Healey:</b><b class="B"> </b>Interestingly, my right hon. Friend the

Paymaster General has just told me that the Liberals opposed road-user

charging in Bristol, which is my right hon. Friend&#146;s area. That

is an interesting contradiction between the views that the party seems

to take nationally and locally, but perhaps that is not terribly new. I

say to the hon. Lady that, in the end, there is not one, single policy

solution to the challenges that we face. Road-user charging may well

help on one front, but it is not the single solution&#151;the silver

bullet&#151;in policy

terms.</div><a name="06051010000304"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000512"></a>Sir

George Young:</b> The Financial Secretary made an interesting

point a moment ago. Should we therefore assume that if the petrol price

goes up by more than 6p between Budget day and 1 September, the

Government will once again defer the

increase?</div><a name="06051010000305"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000513"></a>John

Healey:</b> No, I was explaining the situation that we faced

in 2005. I explained, in response to the hon. Member for Braintree, the

difficult and complex balance of factors that we had to take into

account and the judgment that we arrived at.</div>

<a name="06051010000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on the concerns raised

by the hon. Members for Ludlow and for Wycombe about those sectors of

the economy that are heavy users of red diesel or rebated fuel, I

understand the concerns of the National Farmers Union, which I met

before the Budget. We will examine the impact of the oil strategy with

the NFU, as we will with other heavy using sectors. During the

discussions, the NFU will have the opportunity, which I encourage it to

use, to help us assess the strategy&#146;s impact and put forward its

view on what consideration the Government should give to future policy

in the agricultural sector.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 76</div><a name="06051010000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of warning, though, I say

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000514"></a>John

Healey:</b> The Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 requires road

vehicles to use fuel on which the full rate of duty is charged.

However, schedule 1 to the Act describes excepted vehicles, which are

entitled to run on rebated gas oil, popularly known as red diesel. This

clause will introduce a power to enable Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury

to amend schedule 1 by statutory

instrument.</div><a name="06051010000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

schedule for excepted vehicles was first introduced in 1935. It has

failed since then to keep pace with changes in technology and

commercial practice. As far as we can tell, the last serious review of

that policy took place in the 1960s. Vehicle technology and design

continue to evolve, creating new types of vehicles that were simply not

envisaged when the framework for schedule 1 and the excepted vehicle

status were first drawn up. For that reason, vehicle owners,

enforcement agencies, tribunals and the High Court have interpreted the

schedule on a case-by-case basis, which has resulted in some

inconsistency of approach. Consequently, it has become increasingly

unclear why some types of vehicle should benefit from excepted vehicle

status and others should not.</div>

<a name="06051010000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">In December 2004, the

Government issued a consultation document on changes to the excepted

vehicles schedule. A summary of responses to that consultation was

published in December 2005 alongside proposals for changing the

schedule against a set of principles for establishing greater clarity

and consistency.</div> <a name="06051010000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

reasons for the powers in clause 8 to amend the schedule by Treasury

order are threefold. First, they will make it easier to keep the

schedule up to date so that we do not stifle developments in new engine

design and technology. Secondly, they will enable the Government to

respond more quickly when loopholes are identified to ensure the degree

of consistency and fairness that we seek in the system. Thirdly, they

will give the industry the opportunity to contribute fully to ensuring

that changes in definitions fit their industry and do not have

unintended regulatory consequences and

impacts.</div><a name="06051010000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Industry

associations with particular interests inthe matter have

welcomed our approach almost unanimously. The Agricultural Engineers

Association commented that it considers it a practical

solution.The International Powered Access Federation, the

Construction Plant-hire Association and others have also backed our

approach. We have published in draft the Treasury order to amend the

schedule, together 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 77</div>with a partial regulatory impact assessment. Those have been circulated

to Committee members and to associations and groups representing

interests in the

field.</div><a name="06051010000384"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

pm</div> <a name="06051010000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the long

run, this valuable relief can remain viable only if it has clear rules

based on consistent principles. The changes we have announced are aimed

at restoring clarity and consistency to the schedule, and the power to

add, amend or delete categories by Treasury order set out in clause 8

will ensure that the schedule continues to provide that clarity and

consistency and continues to keep pace with modern

developments.</div>

<a name="06051010000317"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000515"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> As the Financial Secretary has just intimated,

this is an important clause because it introduces a new power for the

Treasury to amend the list of vehicles permitted to use red diesel.

Those are clearly considerable powers so this debate is rather like the

one we had on the provisions in clause 2 that gave the Treasury

similarly considerable powers.</div>

<a name="06051010000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">At that time, I asked the

Minister about consultation because I wanted to be sure that it had

occurred. He has just said that a consultation document has already

been published and that groups with which the Treasury has held

consultations are satisfied. That is important because it is quite a

wide-ranging power and we shall not have the opportunity to add to or

subtract from the list in primary legislation. None the less, we shall

not oppose the clause, but I have a question for the Financial

Secretary.</div> <a name="06051010000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">This

morning, he sent round a draft of the statutory instrument in question,

which is quite detailed, and it defines agricultural tractors,

agricultural machine handlers, mobile cranes and road resurfacing

vehicles. It will clearly be an important statutory instrument. In the

letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)

that accompanied it, the Financial Secretary said that he enclosed a

partial regulatory impact assessment for the Committee. We would like

to know when the regulatory impact assessment will be complete and when

others will be able to see

it.</div><a name="06051010000320"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000516"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I have a brief question based on the draft

regulations to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Why are road

surfacing vehicles included? It seems to me that most roads built in

the UK are built directly or indirectly at the behest of the Government

and financed by them. It appears cursorily that there is a swings and

roundabouts effect in this case. Either those vehicles are not exempt,

and therefore the cost of building the road is higher because they have

to pay more for fuel, or they are exempt, and the costs of building

roads are somewhat

lower.</div><a name="06051010000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the first

case, of course, the Government will be getting the money back through

taxation because of higher fuel prices. However, that removes an

incentive for operators and constructors of road surfacing vehicles to

make them more fuel efficient because they get to run them on cheaper

fuel. It may appear to be a matter of swings and roundabouts in the

context of total Government expenditure, but whether it comes through a

lower bid price for a road with lower fuel 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 78</div>costs or a higher bid price with higher costs, environmentally it is not

a good idea to lessen the incentive for those building and operating

road surfacing vehicles by allowing them to pay red diesel prices

rather than full

prices.</div><a name="06051010000322"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000517"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> We welcome the proposals in principle as a

way of overcoming abuse with regard to exempted vehicles and as a way

of keeping up with the change in build, specification and technology of

vehicles without referring back to primary legislation. They are also a

way of overcoming adverse tribunal rulings that have highlighted the

lack of clarity and ambiguity that exists in the current

legislation.</div><a name="06051010000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although

I welcome the consultation that has taken place and I thank the

Financial Secretary for the draft regulations, I am afraid that I did

not receive the updated partial regulatory impact assessment and I

wonder whether that is because it was not enclosed in the letter that I

had, or because it went astray more widely. On that basis, I would like

to ask the Minister how much of the annual fraud of &#163;0.5 billion

a year will be overcome by the changes, and will any additional

resources be committed to enforcement measures to ensure that the level

of fraud is

reduced?</div><a name="06051010000324"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000518"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> I merely have a brief question for the Financial

Secretary. I notice that clause 8 is entitled &#147;Road

vehicles&#148;, but my question is about the application of red

diesel in respect of canal boats. The issue is of particular concern in

my constituency because a major canal runs through it. Constituents

have contacted me about the ongoing issue of red diesel, which I

believe will no longer be available for canal boats. I seek further

clarification, because there is nothing in the draft statutory

instrument to which he referred in respect of that matter. It might be

that as far as pleasure boats are concerned it is dealt with in a

different regime, but I would be grateful for further

clarification.</div>

<a name="06051010000325"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000519"></a>Stewart

Hosie:</b> I welcome the clause, not least, as the Financial

Secretary said, because it will allow the Treasury to keep up to date,

identify and close loopholes and allow the industry to engage to avoid

unintended consequences. As I said, it might provide a mechanism to

provide relief to certain other sectors and geographic areas. I am sure

that that will be examined in the months and years

ahead.</div><a name="06051010000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.

Member for Falmouth and Camborne, I think my partial regulatory impact

assessment was put in a different envelope that has gone walkies. I

would like to read it.</div>

<a name="06051010000327"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000520"></a>Mr.

Breed:</b> Like the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire,

who alluded to pleasure boats, I have received representations from a

wider series of people who use red diesel in fishing boats and in boats

where training is undertaken on one part and pleasure on another. Some

activities qualify for red diesel and some do not and there are

difficulties in trying to swap between the two. I am not sure whether

certain things happened as part of that consultation exercise.

Certainly pleasure craft, fishing boats and the marine industry as a

whole have not been mentioned in the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 79</div>statutory instrument. Are the Government still considering that matter

or have they reached a decision?</div>

<a name="06051010000328"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000521"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> In considering clause 8, I wanted briefly to

reflect the concern of the road hauliers in my constituency. The issue

is about a level playing field. The Freight Transport

Association&#146;s chief economist, Simon Chapman, said:</div>

<a name="06051010000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whether it is the cost

of the diesel itself or the duty, every lp per litre on the price of

diesel adds &#163;140 million to industry&#146;s overall operating

costs. The Chancellor already takes &#163;4.2 billion per year in

diesel duty and lorry VED from heavy goods vehicles out of a total of

&#163;43.5 billion from all road

users.&#148;</div><a name="06051010000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Duty on diesel in

the UK is 47p a litre, which contrasts with a European average of just

22p a litre.</div>

<a name="06051010000330"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000522"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman is

discussing the wrong clause. Clause 8 is about excepted

vehicles.</div>

<a name="06051010000331"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000523"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I am referring to

duties.</div><a name="06051010000332"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000524"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Gentleman would square the

circle, I should be very pleased.</div>

<a name="06051010000333"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000525"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I am attempting to do so. Substantial problems

are generated for the domestic industry, which is in competition

against foreign vehicles that are working in the UK using cheap

European fuel. About one in eight of the heaviest vehicles on UK roads

now comes from overseas. The level playing

field&#151;</div><a name="06051010000334"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000526"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is out of order.

Clause 8 is about excepted

vehicles.</div><a name="06051010000335"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000527"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I accept the Chairman&#146;s

charter.</div><a name="06051010000336"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000528"></a>John

Healey:</b> I am glad that we have had the opportunity to hear

several contributions to this debate, because the provision is

important. The excepted vehicles schedule and scheme is

important.</div> <a name="06051010000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

grateful for the welcome that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne

gave to the clause. The partial RIA will be posted shortly on the HMRC

website. I will make sure that members of the Committee receive a copy

and that it is available in the Vote Office for other hon. Members to

consult. The full regulatory impact assessment, about which the hon.

Member for Wycombe asked me, is a draft order out for consultation in

order to help us finalise the provision. It will be published alongside

the instrument, in the summer.</div>

<a name="06051010000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall tackle the question of

my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West by referring

back to the purpose of the clause, which is to reintroduce a clearer

set of principles to underpin the eligibility set out in the schedule.

Whether or not different categories of vehicle qualify for excepted

vehicle status would be made clearer and more consistent.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div><a name="06051010000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle derives from the

fact that the duty on oil raises funds for the Government. We spend

that revenue in various ways, including the upkeep of the road network.

It has long been accepted, and was behind the original introduction of

the scheme, that vehicles used in areas, such as agriculture and

construction, that make only incidental use of public roads that are

maintained in that way, should not make the same contribution to the

upkeep of that road infrastructure. For that reason, categories of

vehicle that only incidentally use the main road network are classified

as executive vehicles and therefore eligible to use red diesel at the

heavily discounted duty rate in comparison with main road

fuels.</div><a name="06051010000340"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000529"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> My hon. Friend said that the regime has been

amended and tweaked, to use my words, since it was introduced in 1935

when, I would venture to say, environmental concerns about emissions

from vehicles were not high on the agenda of any Government or

individual. By road surfacing vehicles continuing to use red, rather

than full price, diesel, an incentive is removed that ought to be there

for operators of those vehicles to buy road lane vehicles that are more

fuel efficient. It is precisely because it goes back to 1935 that the

provision is a historic hangover that the Government ought to

address.</div><a name="06051010000341"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051010000530"></a>John

Healey:</b> Once we start considering the environmental

consequences of such matters, red diesel is a lot less clean than main

road diesel. The types of vehicles involved in various facets of road

construction need to be treated in the way that we propose under the

schedule. Some are quite heavy users of the road fuel network, which is

why some, according to our proposals, will not be eligible in the way

that they have been in the past.</div>

<a name="06051010000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principal case, which I

have attempted to explain to the Committee, is the answer to the

question of the hon. Member for Braintree. No one can say that road

hauliers are anything other than heavy road users. There is no case and

they have never been excepted road vehicles under the terms of schedule

1. Therefore, there is no case for their being treated as such even

though they may wish to make other parallel arguments about the levels

of fuel duty and the costs that they impose as part of their

operations.</div><a name="06051010000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,

turning to the rather extraneous question that the hon. Members for

South-West Hertfordshire and for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) asked

me, canal boats come under a separate regime. They are not excepted

vehicles. However, they have a right to use red diesel rather than main

road diesel paid at that rate. The reason is that the UK has a

derogation from the energy products directive in the European Union. It

allows private boat owners to continue to use red diesel&#151;a

derogation that is due to expire at the end of December of this

year.</div> <a name="06051010000385"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7

pm</div><a name="06051010000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following a

long process of detailed discussion with many boating associations, and

following detailed analysis within HMRC, we announced in the Budget

that we believe that there is a strong case for arguing with the

European Commission that we should havean extension of that

derogation. The UK has the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 81</div>opportunity to submit an application for that extension. We confirmed in

the Budget that it is our intention to do just that. Alongside the

Budget, we published our first regulatory impact assessment, which we

built in consultation with the boating associations. That sets out our

case quite strongly. We will apply in that way for the UK&#146;s

derogation, which would allow private boat owners in the UK to continue

to use red diesel, and which would mean that we did not incur the cost

and the consequences that an ending of the permission would

entail.</div> <a name="06051010000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for South-East Cornwall talked about fishermen in his

constituency. Just to be clear, commercial boats are not subject to the

derogation. Commercial boat owners and users can use rebated gas oil or

red diesel anyway, without the provision of that derogation, so they

will not be affected by the European Commission&#146;s ultimate

decision on whether 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 82</div>we will be entitled to extend the derogation that applies to private

boat owners. I hope that that is helpful to the hon. Gentleman, and

generally to Members who raised points about the clause. Given the

hour, I hope that members of the Committee will allow clause 8 to stand

part of the Bill.</div>
