							<b class="B">Mr.
Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): On a point of order,
Mrs. Anderson. It is a great pleasure to have you back in
the Chair. You were in the Chair on 29 January when I raised in the
Committee the issue of the Government&#146;s promised amendments on
the financial assistance scheme. In the light of this morning&#146;s
Court of Appeal judgment&#151;the Government lost, again, and were
heavily criticised by the Lords Justices&#151;it is particularly
relevant that we find out how the drafting is coming
along.</div>
					<a name="08020783000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I am
about it, could I also ask where we are with the draft regulations? Any
would be nice. I do not think that we have seen a
single line of draft regulations, yet the Bill is peppered with clauses
calling for regulations. Perhaps the Minister could help me out as I
have given him prior warning of this point of
order.</div>
					<a name="08020783000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000256"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman would agree that that is more
a question to the Minister than a point of order. Does the Minister
wish to
respond?</div>
					<a name="08020783000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000257"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b> I am grateful to the hon.
Member for Eastbourne for giving me notice of his point of order. I
will respond in a little detail because I know that he wants
clarification on this and I will try to give it.</div>
					<a name="08020783000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">In oral evidence to the
Committee on 17 January, my hon. and learned Friend the Minister for
Pensions Reform said that we were focused on delivering the package of
improvements to the financial assistance scheme as quickly as possible
and that, to that end, we would be looking to use existing powers to
make changes by regulations, wherever
possible.</div>
					<a name="08020783000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. and
learned Friend said that as a first step we would be bringing forward a
set of regulations in March to increase payments to 90 per cent. from
the current 80 per cent., and from normal retirement age. He proposed a
short two-week consultation, subject to the views of Opposition Members
and others. We are grateful that that has subsequently been
agreed.</div>
					<a name="08020783000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
regulations are currently being drafted and the supporting explanations
are being prepared. We expect the two-week consultation period on them
to begin on 6 March. During that period, we will conduct face-to-face
consultation with key stakeholders, including trade unions and members
of the Pensions Action Group.</div>
					<a name="08020783000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the meantime, we will today
be tabling a new clause to the Bill. This will extend the definition of
those who can qualify for the FAS to include those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>whose schemes are still winding up, but who would
otherwise have received their benefits in full from the scheme. This is
necessary because to take over all members&#146; assets, we will need
the power to make FAS payments to them so that we can pay them what
they would have expected to receive from their scheme. There will be an
opportunity to consider the matter in more detail when we discuss this
new clause after the forthcoming short
recess.</div>
					<a name="08020783000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the letter
sent to all Members last Friday, my hon. and learned Friend said that
we were considering where other small adjustments might be needed to
existing powers to deliver all elements of the package of improvements
to FAS, and that there might be a need for a few further changes to be
made via the Bill, when it goes to the other place for consideration.
However, the vast majority of the changes necessary to deliver the
package can be made via
regulations.</div>
					<a name="08020783000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
intend to publish a further set of draft regulations before the end of
March, which will make provision for other key elements of the package,
such as early retirement on ill-health grounds. There will be a final
package of regulations later in the year to deliver the remaining parts
of the package that will move us to a position in which financial
assistance payments are calculated on a basis that is broadly
comparable with the Pension Protection
Fund.</div>
					<a name="08020783000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that
provides a thorough answer on the matter of regulations in respect of
the FAS and other parts of the Bill. I can tell the
hon. Member for Eastbourne that we are discussing&#151;and even
considering&#151;the content of those with the Personal Accounts
Delivery Authority, and it is quite right that we should do so. They
will therefore be brought forward as soon as is practically
possible.</div>
					<a name="08020783000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s interpretation of the court judgment was a bit
slanted. If he looks at the judgment in detail, he will see that there
is very much support for the Government&#146;s position with respect
to many of the matters under consideration. With regard to the rest of
it, we are considering leave to appeal at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="08020783000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000258"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Mrs.
Anderson. May I just clarify one point? The Minister says that he is
going to table a new clause today. The House is not sitting tomorrow,
or indeed next week, so I assume that that clause will not be printed
until we return after the break. It will therefore probably not be
debateable until the Thursday of the week after next, at the earliest.
Will the Minister undertake to let all members of the Committee
know&#151;</div>
					<a name="08020783000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000259"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. It is my understanding that if
the new clause is tabled today, it will be printed
tomorrow, so it will be available. It is clear from the
Minister&#146;s very detailed response that there will be the
opportunity to have this discussion after the short break, so I think
that we should move
on.</div>

amendment No. 6, in clause 74, page 35, line 21, at end

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) subsection (1) shall not apply to any
member of the reserve forces who is paid for more than six months in
any three-year
period.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08020783000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you back to the Chair for our afternoon sitting,
Mrs. Anderson.</div>
					<a name="08020783000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that I
technically have to declare an interest, in that I am not currently a
member of the reserve forces, but I was for 12 years, in an earlier
life. When I served, the role of territorial soldiers, the Royal Naval
Reserve forces and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force was somewhat quieter
than it is today. It is no secret that our reserve forces are much more
of an integral part of the combined efforts of our armed services
across the world at the moment. Not all members of the Committee might
be aware that territorial soldiers are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, it is really on the issue on the length of time for which many
of our reserve forces are serving that I have tabled the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08020783000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I
joined the Territorial Army back in 1980, one classically did a night a
week, a weekend a month, and perhaps two weeks&#146; annual
continuous training a year&#151;if one was really
keen, one would go on a few extra courses&#151;and that was it. Of
course, one understood that the pay did not come with pension
contributions, and that was not a problem.</div>
					<a name="08020783000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">My friends who are still
Territorials tell me that there are many territorial soldiers and
members of other reserve forces who serve for quite long
periods&#151;tours of six months or more are not unusual&#151;and
come back for perhaps a short time before going out again. It is no
secret that the regular forces are short of people to fill those
places, so our three armed services rely very heavily on the reserves.
I really just want to challenge and probe the Minister as to whether he
and his officials should perhaps go back and speak to colleagues in the
Ministry of Defence, re-examine this issue, and get some exact
statistics and figures on the number of reserve forces personnel who
are serving on extended tours of duty, and perhaps back-to-back tours
of duty.</div>
					<a name="08020783000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
people who make more or less a full-time career out of being a reserve
soldier. They might come back to do something else for a while, but
then their camaraderie, or whatever campaign is being fought throughout
the world, calls them back. That situation might continue for very many
years. The years could mount up until suddenly they take stock of their
financial situation and realise that the work for which they have
earned their income for many years has not
represented pensionable service, although their
colleagues in the regular forces have been amassing nice pension
contributions during their
service.</div>
					<a name="08020783000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">All that I am
really saying to the Minister is that the world has changed and there
is now a much greater length of service. The whole issue of the
military covenant is quite rightly under discussion. He might be
familiar with the phrase &#147;one Army&#148; with regard to the
Territorials and full-time Regular Army. Although this is the classic
position, it might perhaps need to be revisited, so I would ask him to
consider that. If he cannot come forward with a proposal now, I would
ask him to go back to the Department and consult with Defence Ministers
and with the wider reserve forces community on this issue, and perhaps
give us further thoughts on the matter on
Report.</div>

Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): It is a pleasure to be back under your chairmanship,
Mrs.
Anderson.</div>
					<a name="08020783000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I echo the
comments made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne about the financial
assistance scheme. I do not wish to reopen that debate, but it is
important that we proceed quickly to a resolution on that important
subject.</div>
					<a name="08020783000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000262"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000263"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> Indeed. As the hon. Gentleman says, there was a
further defeat for the Government in a series of defeats that should
lead to prompt
action.</div>
					<a name="08020783000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire addresses an
important point that has been raised by Territorials in my
constituency. As he said, Territorials, on average, are now expected to
spend a great deal more time on active service than in the past. That
potentially changes the nature of our obligations towards them,
including in the area of pensions. Those people might
choose to be automatically enrolled in pension schemes in their regular
employment, but it is important to ensure that the Government meet
their pensions obligations to people who now spend a good deal more
time on active duty than six months every three
years.</div>
					<a name="08020783000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000264"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will know from
Territorials in his constituency that some of them do not have another
job while they are serving. They might have worked as a security guard
for a while, but give that up to go on a six-month tour. They might go
on a back-to-back or extended tour. They therefore accrue no pension
contributions at home from any other
job.</div>
					<a name="08020783000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000265"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is exactly right, and that
is my experience. We are particularly keen for those people who move
from job to job, or might not be employed during those periods, to be
supported by the Bill. They should be part of the target group. The
Minister&#146;s response, which I look forward to hearing, is
important for ensuring that those people are properly served in the
pension world, given the service that they are giving their country as
Territorials.</div>
					<a name="08020783000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000266"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> This is an important matter, and I am
grateful to the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire for tabling the amendment. I certainly respect his
experience.</div>
					<a name="08020783000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
confirms that some members of the reserve forces and cadet forces
volunteers do not come within the definition of &#147;Crown
employment&#148;, as set out in clause 71, which we considered this
morning. The amendment would bring within the scope of the
Bill&#146;s provisions on employer duty reservists who are paid for
at least six months&#146; service in any three-year period.
Reservists who attend intermittent periods of weekend training and an
annual camp might fall in that
group.</div>
					<a name="08020783000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sympathetic to the spirit behind the amendment,
but I shall explain why we do not think that it is
necessary. The Ministry of Defence already routinely enrols members of
the armed forces and reservists who are mobilised, or take on a
full-time reserve service commitment, in a defined benefit pension
scheme.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div>
					<a name="08020783000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000267"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> It is important to be clear about the
language involved. There is a difference between a reservist and a
territorial soldier. A reservist is someone who has been in the regular
forces and has an ongoing commitment afterwards, but I am really
talking about Territorials. I am sure that the Minister is coming to
that
issue.</div>
					<a name="08020783000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000268"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The Minister is fully aware of the distinction,
and the hon. Gentleman rightly anticipates that I am about to deal with
that point. I am just being complete for the record. I wanted to make
it clear that reservists who are mobilised or take on a full-time
reserve service commitment are enrolled into the defined benefit
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08020783000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
we may reasonably expect non-mobilised reservists and cadet force
volunteers to be in civilian employment&#151;the same goes for most
of those in the Territorial Army&#151;through which they will have
the same right to workplace pension saving as any other worker as a
consequence of the Bill. The commitment is there for those who have an
extensive engagement with the armed forces&#151;they are enrolled
and, incidentally, none has opted out&#151;but for other categories
of people, most will be deriving the bulk of their income from other
sources and will be automatically enrolled through their other
employment, rather than through very short periods of spasmodic
engagement with the armed forces. We would certainly want everyone in
that category to be covered by the Bill, but it is likely that they
will be covered by another
route.</div>
					<a name="08020783000229"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08020783000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to our plans for an
important change in the way the armed forces are to be treated by the
Bill. Members of the forces occupy a special position in law. Many
employment law remedies, such as unfair dismissal, do not apply to the
armed forces and we need to avoid any potential for confusion.
Therefore, after very full consideration and consultation with the
Ministry of Defence, we have decided that bringing the armed forces
within the scope of the employment right created by this Bill would be
inappropriate.</div>
					<a name="08020783000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
policy intention is therefore to remove the armed and reserve forces
from the scope of this Bill in their entirety. I want to reassure the
Committee that that does not mean that we will be treating members of
the armed forces less favourably in any respect. As I have already
explained, the Ministry of Defence already automatically enrols members
of the armed forces as a matter of routine. This includes reservists
who are mobilised or have taken on a full-time reserve commitment. All
those people become members of a non-contributory defined benefit
scheme. Unlike the arrangements for other public servants, the Ministry
of Defence has no record of anyone ever opting out of the scheme.
Naturally there will be a further opportunity to debate this issue in
more detail once the Government amendment to achieve our aim is tabled
and before us.</div>
					<a name="08020783000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be helpful at this point if I clarify the position for cadet
force adult volunteers. These people offer their time and effort
without receiving a wage or pension contributions, although they might
receive recompense for attendance. As such, they do not have access to
pension savings in respect of their voluntary work. While we recognise
the important contribution 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 448</div>of these volunteers, which supports the Government's
policy of engaging with young people, and the
responsibilities involved when working with them, we do not believe
that this voluntary service should attract pension provision when there
is a reasonable expectation that such individuals will be saving
separately by means of other employment, and as such will be
automatically enrolled into a scheme. Having made this decision, it
seems sensible to make it clear that such individuals are not to be
brought within pension provision in respect of their voluntary work
within the forces.</div>
					<a name="08020783000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has raised an
important point and given me the opportunity to clarify the situation.
With those reassurances, I hope that he will be able to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000269"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister. I do
not doubt his good will and good intentions when he says that he is
going to table an amendment to take all the armed forces out of the
Bill. He spoke about those who serve with the regular forces and about
reservists and then, if I heard him correctly, he said that most
Territorials will have the opportunity through their workplace to save.
However, he did not address the point that I specifically raised about
those people, many of whom I served alongside&#151;I remember well
their lifestyle and employment
history.</div>
					<a name="08020783000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">It strikes me
that in the same chapter of this Bill we have a clause about agency
workers. The TUC, quite rightly, has been standing up for the rights of
agency workers. It might be an odd term, but, in a sense, this is
another group of agency workers who are putting their lives on the
line. I had not decided to force a vote, but I am not satisfied with
what I have heard from the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08020783000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000270"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Let me try to help out the hon. Gentleman. I
reiterate that the reason why we take our position is because normal
employment rights do not apply to the armed forces, save in respect of
anti-discrimination measures, as he knows from his experience. All
other normal rights, such as unfair dismissal, do not apply. There is
no dispute about that, or pressure to alter it, because of the unique
role, terms of engagement and demands placed upon those people. The
hon. Gentleman quite reasonably made all those points.</div>
					<a name="08020783000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we were to
include the armed forces in this measure, we would run against the
understanding that normal employment rights do not apply. The idea of
automatic enrolment is another normal employment right. For the sake of
consistency, it is better to be clear that this does not extend to the
armed forces. It would be inconsistent to make a special arrangement
for the group of people about whom he talks, given that the armed
forces as a whole are not going to be included because of their special
employment status. That would be odd, because the group about which he
talks will, for the most part, have alternative employment and will be
automatically enrolled. I want the landscape to be
consistent.</div>
					<a name="08020783000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
that we are trying to do down, or to be unreasonable towards, the armed
forces. They have very good schemes that more than adequately meet the
qualifying criteria. The issue will not arise because we want to treat
it separately to keep this consistent with every other aspect of
employment rights. I hope that helps.</div>

Selous:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister, but I do not fully
accept the logic of his argument. I understand that
serving regular forces or Territorials do not have normal employment
rights in terms of how they conduct themselves. That would obviously
not be appropriate, but I am not sure that the analogy can correctly
extend to pension contributions.</div>
					<a name="08020783000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I accept the
Minister&#146;s argument about normal employment rights, there is an
issue about this group of people. The Minister seems
to be sticking to his argument that all the Territorials have other
jobs through which they can auto-enrol. My point is that there are some
who treat being a Territorial as their main form of employment. They
might have very casual employment outside the Territorial Army when
they are back in the UK for perhaps quite long periods when they are in
their 20s or early 30s. It does not seem right to say that there is a
blanket
exemption.</div>
					<a name="08020783000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000272"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Let me try to reassure the hon. Gentleman
further. We are not trying to be unreasonable towards the group of
people whose interests he is speaking up for perfectly
reasonably.</div>
					<a name="08020783000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a further important problem that the hon. Gentleman needs to consider
when he decides whether to press his amendment to a Division. TA
members are volunteers. Volunteers cannot be jobholders within the
definitional terms of the Bill&#151;they are not an
employee and not a worker. Given that we have already accepted the
definition of jobholder, it would be difficult to get a TA volunteer
into the terms of the Bill. It would be hard to make the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s proposal fit with every other aspect of the
provision.</div>
					<a name="08020783000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000273"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> Again, I hear what the Minister says.
He has a brief and a position that he is doing his
best to advance, but I do not accept the logic of his argument. Once
people put on the Queen&#146;s uniform as a reserve soldier, sailor
or member of the Royal Air Force, they are a jobholder. It would be
easy to amend the definition in the Bill. Those people are certainly
subject to the full demands of military law the moment that they walk
through the door and put on the
uniform.</div>
					<a name="08020783000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Auto-enrolment
will not be forced on anyone. People will have the option to say no. I
have not been reassured by what I have heard. If there were enough
members of the regular forces, for whom the Government would be paying
pension contributions anyway, the Government would be paying this money
as a matter of course. There are long periods of reserve service
because the regular forces are under strength at the moment, and I will
press the amendment to a
Division.</div>

							<a name="08020783000286"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I am happy to relieve my hon. and
gallant Friend the Member for South-West
Bedfordshire&#151;Captain Selous&#151;and to take on the arguments
about a new set of
issues.</div>
					<a name="08020783000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is our first sniff of the simplification&#151;or deregulation, as it
is sometimes called&#151;agenda. We shall hear much more about that
in a later sitting when we debate our new clauses relating to
conditional indexation, for example, so I will hold my fire on many of
the issues until
then.</div>
					<a name="08020783000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department commissioned an independent report on deregulation from
Chris Lewin and Ed Sweeney some time ago. They published their report
on 25 July 2007. The Government subsequently issued their own detailed
comments on the Lewin-Sweeney
document.</div>
					<a name="08020783000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, I pay tribute to Chris Lewin and Ed Sweeney for their
labours&#151;they obviously expended a lot of time and
effort&#151;but it is interesting that on some of the key questions
they were unable even to agree among themselves. In some ways, what we
have is a fairly timid report with some fairly timid recommendations
about deregulation. With all due respect, the Government&#146;s own
timidity about deregulation builds on
that.</div>
				
					<a name="08020783000230"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08020783000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does that
matter? It matters because those of us who still believe that the best
way forward for many people is defined-benefit schemes are prepared to
try almost anything that might encourage a sponsoring employer to
continue providing a DB scheme open to both new members and existing
members. We know there has been a gentle trend of decline in
defined-benefit membership since, if I remember rightly, the late
1960s. On this Government&#146;s watch, that decline 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div>has speeded up dramatically, and bodies that should
know what they are talking about&#151;such as the
Association of Consulting Actuaries&#151;are warning all of us that a
second or third wave of companies might get out of the DB business in
the near future unless they are thrown a lifeline. I do not wish to
reopen the levelling down argument which we have exhaustively
investigated in previous debates, but the crunch moment for many of
them may come in 2012, or whenever the system of personal accounts
comes in.</div>
					<a name="08020783000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
smokescreen of having a Government-sponsored, Government-backed scheme,
albeit with only a 3 per cent. employer contribution, might encourage
some employers&#151;and I am not necessarily talking about
unscrupulous employers&#151;to say to their employees, &#147;We are
not going to carry on with our own scheme; here is a Government scheme.
It&#146;s perfectly okay. Why don&#146;t you enrol in that?&#148;
We know from the National Association of Pension Funds that the average
employer contribution in traditional DB schemes is about 16 per cent.
That is going to make a very significant difference to people&#146;s
outcomes for retirement. The onus is on us, on both sides of the
Committee, to grab any passing suggestion which can make it easier for
these employers to keep going.</div>
					<a name="08020783000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recently
had a trip to the Netherlands, about which I will say much more when we
talk about conditional indexation. I went there to find out why they
have something like 94 per cent. of all employees in DB schemes. It is
absolutely incredible. What are they doing right that we are not doing?
It is always difficult to export and import ways of doing things from
one country to another, although there are a lot of similarities
between what we do and what they do in the Netherlands. What they do is
to build flexibility into the system, making it more attractive for
employers to keep on with proper DB schemes. Lewin and Sweeney&#146;s
starting point, which we accept as common ground for us and the
Government&#151;and, I suspect, for the Liberal Democrats as
well&#151;is that accrued rights should be protected. Any rights
acquired up to this date should be left alone.</div>
					<a name="08020783000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lewin and Sweeney said that
risk sharing should be facilitated, and I think that is important, so
that we get a third way&#151;to coin a phrase&#151;between DB
schemes and straightforward DC schemes where the whole risk is put on
to the employee rather than the employer. Their review has some
interesting things to say about other issues, particularly
principles-based legislation, which is a big topic, and perhaps not one
for today. There is the abiding problem of section 67 of the Pensions
Act 1995, about which debate rages as to whether it stops employers
changing some of the terms of existing pension
schemes.</div>
					<a name="08020783000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
may be wrong, but I think the Government&#146;s default position on
this is that section 67 does not stop people doing these things, which
might be worth doing. It seems to me that as long as many employers
think that&#151;presumably on the basis of the legal advice they are
getting, since I know we lawyers are always ultra-cautious in these
matters&#151;then perhaps we should be doing something about section
67. There is also talk about statutory override, but a new clause deals
with that so I shall return to the subject later. One recommendation
was for a change in the law on pension and divorce, hence clause
78&#151;a clause of one and a quarter lines but of substantial
significance.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>
					<a name="08020783000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mosied down to the Library to
dig out a volume called &#147;Jackson&#146;s Matrimonial Finance
and Taxation&#148;, which gives some useful background. I hope that
there is not an eighth edition; the seventh is the best I can do. The
authors make the point that pension rights are nowadays one of the most
valuable assets to be argued about between the parties on divorce. When
it comes to dividing the matrimonial assets, the pension is more
important than ever. In Brooks <i class="I">v</i>. Brooks, a famous case, many of
those issues were addressed, and much dissatisfaction was expressed
about the existing state of the law.</div>
					<a name="08020783000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The view has
been expressed that as a matter of common law the courts still had some
power to offset&#151;I think that was the expression&#151;pension
rights versus other rights. For instance, if the husband&#151;almost
invariably it is the husband&#151;had built up a substantial pension
pot, the wife might get more of the equity in the house. In the Brooks
case, the House of Lords decided that there was such a jurisdiction. It
was the Pensions Act 1995&#151;as a fresh-faced young Back Bencher, I
had the privilege to serve as a member of the Committee that considered
that legislation&#151;that first gave the courts the power to attach
or earmark part of all of a pension or a commuted lump sum. That came
into effect in 1996. Under the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999,
which came into effect in 2000, the concept of pension sharing replaced
that of pension splitting.</div>
					<a name="08020783000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue has been round for
some time, but one of the difficulties is apparently the concept of
protected or safeguarded rights within pension funds.
The Government&#146;s position was given in the deregulatory review
of private pensions. The review stated:</div>
					<a name="08020783000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There are concerns
about the complexity of the requirements and the
different treatment of pension credit rights. The Government agreed
that some of the requirements are unnecessary and, at the next suitable
opportunity, will repeal the legislative requirements relating to
safeguarded rights.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
review continued:</div>
					<a name="08020783000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Government&#146;s
proposals in this area were warmly welcomed by all the correspondents
who raised the issue.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pausing there for a moment, it is
interesting to note that I have not seen any briefing notes or evidence
from any outside bodies opposing the provision&#151;nor have I seen
any that support it. I can only assume that a veil of silence has
fallen over the proposal, which must mean that everyone is happy with
it. If I get a sack full of letters as a result of
this speech, we will know differently. The review went on to say
that</div>
					<a name="08020783000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
abolition of safeguarded rights will be taken forward in the Pensions

what is happening.</div>

that some 10,000 pension sharing orders are made every year and in the
impact assessment the Government estimate that between 4,000 and 5,000

that the courts would welcome, as would many of the couples involved in
these difficult divorces. Assuming that my understanding of the thrust
of the modest little clause is correct this side of the Committee
welcomes the
proposal.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000287"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
supporting the clause in that way. It abolishes
safeguarded rights and as such is part of what will be a rolling review
of the pensions regulations designed to achieve a degree of
deregulation. He will of course know, having seen the Lewin and Sweeney
report, that there is no magic bullet that will achieve the
deregulation that we want. It is an exercise that needs to take place
over time, looking at all aspects of existing pension regulations. A
number of measures that we can take to achieve deregulation now appear
in the Bill. This is one of them and there are others that we will
debate either today or in later sittings. The hon. Gentleman is
perfectly right to identify that as one of those deregulatory steps and
I am pleased that he welcomes it. As he says, when a divorcing couple
or civil partners who are dissolving their relationship&#151;it does
include that&#151;seek a final financial settlement the court must
take into account the value of any pensions held by either party to the
divorce or partnership dissolution. One of the options open to the
court is to make a pension-sharing
order.</div>
					<a name="08020783000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a divorced
scheme member&#146;s sharable pension rights
include contracted-out rights, the former spouse&#146;s share of
those rights is know as the safeguarded rights, and those rights are
subject to a detailed regulatory regime, similar to but not the same as
the rules for contracted-out rights from which they are
derived.</div>
					<a name="08020783000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
received representations, both as part of the deregulatory review of
private pensions and also prior to the review, that safeguarded rights
serve no useful purpose, that they restrict the options available to
the member and just add administrative complications to pension
schemes. We have been persuaded by those arguments and have taken the
opportunity to bring forward the clause and to remove safeguarded
rights. That is a useful, and I am pleased to hear a supported, step
towards the process of
deregulation.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Waterson</b>
							<b class="B">:</b>
						One likes to think that the concept of
safeguarded rights was introduced originally for some purpose. Has the
Minister been able to identify who or what it was meant to protect at
the time, or has it been a complete misnomer from the
start?</div>
					<a name="08020783000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000289"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Safeguarded rights were introduced for
contracted-out benefits&#151;derived from the national insurance
rebate&#151;to protect public funds. Therefore, safeguarded rights
were created to protect the national insurance rebate when
contracted-out rights were shared between the parties to a marriage or
a civil partnership. They were broadly intended to reflect
contracted-out rights and to ensure that those rights were securely
protected and used for their intended purpose, that is to provide an
income in retirement. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>When they were introduced it was thought that they
provided additional protection to pension credit
members, but since they do not require a minimum level of payment that
is not in fact the case. They were introduced for good reasons but have
proved to be unnecessarily bureaucratic and that is why we brought
forward the proposal to abolish them. I am pleased that the hon.
Gentleman supports that and I hope that it will therefore become part
of the

							<a name="08020783000290"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> First, I want to echo some of the comment made
by the hon. Member for Eastbourne about both the importance of the
deregulatory review and the work that came out of
that, and of the deregulatory agenda more generally, aimed at
protecting, where possible, existing defined benefit schemes. Some of
the matters that we will come to discuss, particularly under the new
clauses, are ones for which I have considerable
sympathy.</div>
					<a name="08020783000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I would be grateful for a bit more information from the Minister on the
evidence base for the Government&#146;s decision to include the
provision to reduce the cap on growth funds for deferred members of
certain occupational pension schemes from 5 per cent. to 2.5 per cent.
Obviously, the main argument in favour of clause 79 and the associated
schedule 2 is that it will provide support for the remaining defined
benefit schemes. That certainly has been the representation made to the
Committee by organisations such as the National Association of Pension
Funds and the Engineering Employers Federation, which made the point
both in its evidence and the briefings it
supplied.</div>
					<a name="08020783000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to know what evidence the Minister has that this will do
something to slow the closure of defined benefit schemes. It is
interesting to look at what the independent reviewer said around this
idea.</div>
					<a name="08020783000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
not inclined to recommend a change in approach to the revaluation
requirements for deferred benefits. Although there will be some cost
savings for final salary schemes (partially offset by extra
administrative costs due to the need to revalue two separate tranches
of benefit at separate rates) these would be made entirely through
reduction in the value of the benefits of those who leave the scheme
before pension age. We have seen no evidence that this change would
ease administration, encourage risk sharing or slow closure of final
salary
schemes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a fairly strong view from the people the Government asked to conduct
the independent review into deregulation. I would be interested to hear
on what basis the Government and their officials reached the opposite
conclusion, which led to the inclusion of this provision in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08020783000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly,
representations from other organisations&#151;I particularly draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to the TUC and to Unite in this
context&#151;suggested that what this provision could potentially
mean is a significant erosion of some members&#146; benefits.
Depending on the measure that is used, inflation is currently running
at around 4 per cent., which would mean that deferred pensions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>would be worth 1.5 per cent. less per year in real terms at the moment,
if this arrangement applied now. Over a long period, if those
arrangements were maintained&#151;the Minister will no doubt draw
attention to the Government&#146;s inflation target and so
on&#151;this could amount to deferred pensioners, perhaps those who
deferred a long time in advance of retirement age, losing quite a
considerable proportion of the benefits they would have expected to
receive.</div>
					<a name="08020783000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
with many other provisions in the pension system, there is currently,
therefore, a risk. I wonder to what extent the Government have
evaluated the possibility that this change could potentially have a
significant effect, particularly on women pensioners. Women pensioners
suffer from a number of different aspects of our pension system and I
would like to hear from the Minister that the impact on women is
something he has particularly taken into account in considering and
bringing forward the proposed
change.</div>
					<a name="08020783000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">To quote the
independent reviewers
again:</div>
					<a name="08020783000215"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although
available data is patchy, it seems to us that women could be
proportionately affected by a reduction in the cap, because they are
more likely to earn pension benefits early in their careers and then
leave the workforce for periods of time to undertake caring
responsibilities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
in the Bill that went on to become the Pensions Act 2007, the
Government made the argument that at least some of the changes that
they were bringing forward were there to support and advance the
position of women pensioners. Though the Bill did not go as far as some
of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil
(Mr. Laws) at that time, we did welcome the progress that
was made. There is a concern, however, that the current
Bill&#151;subject to what the Minister has to say in response about
the evidence he has looked at in relation to the impact on women
pensioners&#151;is actually sending some quite mixed
messages.</div>
					<a name="08020783000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument, which has some force, that has been
advanced particularly by the NAPF is that the
measures contained in the clause and in schedule 2 are necessary to
help protect existing defined benefit schemes. The representation from
the TUC has suggested that this change might, in some circumstances,
encourage employers to close high-quality existing schemes,
saying:</div>
					<a name="08020783000216"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
statutory revaluation cap also provides protection for current
employees in defined benefit pensions, not least when employers make
changes to schemes. If for example a scheme was closed to future
accruals, all the existing members would be treated as deferred members
with their benefits adjusted for inflation up to statutory
cap.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, if the scheme is closed and people are therefore able to
apply the lower cap that is proposed, there is a potential advantage to
employers of closing the scheme. That is the TUC's argument. I wish to
hear what consideration the Minister has given to that important point,
because it needs to be thought through properly before the item we are
discussing is put on the statute
book.</div>
					<a name="08020783000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
should like to hear the Minister&#146;s answer on this
complicated issue, about which there are arguments on both sides. I
wish to be reassured that the impact that the provision may have on
young people's incentive to save was considered properly by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div>Government when drafting the clause. Clearly, in the modern labour
market, we all know&#151;I guess that Members of Parliament are more
conscious of it than most&#151;that there is no such thing as a job
for life. <i class="I">[I</i>
						<i class="I">nterruption</i>
						<i class="I">.]</i> Perhaps the Minister
thinks there is; perhaps the hon. Member for Eastbourne does. People
often move from job to job and might have several jobs&#151;or even
two, three, four, five or six jobs in a year&#151;and under the Bill
there will be the opportunity for automatic enrolment in respect of
every one of those jobs, because having left an employer and moved to
other employment, people are therefore deferred in the context of
earlier employment. What impact does the Minister think the reduction
in the cap would have on the incentives for people to join pension
schemes throughout their lives, given that doing so could result in a
reduction of the benefits that they could receive from the pension
schemes from earlier periods of
employment?</div>
					<a name="08020783000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
be interested to hear the Minister's answers to all those important
questions, before we move on and agree to the clause standing part of
the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08020783000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000291"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I suppose that the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey should know about having more than one
job, because not only is he trying to shadow the Department that it is
possible for 40 per cent. of all Government spending, but he is also
chief of staff to his new party leader. Clearly, he is a renaissance
man. However, I do not agree with him. I do not agree with the TUC,
either, which was wrong to throw its toys out of the pram when this
proposal surfaced. We Conservatives were quick to support the
Government on this matter, but we said, in other ways, that they should
be going further and
faster.</div>
					<a name="08020783000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The TUC needs
to take a trip to Holland, because the unions there are closely
involved in running the big sectoral defined benefit schemes and are
totally on the same page as employers&#146; organisations on how such
things are run and on having flexibility built in. People like those at
the TUC need to get on board with the idea that it is about having a
choice between having a Rolls-Royce pension and, perhaps, a Jaguar or
even a Volvo one, if that is their tipple. However, if people insist on
a Rolls-Royce pension, they may have no such scheme at all and may end
up with an employer reverting to a simple defined contribution scheme
or, when the day dawns, pointing his employees towards the personal
accounts with their 3 per cent. employer contributions. So there are
some real dangers of people, such as those in the TUC, overplaying
their hand. All credit to Ministers for at least coming up with this
brand of risk sharing and
flexibility.</div>
					<a name="08020783000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commend
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey for
picking a quote out of the Lewin and Sweeney report that sounded
clear-cut and black and white on the issue, but it seems to me that the
more relevant quote from their report is
this:</div>
					<a name="08020783000217"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Once
again, we find good arguments on either side of this
question.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is very
much in the mode in which they discuss almost everything in the report.
I do not criticise them, in that they were coming at the issue from
different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>directions. They are both experienced men with a lot of expertise, but
they simply could not agree on some of the fundamental
issues.</div>
					<a name="08020783000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000292"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right in what he points
out about the report. The purpose of what I said was simply to hear
from the Government the reasons why they had decided to come down on
one side of the argument rather than another when the independent
reviewers had not been able to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08020783000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000293"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> It certainly was not the conclusions of Sweeney
and Lewin that persuaded the Government to do
anything specific. In a masterpiece of draftsmanship, they finally came
up with this immortal line. As the hon. Gentleman accurately said, they
did not recommend a reduction in the cap, but they concluded by saying
that they
would</div>
					<a name="08020783000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;understand if
Government took the view that, when looking at the package as a whole,
a reduction in the cap from 5 per cent. to 2.5 per cent. was one of the
measures
needed&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020783000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I was a Minister receiving that report, I would probably be tearing my
hair out. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>The Minister has been, obviously, or
somebody has. It seems strange to produce a report with so few firm
conclusions. Perhaps that illustrates the minefield that we are in at
the moment, but let me be absolutely clear about this. We think that
the prize is to retain and encourage DB schemes, which will always
produce the best possible retirement income, broadly speaking, for
individuals&#151;much better, let it be said, than personal accounts
and significantly better, on average, than DC
schemes.</div>
					<a name="08020783000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, to
their credit the Government, in their own conclusion,
said:</div>
					<a name="08020783000219"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government remains concerned about the continuing decline in
occupational pension provision and that, if nothing is done, the
decline will continue...It is clear that there is no single
&#145;magic bullet&#146;, or, as this consultation has shown,
&#145;a consensus
option&#146;.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree
with all of that. There is no single magic bullet, but there is a
package of different things, some of which are in the Bill but some of
which are not yet, that we think could give the necessary impetus to DB
schemes for the
future.</div>
					<a name="08020783000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, the measure is meant to take effect from January 2009
and will affect only rights accrued after that date. The basic
principle, which I think is common ground, is that any rights accrued
before this legislation will not be touched at all. The Government
estimate that</div>
					<a name="08020783000220"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
reduction in the cap would deliver potential savings for employers of
up to &#163;250 million...a
year&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08020783000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">possibly rising to
as much as &#163;400 million a year. That is worth having in what is
a difficult environment for companies running these
schemes.</div>
					<a name="08020783000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I totally
agree with the NAPF. When it commented on this aspect of the Bill when
it was published, it described it as &#147;an important first
step&#148;. We agree. We also agreed with <i class="I">Pensions Week</i> when
it said:</div>
					<a name="08020783000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Most
notable by its absence in the bill was any conclusion over the
industry&#146;s proposals for risk-sharing
strategies.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000232"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">We
shall come on to that in much more detail, but in this instance we

backing.</div>

							<a name="08020783000294"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> This has been a helpful debate on an
important change that the clause introduces. I am
grateful to the hon. Member for Eastbourne for his expression of
support for it. My problem with the approach of the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is that he has taken this
entirely in isolation, and based his criticisms of it as through it
were a stand-alone change. It needs to be seen in the context of
everything else that is happening. The reform is part of a broad
package. That is what Turner asked us to do; it is what everyone has
understood needs to be done. For example, the hon. Gentleman tried to
argue that this specific form would in some way be particularly
disadvantageous to women. He should bear in mind the whole
package.</div>
					<a name="08020783000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
we have already made changes, which will apply in due course, to the
number of years required to qualify for a state pension. The main
beneficiaries of that reform are women. The majority of those in the
income bracket who will, we hope, become participating members of the
new personal schemes introduced by the Bill will also be women. The net
effect of all the measures being taken will be substantially to improve
the pension position of women in the future. I suggest that the hon.
Gentleman should bear all of these things in mind, because this is part
of making a sustainable
whole.</div>
					<a name="08020783000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000295"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> I think that I acknowledged, in what I said
earlier, that the measures taken in the previous Pensions Bill, as well
as the personal accounts, will have benefits for women. My intent was
not necessarily to criticise these arrangements, but to probe the
Minister&#146;s evidence base on aspects of the clause, so that the
Committee can be assured that all potential criticisms have been looked
into in deciding to bring the measure
forward.</div>
					<a name="08020783000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000296"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am coming to that. I understand that the hon.
Gentleman wants to know the evidence base, and I will come to it in
detail in a moment. I wanted to reassure him on the
broader context. One thing on which we all agree is that good quality
occupational pension provision has to be encouraged. Traditionally, in
our country, such provision has tended to be made up of
defined-benefit, often final salary, schemes. However, due to a
combination of factors such as high life expectancy and lower
investment returns, the cost to sponsoring employers of running
defined-benefit schemes has increased significantly over recent years.
Mainly as a result of these cost pressures, we have seen a decline in
the number of schemes which are open to current and new
employees.</div>
					<a name="08020783000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">While the
Government have no power to control many of the underlying cost
factors, what we can do is review legislation which affects
occupational pension schemes, and seek wherever possible to minimise
the cost burdens arising from such provision. If a member leaves an
occupational scheme before reaching pensionable age, the pension rights
which have been left behind in the scheme&#151;the deferred
rights&#151;can be undermined by inflation if no revaluation
increases are provided by the scheme over the period of deferral. That
is why schemes are required to award a minimum level of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 459</div>revaluation on such rights. When in the 1980s the
statutory revaluation requirement was introduced for deferred pensions,
it was recognised that it would be counter-productive and wrong to
impose a potentially unlimited cost burden on schemes.</div>
					<a name="08020783000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The balance of member
protection and scheme affordability was set by requiring schemes to
revalue deferred pension rights by the rate of inflation over the
period of deferral, or by 5 per cent. per annum, whichever is less.
When the 5 per cent. cap was set, inflation was running at a
significantly higher level than it is now. In fact, over the previous
five years, it had averaged almost 9 per cent. In other words, the
balance was struck such that there was no expectation that schemes
would have to protect deferred pensions fully against inflation. Due,
however, to the sustained reduction in inflation in recent years, that
is now the effect of the 5 per cent. cap. The similar cap which applies
to the limited price indexation requirement on pensions in payment has
already been reduced to 2.5 per cent. per annum, and bringing the
revaluation cap into line with this figure was one of the proposals
considered as part of the recent deregulatory review of private
pensions. We think that it is sensible to include this reform in a
package of measures to help employers to continue to provide
occupational pension schemes for their work forces.</div>
					<a name="08020783000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">In judging that a reduction in
the revaluation cap is now appropriate, the
Government are clear that pension rights that have already
accrued&#151;this point was made by the hon. Member for
Eastbourne&#151;should not in any be affected by the introduction of
the lower 2.5 per cent. cap. We have drafted the legislation carefully
to make sure that that is absolutely clear.</div>
					<a name="08020783000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will have noted that schedule 2 makes equivalent changes to the
provisions of the Pension Protection Fund, so that the shape of PPF
compensation continues to reflect the statutory requirements of the
pension scheme. It would be perverse for a compensation scheme to offer
better benefits than those that a person would have expected from their
own pension
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08020783000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked for specific
evidence. Let me share with him the extent of support for this measure,
the endorsements that it has received and the reasons why it has been
endorsed. For example, this clause is specifically endorsed by the
National Association of Pension Funds, the Association of British
Insurers, the Engineering Employers Federation and the Co-op
Group.</div>
					<a name="08020783000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In endorsing
the clause, the EEF said that the reduction in the cap
would</div>
					<a name="08020783000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make it more
likely that those schemes that have been closed to new members will
decide to remain open for future accruals to existing
members&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020783000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey would
like to see that happen and there is evidence, from those in the field,
that that would be the effect.</div>
					<a name="08020783000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CBI also gave us a little
more insight in this area. If the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey does not mind, I will share
with him the full extent of their support for the measure, because what
the CBI said is interesting in the context of the way that the hon.
Gentleman spoke. The CBI told us:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 460</div>
					<a name="08020783000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Firms have faced an
escalating burden of cost in running DB schemes over the past decade,
resulting from longer lives and higher regulatory costs. Where
appropriate, it is right to reduce these burdens to improve scheme
health. The proposals to amend the limited price indexation (LPI) cap
to 2.5% for deferred members...is therefore welcome. As this is a
forward-looking measure, scheme members will know from the outset what
rate of revaluation their savings will have and will not be
&#147;unfairly&#148; re-valued. Reduction to 2.5% is also
appropriate to delivering the original intention of the legislation -
limited price indexation - in the current the economic
climate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
will accept those arguments. This is a measure that reflects
today&#146;s lower inflation environment and it is part of a package
of wider deregulatory measures. We hope and believe that it will
help employers to maintain defined benefit
occupational pension provision into the future. Therefore, I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will support this clause.</div>

the long run that S2P should cease to be earnings-related and instead
will become a flat-rate scheme, based on earnings at the low earnings
threshold. In its report, the Pensions Commission said that, as part of
the &#147;package&#148;&#151;I think that it is very important to
keep that word &#147;package&#148; at the forefront of our
minds&#151;that it recommended, that this process should be
accelerated and that S2P should become flat-rate by around
2030.</div>
					<a name="08020783000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying to
deal with this issue as briefly as I can, but some of it is a bit
complicated. The Pensions Act 2007&#151;I am sure if the Minister
keeps up, he will get there in the end.</div>

					<a name="08020783000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pensions
Act 2007 accelerated this flat-rating even further and again, that is
all fairly clear. Where things started to unravel was the Budget last
year when we had the harmonisation of the national insurance
contributions upper earnings limit, the UEL to the initiates, and the
threshold at which higher rate income tax becomes payable. The Pensions
Policy Institute, God bless it, pointed out that the effect of this
would be an increase in the value of the state second pension built up
by higher earners running counter to the flat rate in
contention.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div>
					<a name="08020783000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">However
somebody in the Treasury failed to spot this consequence until the
pre-Budget report in October when they announced that the introduction
of the upper accrual point, or UAP, was brought forward to April 2009.
With great energy, my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Hertfordshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Putney, in
deliberations on the National Insurance Contributions Bill,
have been trying to nail down various things&#151;why this was not
spotted, why it happened in the first place and how many people lose
out as a
result.</div>
					<a name="08020783000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think I am right in saying, though I have been unable to find the exact
reference today, that in the Red Book there was a figure of &#163;4
billion allocated against this change, which presumably was to be paid
by somebody. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this is yet
another stealth tax on middle England, because people are paying
contributions, but will not get anything in return. So by aligning
national insurance with income tax in this way, the Government have
imposed another stealth tax. Contributions that were once made towards
earnings-related benefits now contribute towards precisely nothing,
they are just contributions to the
Exchequer.</div>
					<a name="08020783000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs&#146; impact assessment pointed
out at the time that 2.1 million people with income above the UEL are
contracted out of S2P and went on to
say,</div>
					<a name="08020783000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
individuals will either see a reduction in their take-home pay, as they
will get a lower rebate on their national insurance contributions than
would otherwise have been the case, or a reduction in the money that
goes into their pension
scheme.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I say, my
hon. Friends working on the other Bill have been trying very hard to
establish just how many people are affected in this
way.</div>
					<a name="08020783000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
point&#151;I do not want to take overlong on this clause&#151;is
that this change was a key component in the overall package
post-Turner, following the recommendations of the Pensions Commission.
As we have said on other issues in this Committee, any attempts to
unpick the basic package, on which there is a broad political
consensus, and indeed a consensus outside politics, is a dangerous way
to go. The whole package was a complex business of give and take in all
sorts of ways, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Putney made clear
in the debates in Committee on the National Insurance Contributions
Bill,</div>
					<a name="08020783000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
concerns related to the fact that this was the &#147;take&#148;
part of that package, and there was a big question mark over the
&#147;give&#148; part, which was the re-establishment of the
earnings link.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, National
Insurance Contributions Public Bill Committee, </i>15 January 2008; c.
52.]</div>
					<a name="08020783000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the most important
point here because the Government seem happy to fiddle with the flat
rating issue, changing what was in the Turner package. We will have the
opportunity later, because I have put down a new clause about it to
press the Government again as to when they do expect to restore the
link between average earnings and the basic state pension. It may be
something the Minister can put us out of our misery on now and tell us
what is the current intention of the
Government.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000300"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> I just want to echo one or two of the hon.
Member for Eastbourne&#146;s points because there
is a package involved here. It was always the
intention&#151;particularly in the Turner package but also, as has
been discussed, under the previous Pensions Bill&#151;that
the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>flat rating would very much be a development that
would go alongside the uprating of the basic state pension in line with
earnings.</div>
					<a name="08020783000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
explanatory notes make clear for this clause, the reference year is
expected to be 2012. It is expected, although not yet certain, that the
uprating in line with earnings would start from 2012, but the
Government have given themselves a degree of flexibility to change that
so that it might be at any time up until during the next
Parliament before that particular change
commences.</div>
					<a name="08020783000234"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08020783000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have argued
from these Benches that the 2012 date is, in itself, too late; that
improvement should start as soon as possible. However, if there is to
be a clear sense that this particular measure is going to take effect
from 2012 then, equally, it needs to be the case that the uprating in
line with earnings, to match it alongside, is going
to take place from 2012 as well. The Minister&#146;s reassurance on
that basic point, which is pretty fundamental to this part of the Bill,
would be gratefully received by the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08020783000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000301"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am grateful that the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
acknowledged that there is a package of notice to be considered here,
as I was encouraging him to do so in the previous debate. Part of the
package&#151;aside from what the Bill is doing&#151;is the very
extensive reform taking place to the state pension. He will also know,
as was also acknowledged by the hon. Member for Eastbourne, that a
considerable part of that is the extensive reform of the state second
pension. Having simplified future rights to the state second pension,
clause 80 and schedule 3 of this Bill go a step further. These
provisions enable us to simplify past accrued pension
rights.</div>
					<a name="08020783000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Put
simply, the key proposal is&#151;for people retiring after
2020&#151;to bring forward the calculation that would currently occur
at state pension age. In doing this, any and all accruals of additional
state pension up to 2012&#151;be they accrued rights to graduated
retirement benefit, SERPS and/or S2P and contracted-out
equivalents&#151;would be rolled up into a single cash value amount.
This amount would then be revalued annually in line with earnings
during a person&#146;s working life. As a result of this, people will
be able to work out much more easily what state pension they can look
forward to and, subsequently, be better able to plan appropriately for
their retirement.</div>
					<a name="08020783000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to bring to the Committee&#146;s attention that we still
wish to bring forward amendments to this part of the
Bill to simplify the contracted out deductions payable as part of this
consolidation. The required amendments are technical and therefore
demand very careful drafting, but I can confirm that we will bring
these forward as soon as possible.</div>
					<a name="08020783000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to reassure hon.
Members that I intend to provide them with a comprehensive fact
sheet&#151;I know they will look forward to this&#151;setting out
all the details of what is being proposed here, hopefully in the most
digestible manner possible. I will do that in time for the amendments
that I have just referred to.</div>

technical. Given that these changes are still some way off before they
come in, and there will therefore be further
opportunities to consider this during the passage of the Bill, we will
bring that amendment forward before the consideration of the Bill is
complete. When we supply him with his very useful fact sheet the hon.
Gentleman will see the complexity of this and the importance,
therefore, of spending time on it to get it absolutely right. We want
to achieve a simplification of a state second pension system here. The
parts of the S2P that we are dealing with have accumulated a lot of
changes over the years. It is a complex task to achieve simplicity, as
it often is in Government.</div>

					<a name="08020783000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the point the hon. Member for Eastbourne focused on at some length, the
changes announced in the PBR and the points he made in respect of the
upper-earnings limit on national insurance contributions and his
suggestion that there is a stealth tax hidden in here. I will try to
persuade him that that is not the case.</div>
					<a name="08020783000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The May 2006 White Paper
announced our intention to convert the earnings-related state second
pension into a flat-rate top-up to the basic state pension. The process
would commence around 2012 and is expected to be finished by 2030.
Changes to the tax and national insurance thresholds announced in
Budget 2007 have the knock-on effects of extending this transition and
of high earners gaining entitlement to more state second pension
compared to the position outlined in the White Paper. Measures
announced in the pre-Budget report subsequently are consistent with the
original intention stated in the White Paper. To keep within our
original timetable we are bringing forward to 2009 a key feature of the
White Paper proposals, a cap on accruals. To add clarification from the
Pensions Policy Institute, which I think the hon. Member for Eastbourne
prayed in aid to support his own argument. Responding to this point, it
said:</div>
					<a name="08020783000226"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;While
this may sound like a significant policy change, widely reported to
save the Exchequer &#163;2 billion, it in fact refers to a technical
change introduced to restore the flat-rating of S2P back towards the
path originally envisaged in the Pensions Act 2007.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div>
					<a name="08020783000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">They went to explain
that,</div>
					<a name="08020783000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;from 2012, S2P
will be payable on the same earnings as originally envisaged in the

2030.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020783000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
matter of keeping faith with the intentions as originally set

Pension Credit: Extension of Assessed Income Period For Those Aged 75
or
Over</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000308"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I hope that I will not detain the Committee long
on clause 81 which we also welcome. Consensus seems to be back on the
menu.</div>
					<a name="08020783000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">This arose
out of the creation of the pension credit system and the ruling that
anyone 65 or over is not assessed on a weekly basis, as was the case
with minimum income guarantee. There is no responsibility on pensions
to report changes in income on a weekly basis. Instead, this is
normally assessed on a five-yearly period with automatic uprating
during the lifetime of the assessment. The policy assumption being that
they are very unlikely to have any changes in their incomes over the
age of 65.</div>
					<a name="08020783000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
clause 81 is doing&#151;and it is very welcome&#151;is to say that
those 75 and over will be given an indefinite
assessed income period. Instead of having the
intrusion, complications and confusion of a five-year assessment they
will run on the existing basis. Presumably, there will still be an
underlying obligation if they have a great windfall or something to
inform the pensions service, but beyond that they will not be troubled.
I can do no better than quote with approval the comment of Age Concern
when they said:</div>
					<a name="08020783000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This proposal makes
good sense and will be welcomed by people over 75 who will be able to
look forward to a guaranteed income without having to go through a
reassessment process. However, it is very important that people
understand the system and know to ask for a reassessment if their
financial situation changes and they become entitled to extra
money&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020783000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we will
endorse that and support the thrust of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08020783000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020783000309"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Thank you, Mrs. Anderson. I am
grateful to the hon. Member for his support for this clause, which is
an important one.</div>
					<a name="08020783000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assessed income periods are, as
he says, a key feature of pension credit. They were introduced to
remove the weekly means test for pensioners aged 65 and over. An
assessed income period is currently a specific period of up to 5 years,
during which time the customer does not have to report changes to their
retirement provision, broadly their income from capital, annuities and
retirement pension. When the assessed income period comes to an end,
customers need to provide evidence and information on
their current income and capital&#151;in the same way as they do at
the start of a claim&#151;before another can be set.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 465</div>
					<a name="08020783000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
subsection (2) of the clause is that claimants aged 75 or over will be
generally be given an indefinite assessed income period. This will
remove the need for those customers to provide evidence and information
every five years on their retirement provision once this has taken
effect. From age 75 people's retirement income&#151;as the hon.
Member for Eastbourne said&#151;tends, broadly, to be more stable.
Most people by the time they reach that age will generally have
converted any pension pots into an annual
income.</div>
					<a name="08020783000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) of the clause will apply where an assessed income period is brought
to an end by the expiry of a period of five years or more and the
claimant is aged 80 or over. Again, generally the assessed income
period will be extended
indefinitely.</div>
					<a name="08020783000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) makes some explicit provision about the commencement of the earlier
subsections but, broadly, the changes will apply from 6 April
2009.</div>
					<a name="08020783000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(6) is important&#151;it is the sunset provision. The new provision
inserted by Subsection (4) covers those people already in receipt of
pension credit who have an assessed income period at the point of
introduction. The provision only needs to be in place to cover these 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>customers for a maximum of five years&#151;therefore it will cease to
have effect on 6 April 2014, five years after its initial
introduction.</div>
					<a name="08020783000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of clause 81 is to introduce a significant easement targeted at
those most elderly pensioners who are unlikely to have any significant
changes to their income and capital, and who may be worried about the
impact of small fluctuations in those things on their benefit payments.
Their responsibility to inform us of major changes, as the hon. Member
for Eastbourne says, of course remains.</div>
					<a name="08020783000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is worth clarifying
that these pensioners will still be able to request a review of their
claim should their retirement income or capital reduce. So I am
grateful for these words of support and I hope the Committee will agree
that this clause be part of the
Bill.</div>
