                  </span> Good morning to
you, Mr Scott, and to members of the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000009">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause 1
repeals the control order regime. It will come as no surprise to the
Committee that I am very unhappy about that, and I will give my reasons
as we move along. Let me say right at the outset that I was impressed
by the evidence sessions on our first day, and the commitment and
contributions of those involved were illuminating. I am sure that that
will shape the Committee’s view on how we proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000010">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition are upset about the proposals. We accept that the control
order regime is not perfect, and everybody has said that prosecution is
the preferred option, which they would want to see. The reality,
however, is that that cannot be achieved in certain cases. We all agree
that the duty of any Government is to put people’s security and
safety at the highest level, and that will, on occasions, limit the
rights of individuals.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000011">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is the
situation we face. The risk level is at “severe”. We face
threats from a whole range of people. When I was Prisons Minister, I
visited some of our prisons and I saw some of the terrorists who had
been prosecuted, and they really are scary people. Next year, a large
number of them will be released on licence, and they will be back in
society, so the threat is always there. It is always worth putting on
record our thanks to the police and security services for the work that
they do in protecting us from such threats.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000012">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The control
order regime is necessary. Its repeal through clause 1 is the result of
the coalition Government’s position, and we heard evidence about
that from Lord Carlile and Lord Howard on Tuesday. There is nothing
wrong with that; if that is what the Government want to do, that is
what they want to do, but as we heard from the police, the control
order regime seems to be working okay, and they are at ease with what
happens. The Director of Public Prosecutions also felt that the regime
was working.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000013">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">People
thought that we needed a review, and we understand that, but they
seemed confident that that the powers the control order regime gave
them were useful tools to deal with the difficult individuals we are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 56<a class="bkMark" name="Column56">&#160;</a>
                  </div>talking about. Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer—he
was in that job for 10 or 11 years—thought that the regime was
appropriate and was being dealt with in the best possible way. The
counter-terrorism review suggests that we will need further emergency
legislation in the near future and that such legislation will require
even more draconian powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000014">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Who is asking
for the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 to be repealed? It is not the
police, the security services or the public, but the coalition. It had
to reach an arrangement, and there was a long debate before it reached
an agreed position. We now have a terrorism prevention and
investigation measures résumé, which makes it clear that
control orders will not be as tight as they are under the existing
legislation, and I fear what that will mean, because the risks will
increase, which is a danger to the public. The Government, and we as
politicians, should reflect on that. We are creating a greater risk
than that which exists at the moment. Furthermore, if we repeal the
2005 Act, we will be bringing in a Bill that lifts a lot from the Act,
so one could ask whether we need the Bill at all.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000015">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We heard from
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Osborne about the Bill’s resource
implications. We will lose a number of powers, particularly the
relocation powers. He said that in the bid that the police submitted to
the Home Office, the resources and assets required would be immense.
Lord Carlile said that the resources now are about £1.8 million,
which could go up to £18 million to deal with the training and
development of people and assets to put the new regime in place. Losing
the power of relocation, which we will come on to in later clauses, is
of great concern, given that the Olympics and the Paralympics take
place next year. If the power is lost, we know that a number of the
controlees could be back in
London.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000016">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We do, but we want to ensure that the balance
is right for protecting the public. Control orders came about as a
result of the horrendous events around the world and in London, and we
are in a position where difficult decisions have to be taken about the
balance. I think that the new regime that the Government are
introducing is a step too far, because it gives more freedoms to the
controlees, which is a problem that we will discuss later in relation
to the issue of agreed locality. I accept that it is a difficult
balance, but for the sake of the nation’s safety and security,
the Government—

                  <em> </em>It is clear, and if the
coalition gets the Bill through, they must accept that they have
changed their position. The balance has changed from safety to a more
libertarian outlook. I think that is dangerous, and it is not only me
who says so—it is the police and the security services, too.
Those of us who have had to make difficult decisions in the past have
had to weigh up the facts.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000020">&#160;</a>

that we have before us a coalition agreement on a difficult issue where
the two parties had different views on what should occur. Let us not
dress it up as anything different. We will still have a form of control
orders—mini-control orders—and we will come on to that
later. Why are we getting rid of the existing Act at a time when there
is a need for transitional support, because of the time required to
train officers for surveillance and the time required for the assets to
be developed? There is also the cost of all of that. Can we not take
that into consideration?<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000031">&#160;</a>

considered in the past and rejected, because of that. It may be
appropriate on charges under pre-detention. The evidence that we heard
from Lord Carlisle, the police and, indeed, Lord Howard about issues
such as relocation, which we will come on to later, suggested that the
balance should stick with the security services and not letting risk
increase. That is my

the hon. Gentleman back to an earlier intervention and the soundbite
that we should always fall down in favour of security rather than

argue that control orders were not tough enough and that, for security
reasons, people should be detained permanently under a control order,
because that would maximise
security.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000034">&#160;</a>

prosecution is where we would all want to be, as that has the clearest
effect. The reality, however, is that that cannot happen, because of
issues around intelligence gathering and evidence that is inadmissible
in court, despite security services knowing that individuals pose a
threat. That is the
difficulty.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000035">&#160;</a>

from coalition politics—I am aware of the process that

lowest common multiple, and it will do. However, it does not provide as
much public protection as control orders, and it would be foolish

coalition Government and the members of the Committee will make the
arguments to get the Bill through—I have been in the
Minister’s position, ensuring that Bills go through—but
this is a serious issue for national security. There are a number of
reports that are critical of what the Government are doing, such as the
report by the Joint Committee on the Draft Detention of Terrorist
Suspects (Temporary Extension) Bills, which was published this morning

workability.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000039">&#160;</a>

of a Joint Committee, with members from both Houses and all parties,
reflecting on one of the outcomes of the Government’s
counter-terrorism review. Taking evidence in a calm way, rather than
going for a political fix, has led to a different

about the relocation issue. He also expressed concern about the time of
the implementation. The police are concerned that the bid only went in
last Friday. We do not yet know whether the resources will be made
available, how large they are or the cost. There was not an accrual of
feeling that this is a wonderful replacement to control orders. Lord
Howard said that he supported TPIMs, but Lord Carlile said that he did
not and that it was the lowest common denominator.

                  </span> It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr Scott, for what is my first Public Bill
Committee. I am concerned about some of the comments that we heard at
the beginning of our debate, because it seems that people fundamentally
misconceive the purpose of Parliament. We live in a state of liberty.
Parliament’s role is to circumscribe that liberty, so everything
that we do in the House decides how our liberty is curtailed in various
ways: whether it is smoking in the car, as it we debated yesterday,
having to wear a seat belt or being prosecuted for murder. Our 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 61<a class="bkMark" name="Column61">&#160;</a>
                  </div>purpose is not to decide what is in the national security interest and
then allow people to live outside that
bound.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am concerned about the tenor of discussion by Opposition Members. There
are many things in the Bill to be debated, and I look forward to going
through it in great detail. However, the first thing we must do is make
sure that all our freedoms are protected as far as possible, and strike
a balance. I am worried about the arguments that arise from the
principal proposition of the hon. Member for Bradford South that
national security comes first, not liberty, and the idea that this is
some sort of political football. There is something decent and honest
about the measure came about, and the position is not as the right hon.
Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Bradford South said that the public have not asked for
the Bill, but the Liberal Democrats achieved almost the same share of
the vote as his party at the previous election on a manifesto which
specifically committed them to getting rid of control orders. We have a
coalition Government. There are strong views on both sides of the
Government about the nature of control orders and how we circumscribe
liberty. There is no objection to the Labour party; it is just that we
have a difference of opinion. In coming together, we have come up with
a new way of addressing the very difficult problem of just 12 people
who are consuming huge amounts of parliamentary time and enormous state
resources. It is great that we are here, and there is nothing dishonest
about that. We are fulfilling the democratic mandate that we have
together, and which the Opposition are quite rightly
challenging.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000054">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s argument, which he has also put effectively in the
Chamber. He talks about the rights and freedoms of people, and we focus
necessarily in such debates on the rights of individuals who might be a
threat to the community. Does his consideration of rights, liberty and
freedom extend to the rest of the population, who are at risk of being
killed by those

                  </strong> I am not denying that point. I am not trying to
turn our discussions into a metaphysical argument. I was careful not to
speak about rights, because the foundation of our democracy is one of
liberty, how that is curtailed, and how the state and the Crown
specifically ensure that we do not do things or that we might do
things. Our starting point is that we are free people and that we are
doing serious things to people’s liberty. On Tuesday, there was
a searing shaft of testimony by the doctor who knew some of the
controlees and who had a complete understanding of what terrible acts
many such people might wish to do, but the effect of being put under
permanent incarceration for reasons that they do not know is profound.
We must be terribly careful about the ease with which we talk about the
importance of national security, when it is taking away
someone’s own knowledge of their existence and why they are in
that
space.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000056">&#160;</a>

in a sense. He is making a well-argued point, which is interesting for
the Committee. Does he agree that there are several cases, even under a
normal legal system, in which the courts have made mistakes and as a
result of which people have been imprisoned inappropriately? It is hard
to imagine that none of the people under control orders has similarly
been subjected to such errors. We should also be worried about people
who do not have the chance properly to demonstrate their innocence and
who may, in fact, not be guilty of what has been
suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000060">&#160;</a>

process of the courts themselves is not perfect. After all,
“innocent until proven guilty” is the key distinction

about to strike. I would not like to start off this incredibly fruitful
and interesting discussion with the idea that there is one group of
Members in Committee who are keen on national security and the
protection of people at the Olympics and who are turning that into some
great cause célèbre, and another group of Members who are
ignorant of the considerable threats that we face. Underlying

chairmanship, Mr Scott. As hon. Members would expect, I shall oppose
the position expressed in amendment 9. Let me explain briefly why
control orders should go. Principally, it is because the balance
between security and liberty, to which the hon. Member for Bradford
South referred, was struck incorrectly. The 2005 Act was introduced in
a rush. That is not a criticism, because it was due to the
circumstances at the time, but it was one of the reasons why that
legislation was so flawed.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000063">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">On
TPIMs-plus, I welcome the fact that there will be an opportunity for
pre-legislative scrutiny. The right approach is to review legislation
at leisure, when possible, hopefully to ensure that there is a degree
of cross-party agreement and that it is fit for purpose, if it is ever
invoked. I hope that that will not be the case in this

when the last of those people absconded? Many of those people on

unfair on the Committee to keep trying to suggest that the orders are

               <p>We
can both quote as we would like from the report, but the important
thing is to ensure that whatever the Government put in place to replace
control orders is effective. I believe that that will be effective, and
that is why we should get rid of control
orders.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Control
orders contain measures that are very damaging to the families of the
controlees. Some people may have no sympathy for the controlees
themselves, although it is worth pointing out that they have not been
found guilty, but control orders can have a very heavy impact on
families, particularly due to the relocation aspect, on which I know
that the Opposition will focus, as did many of our witnesses. That is
why the coalition is right to ensure that additional resources are in
place to ensure that there is additional surveillance. Relocation
clearly has a heavy impact on
families.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Controls
around access to the internet also have an impact on families, and
particularly on children. As anyone who has children will know, they
rely very heavily on the internet to do their homework, to access
school sites and so on. It is therefore right for the coalition to
provide internet access in a way that is secure and that will be
monitored and controlled effectively. Clearly, the controlees—or
the people subject to TPIMs—will know that if they use the line
they have been granted, it will be monitored at all times. That will
provide the security that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000084">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Control
orders include lengthy curfews that preclude controlees from taking
part in a normal life. Of course, that is a double-edged sword, because
if controlees are able to take part in a normal life, that might
provide them with the opportunity to do things that one wants to stop
them from doing. However, at the same time, if there were any prospect
of some controlees being encouraged to reintegrate, preventing them
from leading a normal life would stop
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000085">&#160;</a>

have spent time with Michael Korzinski, from whom we heard evidence,

                  </strong> The hon. Lady makes a very sensible intervention.
The matter she raises is something with which the Government are
familiar, and it perhaps requires more clarity. If there is no precise
definition, it might be that “overnight” could be
challenged in the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 65<a class="bkMark" name="Column65">&#160;</a>
                  </div>courts in the future, but I would expect that most courts would not
consider a 16-hour curfew to be an overnight curfew, as I do not think
that that would be anyone’s understanding of the meaning of
“overnight”. I am sure that that matter will be resolved
in the courts at some point in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000088">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
point about control orders is that they are not effective in securing
prosecutions. I was disappointed that at least some of the witnesses
from whom we heard evidence felt that TPIMs would be no more effective
at securing prosecutions than control orders. I do not think that they
were right, but the Government could look further at enhancing the
prospect of
prosecution.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000089">&#160;</a>

               <p>He did
not mention securing prosecutions as part of the priority or objective

would receive Opposition support for this—must ensure that there
is a greater prospect of prosecution under TPIMs. We should fight hard
for anything we can do to achieve that
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000091">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This takes us to an important part of the debate.
Obviously we all want more prosecutions—we genuinely
do—but which aspects of the TPIM regime will enable the security
services, the police and the agencies to increase the number of
prosecutions? All the evidence we heard on Tuesday was that if a
suspect is alerted to the fact that they are under
surveillance—whether under a TPIM, a control order or police
bail—further evidence of sufficient robustness for a prosecution
is most unlikely to result. Which measures does the hon. Gentleman feel
will enable more prosecutions to
happen?<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000092">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Additional surveillance clearly opens an
opportunity for obtaining more information—that has to be the
case—and the reporting requirement might add to that. Perhaps we
ought to ensure, for instance, an independent analysis of whether there
is an ongoing investigation. The Government could consider an outside
reviewer looking at police activity to ensure that an ongoing and
active investigation is under way. I agree with the right hon. Lady
that, given the scale of things, the helpful measures might not be
particularly extensive, but there are some, so I hope that our debates
in Committee might identify additional ways of maximising the prospect
of securing prosecution because the Government and the Opposition are
in total agreement on that point. We want to ensure that as many people
who are subject to control orders—soon TPIMs—as possible
will be prosecuted when that is
achievable.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000093">&#160;</a>

the Labour party says that it does not want to make the change a
political football, it has done so by suggesting that it is a political
fix. It is nothing of the sort. Both coalition parties agree that
control orders should be subject to review. The Liberal Democrats voted
against control orders year after year, and the Conservative party
certainly argued against them in successive debates on their renewal.
Both coalition partners agreed that we would review control orders, and
that is exactly what we have done. Accusing us of a political fix

               <p class="tabbed">In
2005, when the Prevention of Terrorism Bill was brought in, as the
Minister responsible for counter-terrorism, I had the unenviable task
of taking it through Parliament. I remember the arguments that went on
long into the night. It was one of the few occasions in our Parliament
when we literally sat through the night debating the Bill, and that
showed how contentious and difficult it was. People had to search their
consciences and beliefs to try to frame legislation that would respond
to a court declaration that detention under the immigration powers was
no longer tenable. We were faced with the very practical problem of
having a number of people whom everyone recognised were seriously
dangerous to the future of the country and of trying to craft a
framework within which we could balance the essential liberties of
people with considerations of national security. My first point is that
while this is a balance between liberty and security, it is also a
balance that involves a consideration of things in the abstract:
principles and the rule of law—and I am a lawyer, of whatever
class. We believe very strongly in our country, and this is the way I
was brought up, that we value
freedom.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
is interesting is what happens whenever anyone sees the intelligence.
Lord Carlile has carried out 10 reviews. He has examined every control
order in detail. He has seen the intelligence and talked to the
agencies, and he has reached the view that however distasteful and
unwelcome the regime is, it is the best thing that can be done to
contain the threat. We can consider the legal cases. It is interesting
that the High Court judges who 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 67<a class="bkMark" name="Column67">&#160;</a>
                  </div>see the intelligence and the threat that the people whom we are
discussing often pose conclude—again reluctantly—that
they are willing to confirm the Secretary of State’s control
order. There have been some Appeal Court judgments in which judges have
specifically denied themselves access to the intelligence because they
want to consider the issue in principle—on the basis of legal
principles. We often find that they are then less keen to impose the
control order, so there is a big distinction
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am not saying that because people are Ministers and have access to
intelligence, they are somehow cleverer and brighter and can make the
right decisions. However, it does something to us, as human beings,
when we see the scale and nature of the problem and how dangerous these
people are. We then see how far we are prepared to move away from a
pure principle of liberty so that we do our very best to protect
normal, ordinary people in the country as they go about their everyday
lives.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000103">&#160;</a>

I trained as a scientist. While I place great faith in evidence, it is
hard always to place faith in people who tell us that they have seen
the evidence. Let me give the right hon. Lady a counter-example. Lord
Macdonald, who gave us such cogent evidence on Tuesday, saw the papers
during his review, but that clearly did not change his opinion. He was
very clearly against the control order regime. Having seen the
evidence, he does not think that it is
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000104">&#160;</a>

I have a lot of respect for the experience that she brings to this
Committee and the House. She mentioned the 2005 Act, but she also
raises the important balance between intelligence and chargeable
evidence, and the fact that, were we to see that intelligence, we would
be minded to go down a particular route. I worked briefly in military
intelligence, and that involves an opinion, an angle and a perspective
that has to be judged. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich
mentioned, we are not always privy to that intelligence and it is not
always correct. We have to work towards chargeable evidence—that
is our base, so we have to weigh it up. If we are not privy to certain
information, we have to make judgments on the chargeable evidence.
Intelligence can be very wrong indeed, such as that in the lead-up to
the Iraq
war.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000110">&#160;</a>

to get to an irreducible minimum of people for whom we would rely on
intelligence rather than evidence. We all want evidence that can be
produced in court and tested through cross-examination in an
adversarial system so that a judgment can be reached. Unfortunately,
however, that does not apply in a small minority of cases—and it
is a tiny minority. We have had only 48 control orders during the six
years in which the legislation has been in existence and we now have
12. They have been subject to the most intense legal scrutiny arising
from any piece of legislation, which is probably right, because they
represent an intrusion into people’s liberty. There is, however,
an irreducible minimum of
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have a choice. It is an honourable and principled position if one
rejects the whole regime and believes that we should never control
people unless there is evidence with which we can charge them, but the
consequence of that is that we would have to be
prepared—politically, morally and in every other way—to
take responsibility for making that decision. There is a dividing line.
If we tell people that they will come through the conventional criminal
justice system and that there will be no intrusion into their liberty,
we have to be prepared to take responsibility, because that will
involve seven or eight people who are very dangerous to this country.
It is perfectly proper to make that choice, but I wish there was some
honesty in this debate. The Bill will introduce a mirror image of the
control order regime. I will go through the five changes that the
Government could have made to the 2005 Act, but we have to be honest
and the Committee should recognise that an irreducible minimum of
people have to be controlled.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000112">&#160;</a>

focusing on those who are involved in control orders, yet we have heard
from the head of MI6 that we have concerns about at least another 1,000
individuals in the UK, if not more. Those who are under control orders
are at least known. Does the right hon. Lady agree that the thrust
should be that if the security services have concerns about
individuals, they should be allowed to pursue them, no matter who they
are, and whether they are under control orders or not, pursuant to
obtaining hard evidence that can lead to a

                  </strong> That is precisely what the agencies do. The whole
point is that there must be prioritisation. There is probably knowledge
of nearly 2,000 people in this country who are involved in various
degrees of plotting, attack planning or association with
terrorism-related activity. We heard yesterday about the resource
implications of 24/7 surveillance on perhaps 12 people—we would
be looking at between £11 million and £18 million for
each one. The country’s entire budget could be spent on
surveillance, but I do not want to live in such a state, thank you very
much. The agencies must prioritise. Let us never forget that the
intelligence is seen by not just politicians, but by High Court judges
who have a complete review regime. It is for those High Court judges,
with the panoply of their legal training and their emphasis on liberty,
to decide whether to quash or revoke a control order, or to vary its
conditions. There is a series of checks and balances within the
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000114">&#160;</a>

utterly consistent. I remember hearing her on “Any
Questions?” and “Question Time” several years ago.
She has never taken a glib line and has always been consistent in her
projection of these difficult balances. She rightly says that this is a
moderation of existing legislation, given her experience as a Minister
when the 2005 Act was drawn up, I would be interested to know the
number of people whom it was anticipated might be placed under a
control order—I recognise that this was only a few months after
the atrocities in 2005—and what proportion would be foreign
nationals. What surprises me in this debate is that we are dealing now
with 12 people, of whom perhaps three or four are foreign
nationals. I would be interested to know what the likely size of that
population was thought to be when the Bill was
conceived.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000115">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman is right, and the picture has
been moving and developing since 9/11. Before 9/11, we dealt with
Northern Ireland terrorism, but we did not have international terrorism
from al-Qaeda and home-grown terrorism. The picture has developed and
the legislation was an attempt, when possible, to keep up with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Importantly,
the 2005 Act was passed before 7/7. Some people thought that the
legislation was a knee-jerk reaction to something that had happened in
this country, but it was not. People had previously been held in
detention under the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997,
and we were trying to deal with a situation in which, following a
challenge in the courts, it was decided that that was discriminatory
because it applied to foreigners but not British citizens. The control 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 70<a class="bkMark" name="Column70">&#160;</a>
                  </div>order regime was an attempt to introduce a non-discriminatory regime
that applied to everyone, but it was passed before 7/7. That was its
genesis. It was considered quickly but, importantly, it was not an
emotional reaction to something that had happened in our
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to put on record the fact that none of us at that time introduced
the regime with relish. Some people have tried to portray us as rubbing
our hands with glee at the prospect of putting people under house
arrest, subjecting them to internal exile, and being an authoritarian
Government disposing of the rule of law. We took that path with a heavy
heart. We were confronted with an almost insoluble problem, and it was
clear, following the courts’ declaration that the previous
regime was unlawful, that we had to take action to protect the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
of those foreign nationals could not be deported at the time because of
huge concerns about whether they would be ill treated or tortured at
the hands of their own regime, so we were in a Gordian knot that was
impossible to resolve. They could not be prosecuted under the
conventional justice system because the information about them was
intelligence that could not easily, if at all, be converted to
evidence. If that information had been brought forward, the lives of
our own security services agents might have been at risk, our
techniques would certainly have been at risk, and we could not have
deported those people. In those circumstances, what does one do? It
could have been decided in principle that a control order regime was a
step too far and that people would be let out. That would have been
fine, but if people had been let out, there would have been a political
and moral responsibility to bear for that
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
welcomed Shami Chakrabarti’s comments in evidence on Tuesday.
She acknowledged that no one had entered into legislating lightly, and
that there was an incredibly difficult set of circumstances to
confront. I am not saying that that was the first time I had heard
Shami say that, but it was very refreshing that she acknowledged that
we were not a bunch of authoritarian, illiberal people and that we had
struggled with the issue in a proper
manner.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
remind the Committee—we are all very conscious of
this—that in the 10 years since 9/11, the security threat facing
this country has not receded. Many of us would have hoped—this
was why we included a sunset clause—that somehow peace would
have been restored and that because we would now be living in a country
where the threat had diminished, we would no longer need such a
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000121">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
the opposite is the case. The threat level remains severe. There are
probably 2,000 people of interest to the police and security agencies,
and there are several active plots at any time. In my view, it is only
because of the dedication, commitment and ingenuity of the police and
security services, who have been able to disrupt many of those
plots—this is where control orders are very important, because
they provide disruption rather than simply surveillance—that
there has not been further mayhem and carnage on the streets of this
country. I am convinced that their ability to deal with the threat has
protected us from
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Control
orders are intrusive and in many ways unwelcome, but they are
unfortunately necessary if we are to continue to protect the public
from those who are determined to do us harm. I therefore do not
understand 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 71<a class="bkMark" name="Column71">&#160;</a>
                  </div>why we are abolishing control orders and replacing them with TPIMs. We
shall debate the “mini control orders” later. I refer to
them as that because they are small, although they are not perfectly
formed. The Government should have brought forward an honest amendment
to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000123">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I do not want
any political footballs in this debate, but it is important that the
public know the “genesis” of the debate on this
legislation—I cite the term used by Lord Carlile in his evidence
on Tuesday. I was surprised that he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000124">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I
have a concern about the genesis of the Bill. It arose from coalition
politics—I am aware of the process that occurred—and it
is a compromise…it is the sufficient lowest common multiple, and
it will do. However, it does not provide as much public protection as
control orders, and it would be foolish to ignore that
fact.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000184">&#160;</a>

a serious mistake in committing itself to the abolition of control
orders. It made that mistake understandably, however, because it did

               </p>
               <p>That is a
powerful passage. Lord Carlile has been intimately involved in this
area for the past decade. What he said about the genesis of the Bill is
telling. This is not a party political point, but it leads me to feel
great concern. One party wanted to abolish the orders completely, and I
think it is still unhappy with a measure that is a mirror image of
control orders, albeit weakened and watered
down.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000126">&#160;</a>

Committee’s attention to a passage in the evidence of Lord
Carlile. We all agree that it is necessary to strike a balance between
safety and the need in a civilised society to protect the liberty of
the individual. We may all have different views about that, but the
previous legislation might, for example, have permitted those who are
subject to control orders simply to be locked up. It might have
derogated from the European convention of human rights. That would have
provided a greater protection for the public. I am afraid that the
right hon. Lady’s point is party political. She is saying, in
essence, that she takes a different view from the Government and that,
as a result, we are merely changing the name. In fact there are changes
of substance in the Bill, so how does she deal with that
issue?<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000127">&#160;</a>

the issue he raised.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What are the
real points of difference between the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005
and the Bill? First, there is a different name. Secondly, there is the
raising of the threshold from reasonable suspicion to reasonable
belief, and I am absolutely content with that. Indeed, Lord Carlile
said again on Tuesday that none of the control orders that have been
made would have fallen 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 72<a class="bkMark" name="Column72">&#160;</a>
                  </div>below the threshold of reasonable belief, and he indicated that the High
Court had made the threshold even higher.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The third
change is the introduction of an absolute limit—the two-year
limit on renewal without evidence of new involvement in
terrorism-related activity. That is a difference. Lord Carlile said
that he was still of the view that there could be exceptional
circumstances, without evidence of new involvement, in which people
posed such a serious threat that it would be legitimate to extend the
order beyond two years, and we will debate that later.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
some changes to the measures that can be imposed. There is no
relocation. There are the measures on mobile phones and on work and
study, so there are some changes to the measures. The legislation is
also made permanent: there is no sunset clause and no review by
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Basically,
therefore, there are five changes, and there was nothing to prevent the
Government from coming forward with five amendments to the Prevention
of Terrorism Act 2005. We could be having a much more honest debate,
which recognised the fact that there is a small number of people we
cannot prosecute or deport and for whom we must make provision. That
will involve some intrusion into their liberty, and the debate is about
where the balance lies. It is, however, dishonest to introduce a Bill,
to rename control orders TPIMs and to have absolutely the same essence
and a mirror-image regime. That is not the way we should
proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000132">&#160;</a>

doubt debate the five differences in the Bill, but, in essence, we have
a repeat of the regime. I welcome that, because it represents a
realistic acknowledgement by the Minister, who occupies the position I
held for three years, that these issues are not easy to resolve and
that we cannot simply make a manifesto promise to abolish a regime,
because, as Ministers and Members of Parliament, we are responsible for
ensuring the safety and security of the people of this

process of grappling with this difficult issue, which the Minister has
to grapple with every day, as an evolutionary process, rather than as a
matter of one side having got things wrong and the other side bringing
in a set of measures to put them right.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Yesterday, I
took part in a sitting on a private Member’s Bill. The hon.
Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) is assiduous in introducing
private Members’ Bills to further the protection of vulnerable
children. His Bill amended the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act
2004, which I took through the House of Commons, and I was there to
support him because he was doing something evolutionary. The time is
now right to make such a change, although it was not right in 2004, and
I wanted to say that to him. Where there is common ground, we should
grapple with the detail and try to reach consensus—that should
be our approach. I sense from the comments made by the hon. Gentleman
and others that there is real potential in the Committee for us to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
really two options that we ought to consider. The Minister should
either have introduced a Bill that only has clause 1 in it or he should
have introduced a Bill that amends the 2005 Act. Choosing the first
option—introducing a Bill with only clause 1 in it—is a
perfectly respectable position to take. It is not one that I agree
with, but I suspect that there are Members of this Committee who would
take that position. We have heard from people in evidence who take the
position that we should use other measures outwith the control orders
regime. So it is a perfectly honest and honourable position to take,
and it is one that I respect even if I do not agree with it.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000139">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the
Government’s own counter-terrorism review had concluded that the
risk from terrorism had reduced to such an extent that these measures
were not needed and that there was another way of imposing the kind of
restrictions that control orders imposed, or if it had concluded that
control orders were wholly disproportionate and therefore ought to be
swept away, we could have had an interesting and vigorous debate about
those choices. To reach either of those conclusions would have been an
honest position to take, but the counter-terrorism review did not reach
either of those conclusions.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My right hon.
Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles has already made that clear.
Point 9 on page 37 of the counter-terrorism review
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
review accepted that for the foreseeable future there are very likely
to be a small number of people in this country who are assessed to pose
an immediate and significant terrorist threat but who we can neither
prosecute nor
deport.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>So
the Government’s own counter-terrorism review clearly came to
the conclusion that the previous Government had come to, namely that
there is this group of people who need to be dealt with in a different
way and that doing that would pose a set of legal questions and other
questions that would need to be answered. This Government did not walk
away from that challenge and I pay credit to them for doing so. There
are some problems with 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 74<a class="bkMark" name="Column74">&#160;</a>
                  </div>some of the measures that they are seeking to introduce, and we will
debate those measures in the coming days. However, to say that that
group of people needs to be dealt with is an honest position to
take.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
counter-terrorism review also came to the conclusion that surveillance
alone could not mitigate risk to the level of a control regime. Not
only is surveillance more expensive but it is not as effective in
controlling and disrupting those who seek to attack and destroy our way
of life. That conclusion—that surveillance alone is not
enough—is another important conclusion that the Government came
to in the review.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I had an
interesting exchange with the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
earlier. I concur with him that the control order regime was not fully
effective; it was not 100% effective. I acknowledge that there were
some “abscondees” in the early days, but there have not
been any since 2007. Critically, the counter-terrorism review
recognised that the regime had been successful in mitigating risk and
detailed evidence in support of that claim was taken from the agencies
involved. The agencies that deal with this issue daily made it very
clear to the Government that the regime in operation had been effective
and the Government seem to have accepted that, at least to some
degree.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000144">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> If people abscond when they are under control
orders, they will abscond under TPIMs too. Unless we lock someone up,
they will run if they really want to, even if they have something
around their ankle. In a sense, that argument does not work either way,
because quite frankly the only way to stop someone doing a runner is to
put them in a jail, and of course we all want that. So the argument
about TPIMs or control orders, and saying that seven people did runners
a few years ago, is largely irrelevant, because some people would run
under any regime unless they were locked up. Is that not the
case?<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000145">&#160;</a>

should always be a priority. No Minister from the previous Government
and no Minister in this Government would disagree with that, but
sometimes when faced with the high-level of threat that certain
individuals pose and when it is not possible to prosecute or deport,
the Government have to do something, and 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </strong> No. The point that was made in evidence the other
day was that the TPIM regime, when in place, will not assist in
furthering prosecutions. That was made perfectly clear by Keir Starmer,
the Director of Public Prosecutions—the man in charge of the
Crown Prosecution Service. He told us that in evidence to this
Committee, and it is well worth reflecting on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000152">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
was making the point to the Minister that he might adopt the more
helpful position of deleting clause 1. We could all then disappear out
of this Committee Room and he could come back to us with a series of
amendments. We could have a lively discussion about the measures that
Opposition Members believe should be included in the Bill.
Relocation—as mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Salford and Eccles—is probably the key one, but there are others
as well, including the time limit that the Minister wants to implement.
There are things that we could debate, but we would at least see some
continuity if he tabled amendments to the 2005
Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000153">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
shall give the Minister one or two examples. Section 2(1)(a)
of the 2005 Act talks about “reasonable grounds for
suspecting”. He would no doubt want to come back with an
amendment that substituted “believing” for
“suspecting”, and I would vote for such an amendment with
no hesitation whatsoever. I also draw the Minister’s attention
to section 1(3) of that
Act:<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
obligations that may be imposed by a control order made against an
individual are any obligations that the Secretary of State or (as the
case may be) the court considers
necessary”.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>He
might want to table an amendment to that provision, in the form of
schedule 1, saying that we should list out the measures that should be
in place rather than simply leaving that decision to the discretion of
the Secretary of State and the court. Again, we would have an
interesting discussion. In that way, the Minister could provide some
continuity, and ensure that we were debating the issues in an
evolutionary way rather than in the way
proposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000155">&#160;</a>

wish to reflect on an earlier comment by the shadow Minister, my hon.
Friend the Member for Bradford South. He referred to the report
published this morning by the Joint Committee on the Draft Detention of
Terrorist Suspects (Temporary Extension) Bills, which has been
considering the Government’s proposals for draft emergency
legislation for when, in exceptional circumstances, the pre-charge
detention period might need to be extended beyond 14 days. I will be
honest with the Committee: when I was in government I supported 28
days, and 42 days, but I have had cause to reflect on that and now
accept that 14 days—<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000156">&#160;</a>

evidence in the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
important point is that when the Government in their review had to deal
with the political problem of what was in certain manifestos and how to
deal with the subject, they arrived at an outcome. However, in the
cross-party Committee, with Members of both Houses serving under the
brilliant chairmanship of Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, a more
considered approach was taken. On that Committee, we heard evidence
from a wide range of people, including some who gave evidence to us
earlier this week. My plea to the Minister is that it is best to
proceed calmly, carefully and in a considered and evolutionary way,
rather than seeking to deal with a political conundrum and not
primarily dealing with public
safety.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000161">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles was perfectly
correct in pointing out the many ways in which changes have already
occurred to the control order regime, which was an evolutionary move
forward from the detention of suspects in Belmarsh prison. I remember
visiting the prison as Prisons Minister when suspects were held there.
That was ruled unlawful, so control orders were introduced. There have
been many legal challenges to control orders that have necessitated
changes. Probably one of the most significant was the case of AF, as a
result of which any suspect now has to be told the gist of the case
against them. That was a dramatic change that has had huge implications
not only in relation to control orders but in relation to many other
circumstances. I am delighted that, in the forthcoming Green Paper, the
Government will deal with the issues of disclosure that bedevil any
regime—controls orders or TPIMs—and many other decisions.
In relation to sustaining controls and making the necessary decisions,
the rules on disclosure are
problematic.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000162">&#160;</a>

contributions made by my right hon. and hon. Friends. Given the detail
of the arguments already made, I will keep my remarks brief, but I have
two points to which I hope the Minister will respond. I shall focus on
the fact that clause 1 seeks to abolish control orders and the rest of
the Bill will essentially bring them back. I endorse the point made by
my right hon. Friends the Members for Salford and Eccles and for
Wythenshawe and Sale East that, to have an honest debate, the
Government should have tabled amendments to the 2005
Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
overnight residence measure, which we will debate at length, highlights
the fiction that the Government are getting rid of control orders and
introducing something fundamentally different because, very
conveniently, the overnight residence measure is not defined in the
Bill. Under the control order regime at the moment, a curfew can be
imposed for up to 16 hours. The hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington believes that it will be left to judges to
decide—from cases that will no doubt flow from the
measure—what the overnight residence measure really means. I am
sure that some Conservative Members will be astonished to discover that
the Government are inviting judicial activism under the Human Rights
Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights. I think that that
is the wrong way to
proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
take on board very strongly the point made by the hon. Member for
Beckenham, who said that we are making law. If the Government believe
that curfews of 16 hours are wrong and they want to do something that
is fundamentally different and much shorter in practice for the people
who are not under curfew for 16 hours, they should spell that out. They
should have the courage of their convictions and put that in the Bill.
They have left it open, because the Home Secretary, since coming to
power, has imposed and defended curfews and control orders of up to 16
hours.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000166">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
counter-terrorism review reported in January, and at that point, it was
open to the Home Secretary to say that she would not seek to impose any

counter-terrorism review. That is obviously not the

that—similar to the point I made earlier—legislation is
framed in a context? Part and parcel of the context envisaged under the
Bill is enhanced support for the security services and police. Her
comments seem to suggest that the Home Secretary should make changes
out of context. The other regime is not there, so she suggests that the
Home Secretary could effectively bring in the TPIM regime by the back

that the Government have committed themselves to a counter-terrorism
review and its findings, so they should be consistent. It was open to
the Home Secretary to say that she would not seek to impose
restrictions that fell foul of the review, but that is not the case,
because she has supported 16-hour curfews and relocation, and she has
defended them since the review was published. I want the Minister to
focus on those points when he explains to us why control orders have
been abolished and not been brought back by the TPIMs regime, because
in fact they
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11062326000169">&#160;</a>

respect, what the Minister was really saying to the hon. Lady was that
the point is a bad point. I would add that it is also a party political
point. The subject matter of the Bill is too important for her to be
