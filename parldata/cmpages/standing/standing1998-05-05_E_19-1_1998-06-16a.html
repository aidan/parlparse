<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I was explaining to the Committee the purpose of the Government's reform and putting the discussions on the clause in context. First, the Government want to encourage entrepreneurs to ensure that their business grows bigger and that there are more gains. Therefore, if they succeed in that entrepreneurial activity they can keep 90 per cent. of what their business makes, regardless of the scale of the wealth that they create. That massive motivation to encourage entrepreneurial activity is underpinned by the principle of fairness: whatever is made, everyone must pay something of the gains 
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney: Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I want to make progress. There will be many opportunities for the hon. Gentleman to contribute to the debate.
<P>
Everyone should pay something of the gain. We do not believe, and neither, I think do Opposition Members, that asking people to pay 10 per cent. is unreasonable, given the massive incentive that we are introducing.
<P>
There will be a transitional period before the new system and the reforms in CGT come into force. It is time to remind the Committee of the Government's objective. Opposition Members may wish that they had taken the opportunity to introduce these reforms and thus encourage entrepreneurial activity.
<P>
Before I respond to the arguments for the amendments, I shall respond to the reference by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) to the Inland Revenue press release dated 17 March. The right hon. Gentleman accused the Government of being misleading, and quoted the following sentence from the press release:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Retirement relief will therefore not be fully withdrawn until the tax year 2003-2004, by which time the benefits from taper relief will be substantially greater."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman well knows that the Government's argument is that taper relief will be substantially greater than in the preceding years. He implies that the matter has been misrepresented, but his reading of the press release is a little skew-whiff, and what he suggests is not what the Government intend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, I want to make progress in this important debate. It is right to put the Government's view on the record. If I have not dealt with the hon. Gentleman's point when I finish my contribution, I shall be happy to take an intervention later.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) asked a specific question to which I shall reply. He asked whether the change was tax neutral, and requested more specific figures. I refer him to Inland Revenue press release 16, published on 17 March. In paragraph 5 of that document, the Government explain that the reforms are expected to have a negligible cost in 1998-99, to cost £25 million in 1999-2000 and to yield £25 million in 2000-01. The document states that for later years the Exchequer effects will depend to a considerable extent upon movement in future asset prices, any behavourial changes by investors and other factors. That statement is wholly genuine. The hon. Gentleman sought to imply that the Government were concealing something from the Committee and that the measure was somehow tax raising. This is not the case. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to that paragraph, which sets out the Government's exact position in revealing the Parliament the changes' likely impact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): The Financial Secretary has said something very important. I hope that she will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that she is confirming that for the years after 2000 and 2001, the Government do not intend the measure to be a revenue-raising change. Am I right in understanding that it should remain neutral for the term after 2000-01?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman seeks to draw me along a route that he knows it is not possible to take. He understands that the press release makes clear that any effects will depend to a considerable extent on movements in future asset prices and on other points to which he referred. I assure him and Opposition Members that I am not attempting to mislead the Committee. A new set of reforms is being put in place, with specific objectives, to encourage entreprenuerial activity. Without a crystal ball, the Government are not[Dawn Primarolo]
able to specifically go beyond the statements in the Inland Revenue press release. I could ask Opposition Members to take my word for it, but I do not think that they would want to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I shall take your word for it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman may take my word on most things, but not on tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary for yet again giving way. I do not wish to make a great meal of this, but of course she cannot look with a crystal ball into the year beginning 2001 and onwards. I was asking her about the Government's aim. Do they intend the measure to remain broadly neutral, or is it their aim for it to tend towards raising revenue? That is the direct question to which I seek an answer.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he was prepared to take my word on the issue. The Government intend the changes to be broadly revenue neutral. However, I cannot with absolute certainty tell him what will happen in subsequent years, beyond those identified. His is right the aim is for the changes to be broadly revenue neutral. We are seeking to encourage entrepreneurial activity and growth in the businesses concerned. I hope that that answer deals specifically with the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
Opposition Members repeatedly made the general comment that the reforms will hit small businesses harder than larger businesses. Under the new system, all gains will be subject to the same percentage reduction, whatever their size. The period for which the asset has been held determines the amount of tax that has to be paid, not the size of the gain. Small businesses and large businesses will be treated equally. The measure does not discriminate against any business it is intended to encourage all businesses to grow and to encourage entrepreneurial activity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not taken part in the debate so far. I am sure that he will be able to engage in the debate later in the proceedings, but I should like to deal with the amendments first.
<P>
Amendment No. 110 would retain the current retirement reliefs until 5 April 2003, instead of gradually reducing those limits over the period from 6 April 1999. Amendments Nos. 212 and 213 would extend the phasing-out period for retirement relief by a further five years, or possibly four years. It is not clear from the amendment which of these periods it is.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 212 and 213 contradict each other. Amendment No. 212 would retain the relief for the year 2007-08, while amenement No. 213 states that it would cease in an earlier year. That brings me back to the point that I made earlier. The taper relief, which is central to the reform, will provide a real incentive for investment in the longer term. The generous business taper will encourage all businesses, from the smallest upwards, to reinvest in growth. We want to ensure that entrepreneurs themselves are in control of their companies and that they benefit from the wealth that is created in their companies when they wish, rather than allowing that benefit to be triggered by ill health or by reaching the age of 50.
 <P>
Fairness is another important aspect of the reform. Abolition of the retirement relief, together with the other changes that we are making, will make capital gains tax a fairer tax. We do not believe that it is right that those with gains, which can be substantial, should pay no tax at all on those gains. That is unfair to the vast majority of taxpayers who do not have capital gains and have to pay tax on their income. The measure reflects the principle of fairness to which I referred earlier.
<P>
The importance of the taper is that it reduces the amount of the gain the longer the asset has been held, and by doing so it specifically encourages long-term investment. Conservative Members are blocking out any recognition of the motivation that we are placing in the tax system to encourage people to ensure that their businesses grow.
<P>
We have to move to the new system in as reasonable a period of time as we can to ensure that we get the maximum benefit from it. In doing that, it would have been harsher to have taken away retirement relief for people who are very close to retirement and had planned on the basis that most, if not all, of their gains would be tax-free. We have decided to withdraw it gradually by reducing the exemption and half-exemption limit in equal annual stages until the relief ceases entirely in 2003. We are trying to behave as fairly and reasonably as we possibly can in respect of the transition period from one system to the next: we are giving people time to plan. Beyond the phasing out period, we acknowledge that the rates will rise a little in 2003-04, before steadily coming down in later years as the taper builds up. The effective rate on the gains of people over 50 who sell their businesses in 2003-04 who would have paid no tax at all on their gains had they sold this year cannot exceed 22 per cent.
<P>
I shall return shortly to the effective rates of taxation that will operate in the phasing-out period, to which several hon. Members referred. It is not easy to move from one system to another, but we believe that our proposal is the fairest solution. It must now be clear that the amendments are unacceptable to the Government because they would delay the real benefits of the reform. Continuing retirement relief in full for five years or phasing it out over 10 years would negate the incentive for long-term investment that the taper provides and perpetuate the unfairness of the present system. Both proposals would have adverse behavioural consequences and delay the simplification resulting from the taper.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 110 would create a nasty cliff edge on 6 April 2003. Under the amendment, if you, Mrs. Dunwoody, were to sell before that date, you would get full retirement relief with today's generous limits. If you sold after it, you would get no relief. We recognise that phasing out the relief may encourage some people to retire earlier than they might otherwise have done. The only way in which we could have eliminated that effect entirely would have been to close off the relief without warning and with immediate effect. That would have been and been seen to be very unfair. If we accepted the amendment, the problem would be worse. The cliff edge in April 2003 would create a considerable incentive for anyone over 50 to sell up before that date. The distortive effect of such a cut-off in the relief does not make economic sense.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 212 and 213, which would extend the phasing-out period from five to 10 years, would retain all the complexities and paraphernalia of retirement relief in the system for a further, damaging period. Retirement relief already creates significant compliance costs for small businesses and the conditions for relief are complex and difficult for people to understand. As Opposition Members know, the system generated much litigation and led to some people missing out on the relief in its entirety. The Government think as should Conservative Members that that is highly unsatisfactory. We do not want to prolong the situation any longer. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
I want to respond to the argument that was used by all the Conservative Members who spoke that the Government are imposing a heavy tax burden on those who made their retirement plans on the basis that they would pay no tax. I shall focus on the effective rates so there is no misunderstanding about the tax that people will be asked to pay.
<P>
Let us take someone in business on Budget day who has £250,000 the largest gain that is exempt under the current rules. Let us not forget that to achieve a gain of that order, with indexation relief up to April this year, we are looking at gross proceeds from the sale of a business possibly approaching £500,000. If that person sold the business in the year 1999-2000, he would pay an effective tax rate of under 3 per cent. If he sold in 2000-2001, the effective rate would be under 6 per cent. In 2001-2002 it would be under 8 per cent., and in 2002-2003 it would be under 12 per cent. Those are the maximum rates in the phasing-out period. After that, in 2003-04, the effective rate rises, as hon. Gentlemen have made clear, to a maximum of 22 per cent. before dropping progressively over the years. Those rates cannot be said to be unreasonable given the size of the gains involved.
<P>
For the reasons that I have set out, the objectives of CGT reform and the placing of retirement relief within it are a fair package, which will ensure that people have the benefit of the gains that they have made and make their contribution in the tax system at a reasonable level.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): The Financial Secretary opened her response by telling us that retirement relief was available only to retired people. We knew that already, although it was useful to have it confirmed.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): It is a fallacy. One does not have to retire to get retirement relief that is a fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</b> So the Financial Secretary's opening remark was not quite right either. However, it was the nearest she got to an assertion that bore some resemblance to the points that we had made to her; thereafter, her speech trailed off.<P>
<P>
The Financial Secretary referred to the Government's leading press release on Budget day. It is quite clear and states that the benefits from tapering will be "substantially greater" than "retirement relief" the only other noun in the sentence. If the Financial Secretary wants to put some ungrammatical construction on those weasel words, she had better try again. Clearly, the only grammatical interpretation of that sentence is that tapering relief will more than compensate for retirement relief. However, everything that has been said by Opposition Members in Committee and by outside bodies that have written to the Financial Secretary and to other Ministers shows that that is not the case. For thousands of smaller business men, the tapering proposals, when they come fully into effect, will not compensate for the phasing-out of retirement relief over five years.
<P>
The Financial Secretary made matters worse by saying that the changes would not hit small businesses harder. That is flatly untrue that is the only way that I can describe it. The points have been made at some length, but at the risk of wearying the Committee, I will quote the Chartered Institute of Taxation again. It quotes the Treasury's statement that the measures are designed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`to encourage long-term investment and promote entrepreneurial activity'".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The phasing out of retirement relief over five years together with the introduction of a ten year taper gives rise to results which are a direct contradiction of the stated objective noted in paragraph 1 above."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the case. The measures will, in some cases, have a devastating effect on smaller business people whose business constitutes their retirement plan. They have built up businesses in good faith, reinvested the profits and planned sensibly for their longer-term retirement. Then, along come the Government and cut them off at the knees. It is arithmetically factual that replacing a 100 per cent. exemption from capital gains tax for smaller businesses with, at the maximum, a 10 per cent. relief over 10 years will make people less well off. I challenge the Financial Secretary to have another word with her experts, who will confirm that that is the case; no other construction can be put on her clause.
<P>
Hundreds of people have written to the Treasury and to members of the Committee making those points. However, Government Members have been silent during the debate, which is somewhat shameful. We know that some Government Members are worried because 13 of them signed an early-day motion dealing with the matter. All 13 have been excluded from the Committee.
<P>
We do not ask Government Members to jeopardise their careers by doing something nasty such as asking the Minister to reconsider the details of the clause. That would obviously be too much, but we might have expected them at the very least to wonder in a questioning way whether the Government intended given that the proposal is supposed to be revenue neutral to damage smaller businesses and pass the benefits to rich people with large disposable assets.
[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
<P>
As it stands, the clause is clearly regressive. It hits the very people whom we all represent in our constituencies. Although the Financial Secretary tried to say that the entire package was revenue neutral, my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks has shown how that is not so. This is a revenue-raising measure, certainly in the longer term.
<P>
We have demonstrated how the measure will take benefits away from smaller businesses and give them to the well-off, so it must be the case that the measure is regressive. Therefore, we intend to press amendment No. 212 to a Division at the appropriate time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 240, in page 131, line 29, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7) In respect of any relevant disposal after April 1999, and overriding for this purpose only all the previous clauses of this paragraph, taxpayers can elect to claim either 
<P>
(a) retirement relief in accordance with the provisions set out in paragraph 2 above; or
<P>
(b) taper relief as set out in clause 119 of this Finance Bill.
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the previous debate, when I tried to intervene on the Financial Secretary, she mentioned that I had not taken part in the previous debate. I was in the Committee throughout that debate, listening intently to all the contributions of right hon. and hon. Members, and in particular to the response of the Financial Secretary, because I wanted to find out whether it would be worth pressing our amendment. Having listened to the hon. Lady's response, I believe that it certainly is worth having another debate because our amendment would give the Government a way out of the mess that they seem to have got themselves into by giving them the option to introduce a system whereby a business person could elect retirement relief or the Government's proposals. That would not drive a coach and horses through the taper relief proposals, but would protect small business people who will be severely hit by the measure.
<P>
The Financial Secretary's answer that the legislation does not discriminate against small businesses belies the facts. Small businesses will be severely hit by the measure. I hope that the Government will realise that. The Financial Secretary's statement that a relief that relates only to retirement is somehow ungenerous, and that the Government's proposals are more generous to business shows that the Government fail to understand how the small business sector works. Small business people spend their lives building up their businesses as part of their pension and long-term savings. Retirement relief was well suited to that type of entrepreneurial activity. The Government fail to understand that, and that is why their measures are so wrong. Amendment No. 240 offers the Government a way out.
<P>
This debate is important for another reason. Although some excellent speeches were made in the previous debate, they understated the unfairness of the measures, which are an attack on small business indeed, on some of the poorest small businesses. The Federation of Small Businesses quotes figures from the European Commission, which show that 63 per cent. of Britain's self-employed people have an income below £12,000. Those are the people who will be hit hardest by the measure. It is an attack on the hard work of ordinary people. That is why the measure should be rejected and why Labour Members should be angry on behalf of their constituents. We are discussing a long-term tax increase for small businesses which, taken with the transitional arrangements, amounts to a huge tax hike. I am astonished that Labour Members have not felt able to contribute.
<P>
We heard this morning about some of the huge tax increases involved. As some Labour Members were not present, I have a chance to repeat some of the figures and give other pertinent examples. I hope that they will listen to the size of the increase proposed by their Government. Under the previous scheme, with retirement relief, a small business person with assets worth £250,000 would have paid no tax. Under the new scheme, even in the most favourable circumstances, the same small business person will pay £25,000.
<P>
Labour Members may think that a person who has business assets of £250,000 is wealthy, but if a large income has not been taken from the profits accrued throughout a business's life because they have been reinvested in the business, most of that person's savings and wealth will have come from capital growth. That is how the small business sector works. Penalising that method of running small businesses is the wrong thing to do if the Government want to promote small businesses in the entrepreneurial sector. We have heard that small businesses are the engine of the British economy and of employment growth. The Government are hitting the job-creating sector of the economy hard. It is astonishing that they want to do that.
<P>
The small businesses that will be hit by the scheme include the corner shop, the ordinary restaurant that is on all our high streets and small decorating companies. The Government are, however, going to allow the people who have large sums invested in their businesses to have a huge tax cut. Under the old scheme, someone with business assets worth £1 million would have paid capital gains tax of £150,000. Under the proposals, that tax bill will fall by £50,000 to £100,000. As hon. Members said, this is a regressive set of measures.
<P>
The Financial Secretary told the Committee that during the transition, tax increases on small businesses will be even more severe. If a business that is worth £250,000 is sold in 2003-04, the tax liability will increase by more than £52,000. She said that that was not unreasonable. For a small business to have a tax increase from nought tax liability to £52,280 is unworthy of the word "unreasonable"; it is outrageous. The Government should be ashamed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is outrageous that the Financial Secretary admitted that the measure is not intended to be revenue raising after three years but revenue neutral to encourage entrepreneurial activity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is outrageous. I hope that the Government, even at this late hour, will back our amendment. It would enable them to keep their taper relief proposals but protect the businesses that will suffer. In the previous debate, hon. Members told us about businesses in their constituencies that will suffer. I visited a number of small businesses in my constituency last week. One carpet shop owner based on Victoria road, Surbition told me that he was worried about the proposals. Another gentleman, who lives on the Upper Brighton road in Surbiton and has run an equipment rental and repair business for the past 30 years, was hoping to retire but has been forced to consult his tax advisers on the best date for retirement. He has had to completely change his business decisions.
<P>
That is one of the problems related to these proposals: small business people might decide to retire early when they would otherwise have continued running their businesses and creating wealth and jobs, while those with medium-sized businesses might decide to retire later. Decisions about retirement must now be altered completely. It is wrong for the Government to interfere in the long-held retirement plans of many small businesses.
<P>
I also spoke to an Asian business man at the weekend. He was appalled to hear about the proposals and felt that many of his colleagues running corner shops and small restaurants would be directly hit.
<P>
When the Financial Secretary replies, will she tell us whether she has received representations on this matter from the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry? Having piloted through the House constructive legislation on automatic interest payments on overdue debt which has received great support from the small business sector I cannot believe that she will be pleased that she must try to defend these damaging Treasury proposals. The small business people to whom I have spoken find it galling to see very wealthy people benefiting through the same package. The Paymaster General, as we have heard, will benefit significantly whether through the sale of his shares in TransTec or his second, third and fourth homes from the measure. People working in the city perhaps the partners at Goldman Sachs stand to benefit by hundreds of thousands if not millions of pounds as a result of this initiative. It seems that the world has suddenly turned upside down. Rather than governing for the many not the few, the Government seem to want to govern for the few not the many.
<P>
The proposal is not old Labour as it is so regressive and not new Labour as it is so anti-business. The Government make much of working in partnership with business, of the number of business people who are members of their task forces and review panels and of consulting with business every step of the way. But this measure makes it clear that they do not properly understand the small business sector. They do not understand how enterprise works or what long-termism means in the private sector.
<P>
Amendment No. 240 provides the Government with a chance to put matters right. I am sure that the Financial Secretary will argue that it would add a furter level of complexity to an already over-complex system, but such an additional level of complexity would be welcomed outside this House. The level of complexity that she and her colleagues have introduced has been severely criticised. According to Accountancy Age, Maurice Fitzpatrick, head of economics at the accountancy firm Chantrey Vellacott,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"agreed the proposals would double the complexty of CGT, but argued the increased complexity would be good for business."[Mr. Davey]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He meant his business the business of accountants. Mr. Fitzpatrick said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Accountants should welcome the increased complexity; anything that makes tax more complicated will generate more work for them."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[Interruption.] As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) says from a sedentary position, the proposal is a charter for accountants.
<P>
Although the amendment would introduce a little more complexity, such complexity would help the ordinary small business man. That is why the Committee should support the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I rise to support the amendment, which is in my name and those of my colleagues, and I appeal to Labour Members' best instincts for fairness and fair play.
<P>
Several of the Bill's proposals are inequitable. I alluded to that litany of examples this morning, which includes the inability of non-taxpayers especially the elderly and the most poor to recover tax credits. The Paymaster General [Interruption.] I will be very quick.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, not even very, very quick. The hon. Gentleman is speaking to amendment No. 240 not to a previous amendment, not to a previous point that he might want to raise, and not even to amendment No. 110, which we have just discussed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. The Paymaster General had the confidence and the nous to say that he would reconsider that matter, and I hope that the Committee will approach this amendment in a similar vein. When the Financial Secretary responds to the debate on the amendment, I hope that she and her Labour colleagues will have the confidence to think again. The abolition or should I say phasing out of retirement relief will lead to the unfairness about which many Committee members have spoken. Small business men have been prejudiced and huge benefits have been given to the wealthiest. No one advocates taxation for taxation's sake.
<P>
I have a question for Labour Members. Why discriminate against small and medium-sized business men and women, who invariably use the proceeds of the sale of their business to provide for their retirement? Labour Members can do something about the problem they can vote for fairness and equity.
<P>
I referred earlier to the stark contrast in figures. A business man who made a chargeable gain of £350,000 had to pay no tax under the old rules, but he will have to pay £5,000 in tax under the new rules. A person who made a gain of £10 million had to pay £3.75 million in tax under the old rules but he will have to pay £1 million under the new rules. The proposal is a bonanza a lottery win for the wealthy, but it will penalise small business men and women.
<P>
Another aspect of the change in retirement relief has not been highlighted sufficiently. It relates to cases involving small working farmers who have to retire early on grounds of ill health or injury. They are physically and emotionally incapable of continuing to run their business, and existing legislation contains a provision allowing them to retire early. Under the Government's proposals they will still be able to retire early for the next five years but that, surely, is unfair. Should not the Government match the phasing out of retirement relief with the phasing in of the taper over a 10-year period? After five years, that relief will be denied to those people who seek to retire on grounds of ill health.
<P>
The examples are stark and unfair. The new rules could be introduced under the amendment, but their phasing in would be matched with the phasing out of the old rules. We want to allow existing retirement relief and I ask the Government seriously to consider that on the grounds of fairness and equity. Introduce the new relief and match the phasing in over 10 years wth the phasing out over 10 years, but allow existing retirement relief and allow our amendment.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I listened carefully to both hon. Gentlemen, many of whose points were raised during an earlier debate. I shall not try your patience, Mrs. Dunwoody, by repeating what I said on previous amendments. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) tabled amendment No. 240, which would give the taxpayer a choice between retirement relief in full or the taper relief; both systems would run in parallel. If hon. Gentlemen were listening to the previous debate, they will not be surprised to hear me say that that is contrary to the purpose of the reforms in the Bill and is totally unacceptable. It would work against the incentive for long-term investment and tapers, perpetuate the unfairness of the present system, allow substantial gains to go untaxed, retain what is widely regarded as a complex and unsatisfactory relief and add considerable complexity. The Liberal Democrats seem to have that problem constantly. They want simplification, but try to amend legislation by introducing horrendously complicated requirements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If I may explain to the hon. Gentleman why his amendment would not work, he may understand what I am saying. If he intervenes before my explanation, he will not know, unless he is a mind reader.
<P>
Under the amendment, taxpayers over 50 would have to calculate whether they would be better off opting for retirement relief in full with no taper, or taper relief in full with no retirement relief. If the hon. Gentleman believes that that would not add complexity and make matters more difficult for taxpayers, he is still on the late train from Exeter, in mind if not in body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I do not know whether the Financial Secetary took all lunchtime to think of that joke, but it was quite a good one.
<P>
The calculation would probably take around a quarter of an hour. For a gain of £250,000, £25,000 would be saved under our amendment. That is not bad value for money, is it?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, I wish the hon. Gentleman would be consistent in his argument. I suggest that he reconsiders his recent comments on how long it would take to work out the complexities of the system that he wants to develop in his amendment. That is not the only calculation, so the hon. Gentleman may want to change his sum when I tell him about the next problem that the taxpayer would face. If we are right about the amendment's effect, there would be a third calculation for many people making disposals in the years 1999-2000 and 2002-03 to establish whether they would benefit from reduced retirement relief plus taper relief on the excess gain.
<P>
I implore the hon. Members for Torridge and West Devon) (Mr. Burnett) and for Kingston and Surbiton to reassess the amendment. There would be substantial costs in retaining indefinitely the exemption for business gains alongside the taper relief for over-50s. There would be substantial compliance costs and difficulties for business men and women the very people whom the hon. Gentleman says that he is trying to defend. The amendment would cost across what the Government want to achieve; it is therefore unacceptable and I urge the Committee to oppose the amendment if the Opposition press it to a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Financial Secretary failed to respond to the key points made by the Opposition, just as she did in the previous debate.
<P>
The Government's proposals are wholly unfair to small businesses. The hon. Lady may say that she responded to that argument in her previous remarks, but she did not. She misunderstands the effect of the measure on the small business sector. When the small business people in my constituency realise the enormity of the Government's proposals, they will be extremely angry. Already, people are waking up to what the Government have done and in the days, weeks and months to come there will be an increasing volume of opposition to the Government's proposals.
<P>
The Minister spoke about the complexity of the amendments, which I admitted in my opening remarks. Ours is a second-best solution; in previous debates we made it clear that we are fundamentally opposed to the Government's taper relief proposals. The amendment would not prevent the Government from going ahead with that overall change; we have already had that debate and we are not trying to break the system. But we want to ensure than the small business person is protected. The idea that the additional complexity of the amendment is as great as the measures that the Government are loading on to the tax system does not bear analysis.
<P>
We have already heard how manufacturers of software for tax calculations are having problems working out how their systems will cope with the Government's complex proposals. As my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon said, the amendment would require only minimal additional calculations and the Minister's argument against it is weak. We shall press the amendment to a Division.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We come now to the taxation of temporary non-residents. Let me tell the Financial Secretary straight away that this is a probing amendment. The changes proposed in the clause for those who have been resident in the UK for as few as four out of seven years before becoming non-resident are unnecessarily tough. The way in which the clause is drafted could easily catch foreign individuals who are posted to the UK for a comparatively short period before being posted elsewhere. If they are then posted back to the UK, they could easily be caught by the clause.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary explain the rationale behind the four out of seven years? In the amendment, we suggest that seven out of 20 years might be better, but we could easily have suggested seven out of 10 years. The amendment could have suggested 17 out of 20, which is the deemed domicile period for inheritance tax. Our drafting is a little more relaxed than that of the Government. I should be extremely interested to hear the Financial Secretary's justification for choosing four out of seven.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The clause introduces a new section 10A into the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Four conditions have to met before the new anti-avoidance measures apply. First, the person must be resident in the UK in the year in which the return has been made. Secondly, the person must have been a non-UK resident for one or more years prior to the current year. Thirdly, the person must have departed from the UK at least five years ago, and must not have been absent for five years or more during that period. The fourth condition, to which the amendment applies, is that in the seven years prior to leaving the UK and becoming a non-UK resident, the person in question must have been resident in the UK for at least four years.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks said, the amendment seeks to change those periods from four to seven years and from seven to 20 years. Expatriates coming from overseas to work in the UK could easily have worked here for four years within the seven years prior to leaving. A United States citizen working for a multinational based in the UK may well have worked here for four years in the seven-year period. It is quite common for secondments to last for two, three and four years. The clause is therefore likely to catch individuals to whom the anti-avoidance provision is not intended to apply.
<P>
Amendment No. 88 is a technical amendment, not a probing amendment such as amendment No. 23. Some commercial transactions involve the creation of what is technically a settlement. For example, if one sold 10 years' worth of ICI dividends but retained the ownership of the underlying capital, a settlement would be created by implications.
<P>
In conclusion, the Government should consider this technical amendment, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will tell the Committee that they will accept it to avoid a serious future complication.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall deal with amendments Nos. 23 and 88 together. The clause's purpose is to ensure that gains made by people who have spent significant time in this country in recent years and who became temporarily resident abroad do not escape a capital gains charge. We adopted a test period of prior residence in the UK to determine whether the charge should apply. That will ensure that a person who has been resident in the UK for only a short period prior to departure will not be subject to the charge on gains realised in the years afterwards. A test period that goes back only to the date of departure is appropriate for that purpose, as far as it is necessary to provide a reasonable and fair test of whether the person is a temporary resident in the UK.
<P>
A seven-year period is a very reasonable test in that respect. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks gave an example that involved someone here for a short period of time. The Government believe that such cases are adequately covered by the test.
<P>
I realise that the hon. Gentleman said that his amendment seeks to probe. Its effect, however, could be to tax the very short-term UK resident after he or she leaves. The point that the hon. Gentleman was trying to avoid concerns a person who normally resides overseas but who may have been educated here, up to 20 years ago. If that person, returns to the UK for only six months and becomes resident here, a seven-out-of-20-year rule may well catch that person on gains made subsequent to that six-month stay.
<P>
We do not want that result, and the comments of the hon. Member for Sevenoaks suggest that neither does he. On the other hand, a seven-out-if-20-year rule could exempt a person who has been resident in the UK for the past six years and who has accumulated substantial gains here in that time. We do not want that result either. We think that such a person should pay tax on gains largely accumulated during a recent and substantial period of residence in the country. That is why the proposal of four out of seven years achieves the right balance. As I explained, the effects of the amendment could be exactly what the hon. Gentleman wants to avoid.
<P>
As for amendment No. 88, the clause exempts gains realised on assets acquired and sold by the taxpayer during a period of temporary residence abroad. However, there is no case for extending that exemption to an interest in a trust acquired after the taxpayer leaves the UK. That may simply provide a means to avoid tax, especially in the context of clause 126, which we have yet to debate. That clause is designed to ensure that offshore trust gains do not escape a charge through the sale of an interest in a trust after it has moved to the UK. We need to ensure that arrangements cannot be made by the temporary non-resident to escape a charge on offshore trust gains through an exemption for interests in trusts in this clause.
<P>
To be honest with the hon. Member for Sevenoaks, it is difficult to see why a let-out should be provided for a person who acquires an interest in a trust after leaving the UK for a period of temporary residence abroad and sells that interest before returning to the UK. The capital gains rules do not distinguish between trusts made for value and other trusts. There seems no reason to do so in this measure.
<P>
A trust created for valuable consideration could be used as much for tax avoidance as any other trust. In any event, there might be difficulties in defining such a trust for tax purposes. That is why the Government settled on the period that would be altered by amendment No. 23, which we would resist if the hon. Member for Sevenoaks chose to press it to a vote. It is also why I ask the Committee to reject amendment No. 88.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Financial Secretary's reply to amendment No. 88 will be studied later by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). As for amendment No. 23, I did not catch any real rationale behind the period proposed in the Bill. The test still seems somewhat subjective. Indeed, a better test was suggested in the phrase that the Financial Secretary used when she said that there was a need to catch "recent and substantial gains". It might have been better to put something like that in the Bill.
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary understands that the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Bill does not inadvertently catch people who subsequently return to the United Kingdom. If that is common ground between us, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 89, with which it may be convenient to consider amendment No. 96.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> What?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have reached amendment No. 89, and the selection also includes amendment No. 96, which is in clause 128, and may be debated at the same time.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Amendment No. 96 is not printed on my selection list.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If the hon. Lady moves forward to page 394 of the amendment paper, she will find it there.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Perhaps I can assist the Committee, Mrs. Dunwoody. The amendment is of course on the amendment paper, but it has not been included on the selection list, perhaps inadvertently. Amendment No. 96 has not been included under clause 125, nor indeed under clause 128. It seems to have disappeared. That is why there is some puzzlement in Committee. I am sure that no extraneous forces are at work here.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As we have discovered, various fairies are in the woodwork. Apparently, the error is a typographical one amendment No. 96 should have been printed on the selection list with amendment No. 89. If that causes unnecessary difficulty to the Committee, we can return to amendment No. 96 at a later point. However, the intention was to discuss the amendments together because they deal with the same subject matter. I am sorry that that was not made clear at the beginning.
<P>
Given that we have a gremlin in the works, perhaps I should also make clear to Members before we proceed to clause 126 that amendment No. 214 is in the wrong place. It should be listed after Government amendment No. 245 and before amendment No. 263.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 119, line 3, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(11) Without prejudice of the provisions of subsection (10) hereof, relief shall be given by way of credit for all taxation payable outside the United Kingdom which can be attributed to the disposals attributed to the taxpayer hereunder.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 96, in clause 128, page 122, line 7, after "section", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and there shall be offset against any capital gains tax payable by the recipient an amount equal to any tax on the underlying gains paid by the trustees in the jurisdiction in which they are taxable.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Both amendments deal with the same point.
<P>
Subsection (10) of new section 10A of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, which clause 125 will insert, states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This section is without prejudice to any right to claim relief in accordance with any double taxation relief arrangements."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, if there is tax payable in a foreign jurisdiction as a result of the provision, that tax can be offset against the UK tax, provided that a double taxation agreement is in place.
<P>
The amendments would introduce unilateral relief, so that relief would still be given on overseas tax paid where no double taxation agreement existed. It is a sensible amendment, and I hope that the Government will take it on board.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, I have caught up with you now.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am very happy that the Minister has caught up with me. I do rather enjoy that.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, I know that you are even-handed with all Committee members.
<P>
Amendment No. 89 is unnecessary and a little misguided. I tried to find a nicer word than "misguided", which would nevertheless adequately deal with the hon. Gentleman's point about double taxation relief.
<P>
The amendment suggests that credit against UK tax should be given for overseas tax even where the UK clearly has a prior taxing right over gains. That would not be right. Where the UK does not have the primary taxing right, we will give credit under our normal double taxation relief rules. Under the terms of double taxation treaties and in accordance with standard international practice, the UK has a prior right to tax gains from land and buildings situated in the UK. It would be wrong to expect the UK to give credit for overseas tax on gains from property situated in the UK[Dawn Primarolo]
when, in the reverse situation, we would be expected to give relief for the other country's tax where the gains arise to a UK taxpayer from property situated in that country. Indeed, were we to do so, double relief would be available to the taxpayer because both countries would then be obliged to give the relief.
<P>
We have agreed provisions in a number of tax treaties that will enable the country in which the individual was a former resident to tax gains arising within a period of a taxpayer's departure. Such a provisions gives the UK a prior taxing right over gains made by its former residents. Again, it would be wrong to give relief for overseas tax when we would be expected to give relief for gains made by a former resident of another country in the reverse circumstances.
<P>
Where we have no treaty with a country in which a taxpayer is temporarily resident, the normal rules for the relief of double taxation will apply. This means that we will give credit unilaterally we mentioned this when we discussed an earlier clause for tax paid in the country in which the gain arises. Where it arises in the UK under normal international practice, the country in which the individual is resident at the time that the asset is disposed of would give the relief. Gains taxable under the provisions of the clause should be treated no differently from any other gains on which foreign tax may be paid. A special provision for the relief of double taxation is not required. I hope that that explanation allows the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to withdraw his amendment. His point was, I think, about how the measure interacts with double taxation reliefs.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 96, it is right that beneficiaries with a close and continuing connection with the UK those who are not only resident but also domiciled here should be charged to UK tax in respect of payments that they receive from an offshore trust. The amendment would allow the beneficiaries to set against their UK tax liability any foreign taxes paid by the trustees on the gains that they have made.
<P>
The amendment is defective because it does not attempt to define the gains realised by the trustees, still less to provide the rules for identifying them, but the essential point is that the relief is already available for foreign tax paid by trustees. It is deducted from the amount of gains realised by the trustees. Beneficiaries who receive capital payments from the trust may be subject to a charge.
<P>
I recognise that that does not go as far as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton may wish, but I am not persuaded to go any further. The present rules go back to 1981 and I assume that the Opposition, when they were in power, thought that they had provided sufficient relief. Moreover, in many cases the trustees will not pay any tax on gains that they realise.
<P>
A further consideration is that any legislation to extend the relief for foreign-paid tax by trustees beyond what is currently available would be extremely complex. Given what I have said about double taxation relief being covered and in anticipation of the careful monitoring of the situation by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for her full and detailed explanation, especially about amendment No. 89. In view of her comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Disposal of interests in a settlement</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 245, in page 119, line 34, leave out "and".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: Government amendments Nos. 246, and 247, amendment No. 264, in page 119, line 42, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"unless the disposal of an interest in settled property is one treated under subsection (2) below as one made in consideration of the settled property.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and Government amendment No. 248.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Government amendments Nos. 245 to 248 will ensure that when a disposal of an interest in a settlement is occasioned by a beneficiary becoming absolutely entitled to trust property, the clause will not remove the beneficiary's exemption from CGT on the disposal of that interest.
<P>
The clause is the first element of our package of proposals that deals with offshore trusts. Briefly, it will remove an exemption from CGT for the disposal of an interest in a trust when the interest is in or originates from a trust that has at some time been offshore. That will prevent avoidance of CGT by beneficiaries offshore.
<P>
We received several representations stating that the clause was too wide, in that in certain circumstances it could result in a double charge to tax. That matter is also dealt with in amendment No. 264, which is an Opposition amendment. That could happen when a beneficiary becomes absolutely entitled to trust property for example, on reaching the age of 25. In that case, the charge to tax arises on the trustee on the open market value of the property and the beneficiary is charged to tax on gains that are realised while the trust is offshore. When such charges apply under existing provisions, we fully accept that there should be no additional charge on the beneficiary by virtue of the clause.
<P>
The Government amendments will ensure that the clause will not impose a further charge on a beneficiary of the trust, when the beneficiary becomes absolutely entitled to property in the trust under an interest that was created for him or her. They provide a fairer basis for the charge, they will continue to ensure that the clause will protect the Exchequer, and I commend them to the Committee. I also hope that the Opposition accept that the purpose of their amendment has been dealt with in the Government amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> As the Financial Secretary said, the group of amendments includes an Opposition amendment but, before I discuss it, it may be useful if I make one or two general remarks about the anti-avoidance provisions, which relate to this group of amendments and to our amendments on subsequent clauses. Those amendments should be placed in a more general context.
<P>
All of the Finance Bills that were introduced during the previous Parliament contained anti-avoidance measures. We accept and understand the need to take action against certain avoidance schemes. It is silly to conduct a general witch hunt against all tax avoidance because savings products are designed to avoid tax. Every time someone invests in a pension, a personal equity plan or an individual savings account, it is done in order to avoid tax, and it is done with the active encouragement of the Government.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
So it is fruitless to wage a campaign against tax avoidance. We agree that anti-avoidance measures should be taken when the intentions of Parliament are being circumvented, particularly by artificial or contrived schemes and, secondly, where the loss of revenue to the Exchequer is significant. The action taken must be proportionate to the mischief perceived. Moreover, we have several tests by which to judge the clauses under discussion, which tackle the issue of overseas trusts and the extent to which they have been, and can be used, for tax avoidance.
<P>
One test is that the measures taken by the Government should neutralise the tax advantage, not penalise those who set up a trust or benefit from it. There is no point in persecuting such people. I am afraid that when we debated the clause relating to personal portfolio bonds last week, it was apparent to us that the Government and the Inland Revenue this has happened for several years, including under the previous Government, but noticeably under this Government were going beyond neutralising the tax advantage and were engaged in a systematic persecution of Professor Willoughby and several other entirely innocent taxpayers. I shall not repeat that debate, but the test stands, and the aim of tax avoidance measures should be to take away an illegitimate tax advantage.
<P>
Allied to that, it is evident that the measures taken must not be unworkably complex. If they are, they tend to be self-defeating because they are impenetrable to taxpayers and, in some cases, even to the Revenue, and invite countermeasures from armies of well-paid tax advisers trying to get around the original clauses.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, I hope that this is relevant 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I, too, hope that it is relevant, but I must point out that if there is too much general debate, it will rebound on the later discussion on clauses. I understand that the hon. Gentleman needs to put the amendments in context, but a full debate on the clause will extend the debate without fulfilling the main purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> You will see in a minute, Mrs. Dunwoody, that it is my wish to deal with the substance of the amendments quickly, if the Financial Secretary can give certain explanatory assurances. That will genuinely prevent me from having to comment in unnecessary complexity on every group of amendments. So this is a time-saving measure. I thought it fair to make these comments at the outset because they apply to several amendments.
<P>
I wish to make two other points about the clauses. It would be foolish for the Government to try to deter the repatriation of foreign capital, or indeed, in some cases, the payment of trust money to UK citizens from foreign trusts. That would be to the detriment of the country as a whole. I hope that the Government will use that test when they assess their tax-avoidance measures.
<P>
Lastly, we deprecate the use of retrospective legislation and I am sure that the whole Committee agrees with me on that. I shall therefore apply those tests in turn.
<P>
I am happy to say that the Financial Secretary has already responded by tabling a number of Government amendments that substantially do the job that my amendment No. 264 would have done. I shall not press amemdment No. 264 to a vote, and I shall not on this occasion seek any further assurances from the Financial Secretary.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It will be interesting to see how the right hon. Gentleman develops his points in the course of this debate. Our proposals seek to target people who have a close and continuing connection with this country and who set up or can benefit from an offshore trust. It is right that such people should be subjected to a UK tax charge in the circumstances set out by our proposals. We will review the application of these provisions and will consider carefully, in the light of what happens in practice, whether any problems arise. The hon. Gentleman has put on record his agreement with the Government amendments so there is nothing further to add.
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 214, in page 119, line 44, after "time", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"immediately preceding 6 March 1998 or at any time thereafter.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although the amendments that have been passed tackle some of the objections raised, the clause is still rather wide. It seeks to impose tax on the disposal of a trust that has at any point had non-resident trustees. I understand the thinking behind that provision, but trusts may have had trustees who temporarily and almost accidentally became non-resident many years ago and well before the present beneficiaries had any interest in the trust. It seems unnecessary and onerous that such trusts should be subject to that provision.
<P>
Amendment No. 214 therefore removes the provison unless the trust has had UK resident trustees[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
immediately preceding 6 March 1998 or afterwards. That does not weaken the clause, but removes from its ambit trusts that have trustees who temporarily moved offshore with no tax avoidance motives many years ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want briefly to raise a related point. The notes on clauses make it clear perhaps before speaking to this amendment I should declare that neither I nor my immediate family have any interest in the amendment, but it is possible that some more remote members of the family do.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Luckily, hon. Members do not have to declare things that they do not have an interest in.
<P>
We must be a little careful about constantly quoting from the notes on clauses. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that we are discussing the Bill and amendments to it. The Notes on clauses are for information and they should not be quoted as though they were part of the record of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Thank you. Mrs. Dunwoody. Both your strictures are helpful.
<P>
Subsection (2) applies to any trust that has ever been an offshore trust. Will the Financial Secretary elucidate further on the provision because it is very widely drawn? A trust that has been resident in this country for a number of years could be caught although it may have traded legitimately, with no wish to avoid tax, and been taxed according to UK trust law. A trust that has been resident here for 10 years could be caught and perhaps the Financial Secretary will explain the possible discrimination that could be occasioned by the clause.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> In setting out his four tests, the right hon. Member for Wells referred to what was necessary to neutralise tax advantage but not to penalise or persecute. The clause provides that balance. The purpose of the amemdment is to exclude from the application of the clause those offshore trusts which were brought into the UK some time before 6 March 1998, which is the date on which the provision has effect.
<P>
The clause is the first element of a package covering offshore trusts. It removes an exemption from capital gains for the disposal of an interest in a trust in which the interest is or originates from a trust which has been offshore for some time. The purpose of the amendment is to limit the application of the provision so that only trusts that were brought back to the United Kingdom shortly before or at any time after 6 March 1998 will fall within its scope. Under the amendment, any trust that was brought back to the UK before 6 March 1998 in anticipation of a beneficiary selling an interest in the trust would escape a charge and allow the beneficiary to enjoy the fruits of his avoidance.
<P>
Given the four points made by the right hon. Gentleman, I am sure that he would not seek to do that. His amendment would introduce a loophole through which the well advised could escape. The Government believe that it is wrong to allow the well advised who put devices in train in advance of 6 March, but have not yet carried them through, to escape the charge. I cannot accept the amendment because it would widen the opportunities for avoidance of a very narrow requirement on offshore trusts to tax the gains in those trusts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As the Financial Secretary has failed completely to answer my question, I should be grateful if she would do so now.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Is it the wish to the Committee that the amendment be withdrawn?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I put a genuine point to the Financial Secretary and I failed to get any answer whatever. Surely that is regrettable. If we cannot get any answers out of the Minister, how are we supposed to know how to vote on the clause?
<P>

<P>
then section 260 shall apply as if the disposal of the interest in settled property was one which fell within subsection (2) of that section.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The aim of the clause is to get at the disposal of an interest in a trust for gain to a third party. The amendment would relieve from that the disposal of an interest by way of a gift, by making available holdover relief to such a beneficiary.
<P>
The amendment uses section 260 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, specifically because it can operate only where the transferor and the transferee are both UK residents. Thus there is no opportunity to use a non-resident to avoid tax. The amendment would therefore block up an avoidance opportunity while taking away from the application the beneficiaries who are simply disposing of an interest by way of a gift. I think that that is in line with the Government's thinking behind the clause. It is a probing amendment, but I should be interested in the Government's response.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Generally, gifts are treated as normal disposals on which a capital gains tax charge will arise for the person making the gift. That has been the case since the introduction of capital gains tax in 1965; to do otherwise would introduce significant holes in the system. There was a general holdover relief for gifts in the 1980s but it was substantially curtailed by the previous Governmnt in 1989, after it became apparent that the provision was being exploited for avoidance purposes. That was their justification at the time.
<P>
At present, gifts holdover relief applies only to transfers that are chargeable for inheritance tax purposes and gifts of business assets. It is possible that the gifts on which we are currently focusing may fall within the scope of the present reliefs. However, in cases in which they do not, I see no reason to extend the scope of the present reliefs to cover these types of assets. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am a little disappointed by that. The clause comes near to conflicting with one of the general principles that I set out at the start of our proceedings that is, that it should not deter the repatriation of capital to this country. As the clause stands it will do that, because it does not bite on those trusts that remain entirely offshore. If the Government intend to encourage those trusts to come back to the United Kingdom it would have been useful to disapply the provisions whereby, when they come back, the disposal by the beneficiary is by way of gift rather than remuneration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman considering overseas trustees who retire having, prior to retirement, appointed UK trustees and then appointed assets to UK beneficiaries?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, that is precisely the point. The clause is a disincentive to offshore trustees who may be considering retiring in favour of UK trustees. The Government have indicated that they wish to see such trusts coming back, and the capital being remitted to the UK. My amendment would have provided an incentive for that to occur.
<P>
The clause will be a little perverse in its effects, as I have outlined. However, the hon. Lady has given the Committee some further elaboration on the matter, and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I shall try once more, if I may, to make a short and simple point. Subsection (2) is widely drawn to include all those trusts that have ever been offshore. In some cases, trusts will have operated in the United Kingdom for many years. The trustees will have paid capital gains tax, and would also be liable to tax on the occasion of any person becoming absolutely entitled to any part of the trust fund. That will result in the clearest possible case of double taxation.
<P>
Furthermore, the clause discriminates against trusts that have always been resident in the United Kingdom. The two trusts would have had exactly the same tax regime, but the one has to pay tax when the beneficiary becomes entitled whereas the other does not. That appears to me to be an unfair discrimination. Will the Financial Secretary consider some form of limitation as to the length of time for which a trust has been offshore 10 years, for example?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am not convinced that the case that the hon. Gentleman has described will occur often, if at all, in reality. If a beneficiary disposes of his interest in a trust on or after 6 March 1998, they will do so in full knowledge of the tax consequences. However, I note the point that the hon. Gentleman has raised, and assure him that we will keep the provisions closely under review to assess how they work in practice.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 126, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 127</center></H4>
<H4><center>Attribution of gains to settlor in section 10A cases 1992. c. 12</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 120, line 8, leave out "This section" and insert "Subsection (2) below".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 250 to 256.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amendments correct a defect in the clause so that it achieves its purpose of preventing double taxation of gains arising to an offshore trust in circumstances in which they are charged on the settlor on his or her return to the United Kingdom from a period of temporary residence abroad.
<P>
To explain the amendment, I need to say a few words on the general purpose of the clause. It is intended to[Dawn Primarolo]
prevent a double charge to capital gains tax on gains realised within an offshore trust on both the beneficiary and the settlor as a result of clause 125. The circumstances in which a double charge could arise are complex. Under existing legislation, the person who sets up a trust, the settlor, may be charged on a gain made by the trustees when the settlor, or his or her immediate family, can benefit from the trust.
<P>
For the charge to apply, the settlor must be resident in the United Kingdom in the year in which the gain is made by the trustees. When there is no charge on the settlor, the United Kingdom beneficiaries of the trust are charged on such gains to the extent that they receive capital payment from the trust. If the settlor leaves the United Kingdom for a period of temporary residence abroad and payments of capital are made to the United Kingdom resident beneficiary from the gains realised during the period while the settlor is abroad, the settlor could be charged on his or her return under the terms of clause 125 on gains which have effectively already been charged on the beneficiaries. That would not be right, so clause 127 reduces the amount charged on the settlor on his return by the amount of the gains realised by the trustees during his absence, which have already been charged on the beneficiaries.
<P>
The clause also provides a mechanism to ensure that any gains arising during the settlor's period of absence which are charged on the settlor on his return cannot also be taken into account when beneficiaries of the trust subsequently receive capital payments from it. We have received representations which claim that the clause does not prevent double taxation in all circumstances. It does not do so when the trustee may not pay to beneficiaries the whole of the gains during the period of the settlor's temporary non-residence. We agree that that was not our intention. It is not our intention that there should be a double charge; the amendment rectifies that situation and prevents the possibility of a double tax charge, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 252 is straightforward and self-explanatory: it corrects a printing error in the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 253 to 256 would have the same effect as Opposition amendments Nos. 265 to 268. Our amendments to clause 130 would bring offshore trusts set up for 19 March 1991 within the scope of the capital gains tax charge on the settlor where he, his immediate family or the companies he controls can benefit from the trust. That charge generally applies to disposals on or after 6 April 1999, but schedule 23 contains rules to charge gains realised in the transaction period from 17 March 1998 to 5 April 1999 on the settlor at the end of the period in certain circumstances.
<P>
The schedule also contains rules to prevent a double tax charge on the settlor and on the beneficiaries who receive payments from the trust in respect of gains realised during the transitional period. The amendments will ensure that the rules to prevent double charge apply even where the payments to the beneficiaries during the transitional period do not exceed the pool of trust gains as at 17 March 1998. I ask the Committee to support those corrections to the Bill, which I am sure it will.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Government are, rather belatedly, correcting and adding to their anti-avoidance clauses. That is evidence of the fact that they are in some confusion about the scope of those clauses and about whether they will end the mischief that they are intended to get at. It is a bad sign when Government amendments are tabled to an anti-avoidance clause so late in the day. That is not a satisfactory way to proceed. It is, however, better that we put on the statute book a measure with which the Government are reasonably content rather than one that they know to be deficient. Conservative Members will not, therefore, hold up the amendments. I am grateful for the Financial Secretary's clarification of them; in some ways, they meet several objections that I would have raised.
<P>
I want further clarification on one point, however. The Financial Secretary explained that other provisions seek to impose a charge on a temporary non-resident settlor when he returns to the United Kingdom within five years. She has also explained that the clause is designed to prevent a double charge on the settlor and on the beneficiaries. So far, so good. She perhaps omitted to explain, however, that that would only be in the case of United Kingdom beneficiaries. What about a situation in which gains are realised and distributed to non-resident beneficiaries? As the clause stands, they will continue to suffer double taxation as a result of a tax on that distribution and a tax on the settlor. As that goes against the purpose of the clause as outlined by the Financial Secretary, she will be sympathetic to our amendment, which would correct the problem by ensuring that all distributions avoid double taxation, whether or not the beneficiaries are UK-resident.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The rules exist to prevent a double tax charge on the settlor and the beneficiary of the trust. There is no charge to tax on a beneficiary who is not resident in this country. There is no need to take payments to such a beneficiary into account for that purpose. There will be no double charge on the settlor and the beneficiary. That covers the right hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I apologise if my words were not sufficiently clear, but the hon. Lady's do not cover the point. We are discussing whether a settlor should be fairly taxed. We have established that it would not be right to tax a returning settlor where a UK beneficiary has already been taxed. I am aware that non-UK resident beneficiaries do not suffer the tax, but we are considering whether the settlor should be taxed when the beneficiaries are non-UK residents. As the clause stands, the returning settlor will still be unfairly taxed, even though the Government have succeeded in tackling circumstances in which the beneficiaries are UK residents.
<P>
The circumstances that I have described may be rare, but they certainly exist. The clause will mean that the settlor will be taxed in a way that the Government consider not to be right.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not believe that to be the case, and I think that I have answered the point about double taxation. However, the right hon. Member for Wells conceded that these are complex matters, and I undertake to examine the point that he has made when the Hansard record is available. If for some reason I have not covered the point that he made, I shall write to him and to the rest of the Committee, but for now I repeat that I do not believe that the circumstances that he has described would arise.

<P>
This clause applies very widely and we are worried that the measures taken might become unworkable in practice. They are certainly in danger of being disproportionate to the problem identified. The clause brings gains made by an offshore trust set up by a non-resident within a charge on UK beneficiaries. The tax will apply to gains made after Budget day, even though they could have accrued over many years beforehand.
<P>
Does the Financial Secretary believe that in practice it is realistic to expect all such trusts to have kept all the necessary records for the capital gains tax computations to be made? It appears that every non-UK trust could be caught if any of its beneficiaries one day became UK resident. One can imagine that an American trust might have a number of beneficiaries and might have existed for, say, 100 years. If one its beneficiaries married an Englishman and settled in the United Kingdom, she would therefore become UK resident.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary confirm that gains made in that trust could become liable to UK tax? That would be an extraordinary imposition to make on a trust such as I have described. Is it realistic to expect the UK beneficiary to have access, through the trustees of the large American trust, to all records needed to calculate the necessary tax? The provision could be unworkable and very wide in its application. It will also provide another penalty on money flowing to UK citizens. In my example, there would be every incentive on the American Trust not to have a UK beneficiary and not to pay that beneficiary any revenue or capital that is financed by American gains.
<P>
The legislation would work against our own interests. I should be interested to hear how much revenue gain the Financial Secretary believes that the clause will generate. If it is comparatively trivial, or if the provision has a deterrent effect that reduces the revenue, is it seriously worth the effort and expense of trying to enforce the clause? The amendment would maintain the exemption when the trusts concerned were not created for tax avoidance purposes. I gave the example of a longstanding American trust that was clearly not established for tax-avoidance purposes. It seems entirely reasonable that this very complex clause should not be applied to such a trust.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The purpose of the amendment is to introduce a motive test so that the provisions will apply only when the trust was set up with the intention of avoiding UK tax. The Government believe that it is right that beneficiaries with a close and continuing connection with this country and who are not only residents but are also domiciled, should be charged UK tax in respect of payments that they receive from an offshore trust. We can see no justification for not taxing such people on payments that they receive, regardless of underlying motives in setting up the trust. We do not believe that a motive test is appropriate. The right hon. Gentleman did not specifically mention the motive test, and I assume that he would not accept it as a reasonable way forward. When the previous Government introduced the existing charge on beneficiaries of offshore trusts in 1981, they did not see the need for a motive test in the original provisions that the clause extends.
<P>
Of course, section 741 of the Taxes Act 1988 contains a motive test that applies to beneficiaries who receive payments from income from offshore trusts. However, that test applies only when the payment is made out of income accumulated within the trust. In other cases, the charge arises regardless of underlying reasons for setting up the trust. No general motive test applies to payments of income from offshore trusts. As I said, I see no reason for introducing such a test of capital from offshore trusts. The clause focuses on beneficiaries with a close and continuing connection with the UK, to whom large payments from offshore trusts can be made. The underlying motives for setting up the trust are not clearly relevant, and there is no clear case for them being tested. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman went on to say that it is impossible in some or all cases to obtain the information necessary to calculate tax liability. Trustees will need to keep records of their transactions to show that they have properly discharged their duties. Their duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the trust will include providing UK beneficiaries with sufficient information to enable them to calculate their tax liability. Offshore trustees have had to provide that information to beneficiaries for a number of years. I understand that it has not given rise to any problems and there is no reason to believe that that may happen in future.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's final point was about the yield. The figure is £5 million, but that is, as I am sure[Dawn Primarolo]
the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate, a broad estimate.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not think that the Financial Secretary has taken my point on board. It is no good saying that the trustees will have to keep records. We are talking about a historical situation. Records may not have been kept for the good reason that the trustees never dreamt that they would have any connection with the United Kingdom or the United Kingdom tax authorities.
<P>
I gave the case of a long-standing trust in a foreign country that suddenly had a beneficiary in this country, which could be largely accidental, after having had no connection at all with the UK. To assess the tax on that person, information would have to come from the trustees in, for example, the United States about historic costs and gains that may have been made in the early part of the century. Unrealised gains could have funded the distribution to the United Kingdom beneficiary. It is not realistic to expect trustees to provide the necessary details to satisfy the UK tax authorities about how much the gain has made over what may have been a considerable amount of time.
<P>
We all understand that from now on trustees should realise that the information may be requested, but is it realistic to expect that on an historic basis? Nothing that the Financial Secretary has said suggests that she has thought about it or met the objection. However, as I shall return to the matter later, I beg to ask leave to withdrawn the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Having mortally offended the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham by confusing him with the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmonds (Mr. Ruffley), I almost feel that I should call Mr. Loughton. However, I shall call Mr. Ruffley.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I beg to move amendment No. 274, in page 121, line 49, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4)In section 87(1) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 there shall be added after the words `applies to a settlement' the words `other than a relevant qualifying settlement'.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 280, in clause 130, page 124, line 7, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7) After sub-paragraph (11) of paragraph 9 of Schedule 5 to the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 there shall be inserted the following sub-paragraph 
`Meaning of Relevant Qualifying Settlement
<P>
(12) A settlement which would, but for the following provisions of this subsection, be a qualifying settlement by virtue only of the provisions of sub-paragraph 1(A) or sub-paragraph 1(B) above shall be a relevant qualifying settlement if the trustees of such settlement were resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for the whole or any part of 1999-2000 year of assessment'.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> These are probing amendments because the related amendments to which the term "relevant qualifying settlement" refers have not been selected.
<P>
It might be helpful to remind the Committee of legislation introduced by the Conservative Administration in 1991 to distinguish between pre and post-1991 offshore trusts. The legislation brought into effect a regime in which the gains of offshore trusts in relation to settlors and beneficiaries to the extent that capital payments were received from offshore trusts were to be charged to capital gains tax. Pre-1991 trusts were not subject to the same regime.
<P>
The distinction between the two trusts was based on technical matters. The pre-1991 trusts were viewed as offshore trusts that had been created to assist the venture capital industry. A distinction was drawn between those offshore trusts and their advantages and those trusts that were set up post-1991. A loophole was not being exploited Ministers were made aware of that because the relief was legitimate.
<P>
Sections 86 and 87 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 respectively allow charges to settlors and to beneficiaries in respect of gains arising from those offshore trusts. The clause will amend section 87 of the 1992 Act for post-1991 trusts. The position was that if a beneficiary received a capital payment there would be a charge to tax in respect of capital payments from an offshore trust to a UK beneficiary only if the settlor was resident or domiciled in the United Kingdom. If he was not, the beneficiary would not, under current provisions, be liable to CGT.
<P>
I am afraid, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I shall have to refer to clause 130. Amendment No. 280 relates to that clause, which deals with the relevant qualifying settlement 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For clarity, I am happy for the hon. Gentleman to refer to the clause briefly, but we must not have a long debate on a clause that we have not yet reached.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I have no intention of getting to the meat of clause 130. That clause is discreet from the narrow point about beneficiaries, which is the subject of clause 128 and to which my amendment refers. In clause 130, the Government seek to realise the gains that are made by pre-1991 offshore trusts. The burden of our argument about that clause is that that proposal is unfair and retrospective.
<P>
The amendment suggests that relevant qualifying settlements can take advantage of the transitional provisions in clause 130, which will involve transitional provisions for the benefit of pre-1991 trusts. We want to encourage the offshore trusts that will be hit by the relevant clauses, especially by clause 130, to rebase any capital gains as they stand on Budget day there will be a deemed disposal and acquisition at the market value of the assets on Budget day. Amendment No. 250, which was tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, deals with that matter, and we shall reach it shortly.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That amendment has not been called.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I beg your pardon, Mrs. Dunwoody. I meant amendment No. 258, which will be called.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The point is that that amendment has not been called at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The thrust of that amendment, Mrs. Dunwoody, will be brilliantly discussed in a matter of minutes, when you call it. The thrust of that amendment is that there should be 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have obviously not made myself clear. We are discussing amendment No. 274, which is grouped with amendment No. 280. We are not discussing clause 130 or the next group of amendments. I want the hon. Gentleman to restrict himself to what is on the selection list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am endeavouring to and will abide by your strictures, Mrs. Dunwoody, but as I am sure the Clerk will understand and will explain to you 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman criticising the Chair? I can assure him that, unfortunately for him, I am in charge. I repeat that we are debating the amendments that have been called, and not the amendments that have not been called.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I would not dare to criticise you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was merely reminding the Committee, as well as your good self, that amendment No. 280 was an amendment to clause 130. It is difficult to discuss this definition without some brief advertence to clause 130, but the brief advertence has already been made, and I shall not return to the matter that attracted your strictures a few seconds ago. [Interruption.] If Labour Members were able to follow any of these difficult matters, they would not be so free with their sedentary interventions. We would prefer them to make proper interventions.
<P>
The rebasing provisions are an integral part of the argument for a relevant qualifying settlement. Such a settlement, referred to in amendment No. 280, is a settlement created before March 1991, which was not, before the provisions of the Finance Bill, within section 86, as it relates to the settlors; and, most importantly, the trustees of the settlement must have become resident in the United Kingdom on or before the onset of the transitional period. That definition will positively encourage offshore trusts to move on shore something the Government should welcome with commensurate benefits in the future for the Treasury in terms of the increased revenue that will accrue.
<P>
As a result of the non-selection of various other amendments relating to relevant qualifying settlements, I shall end my remarks there. However, it should be stated that the transitional period will give rise to a section 87 charge on a beneficiary, to which the clause refers. If, during the transitional period, a section 87 charge to a beneficiary will be made, amendment No. 274 would take that beneficiary out of tax during that period. That is of a piece with the thrust of our proposals for giving relief for relevant qualifying settlements.
<P>
For all those reasons, I should be grateful if the hon. Lady would accept the principle of giving relief, during the transitional period, to beneficiaries who might otherwise be hit by the operation of the clause.
