<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000518"></a>The
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. Michael
Wills):</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cook. I
am sure that we will benefit from your guidance as we make further
progress on this important
Bill.</div><a name="0811121000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was responding to the hon. Member for Cambridge, who had referred to
the briefing note put out by the Electoral Commission on the relaxation
of the political restrictions on commissioners. He was asking, in the
spirit of inquiry more than anything else, why we had not followed the
commission&#146;s
advice.</div><a name="0811121000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are aware of what the commission feels about the matter, but
I am afraid that our view is different. We take the view of the
Committee on Standards in Public Life that continuing with the current
10-year rule for staff is not proportionate or necessary to ensure the
impartiality and independence of staff employed by the commission or,
more broadly, the commission itself. Obviously, there must be some
restrictions. We think that 10 years is too long but five years is
about right. It is a matter judgment, and that is our
judgment.</div><a name="0811121000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811121000519"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Eleanor Laing</b> (Epping Forest) (Con): I do not wish to take
up much of the Committee&#146;s time on this matter, as we dealt with
most of the principles of political involvement of commissioners when
we considered amendments to the preceding clauses this morning. I
simply want to put on the record that I agree with what the Minister
just said. It is right that there should be restrictions, and we must
make a distinction between those on the commission who are
representatives of the political world and those who are not. I think
that that distinction is clearly made in the clause, which we
support.</div><a name="0811121000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811121000520"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie</b> (Chichester) (Con): I have had a chance to
remind myself of the content of clause 7&#151;I did not get enough
time to do that during the four minutes of debate on it before
lunch&#151;and I have realised that there is some substance to the
clause that needs an airing and deserves attention before we move on to
further clauses. I am grateful to the hon. Member
for Cambridge for flagging this up rather than taking the clause on the
nod.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div><a name="0811121000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
important because it creates two classes of commissioner for the first
time, and we need to pause a moment to ensure that we have them right.
We need to bear it in mind that the purpose of the clause is to bring
some political experience into the commission, which many have argued
has not shown enough political experience of the system that it is
trying to regulate. This is why, after much careful thought, the
Committee on Standards in Public Life decided to argue in favour of a
relaxation of the 10-year bar on political involvement. Its
recommendation is set out in paragraph 3.29 on page 59 of its report.
My question is whether what is in clause 7 is consonant with what is in
that
recommendation.</div><a name="0811121000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am a little concerned that we may find that nearly one half of the
appointed commissioners have recent political experience, as set out in
the clause; and that under this clause the other group&#151;in the
past, it would have had no ties with a political party for 10
years&#151;might also have been MPs only five years ago, hammering
things out in a Committee such as this, for example, or across the
Floor of the House. In other words, we may find ourselves with a group
of commissioners all of whom have a good deal of very recent political
experience.</div>
<a name="0811121000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
entirely sure that I am happy with that, so I am not entirely sure that
I am happy with the move from 10 to five years for the remaining
class&#151;that is, the original class&#151;of commissioners. I
would like the Minister to give an explanation for that reduction from
10 to five years. I have a couple more points that I would like to make
while he is thinking about that one, unless he wants to intervene on me
now; if not, we can wait until I have dealt with the other
points.</div><a name="0811121000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point concerns the staff, whom we have not mentioned at all. Clause
7(2) proposes that the 10-year bar that applies at present be reduced
to five years for the chief executive and to one year for all other
staff. That is also a substantial change when taken together with the
change for commissioners. I wonder whether we ought to
consider&#151;I throw this thought to the Minister&#151;extending
the five-year minimum to several other important jobs, rather than just
limiting it to the chief executive of the Electoral
Commission.</div>
<a name="0811121000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been a
participant in the informal group whose job it was to try to fill the
gap that the Electoral Commission realised existed when it wanted more
political experience to be made available to it. That group has been
functioning for many years. As a member of it, I was initially
sceptical about the need for this clause at all, and wondered whether
the issue could be better addressed, for example, by putting that group
on a formal basis, with the authority to publish views of dissent if it
disagreed with actions of the Electoral Commission, which itself would
be a constraint. If a group of politicians, all from different parties,
said all at once that they disagreed with something and that the
commission was going down the wrong route, that might act as a
restraint on the commission.</div>
<a name="0811121000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">This issue was
the subject of the Hayden Phillips process. I participated in that
process, as the Minister knows, and I participated in all the talks
about this issue. It was largely decided in the margins of the Hayden
Phillips discussion to go down this route as it was probably the least
bad option, recognising that there are pros and cons for whichever
route one takes. I am now a convert to the idea of
a reduction, and I will not divide the Committee on this point.
However, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s response to a number of
concerns. First, when we consider the changes that we are making to
staff as well as to the commissioners themselves, we are making a
substantial change all in one go. Secondly, is the reduction from 10
years to five for commissioners necessarily right for the reduction for
the non-political group? Thirdly, is the reduction from five years to
one for all staff except for the chief executive the best way
forward?</div>
<a name="0811121000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000521"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> As always, the hon. Gentleman makes some
valuable points and broadly speaking, they reflect the views of the
Electoral Commission. Of course we are aware of those views and we have
taken them into account. The hon. Gentleman said, using carefully
chosen words, that he was not altogether sure that this way was the
right way. Let me try to give him greater certainty, so that he can go
forward into the afternoon in comfort and relaxation.</div>
<a name="0811121000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
difference in principle between us on the fact that there needs to be
some form of sanitising period; I think that that is consensual. That
is why we have maintained the existence of that sanitising period. The
only question is how long that period should be. We have taken the view
that to maintain the current restrictions is disproportionate and
restrictive on individuals&#146; right to participate and perhaps to
bring their interests to bear in this form of public life. There needs
to be a sanitising period. Some of the recommendations have come from
the Committee on Standards in Public Life. The hon. Gentleman is right
to say that the decision to reduce the restrictions on other
commissioners from 10 years to five was taken by the Ministry
of Justice. Therefore, by and large, we have imported the view of the
Committee on Standards in Public Life, except in that one
respect.</div>
<a name="0811121000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
offer to the hon. Gentleman an anecdotal reassurance and then a
reassurance in principle about the approach that we have taken. The
anecdotal experience is that, by and large, being politically active is
an addiction and an obsession. We all know how all-consuming political
activity can be. By and large, when people decide, for whatever reason,
to detoxify and leave the pursuit of politics, they tend to stay clean.
After a break of five years or one, they do not tend to decide to seek
election and parliamentary office. They have either had their fill of
it and they move on, or they have never had their fill of it and never
move on. Therefore, if people take a break, they move on from that
partisan participation. That is the anecdotal reassurance.</div>
<a name="0811121000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much more
importantly, we must not lose sight of the fact&#151;we come back to
this point over and over again&#151;that everyone we are talking
about will be selected on merit. Those selecting them, whoever they may
be, will clearly be conscious of the need to avoid any perceived or
actual conflicts of interest. That is fundamental. All the concerns
that the hon. Gentleman expressed are fundamentally important, but all
the commissioners will be selected on grounds of merit, and with that
will come the fundamental objective of avoiding any conflicts of
interest, real or perceived. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman
some reassurance about the approach that we have taken. It is a matter
of judgment. This is the judgment that we have made and we think it
adequate.</div><a name="0811121000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): I beg to move
amendment No. 79, in
clause 1, page 1, line 7, after
&#145;the&#146;, insert
&#145;sole&#146;.</div><a name="0811121000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000523"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment</div>
<a name="0811121000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 38, in

Act section 13 (which makes provision about the promotion of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000524"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move to clause 1, which deals with the
functions of the Electoral Commission. In fact, we are moving back to
clause 1. There is always something about moving backwards in Bills. I
should like to put it on record that we have found it difficult to
prepare comprehensively for these clauses. They are the most technical
clauses in the Bill, and it would have been helpful to have had more
time. As a result, amendments have been rushed with little or no time
for consultation. That includes the Government amendments that we
received on Friday. Although it is good to have seen the
amendments&#151;and I thank the Minister for having put some of them
through&#151;we have not been able to consult on them for obvious
reasons. Frankly, that is not the best way to make law. I hope that
lessons will be learned from the experience that we have had in this
Committee, although that is unlikely to be the
case.</div><a name="0811121000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000525"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am particularly perturbed that we have not had
time to prepare for this Bill. The language has always been consensual.
We will do this by working together. I cannot understand the mad rush.
We are talking about not just legislation, but constitutional
legislation at that. I wonder whether my hon. Friend wants to comment
on
that.</div><a name="0811121000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000526"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Given that, one way or another, whether here or
in the other place, the Bill is invariably going to stretch into the
next Session, I agree with my hon. Friend about the rush. However, that
is the situation that we
face.</div><a name="0811121000482"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="0811121000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me move on to amendments Nos. 79 and 38. We generally support the aim
of clause 1 and believe that it should be a tool for change. There is a
need to refocus the commission on its core duties as a regulator. That
is generally recognised by pretty much everyone, not least by the
commission itself. The question is, how are we going to do that? Given
the known weakness of the commission in its various functions, does the
Bill go far enough in redefining those functions? The Bill gives the
commission lots of new investigatory powers, for instance, but will it
actually use them in the exercise of its functions, given the limited
redefinition in the Bill? Do the functions need further focus than has
been provided?</div>
<a name="0811121000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us examine
the redefinition. Clause 1 will delete the original wording of section
145(1) of PPERA, which
states:</div><a name="0811121000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commission shall have the general function of monitoring
compliance&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div><a name="0811121000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">and replace it with the
slightly more proactive
wording:</div><a name="0811121000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall
have the function of monitoring, and taking such steps as they consider
appropriate with a view to securing,
compliance&#148;.</div><a name="0811121000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
emphasis on the proactive role of the commission is to be encouraged,
as the bulk of the reports to date have recommended a need for it to
act more courageously and to shrug off what some have seen as a passive
attitude. In essence, clause 1 provides that in addition to its
existing function of monitoring compliance with the various
requirements, the commission shall also have the function of taking
such steps as it considers appropriate to secure compliance with those
requirements.</div>
<a name="0811121000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of
amendment No. 79 is to tighten the wording of the clause, to insert the
word &#147;sole&#148; before describing the function of the
Electoral Commission. The aim is that first, we will not be back here
again in six years, with all the associated costs, to review the scope
of the commission&#146;s duties because it has been able to take the
path of least difficulty and resume a passive role and, secondly, to
aid the commission and give it a clearer indication of what Parliament
thinks its role should be. It may take time for the commission to
readjust to its new role, so I propose a clear statutory signposting so
that it can have the courage of its convictions to fulfil its mentoring
and enforcement role, without the need to consider the wider issues for
the electoral system. I hope that the commission and the Government see
this is an enabling remit for the commission, rather than a restricting
one.</div>
<a name="0811121000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
38 seeks to clarify the position. Given that the Bill seeks to refocus
the commission&#146;s core duties on to its role as a regulatory
body, we need to do away with a particular section in PPERA as it will,
in effect, become all but redundant. To leave it on the statute books
will serve no function other than to confuse the commission and those
studying the
legislation.</div><a name="0811121000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
13 of PPERA places a duty on the commission to promote awareness of the
electoral and democratic systems. As my hon. Friend for Chichester so
rightly pointed out in his submission to the Committee on Standards in
Public Life review, this is not a matter for the commission; rather it
is a matter for political parties. The amendment is designed to tie up
the loose ends so that there is no room for future confusion.</div>
<a name="0811121000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last night the
Electoral Commission commented on this issue, and it is worth putting
its position on the record. It
said:</div><a name="0811121000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commission does not support amendment 38 which would remove our duty to
promote public awareness of electoral systems and related matters.
There is a strong case for ensuring that people get clear and reliable
information about how to register to vote, and how to take part in
elections, and for this information to be provided by the independent
Electoral
Commission.</div><a name="0811121000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">Although
the Committee on Standards in Public Life (CSPL), in its eleventh
report, recommended that the Commission should no longer retain a wider
statutory duty to encourage participation in the democratic process, it
also recommended that the Commission should &#145;retain a clearly
defined statutory duty for the provision of public information on the
mechanics of the electoral process including electoral registration
procedures, how to vote and explaining any changes to the electoral
system.&#146;</div><a name="0811121000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
Commission no longer encourages participation in the broader sense
discussed by the CSPL. We agree with the Government&#146;s response
to the CSPL on the point that &#145;informing the public on the
mechanics of the electoral system, including the registration process,
is key to maintaining a strong democracy and we agree that the
Electoral Commission should continue to fulfil this
role.&#146;&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div><a name="0811121000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I can understand the Electoral Commission&#146;s position, it leads
to a wider issue, namely: where is the line going to be drawn on what
constitutes strict provision of public information, and how much of its
time should be spent on undertaking that? Given the well recorded poor
record of the Electoral Commission on that aspect, the Bill should be
more specific. That is why I head back towards the measures contained
in my
amendments.</div>
<a name="0811121000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811121000527"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I have some sympathy with the
overall aim of the amendments, although rather less sympathy with the
precise terms in which they are drafted. The overall aim will be
recognised by anyone who has had much to do with the Electoral
Commission over the past few years, and is that of producing a
commission that is more focused on its core tasks&#151;the monitoring
and regulation of political parties and the administration of
elections. It has not been all that successful at its more general role
of promoting democracy and participation and, on the whole, that has
drawn attention and resources away from its core tasks.</div>
<a name="0811121000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with the amendments is what they would do, and that is a separate
question which we should consider in detail. As the hon. Member for
Huntingdon explained, amendment No. 79 would insert the word
&#147;sole&#148; into the legislation. However, he seems to have
forgotten what it would insert that word into&#151;section
145 of PPERA. After the words in clause 1, that section refers
immediately to</div>
<a name="0811121000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the restrictions
and other requirements imposed by or by virtue of Parts III to
VII.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, it misses out the requirements in parts I and II of PPERA,
which unfortunately are rather important. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment would rule out a role for the commission in those two areas.
Part I includes provisions on a supervised role regarding boundaries in
England, and part II is about the registration of political parties.
The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment would leave us without any body
responsible for the registration of political parties; I cannot support
it.</div>
<a name="0811121000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is more
to amendment No. 38 than there is to amendment No. 79, but there is a
difficulty. In its response, the commission said that it still wants to
have the power to give information about how the electoral system
works. That is the proper function of the commission and is part of the
administration of elections. When there are different electoral
systems&#151;the European Parliament system, for example&#151;the
commission has a role in ensuring that the explanation for the system
offered to voters is not only clear but fair, and that it is not biased
in the direction of a particular party or group of parties. I agree
that that role should remain, but that does not mean that the
commission should also retain its broader position, which has had the
effect of taking away focus from its core role.</div>
<a name="0811121000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it now
stands, section 13(1)(a) of PPERA details the commission&#146;s role
in explaining the electoral system, and is worthy of retention.
However, according to section 13(1)(b), the commission is supposed to
promote awareness of</div>
<a name="0811121000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;current systems
of local government and national government in the United Kingdom and
any pending such
systems&#148;,</div><a name="0811121000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">while
section 13(1)(c) states that the commission should promote public
awareness
of</div><a name="0811121000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
institutions of the European
Union&#148;.</div><a name="0811121000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me surprising that the commission should have such a
role.</div>

I am sympathetic to the overall aim of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment and support its effect in those parts, overall it goes
slightly too far. Nevertheless, I would be interested to hear the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000528"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful for the spirit of the contributions
to the debate from the hon. Members for Huntingdon and for Cambridge.
We are broadly in agreement about where we want to go. Before I
regretfully have to resist the amendment, I want to address the matter
of lateness raised by the hon. Members for Chichester and for
Huntingdon. Some amendments were tabled late, and we very much wish
that that were not so. The team of excellent and extremely hard-working
civil servants who worked late into the night to draft them certainly
would have wished to have been able to deliver them earlier. However,
everyone recognises that it is important to take account of the new
Public Bill procedure, all the evidence that was received and the
recent contributions to the debate. That is why it was not possible to
table amendments sooner. I realise that issues are involved, but I mean
what I have said on many occasions. We want to achieve consensus as far
as possible, and it is important that we do
so.</div><a name="0811121000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind the Committee that the White Paper on funding was published on
16 June and that the Bill itself was published on 17 July, so there has
been a reasonable passage of time for members of the Committee to get
their heads round a lot of the
issues.</div><a name="0811121000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000529"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Does the Minister really think that it is a
consensual and reasonable approach to expect Opposition Members to
absorb amendments that were tabled on a Friday for debate the following
Tuesday, when the whole purpose of the process in which we are engaged
is to attempt, as far as we can, a constitutional change with which all
parties can agree? Might it not have been possible to re-timetable
matters so that we had a week&#146;s interval between the Public Bill
Committee-style evidence and the Standing Committee procedure? If we
had had that, we would not have had such
difficulties.</div><a name="0811121000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we are at it, what on earth is the Government&#146;s Gadarene rush
about in trying to get the Bill on to the statute book so
quickly?</div><a name="0811121000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000530"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I can understand frustrations being
expressed by all Members. I feel them frequently myself, but we are
talking about specific amendments. Along with amendment No. 38, we are
discussing amendment No. 79 to clause 1, not the processes regarding
why it took so long in the past to draft amendments, or why it might
take so long in the future. Can we address the amendments,
please?</div>
<a name="0811121000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000531"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Of course, Mr. Cook. There is a general
consensus, including from the commission, that its role should be to
withdraw from the wider role of encouraging democratic engagement, and
therefore the Government have accepted the recommendations of the
Committee on Standards in Public Life that it should no longer have
that role. We have also accepted its recommendation that the Government
should retain a clearly defined statutory role for the provision of
public information on the mechanics of the electoral process, including
election registration procedures, how to vote and an explanation of
changes to the electoral system.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div><a name="0811121000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we said in
our response, the Government believe in informing the public of the
mechanics of the electoral system, including the registration process.
We have already had some exchanges in Committee about the importance of
maintaining the register. We know that such practice is key to
maintaining a strong democracy. Repealing section 13 of PPERA would
prevent the commission from performing that vital function. Amendment
No. 79, which would amend clause 1 to limit the
commission&#146;s role to</div>
<a name="0811121000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;monitoring, and
taking such steps as they consider appropriate with a view to securing,
compliance
with&#148;</div><a name="0811121000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
controls imposed by the 2000 Act, would actually create a problem. It
is clear that everyone agrees how important it is that the commission
focus anew on its monitoring functions, and that it has appropriate
powers to perform them effectively. However, the amendment goes too
far. It would prevent the commission from performing any of its other
legitimate functions, as set out in PPERA. The hon. Member for
Cambridge has already alluded to
that.</div><a name="0811121000483"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="0811121000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already said that we accept that the commission should no longer
have a role in promoting that wider participation. We do not believe
any legislative changes are required to implement that. Furthermore, we
have already accepted the recommendations of the Committee on Standards
in Public Life that the Electoral Commission should no longer have any
involvement in electoral boundary matters and that the provision in
PPERA that allows for the transfer of boundary setting functions to the
commission should be repealed. We therefore believe that the amendments
are not necessary and that they would prevent the commission from
carrying out some of its remaining vital functions. I therefore hope
that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="0811121000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000532"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Member for Cambridge explained the
shortcomings of amendment No. 79 and I accept much of what he said. I
think he understood that the underlying point is that we need to be
satisfied with the focus of the commission. However, that is more of a
matter for a stand part debate and I will come back to it
then.</div><a name="0811121000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I agree with the Minister that the drafting of the amendments is
perhaps not up to the job, but I do not agree that the concept behind
the amendments is wrong, which is, I think, what he went on to say. We
do not think that the focus is right and so, although I will not press
the amendments to a Division, we will consider the matter again when we
move forward to the next stage of the
Bill.</div><a name="0811121000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0811121000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Ainger</b> (Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire)
(Lab): I beg to move amendment No. 2, in
clause 1, page 1, line 10, leave
out &#145;may&#146; and insert
&#145;shall&#146;.</div><a name="0811121000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000534"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 81, in
clause 1, page 1, line 13, leave
out &#145;, or is sufficient&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div><a name="0811121000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000535"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> May I say, Mr. Cook, how pleased I am
to be serving under your chairmanship again? The purpose of the
amendment is to ensure that the Electoral Commission publish clear
guidance for political parties, donors and those regulated by the 2000
Act. I note that Government amendment No. 125 uses the word
&#147;shall&#148; in relation to other guidance that is to be
published by the commission. I am surprised that the Government have
not used the word &#147;shall&#148; in the clause.</div>
<a name="0811121000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning,
we heard the words &#147;complexity&#148; and
&#147;complexities&#148; used on a number of occasions about the
Bill and the 2000 Act. Bearing it in mind that these are complex and
important issues, particularly for the individuals and parties that
might be affected by monitoring and regulation as a result of the 2000
Act and this legislation, clear guidance should be provided by the
Electoral Commission so that people can refer to it and establish
whether they are complying with the regulation and what they should do.
It is interesting that clause 1 sets out the terms of reference for
that guidance, which is extremely
helpful:</div><a name="0811121000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
what it is necessary, or is sufficient, to do (or avoid doing) in order
to comply with the
requirement;</div><a name="0811121000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
what it is desirable to do (or avoid doing) in view of the purpose of
the
requirement.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Bill, we say that there should be clear guidance, but we do not say
there shall be publication of that guidance. I would be grateful if my
right hon. Friend the Minister explained why, in this part of the Bill,
the Government say that the Electoral Commission &#147;may&#148;
publish guidance, but elsewhere that it &#147;shall&#148; do
so.</div><a name="0811121000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000536"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We have added our names to those of the hon.
Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire and others. Clause
1 would insert a new subsection (6) into the PPERA, requiring the
commission to publish guidance on how to comply with the provisions of
the Bill. That is recognition by the Government that the Bill
introduces complex and administratively burdensome duties, which would
have to be implemented by those at the lowest level of the party
structure, who are often volunteers and have little or no legal
training. The commission will need to produce guidance to assist
parties at the local and national levels to bring their practices in
line with the Bill. That will be a considerable undertaking for the
commission in the aftermath of the Bill&#146;s enactment. Failure to
produce guidance in a timely and concise fashion would have potentially
wide-ranging and detrimental impacts on both the commission and those
who must implement the Bill&#146;s
provisions.</div><a name="0811121000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Peter
Wardle, the chief executive of the commission, highlighted the
commission&#146;s own emphasis on the need for guidance in the second
sitting of the Committee last
week:</div><a name="0811121000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are lots of questions about the Bill at the moment. We are already
beginning to try to work out what our guidance would look like and we
would hope to have that guidance in the public domain by January. I do
not think that it is possible to get anything useful and in detail in
the public domain before
then.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Political
Parties and Elections Public Bill Committee, </i>6 November 2008; c.
47, Q113.]</div><a name="0811121000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister give us some idea of the projected cost to the commission
of producing the guidance? Will the commission be given any additional
financial or personnel resources to handle the increased work load as a
result of the legislation being passed? Have the Government
consulted with the commission on its needs? If
so, could the Minister circulate a copy of the
commission&#146;s response?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div><a name="0811121000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of
amendment No. 2 is, again, to give a clear indication to the commission
about the focus of its remit. The amendment looks to reverse some
ambiguity in the Bill. That the
commission</div><a name="0811121000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
prepare and publish
guidance&#148;</div><a name="0811121000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">implies
a level of discretion. We wish to ensure that guidance is given the
priority it needs and that the commission is compelled to issue it. The
publication of guidance should form a key part of the
commission&#146;s role in the coming years, while the
Bill&#151;when enacted&#151;and its requirements are bedding down.
That would not only assist parties and their officials in complying; it
would also go a long way to rectifying the commission&#146;s damaged
reputation in the eyes of
many.</div><a name="0811121000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 81, likewise, we find the inclusion of the phrase
&#147;or is sufficient&#148; to be strangely confusing and
ambiguous. What is &#147;necessary&#148; and
&#147;sufficient&#148; should be one and the same. If something is
sufficient, but not necessary, we are possibly imposing a split level
into the test, which is surely not the best way forward. I shall be
interested to hear what the Minister considers necessary and what he
considers sufficient. Given the complexity of the Bill&#146;s
schedules and the clear possibility of confusion, we as legislators
should be doing as much as humanly possible to ensure that we are clear
about what must be done to comply with the law. As I noted, the
commission&#146;s guidance will prove invaluable when parties go
about implementing the Bill&#146;s provisions. Guidance should be
published as quickly as possible, setting out clearly what needs to be
done. Let us deal in black and white as much as possible. The phrase
&#147;or is sufficient&#148; introduces grey areas, which are the
last things that we or the commission need. We suggest the
phrase&#146;s
deletion.</div><a name="0811121000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000537"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I, too, support amendment No. 2, and like the
hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire, I look
forward to an explanation from the Government as to why, in this part
of the Bill, the commission is given a power to give guidance, whereas
elsewhere it is given a duty. The commission&#146;s response implies
that a duty here would produce a vast amount of work, which leads to
the question of why that is not the commission&#146;s view of its
existing obligations under the law. There is a link between this and
the previous debate&#151;if the commission is being asked to focus
attention on its regulatory activities rather more than in the past,
that should free up resources from the other functions to devote to
this
area.</div><a name="0811121000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I cannot support amendment No. 81, which, if anything, is the wrong way
around. The difference between &#147;necessary&#148; and
&#147;sufficient&#148; is as follows. If a party official trying to
comply with the law is told that various things are
&#147;necessary&#148;, they are told that they have to do them, but
not that that is enough to comply. A lot of things might be necessary,
but not add up to enough to comply with the law. If they are told what
is &#147;sufficient&#148; to comply, that is much better. It gives
them a safe harbour, because if they comply with the guidance, they are
okay and know that they have not broken the law. It seems to me far
more important to have guidance on &#147;sufficient&#148;
conditions for compliance than on &#147;necessary&#148; conditions.
If the hon. Member for Huntingdon wanted to remove part of the clause,
he would have done better to remove the word
&#147;necessary&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div><a name="0811121000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000538"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I will address some of the detailed issues that
have been raised in a moment. First, I shall explain briefly why we
will have to resist both
amendments.</div><a name="0811121000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 2 is unnecessary as it would be unhelpful to have in primary
legislation such a hard requirement on the commission. We have every
confidence that the commission will produce the guidance as necessary,
and I am aware that it has already started work on it. However, in
practice it would be difficult for a statutory requirement that it must
produce guidance to work. What would constitute the guidance having
been produced? Who would judge that it was adequate and that the
commission had fulfilled its statutory obligation? It seems to me that
the amendment would open it up to judicial review, which can hardly be
a sensible recourse given what we are trying to achieve in the clause.
A permissive power for the commission to produce guidance is
sufficient. It will be able to keep the guidance updated and refreshed
and focused on key areas of uncertainty. Amending the Bill in the way
sought in the amendment would not add
anything.</div><a name="0811121000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 81 would limit the commission&#146;s guidance to setting out what
it is necessary or desirable to do, or avoid doing, to comply with the
requirements of the 2000 Act. We believe that the clause will allow the
commission flexibility to decide what information it should set out in
its guidance to help regulated individuals to comply with regulatory
requirements. The amendment would unnecessarily restrict the
commission&#146;s
flexibility.</div><a name="0811121000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will allow the commission to produce a wide range of guidance,
including best practice guidance and pro formas that parties can
complete if they wish to comply with the requirements on them to report
to the commission. We believe that that flexibility will help Members
and other regulated
persons.</div><a name="0811121000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire
and the hon. Member for Cambridge asked why in some parts of the Bill
we suggest that the commission should be given a power, but in others
we seek to impose a duty on it. Quite simply, the difference is that
the commission &#147;shall&#148; produce guidance on the use of
investigatory powers and sanctions, but it &#147;may&#148; produce
guidance on the requirements of the 2000 Act. That is because sanctions
and powers are a much narrower issue with potentially serious
consequences, and the commission must therefore explain how it intends
to use
them.</div><a name="0811121000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
requirements of PPERA are many and complex, and the Electoral
Commission must be empowered to judge which aspects require
explanation. Requiring guidance on every single aspect of the Bill
would make it very difficult and effectively inoperable. I hope that
that gives some reassurance to my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman
about why we have adopted the distinction between the application of
the power and the
duty.</div><a name="0811121000088"></a>

Electoral Commission tell us that they are producing the guidance, so
why is the requirement so onerous? If it is producing the guidance, it
does not seem to be too onerous for it to do so. We being told that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000562"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Political party funding and the organising of
elections have been controversial in this country for centuries. One
has only to look at a series of reports going back over the years to
see that those perennial problems have presented challenges to the
electoral 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>system and political parties alike throughout history. To the extent
that society changes over time, so do its expectations for electoral
and funding probity, and changes then follow. However, the problem has
become far more acute under the present Government.</div>
<a name="0811121000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said on
Second Reading, this is a half-hearted Bill, which is characterised
more by what is missing than by our wholesale objections to its
content. We are missing an opportunity to rectify the damage and add
legitimacy back into the system. We are not the only ones to think that
way. A key finding of the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust
was:</div><a name="0811121000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Public
confidence in the electoral process in the UK was the lowest in Western
Europe in
1997.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
effective electoral system and its administration must be the
foundation of our democracy. For a democracy, we need elections. Those
elections cannot be free and fair unless the rules governing them are
fair and coherent, and those rules must be administered properly and,
if necessary, enforced actively. Party funding regulations are just as
important.</div><a name="0811121000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
recent experience, we agree that the regulatory framework needs
strengthening. The principle, set out in clause 1, that the commission
is now required to both monitor and regulate compliance has long been
promoted by the Conservative party, although we will need to tie down
exactly what that means. We hope that it will result in the commission
doing less of what it should not be doing, such as spending millions of
pounds on increasing voter turnout. That is our job as politicians, not
the job of the commission. As such, we in the Conservative party
cautiously accept in principle some of the proposed additions to the
investigatory and sanctioning powers of the Electoral Commission,
although we will want to examine more closely how they will work in
practice, as we will be concerned to ensure that they do not destroy
donors&#146; willingness to
participate.</div><a name="0811121000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
I of PPERA contains 21 sections and two schedules that created the
commission and set out its general functions. The commission was
established as a corporate body independent of any Department. Sections
5 to 13 provided it with a broad range of functions primarily in
relation to the oversight of electoral matters in the UK. Its aim, in
essence, is to ensure the integrity of and public confidence in the
democratic
process.</div><a name="0811121000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the mandate set by the Government in the legislation was
unintentionally broad and ultimately far wider than originally
envisaged. The commission sees its function as ranging from the
regulation of political donations and expenditure by political parties
through to the promotion of greater participation in the democratic
process and responsibility for electoral policy review. That is a very
extensive remit for a body that, according to the figures on its
website, has only six commissioners, one chief executive, an executive
team and an employee force of fewer than 200
people.</div><a name="0811121000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
the enactment of PPERA, several years passed before the problems
associated with the breadth of the remit became apparent. The
commission itself, in a report that it published on PPERA in 2003,
queried the extent of its role and whether it had sufficient powers to
ensure that there was compliance with the Act. By the start of 2007,
the problem had become so acute that it was hampering the commission in
its work.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div><a name="0811121000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 11th report
by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, entitled &#147;Review
of the Electoral Commission&#148;, was published in January 2007 and
attracted considerable press coverage. While commending the work of the
commission to date, it noted rather
alarmingly:</div><a name="0811121000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Evidence
received by the Committee strongly suggested that it has been less
successful in acting as an effective and strategic regulator in a
manner which ensures public trust and confidence. The root of this,
from the evidence we have received, appears to lie in the
Commission&#146;s interpretation of its regulatory mandate in PPERA
and, in consequence, its overly passive
role.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
criticism of a too-passive approach to its role as regulator has dogged
the commission in recent years. Peter Wardle said in evidence to the
CSPL:</div><a name="0811121000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
legislation very much puts the onus on the parties to comply and some
of the information that we need, which can trigger our investigations,
does not come into our possession until such time as the parties do
that under the
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
a regulatory body whose total net operating costs have exceeded
&#163;22 million for both 2006-07 and 2007-08, that is a rather
depressing perspective on its role as a
regulator.</div><a name="0811121000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
more concern, perhaps, was that the Government seemed to support that
passive role when only 18 months ago Lord Falconer stated in evidence
for the same CSPL
report:</div><a name="0811121000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Electoral Commission&#146;s role, as set out by PPERA, was not to
investigate. It was simply to be a recipient of information. They were
in a sense exactly the same as the Register of Companies (Companies
House).&#148;</div><a name="0811121000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CSPL expressed considerable surprise at the time at those comments.
Will the Minister address that issue and tell us why there has been a
change of approach from the Government, as welcome as it is? It is
important that that is placed on the
record.</div><a name="0811121000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes to the Bill indicate that the commission has
estimated that the additional costs arising as a result of the changes
to its powers and sanctions will amount to about &#163;650,000 per
annum. Could we please hear from the Minister how likely it is that it
will be able to meet those costs from its existing budget? Details on
the budget would be
helpful.</div><a name="0811121000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
more concern is that, once again, the Government are swinging wildly
between opposing sides of the argument: from a placid commission to a
full-throttled regulator with all the powers needed to enter
people&#146;s homes. I do not say that as an indication of a likely
approach that I have received notice of from the commission. Rather, it
is an observation of the potential held in the wording of the Bill. A
lack of balance runs throughout the Bill, and I will return to it in
coming debates as I attempt to highlight some of the Bill&#146;s
inconsistencies.</div><a name="0811121000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
concerns focus on the tendency of the commission to travel the path of
least resistance and sometimes spread itself so widely on less vital
issues that it has been left wanting when faced with larger problems. I
would like to take this opportunity to quote from the submission of my
hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr.
Heald) to the CSPL in June 2006. It adds considerable weight to what I
am saying. He
stated:</div><a name="0811121000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have concerns that the Commission may have attempted to do too much,
such that it has spread itself too thinly and failed to deliver on
inflated expectations of what an &#145;independent electoral
watchdog&#146; should achieve. This problem of &#145;mission
creep&#146; is not unique to the Commission and has affected other
public sector 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>agencies...Although the Commission has a statutory function to
review and issue reports on matters relating to elections, it has
produced an excessive flurry of investigations into every single aspect
of the electoral system. We are concerned that the Commission may have
adopted the institutional mindset of &#145;change for change&#146;s
sake&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will give one more short excerpt. My hon. Friend
continues:</div><a name="0811121000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
would suggest that the Commission has interpreted its remit to believe
that elections must be &#145;modernised&#146; as an end in itself.
RPA2000, PPERA, and successive legislation, have created an
institutional instability in the electoral
system.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend&#146;s comments are just as relevant
today.</div><a name="0811121000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
a classic example of public choice theory in action, these reviews have
resulted in the conclusion that the Commission should have a bigger
budget and more power. &#145;The need for the Commission to take on
new functions has been pressed on us...We recognise that now a central
electoral body exists, there is an inevitable logic in locating certain
central functions with the Commission.&#146; Mirroring this trend of
constantly seeking to expand its role, the Commission&#146;s
expenditure has spiralled from &#163;7 million in 2001-02 to
&#163;26 million in
2006-07.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
has been a common feature of the commission&#146;s performance to
date. It bemoans its lack of powers, yet only 29 people have been
prosecuted for crimes under PPERA. Compare that with the 400-plus cases
of alleged electoral fraud that have apparently occurred in the same
period, and one begins to get the impression that better utilisation of
what the commission has is needed as much as more
powers.</div><a name="0811121000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the commission&#146;s predisposition&#151;albeit somewhat reduced
in recent months, it has to be said&#151;to include itself in
non-regulatory or enforcement activities such as the promotion of the
electoral system and encouraging people to vote has, in the view of
many, detracted significantly from its role as a guardian of the
electoral system&#146;s integrity. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Chichester so accurately stated in his submission to the report of the
CSPL:</div><a name="0811121000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
first area where I think a mistake has probably been made was in asking
the Electoral Commission to take responsibility for voter
participation. I am confident, in retrospect, the majority of people
think that it should not have...I think that is the responsibility
of political parties. If people are not interested in politics it is
our fault,
primarily.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
presume that &#147;our&#148; refers to
politicians.</div><a name="0811121000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet
that element of the commission&#146;s work is supported by a
ring-fenced &#163;7.5 million, or some 34 per cent. of last
year&#146;s costs&#151;more than one third of its expenditure. I
believe that those figures are right, but I would appreciate it if the
Minister could confirm that that is the case. The Government&#146;s
original rationale for placing this function within the remit of the
commission was alarm at the continuing drop in turnout at various
elections. While the reasons individuals do not vote are highly
subjective, it is surely a political party issue rather than a
commission one. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire the then shadow Secretary of State for Constitutional
Affairs, noted in the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#146;s
report,</div><a name="0811121000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think it is an important issue, but I think someone else should be
doing
it&#148;.</div><a name="0811121000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
more damning is the suggestion from the CSPL that the evidence of any
impact, in terms of increased turnout in elections on the back of the
Commission&#146;s work, is at best mixed and some would argue
negligible.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div><a name="0811121000485"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="0811121000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
this is the commission we find ourselves confronted with today. We
accept the need for an effective commission and recognise it as a
necessary and vital part of the modern electoral fabric. It is its duty
to act as a watchdog of party financing and electoral administration.
If we get it correct, people will have faith in the system and its
integrity and we shall not undervalue the role of promoting the
integrity of the system when assessing people&#146;s propensity to
vote. In other words, if I do not trust the system, why should I bother
voting? That is the fundamental issue that the Government consistently
shirk in the Bill, in which they continue, wrongly, to put turnout on
the same level as countering fraud. The priority needs to be to refocus
the commission, and that is what the amendment and new clause 1 sought
to do, which is why we will be coming back to it at later
stages.</div><a name="0811121000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we have got, through a combination of deficiencies in the PPERA, is a
mandate for the commission that is too weak in some cases and too broad
in others. This has left us with an enforcement body that has fallen
short of fulfilling both its potential and its important statutory
duties. We will want to ponder where we have got to before the Bill is
considered on Report, but I am not satisfied that we are yet where we
want to be. It would be helpful if the Minister spent a little time
analysing how we got to this position. Was it poor management, a poor
legal structure, or a bit of both? Is he confident that the Bill,
following the implementation of clause 1, is going to deal with the
problem?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000563"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I may just have glimpsed a shadowy ghost of the
consensus that I have been so avidly seeking throughout today. Apart
from the occasional moment when the hon. Gentleman strayed into some
general partisan comments about the overall nature of the Bill, there
is a large measure of agreement on a lot of the substantive issues.
Before I set out answers to some of his questions and our case for the
clause, I point out that it was remiss of me not to address a couple of
the important questions that he asked earlier.</div>
<a name="0811121000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
difference between &#147;necessary&#148; and
&#147;sufficient&#148;, although the hon. Member for Cambridge had
a good go at it, I try never to avoid anything and I can tell the
Committee that &#147;necessary&#148; will detail what is required
in cases where the Bill requires clear steps to be taken, while
&#147;sufficient&#148; will provide what needs to be done as a bare
minimum when the nature of the obligation may be less clear. I hope
that that clarifies that important point. Let me clarify a further
point. In the hon. Gentleman&#146;s previous remarks, he seemed to
suggest that my comments about &#147;complex&#148; and
&#147;various&#148; in relation to the previous group of amendments
referred to the Bill. In fact, they referred to the 2000 Act, which has
been in effect for eight years, so that was the point that I was
making.</div>
<a name="0811121000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1 is an
important part of the Bill for a lot of the reasons that the hon.
Member for Huntingdon has set out. It emphasises that the commission
has a role in monitoring compliance with the controls, but it also goes
further and sets out the commission&#146;s role in securing
compliance. That will make it clear that a key part of the
commission&#146;s monitoring role is to investigate allegations or
suspicions of regulatory failure, and to consider whether to take
further action.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div><a name="0811121000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause also
enables the commission to prepare and publish guidance setting out its
opinion of what is required under the legislation referred
to&#151;section 145(1) of PPERA. The clause clarifies the
commission&#146;s role by making it clear that it has the
responsibility not only to check whether relevant restrictions and
requirements are being complied with, but to take the steps it
considers necessary to ensure that the rules are complied with, and to
deter non-compliance. The clarification of the commission&#146;s role
is intended to address a recommendation of the Committee on Standards
in Public
Life.</div><a name="0811121000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2007 report on the Electoral Commission drew on evidence received by
the committee that suggested the commission&#146;s interpretation of
its regulatory mandate in the 2000 Act had led it to take a passive
approach. In turn, that made it a less effective regulator and led to
less public trust and confidence. The committee therefore recommended
that the 2000 Act should be amended to make it clear that the
commission has a duty proactively to investigate allegations or
suspicions of failures to comply with the regulatory
framework.</div><a name="0811121000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, the committee recommended that the word
&#147;monitor&#148; in section 145 of the 2000 Act should be
replaced by the word &#147;regulate&#148;. However, we believe that
such an amendment would not sufficiently achieve the underlying
intention of the committee&#146;s recommendation, which is to place
greater emphasis on the active steps that the commission may take in
order to perform its role. The wording of the clause will bolster the
commission in performing its role and will place the correct emphasis
on the importance of an active approach to regulation. We believe that
that will result in a strengthened regulator. It is essential that the
commission and those whom it regulates be in no doubt about the extent
of the commission&#146;s role as a regulator of party funding and
campaign expenditure.</div>
<a name="0811121000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
aspect of the clause relates to the commission&#146;s ability to
publish guidance, and is necessary to ensure that regulated individuals
and political parties fully understand what they are required to do, or
avoid doing, to comply with party funding legislation. We recognise
that party funding rules are complex and that those charged with
compliance are often volunteers who may lack financial skills. The
clause is intended to reflect that. Such guidance might cover
frequently asked questions, or it might set out some scenarios on novel
circumstances and steps that the commission would expect a regulated
individual to take to comply with regulatory requirements in those
circumstances. The clause also allows the commission to produce best
practice guidance or pro formas that parties or regulated donees might
like to use to submit returns to the commission. The intention of this
part of the clause is to ensure that the commission takes an active
role in helping those whom it regulates to comply and avoid inadvertent
breaches of the
rules.</div><a name="0811121000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Huntingdon asked various questions about the budget and
was interested to know whether the commission would have sufficient
funding to enable it to discharge these new duties. He will be aware
that the commission is funded directly from the consolidated fund,
after the Speaker&#146;s Committee, about which the Committee has now
been much enlightened, has approved its estimates. I am happy to write
to him 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>with the details of that budget. Indeed, I am sure the commission will
be happy to let him know directly what its views are about the adequacy
of its
funding.</div><a name="0811121000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman spent a reasonable amount of time asking how we got to
this position. I do not want to exhaust the Committee&#146;s patience
by providing a blow-by- blow account, but it is not surprising that in
an area as complex and important as this, the legislation needs to be
constantly revisited to ensure that it is appropriate to the
circumstances. I do not need to remind the Committee of the various
issues that have arisen from all parts of the House in recent years,
which have suggested that we needed to take a fresh look at this
subject. I have no doubt that, no matter how important and useful the
Bill is in achieving its objectives, we will revisit these issues in
legislation.</div><a name="0811121000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally,
it has always been clear that, since the 2000 Act, the role of the
commission should be that of a regulator. Section 145 of that Act makes
it clear that the commission&#146;s role is to monitor
compliance&#151;clearly, that is a regulatory role&#151;and that it
should do so by taking &#147;appropriate steps.&#148; That is a
clear nod towards investigation and possible sanctions. That is not a
new role, but it does need refocusing, as the hon. Gentleman clearly
stated.</div><a name="0811121000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is an important part of an important Bill and I hope that the
Committee will support its inclusion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000564"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to clause 2, which deals with the new
investigatory powers of the commission. PPERA created the commission
and, at the same time, provided it with supervisory powers. Section 145
set out the general function of the commission as the regulator and
monitor of compliance with part III,
on</div><a name="0811121000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Accounting
requirements for registered
parties&#148;,</div><a name="0811121000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
part IV,
on</div><a name="0811121000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Control
of donations to registered parties and their members
etc.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
complement that, section 146 empowered the commission to require a
predefined group of entities to provide it with information relating to
their financial affairs. That predefined group included registered
political parties, recognised third parties, permitted participants in
a referendum campaign, regulated donees and candidates at an
election.</div>
<a name="0811121000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">A person
authorised by the commission may also enter the premises of a
registered party, a recognised third party or a permitted participant
to inspect their financial records. However, according to the Secretary
of State for Justice, those powers have been used only once. On Second
Reading, he
said:</div><a name="0811121000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
any event, the existing powers have been used only once since the
Electoral Commission was established nearly eight years
ago&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 20 October 2008; Vol. 481,
c. 50.]</div> <a name="0811121000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first question to ask is, why have they not been used more
frequently?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div><a name="0811121000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scope of
proposed new section 146 goes well beyond that, and the Minister must
show some evidence of the need for such an extension. In particular, it
would interesting to know what formed the catalyst for the Government
to give those powers to the commission, what format the consultation
process took and who was consulted. Can the Minister provide figures
for the number of instances in which the commission has failed in its
duty as a regulator on the basis of a lack of those proposed powers? In
other words, have the Government reviewed to what extent the failure to
regulate has so far been as a result of inaction by the commission, or
of a lack of appropriate legislation? When does the commission feel
that there could be a need to go into the homes of individual donors?
How frequently is that likely to happen and on what basis?</div>
<a name="0811121000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2 seeks
to replace section 146 of PPERA, thereby providing the commission with
increased powers of investigation. Subsections (1) and (2) would insert
and give effect to what is now schedule 1 of the Bill, while subsection
(3) makes provision for penalties for offences under the new schedule.
Among other things, schedule 1 would enable the commission to require
access to financial records and information, and to enter premises to
inspect and make copies of relevant documents.</div>
<a name="0811121000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 1(1)
of schedule 1 is particularly concerning. It would extend the power
under section 146 of PPERA to enter premises that had previously been
restricted to registered parties, permitted participants and candidates
at elections. Paragraph 3 of schedule 1 would include other bodies or
individuals such as donors. Those investigatory powers can be exercised
in cases where the commission has &#147;reasonable grounds&#148; to
suspect that an offence or contravention has been committed. Will the
Minister give an early indication of what he thinks would constitute
&#147;reasonable
grounds&#148;?</div><a name="0811121000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
provision has the potential to erode the willingness of law-abiding
citizens to donate to political parties&#151;a point that has been
made by many people. It would take only one heavy-handed and
well-advertised use of those powers in someone&#146;s home or office
for other legitimate donors to take fright at the prospect of giving
money to political parties. Giving money to political parties is, for
the vast majority of contributors, done for the noble and civic
intention of wishing to promote a better society for all. To destroy or
hinder that instinct would be inexcusable, let alone anti-democratic.
That is why we have tabled a number of amendments to schedule 1. The
stakes are high and we must thoroughly justify the need for these new,
sometimes severe powers.</div>
<a name="0811121000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">In so doing,
the Minister should bear in mind the comments of Peter Wardle, chief
executive of the commission. Giving evidence to the Committee on the
extension of the commission&#146;s powers to cover regulated donees,
he expressed reservations over the extension and
said:</div><a name="0811121000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
feel that the current powers are adequate to do the job we need to do
regarding inspection. One can see why, for completeness, the powers
have been extended, but we are not convinced that we need these
powers.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Political

read with interest the White Paper published by the Ministry of Justice
in the run-up to the Bill. I note in particular the sections entitled,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>However, in the section entitled, &#147;The case for change&#148;, I
was left somewhat bewildered by the fact that there was no mention of
the need for the commission to have the power to demand documents from
individuals. That does not appear until the proposals on page
27:</div><a name="0811121000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
provide the Commission with a widened range of sanctions and
investigatory powers to enable it to become a more robust regulator.
The Commission&#146;s powers to obtain information would be extended
to allow it to require the production of information from relevant
individuals not currently covered by the PPERA powers where it is
appropriate to do so...This would need to be accompanied by appropriate
safeguards.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000486"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

there is no recommendation that the commission should be able to enter
the homes of individuals. Will the Minister tell us from whom that
recommendation first
came?</div><a name="0811121000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission states that the power of entry is consistent with that used
by other regulators. Will the Minister tell us what circumstances have
necessitated the use of such powers? How often does he or the
commission envisage the powers being used? Is the Minister also aware
of the commission&#146;s own concerns that the safeguards for access
to premises occupied by regulated donees&#151;including individual
MPs and other holders of elective office&#151;may not be robust
enough? Has the Minister taken up the commission&#146;s offer to
consider further how to safeguard such powers effectively? Does the
Minister not find it concerning that the very organisation that they
seek to empower shies away from the arbitrary power being handed to
it?</div><a name="0811121000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to a press release issued by the Home Office in July there are now
1,043 separate laws that allow state inspectors to enter
people&#146;s homes and premises. On 15 July, the operational
policing section of the Home Office slipped out a new detailed survey
of powers of entry by state officials. There was no press release, no
comment and no
fanfare.</div><a name="0811121000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
those 1,043 state powers of entry, 753 are exercisable under primary
legislation and 290 through secondary legislation. In total, an
estimated 430 new powers of entry have been created by this Government.
Despite the Prime Minister&#146;s pledge last year to curtail those
rights, a further 16 new laws are being pushed through Parliament that
entrench or extend powers of
entry.</div><a name="0811121000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a speech last year, the Prime Minister pledged to curtail powers of
entry with a new liberty test. He said that any change to entry powers
would be accompanied by new guidance on using such powers and on the
rights of members of the public to prevent their abuse. To paraphrase
his speech, he made three points. He said that any change will be
accompanied by guidance on how it is to be exercised; that individuals
have the right to take action if that guidance is not complied with;
and that we should consider whether we need to do more to offer redress
for the individual against disproportionate use of those powers by the
state.</div><a name="0811121000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
my reading of the Bill so far, not one of those limbs of the test has
been complied with. Will the Minister explain why not, and when and how
they will be, or is it simply that, given what I hope is not going to
become the partisan nature of the Bill, the Government want to rush
through the measures in time for the next general
election?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div><a name="0811121000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">We support the
general need to empower the commission and to provide it with tools to
be an effective regulator. However, unless we are careful, the effect
of the measures will be to push people further away from the political
process. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr.
Maude) rightly pointed out on Second
Reading:</div><a name="0811121000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
all agree that the Commission must have appropriate powers to enable it
to carry out its duties, but there is a real concern about the

to political parties are a way of volunteering assistance to the
political process, and the last thing that we wish to do is discourage
it. We must be careful to ensure that we do not introduce knee-jerk
legislation when we have not fully considered its long-term impact.
Given the rushed nature of the timetable for the Bill, I fear that we
may be in danger of doing just that. It seems that the old saying
&#147;more haste, less speed&#148; could be applied to the
Government. In their desire to push through the Bill, I trust that they
will not breach their own code of practice on guidance&#151;or the
Government&#146;s guidance on guidance&#151;which states that
guidance should be issued at least three months before any regulation
comes into effect.</div>
<a name="0811121000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
finish by saying that there is a twist to this. In answering a written
question from my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, the Minister
noted that the consultation on clause 10 will be that of the Electoral
Commission and not the Government. Will the Minister explain the
position relating to clause 2 and schedule 1 and confirm that that full
consultation will occur, whichever body undertakes
it?</div><a name="0811121000176"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000565"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I should draw the Committee&#146;s attention
to the fact that the hon. Gentleman made extensive reference in his
contribution to various elements in schedule 1. I did not stop him, but
that makes me less well disposed to the prospect of having a stand part
debate on the schedule. If other members will bear that in mind, it
will help me.</div>
<a name="0811121000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000566"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Thank you for those comments, Mr.
Cook. It will take me much less time than the hon. Member for
Huntingdon to say what I have to say about the clause. He is right to
worry about powers of entry and other details that we will discuss when
we debate schedule 1, but we politicians have to bear it in mind that
Parliament has imposed lots of requirements on other people. When it
comes to imposing similar requirements on politicians themselves,
people who were not concerned before suddenly become concerned, and we
must be aware of what that looks like to the outside world. The key is
that we should not make arbitrary exemptions for ourselves. The
principles that we apply when regulating politics are the same as those
that we apply to the regulation of anything else. I hope that when hon.
Members make points that might sound self-interested, they will at
least have the grace to concede that similar points can be made about
other people&#146;s civil liberties, not just their
own.</div><a name="0811121000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811121000567"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): I should simply like
an explanation of the measures on page 2. In the right-hand column,
lines 5 and 8 mention summary convictions, and that is to be
understood. Further down,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>however, there seems to be a rather peculiar situation in which the
Northern Irish are entitled to six months off from what the English,
Welsh and Scots have to pay as a penalty. Why are the Irish entitled to
a lesser penalty than the English, Welsh and
Scots?</div><a name="0811121000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000568"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I shall be relatively brief, because many of the
important points of detail that the hon. Member for Huntingdon has
raised will be covered in our discussions on amendments. I shall simply
say a few general words about the clause.</div>
<a name="0811121000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
distinguished contributions of the hon. Members for Huntingdon and for
Cambridge clearly illustrate the path that we have tried to tread with
the clause and the schedule. Of course, we have to be sensitive, as the
hon. Member for Huntingdon has said, to the voluntary nature of a huge
amount of political activity. We must be sensitive to the need to
sustain that activity and to the risk of that effort being damaged by
any legislation giving the Electoral Commission new powers. He made the
case very well about the potential risks of this clause and, indeed,
any legislation that seeks to
regulate.</div><a name="0811121000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cambridge rightly points out that we must be extremely
careful of seeming to exempt ourselves arbitrarily from regulations and
controls to which we rightly expect other participants in public life
to be subject. The controls that we propose are not dissimilar to those
relating to the Financial Services Authority, for example. We have to
steer a careful course here. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State for Justice and I made it clear on Second Reading that we are
sensitive to the concerns that hon. Members on both sides of the House
have expressed about this clause and about the powers in the schedule
to which it is so closely linked. The amendments that the Government
have tabled, which we will discuss in due course, show that we are
trying to respond to those concerns.</div>
<a name="0811121000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, in
relation to the overall position, it is worth reminding the Committee
that the commission already has extensive powers under section 146 of
the 2000 Act, which requires the disclosure of documents and gives it
the power to enter premises and take copies of information for the
purposes of carrying out its functions. It is a criminal offence, under
the provisions of that Act, to
fail,</div><a name="0811121000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;without
reasonable excuse, to comply
with&#148;</div><a name="0811121000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">a
request or to obstruct entry and
search.</div><a name="0811121000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers that we are discussing already exist. They have, from memory,
only been used once in the past eight years. They have not been used
extensively, but they exist. As we discuss the matter, we will see that
these powers are being restricted. We have tabled amendments and we
will discuss the details as we go forward and I will, if I may, address
many of the particular points that have been raised in the course of
that discussion. It is important to bear it in mind that, so far, we
have consensus on the importance of the Electoral Commission&#146;s
regulating the conduct of elections more effectively than it has done
in the past&#151;I think that all Committee members agree with that.
If the commission is to do that, we have to give it the powers to be an
effective
regulator.</div><a name="0811121000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have tabled a lot of amendments and I will bear in mind your
strictures, Mr. Cook. However, if I may suggest it, there
would be merit in, and the Committee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>would benefit from, a stand part debate on schedule
1, because it is important, there is a widespread degree of concern
about it, and we should have such debates. However, I will restrict
myself at this
point.</div><a name="0811121000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to bear in mind that we must give this body the powers to be a
credible
regulator.</div><a name="0811121000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000569"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It is important that, at this stage, the
Minister gives the Government&#146;s rationale for needing the
clause. He just said that there has been only one prosecution in this
area in the last eight years. Does he think that there are things that
would be prosecuted, but are not being prosecuted, because there is a
lack of legislation, or does the commission need to pull its finger out
and do more of what it should have been doing? Perhaps he can give the
Government&#146;s view on what needs to be
done.</div><a name="0811121000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000570"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We are trying to give the commission new powers so
that it can be more effective, as is necessary, in respect of the
offences. As the hon. Gentleman has said, powers of entry are provided
for under those new measures. The commission should be a credible
regulator that can act as a deterrent as much as anything else. I ask
the hon. Gentleman, as we discuss these matters further, to bear it in
mind that the existence of these powers may act as a deterrent to the
kind of behaviour that we do not want to see in the conduct of our
elections. That is an important point. It is not that we think that
these offences will necessarily be committed and that they will then
have to be prosecuted under the relevant powers; we want to stop this
behaviour happening. The existence of these powers could be a credible
deterrent.</div><a name="0811121000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to address a lot of the detail, because it relates to the
amendment, but first I want to correct a remark I made earlier and put
the record straight. The commission has not used its powers of entry;
it has only once used its power to request
documents.</div><a name="0811121000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that Committee members will support clause 2 and that we can
discuss its detailed implementation as we go through schedule
1.</div><a name="0811121000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000571"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000573"></a>The

down.</div><a name="0811121000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000576"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> On the question asked by the hon. Member for Isle
of Wight, might the answer relate to the passage of the Criminal
Justice Act 2003? Might it be that that does not yet apply in Northern
Ireland, which is why there is a distinction between a six-month
sentence in Northern Ireland and a 12-month sentence in the rest of the
UK? It was a new sentence introduced in the 2003 Act, under
which I think half is meant to be served and half not. There is still a
maximum of 26 weeks to be spent in a prison
cell.</div><a name="0811121000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000577"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000578"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 102, in
schedule 1, page 13, line 15, leave out sub-sub-paragraph
(1)(d).</div><a name="0811121000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
part of the schedule to which the amendment refers deals with
powers</div><a name="0811121000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
relation to registered parties and
others&#148;,</div><a name="0811121000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
it is the &#147;others&#148; bit about which we have most concern.
The amendment proposes the deletion of the term &#147;regulated
donee&#148; from the list of people or groups to whom the
commission&#146;s new investigative powers will apply. This part of
the schedule is effectively lifted from the PPERA, but with the
important change of inserting that
category.</div><a name="0811121000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
meaning of &#147;regulated donee&#148; is defined in paragraph 1(7)
of schedule 7 to that Act
as</div><a name="0811121000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
member of a registered party...a members association;
or...the holder of a relevant elective office, whether or not he
is a member of a registered
party.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment comes on the back of our concerns about the extension of the
powers to individuals. Given that a person can fall under that
provision and not be a member of a registered party, I fear that unless
we are careful the effect will be to push people further away from the
political process. The hon. Member for Cambridge said earlier
that we have to examine politicians, but he will appreciate that what
we are discussing here goes much further than politicians and deals
with
donors.</div><a name="0811121000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
broadening the scope of which people the powers of investigation cover,
we are in danger of casting the net too wide. People may become
fearful, or at least think twice about volunteering their time and
energy to assist political parties, if the end result might be that
they are investigated by the commission for an action that they have no
direct involvement in. My understanding is that it was the Ministry of
Justice, rather than the commission, that requested these extensions to
the powers. Will the Minister please explain why, and why he believes
that they will be required in
practice?</div><a name="0811121000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
an era of political disfranchisement and unwillingness to get involved
in the political process, the last thing that we wish to do is
discourage donors. We must be careful to ensure that we do not
introduce legislation so broad that it tars everyone with the same
brush. We do not need another reason for members of the public to turn
their backs on political
parties.</div><a name="0811121000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision is also a disproportionately powerful tool to hand to the
commission. How does the Minister see the balance between its
enforcement role and the need to safeguard the public from arbitrary
state interference working in the paragraph that I mentioned? Can he
give hon. Members an idea of the number of people in the UK who would
be considered regulated donees and therefore fall within its
scope?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div><a name="0811121000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
evidence has the commission, or any other body, presented to the
Government to support the need for such a broad definition of those who
can be investigated? The impact of the change will clearly be to alter
the limited scope of the powers and apply them to a hugely larger
catchment group. Finally, what example can the Minister give of the
powers having been required in
practice?</div><a name="0811121000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000579"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Electoral Commission&#146;s view is that it
requires regulatory power over at least some regulated donees. I notice
that the provision is about donees rather than donors&#151;the people
receiving the money, not the people giving
it.</div><a name="0811121000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulated
donees are defined in the 2000 Act as members of a registered party, a
members&#146; association
or</div><a name="0811121000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
holder of a relevant elective
office&#148;.</div><a name="0811121000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
particular group that the Electoral Commission believes it needs
regulatory power over is the middle one, the members&#146;
association. Under the current law, a members&#146; association is
defined
as</div><a name="0811121000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
organisation whose membership consists wholly or mainly of members of a
registered party, other
than&#148;</div><a name="0811121000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">something
that is a party
itself.</div><a name="0811121000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a requirement to regulate registered donees and to have access to
their papers because otherwise it would be easy for sub-groups within
parties to be set up in such a way as to evade regulation. It is
perfectly reasonable for the Bill to extend the basic way in which
regulation happens to members&#146; associations. It was implied in
the comments of the Electoral Commission that the Government must
answer why it is also necessary to extend the same powers to individual
members of parties or individuals who hold elected
office.</div><a name="0811121000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
fact, those two cases might be different. There might be an argument
for the third category: those of us in the House, for example, who are
holders of elected office. I shall not refer to particular media items,
but it might be possible for donations to parties to take a route to an
individual hon. Member for help in his office or such matters. They
might otherwise have gone to the party, so perhaps there is a case to
answer in such instances. However, I am worried about the extension of
the powers to individual party members, which was the strongest point
made by the hon. Member for
Huntingdon.</div><a name="0811121000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
the amendment would go far too far. Under existing law, there is power
to require documents from registered donees. The Bill adds powers of
entry, which is what is worrying several people. The problem is that,
under the existing law, powers to require documents and powers of entry
are treated separately. The Bill puts them
together.</div><a name="0811121000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment would not only prevent the
extension of the law, but take the law away from where it is and reduce
the power of the commission over requiring documents. We should not do
that. It raises the matter that the commission mentioned, in that the
issue should be approached not through entering people&#146;s
premises on a warrant or on the say so of the regulator, but by going
instead down the route that it proposed of treating the whole thing as
a civil matter, whereby the commission goes to the court and asks for
an order requiring documents be produced.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div><a name="0811121000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was proposed that if the requirement was not obeyed, at that
point&#151;as a remedy for the failure to comply&#151;the court
could either hold the object of the law in contempt or further
authorise a search. There needs to be some regulation; there seems to
be over-inclusiveness in the schedule&#146;s drafting. I ask the
Government to look at the matter again&#151;not how the amendment
proposes, but more subtly than that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000580"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Independent review after independent review has
recommended that the Electoral Commission&#146;s powers should be
overhauled. It cannot be right, for example, that when someone has used
an agent to give money to a party, the Electoral Commission can require
information not from the original secret donor, but only from the
agent. The powers that we propose will allow the Electoral Commission
to investigate effectively and request information from all those who
have
it.</div><a name="0811121000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a case to be made for allowing the investigatory powers to apply to
regulated donees. However, of course I am aware of the concerns that
have been expressed here today, and elsewhere, by hon. Members about
the powers and their application to regulated donees. I am also aware
that the Electoral Commission has perhaps been reconsidering its
position&#151;we have had some communications, and I intend to
discuss the matter further with it and to reconsider carefully whether
the extension provided by the Bill is defensible. Given that the
commission has yet to use the power, the case for extending it may
still have to be
proven.</div><a name="0811121000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Colleagues
and Members of Parliament have expressed concerns. We need to seek the
advice of the regulatory body to see what it feels on the subject. When
we have had those further consultations with the Electoral Commission,
I shall respond to this point. However, I take up the invitation of the
hon. Member for Cambridge to reconsider those points of view. As we are
engaged in reconsidering the provision, I hope that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="0811121000221"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000584"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We shall now deal with a batch of several
amendments. Given the accusation about the commission&#146;s
passiveness in exercising its regulatory role, the amendments would
ensure that there was no ambiguity or discretionary element coming out
of the schedule, or would at least reduce
them.</div><a name="0811121000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 86, by removing any suggestion of discretion, would make it clear
to the commission and to the individuals or organisations covered by
the schedule what must be done to comply with it. The addition of
&#147;only&#148; would ensure that there was no ambiguity around
when a disclosure notice may be issued by the commission. That would
help to clarify the position for the commission and those subject to
the
provision.</div><a name="0811121000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the complexity of the schedule, certainty must be our objective,
thereby reducing the possibility of the provisions being breached by
administrative oversight or simple ignorance of the effect of
non-compliance.</div><a name="0811121000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 87 would include a specified time limit for the period in which an
officer of a party may be considered within the remit of the
Bill under clause 2. It is an important issue. We do not wish to see
individuals subject to disclosure notices for some long-forgotten
donation or action. It is unreasonable and impractical to extend the
power to cover actions taken or documents received at any point in
history when we are talking about people who mainly are volunteer
workers.</div><a name="0811121000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a practical level, the keeping of comprehensive records for more than
five years will be difficult to enforce and is unlikely to be achieved,
given the limited space that party officials often find themselves
working in. I am sure that a straw poll of hon. Members would find few
with full and comprehensive records for matters that occurred before
2002 that were also easily
accessible.</div><a name="0811121000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must be mindful of the financial and administrative burdens that we
place on those individuals and organisations, not to mention the
likelihood that many of the individuals concerned may have left such
offices, or even the country. The time limit of five years attempts to
achieve more than just nodding acquaintance with the normal term of
Government. I certainly hope, too, that where the commission is
planning on issuing such disclosure notices, it does so expediently and
well within the five-year limit proposed. If it does not, that will be
the fault of the commission, rather than the
individual.</div><a name="0811121000488"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="0811121000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendment No. 88, the need for &#147;reasonable suspicion&#148; by
the commission is a theme that will be seen in a number of my
amendments during the course of our debates on the Bill. Here I suggest
its insertion into paragraph 1(2) of schedule 1. We are dealing, as
always when we legislate, with the need to balance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>competing interests. On the one hand, the commission must be given
effective and workable powers of investigation that it can utilise in
its role as regulator and, on the other, party officials and
individuals must be allowed to go about their usual business without
fear of being arbitrarily subject to possible investigative whims of
the
commission.</div><a name="0811121000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have a legal system in the UK that operates on the principle of
innocent until proven guilty. The amendment would maintain that
principle and ensure that the commission operates within the rule of
the law. The concept of &#147;reasonable suspicion&#148; is seen
throughout the criminal and civil sanction regimes laid down by this
House over the years. It is a vital tool in ensuring that the agents of
the state do not have arbitrary powers to encroach on the lives and
activities of honest groups or individuals. It is a reminder to
agencies that they are not above the law, while providing an avenue for
redress for an individual who feels that they are subject to
unjustified and arbitrary state
persecution.</div><a name="0811121000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
courts of this country are familiar with the concept, so too are the
various regulatory bodies that operate to ensure compliance with the
law in the UK. I have not proposed the need for belief beyond
&#147;reasonable doubt&#148; as I believe that that may unduly
hinder the effectiveness of the commission. The test of reasonableness,
however, would not only safeguard the individual, but would focus the
mind of the commission when investigating alleged offences under the
Bill. Will the Minister tell hon. Members why such a safeguard was not
originally included in the
Bill?</div><a name="0811121000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 89 relates to sub-paragraph 1(2), which as it stands, is silent on
the method of service for disclosure notices. That could have difficult
practical implications for the effective workings of this new system.
Are we to accept that by simply posting a notice the commission can be
considered to have properly served such a notice? What of the situation
where the individual or group has moved address? I believe that the
service of such notices by hand is both the fairest and most proper way
of handling this current deficiency. I have neither seen nor heard from
the Minister any figures that would suggest that this would
place a disproportionately arduous burden on the commission, nor do I
believe it is unreasonable for the commission to serve disclosure
notices in such a way. How many does the Minister consider will be
handed out per year? Presumably, very few
indeed.</div><a name="0811121000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to grant the commission the power to enter premises and remove
documents, thus interrupting the lives of individuals, it is a matter
of due process, not to mention courtesy, that those individuals are
first, made aware of the investigation and secondly, have proper notice
of such an investigation and a disclosure notice, so that they may be
given the fullest amount of time to comply and avoid further
penalty.</div><a name="0811121000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
noted that I did not believe that service by hand would place an undue
burden on the commission. To support this I would like to draw hon.
Members&#146; attention to comments made by the Secretary of State
for Justice in the first evidence session before this Committee. In
response to questions I put to him he
said:</div><a name="0811121000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
answer is that, as at 16 June 2008, 29 people had been prosecuted under
the 2002 Act, resulting in 23
convictions.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Political Parties and Elections Public Bill Committee,</i> 4
November 2008; c. 18, Q38.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div><a name="0811121000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">By my calculations, that
is less than four prosecutions on average for each of the years that
the commission has been operating. Unless the Minister has evidence to
suggest that many more disclosure notices will be issued by the
commission in the years following the enactment of this Bill, I believe
that service by hand, when balanced against the severity of the
penalties for none compliance, is fair. Amendment No. 90 is
consequential.</div>
<a name="0811121000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
91, dealing with paragraph 1(3), would ring fence the powers of the
commission and concentrate them only on investigations of offences
under the Bill. The amendment would remove the ability for the
commission to use this power in relation to &#147;any of its
functions&#148;, which is an unnecessary and unjustified extension.
The commission&#146;s functions under PPERA have been the focus of
many reviews by a multitude of different organisations. Indeed, we are
here today because the commission&#146;s previous functions were
deemed too wide and therefore were hampering its ability to effectively
undertake its role as a regulator. Part I of PPERA contains 21 sections
and two schedules that expressly set out the functions of the
commission.</div>
<a name="0811121000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are we to
believe that the Government intend these powers to extend to the
commission&#146;s multiple roles? Or rather are they to be used only
in relation to their investigation of offences under the Bill? I hope
very much, for the sake of all of those who act in some capacity that
brings them into contact with political penalties or donations, that it
is the former. Otherwise, the balance will have been tipped
unnecessarily in favour of the commission. We would hand it powers that
it not only does not need, but would not use.</div>
<a name="0811121000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Government see that the breadth of the sub-paragraph as it
currently stands is very wide. As an aside, would the Minister please
confirm that the existing powers of investigation in PPERA will be
terminated by the Bill so that there is no duplication of powers, which
could&#151;inadvertently, I am sure&#151;be used to give the
commission a second bite of the
cherry?</div><a name="0811121000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 92 deals with paragraph 1(3). I would like to reiterate points made
by Sir Hayden Phillips. In the first evidence session before this
Committee, he said that he hoped we would be able to find amendments
that would make everyone comfortable that the powers are not excessive.
I fear that without a right of appeal, which I propose in the
amendment, we are handing the commission a mandate to serve disclosure
notices on individuals and groups associated to political parties in
the manner of a fishing exercise. Without a right to appeal, there is
nothing to prevent the commission from simply trawling the records of
such people in the hope of finding an inconsistency on which it could
build an
investigation.</div><a name="0811121000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not suggesting that that would take place with the current
commission, which has been co-operative throughout the development of
the Bill, including with the official Opposition, but we are
legislating for future generations that will not have been privy to the
many discussions and debates that have surrounded it. As such, we must
ensure that we minimise opportunity or flexibility that would leave the
powers open to abuse in years to come. By having a right of appeal as
set out in the amendment, we would, in effect, have a self-policing
safeguard that would require no additional cost to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>borne by the commission. Furthermore, given the 14-day time frame, it
would not produce unnecessary delay to
investigations.</div><a name="0811121000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 93 deals with paragraph 1(4). It returns to my concern that many
aspects of the Bill are so broad that they could be rendered almost
unworkable in practice. Compliance in a &#147;reasonable time&#148;
is too subjective a concept. One man&#146;s reasonable may be
another&#146;s unnecessarily harsh or overly lenient. Elements of
subjectivity in time-keeping should not have a place in a Bill such as
this. Clarity and certainty are needed. The amendment would work to the
ultimate benefit of all parties
involved.</div><a name="0811121000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
28 days recommended in our amendment should be sufficient for those
served with a disclosure notice to locate the documents and information
specified in it. Given the penalties that may be faced for
non-compliance, every effort should be made to ensure that individuals
do not fall foul of them because of unforeseen delays. Illness,
temporary IT problems, personnel on holiday or any number of other
eventualities may prevent documents or information from being submitted
to the
commission.</div><a name="0811121000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would caution against over-zealous application of the limit by the
commission. Co-operation is the easiest and simplest way to resolve
most causes of a breach of the provisions of the Act, and the
commission should not be too quick to take punitive action. I hope that
the Government will see the value in what I have said, and I welcome
the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="0811121000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000585"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I have a great deal of sympathy with what the
hon. Member for Huntingdon said towards the end of his remarks,
especially about amendment No. 93, which would add to the clarity of
the schedule. I hope that the Minister has some explanation as to why
the system at present operates on the basis simply of
&#147;reasonable
time&#148;.</div><a name="0811121000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also have some sympathy with amendment No. 92, which would insert an
appeal mechanism. That is necessary if we are not to go down the route
that the commission suggested of having it go to the court in the first
place to ask for enforcement of a disclosure
notice.</div><a name="0811121000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I would like to spend a minute or two on amendments Nos. 88 to 91, with
which I am less comfortable. They tend to conflate two different
functions of the commission. It may well be the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument that the commission should have only one function, and that he
is trying to get rid of the other
one.</div><a name="0811121000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
two functions are inspection, and the investigation of offences. Of
course, a body that has an inspection power will, ultimately, need some
criminal law sanction, or some sanction, to enforce it. Nevertheless,
the main point is that it is not the criminal law, or taking people to
court to prosecute them for non-compliance, but the inspection itself
that gets the compliance. The idea is that transparency, openness,
information and audit all add together to produce compliance with the
law&#151;whereas investigatory powers of the second sort are more
like what the police or prosecution authorities do.</div>
<a name="0811121000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment
Nos. 88 to 91, the hon. Gentleman is trying to remove the difference
between those two. He is treating the Electoral Commission purely as a
prosecution authority&#151;as if it were the Serious Fraud Office or
the DPP. I do not think that that is appropriate. A regulatory body
needs tools other than prosecution to get compliance. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>The tool available to it&#151;inspection backed by sanctions&#151;is
an appropriate and better tool for what it has to do. I fear that the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach will have the opposite effect to the
one he wants: it will make the commission more like a hard criminal
prosecutor and less like a regulator. His approach will encourage the
kind of attitude that those who read news stories about the
commission&#146;s activities have: that those involved in politics
are the kind of people who commit criminal offences, as opposed to
merely being the kind of people who need to be
audited.</div><a name="0811121000257"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000586"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The hon. Members for Huntingdon and for Cambridge
have made useful contributions; I am grateful to them. Many detailed
issues were raised and I shall run through the amendments more or less
in order&#151;although I am afraid I will have to resist all of
them.</div><a name="0811121000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 86 is unnecessary. It seeks to limit the extent of the
commission&#146;s investigatory powers under paragraph 1(2) of
schedule 1 to the Bill. The effect of the amendment would be that the
commission would only be able to issue a disclosure notice either to a
treasurer or an officer of an organisation to which paragraph 1
applies, or to an individual to which paragraph 1 applies&#151;in
other words, regulated individuals. That is the effect of paragraph
1(2) anyway, so the amendment is unnecessary. The limitation in
paragraph in 1(2) will have no effect on the use of paragraph 2, which
is a separate power to which separate limitations set out in the Bill
apply. The commission needs a cross-party consensus to become a more
effective regulator. If it is going to do that, it needs more
appropriate investigatory powers and the clause as drafted does that
without straying too far. For that reason, the amendment is unnecessary
and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw
it.</div><a name="0811121000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am afraid that I will also have to resist amendment No. 87 because it
seeks to place a time limit on the commission&#146;s powers to issue
a disclosure notice under paragraph 1(2). The effect of amendment No.
87 would be that the commission would only be able to issue a
disclosure notice to a person who has been a treasurer or another
officer of an organisation to which paragraph 1 applies in the past
five years. Currently, the commission can issue a disclosure notice to
any person who is, or who has been the treasurer or another registered
officer to which this paragraph applies, or an individual to which this
paragraph applies. There is no time limit in relation to
that.</div><a name="0811121000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
it seems unlikely that in most cases, the commission will need to go
back in time more than five years, we cannot entirely rule out that
possibility. Given that the commission will have to exercise its powers
reasonably, which is in line with the general principles of public law,
before making a request under paragraph 1, we do not think that such a
constraint needs to be put in the Bill. I therefore hope that the hon.
Gentleman does not press the
amendment.</div><a name="0811121000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall deal with amendment Nos. 88 and 91 together and at some length
because they raise important questions that I know are of general
concern to the Committee and hon. Members more widely. Both amendments
seek to limit the extent of the commission&#146;s investigatory
powers. Although the amendments are clearly well intentioned&#151;and
we are grateful to the hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>for the spirit in which he is proposing them&#151;they, nevertheless,
suggest a misunderstanding about the different purposes of the powers
set out under paragraph 1 and those set out under paragraphs 2 and 3.
If there is such a misunderstanding, I hope that it will be helpful to
the Committee if I set out the different purposes of those powers and
the interplay between them. The hon. Member for Cambridge may have been
alluding to that in his
remarks.</div><a name="0811121000489"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="0811121000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
1 of the new schedule restates, with some changes, powers that the
commission has in relation to registered parties and others
that are contained in section 146 of the 2000 Act. Under section 146(3)
of that Act, the commission has powers to enter premises and take
copies of information relating to income and expenditure from a
registered political party, a recognised third party and a permitted
participant in a referendum. That power under the Act can be exercised
by the commission for the purposes of carrying out its function. At
present, the power to enter premises does not apply to election agents
or candidates in an election&#151;except candidates at a local
election in Scotland.</div>
<a name="0811121000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
commission currently has powers under section 146(1) to require the
disclosure of documents relating to income and expenditure from
election agents or candidates. The Bill repeats the existing power to
enter in paragraph 1(5) of proposed schedule 19A, which is to be
inserted into the 2000 Act by schedule 1 to the Bill. It also extends
it to candidates&#151;other than candidates in Scottish local
government elections&#151;election agents, regulated donees,
including MPs, and regulated participants. The result of that is that
the original power in the 2000 Act for the commission to enter premises
for the purpose of carrying out its functions will now apply to
election agents and candidates, alongside the other individuals
and organisations listed in paragraph 1(1) of schedule 19A.</div>
<a name="0811121000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 2 of
the schedule seeks to provide new powers for the commission when it
undertakes an investigation into a suspected breach of the 2000 Act. To
that end, the Bill provides the commission with new powers to request
information, to put questions and to apply for a warrant to enable it
to enter premises when carrying out an investigation into a suspected
offence or other contravention of the 2000 Act. Those powers can be
applied to election agents and candidates who have such information in
the same way that they may apply to anyone
else.</div><a name="0811121000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;this
is crucial to addressing the concerns of many hon. Members in Committee
and in the House more generally&#151;we have also introduced a number
of important safeguards for the use of such new powers. In relation to
the entry of premises under this new power, the commission will need to
apply for a warrant under paragraph 3 of proposed schedule 19A. There
is no automatic right of entry. For a warrant to be issued, the
commission must demonstrate on oath to a justice of the peace that it
has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been
committed&#151;or that another contravention of the 2000 Act has
occurred. It must also establish that documents are on the premises
that were withheld following an earlier request or that are otherwise
relevant to the investigation. When entering the premises,
commissioners must be accompanied at all times by a
constable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div><a name="0811121000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to limit the extent of the commission&#146;s
investigatory powers under paragraph 1(2) and (3) of the schedule. The
effect of amendment No. 88 would be that the commission would
be able to issue a disclosure notice only to a treasurer or officer of
an organisation to which paragraph 1 applies, or an individual to which
paragraph 1 applies, such as regulated
individuals.</div><a name="0811121000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would impact on the powers of the commission in paragraph 2 of the
schedule to require any person, including a regulated individual listed
in paragraph 1, to produce documents or information that it reasonably
requires to investigate suspected offences or contraventions. That
would seriously hamper the commission&#146;s ability to investigate
suspected breaches or contraventions in conjunction with relevant
prosecuting
authorities.</div><a name="0811121000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of amendment No. 91 would be to restrict circumstances in which
the commission can issue a disclosure notice so that it could do so
only when it has formed a reasonable suspicion that an offence has been
committed under the Act. Currently, the commission can issue a
disclosure notice seeking information or documents relating to the
income or expenditure of the organisation or individual in
question that it reasonably requires for the purposes of
carrying out its
functions.</div><a name="0811121000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers set out in paragraph 1 are supervisory powers and we believe
that the commission should be able to use those powers to determine
whether regulated individuals are complying with regulatory
requirements. To restrict that power to circumstances in which the
commission has formed a suspicion that an offence has been
committed&#151;as is required under paragraph 2&#151;would
unnecessarily restrict the commission&#146;s ability to carry out its
supervisory and monitoring functions. I, therefore, hope that the hon.
Members will not press the
amendment.</div><a name="0811121000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
I shall have to resist amendment No. 89, too. It would
require a disclosure notice served under paragraph 1(2) of proposed
schedule 19A to the 2000 Act to be served by hand by a person
specifically authorised by the commission to do so. I understand the
points made by the hon. Gentleman, but we cannot give him any
information about how often the power will be used because we do not
know that. However, it is likely that the relatively small number of
occasions it was used between 2000 and 2008 will increase because, at
that point, the commission did not have investigatory powers. How
burdensome it would be to the commission is therefore impossible to
say, but the case for resisting the amendment does not rest only on the
fact that it would be
burdensome.</div><a name="0811121000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Serving
notices by hand is unnecessary. There are other ways in which to serve
notices, which would remove the risk of such action being a burden on
the commission. Moreover, it is important that the hon. Gentleman
considers that serving the documents by hand might also create an
opportunity to allow those to whom the commission intends to give a
disclosure notice to obstruct the receipt of that notice in a way, for
example, that delivery by recorded delivery or registered post does
not. Such methods of delivery do not give the same opportunities. In
light of my explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press
the
amendment.</div><a name="0811121000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sadly,
I shall have to resist amendment No. 90 as well. It would allow a
disclosure notice issued by the commission to require the production of
documents or information rather than any documents, as the Bill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>currently provides. The amendment&#146;s effect is already
achieved by paragraph 1(3)(b) of proposed
schedule 19A to the 2000 Act. It provides for a disclosure
notice to require the person to whom it is given to provide the
commission with information. The amendment is unnecessary as it would
not add to the effect of the Bill. I therefore hope again that the hon.
Gentleman will not press
it.</div><a name="0811121000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
resist amendment No. 92. It would allow a person served with a
disclosure notice to appeal to the commission in writing within 14 days
of receipt of service under paragraph (2A), which the amendment would
insert. A disclosure notice is essentially a request for information
requiring the person to whom it is given to produce for inspection by
the commission any documents that relate to income and expenditure of
regulated individuals and organisations, and that are reasonably
required by the commission for the purposes of carrying out its
functions. The commission is best placed to decide whether it is
necessary to issue such a request, and it would slow down the progress
of investigation considerably if each notice were accompanied by a
right of
appeal.</div><a name="0811121000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
a disclosure notice is not a sanction, we do not believe than an
appeals process is necessary. It would be open to individuals who feel
that they have a reasonable excuse not to comply with a disclosure
notice because, for example, they do not hold any of the requested
documents, to provide the commission with an explanation of why that is
the case. In subsequent proceedings in respect of an offence for
refusing to comply, any such explanation would have to be taken into
account by the commission or, indeed, by a court. I hope that, in light
of that reassurance, the hon. Gentleman will not press that amendment,
too.</div><a name="0811121000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come now to amendment No. 92, which the Committee may be relieved to
hear is the final amendment in this group. It requires those served
with a disclosure notice by the commission to comply within 28 days.
Under the Bill, they would currently be required to comply within such
reasonable time as is specified under the notice. I agree that those
who receive a disclosure notice need to be given time to comply with
it, and that they need to know the length of the period. That is why
the Bill provides for a disclosure notice to specify a
&#147;reasonable&#148; time within which the person served with the
notice must comply. To that extent, there is
certainty.</div><a name="0811121000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been some discussion about whether &#147;reasonable&#148; is
sufficiently certain. We would argue that the flexibility that the term
gives is appropriate, because the commission should have discretion to
vary the period for compliance depending on the nature of
the requests, which may be various. We believe this more flexible
formulation is appropriate as, in some instances, the commission will
need to allow a longer period&#151;for example, for the production or
provision of documents in some circumstances, such as if there is a
large number of them. Equally, a request might be time-critical,
particularly if there was concern that the success of an investigation
might be under threat if not obtained
speedily.</div><a name="0811121000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
term &#147;reasonable&#148; is in common usage and, for example,
the courts have not had much difficulty in interpreting it. In the
light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not
press that amendment as well.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000587"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> As Members will have noticed, this batch of
amendments has taken quite a long time to run through. The amendments
are technical by nature, but we are covering new ground here and making
new laws. This is the first sitting of several in this House and
several in the other place, and it is very helpful that the Minister
has given full answers and fully considered the amendments, because
that will make both stages on the Bill more productive as a result. To
the extent that there was a lot of information, I shall be going away
and having a careful look at what he said
today.</div><a name="0811121000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000588"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Because the hon. Gentleman will so generously
consider what I said, I want to add one answer. He raised an important
question about giving the commission a second bite at the cherry, which
I regret that I inadvertently failed to address. The Bill would not
allow that, and nor would it allow more than one sanction to be applied
for the same offence. I hope that gives him some
reassurance.</div><a name="0811121000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000589"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That is a very helpful clarification. In
relation to his latter point, I shall be covering that again through
one of my other amendments, so I must revisit
that.</div><a name="0811121000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
took the point of the hon. Member for Cambridge that some of the
amendments could have the implication of making the clause more
criminal in nature, therefore making it less adaptable and
user-friendly as a proportionate and varied approach from the
commission. I shall look at our amendments again in that light, because
that is an important point. Of course, the first line for the
commission would be to approach people without any criminal or civil
penalties whatsoever&#151;just approaching people for information,
which is probably the best way to get
it.</div><a name="0811121000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment.</div><a name="0811121000283"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000592"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Amendment No. 94 is moved on a probing basis, to
delete paragraph 1(5) of schedule 1, which empowers the commission to
enter premises to carry out what is stated as its function under PPERA.
Given the vagueness of the provision, we are keen for the Minister to
justify fully the need for the powers. From Government amendment No.
122 and their consecutive amendment, it would seem as if they will make
some concessions in this area and we look forward to hearing the
Minister.</div><a name="0811121000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we have significant concerns about the proposals for powers of entry
for the Electoral Commission. The commission already has powers of
entry into political parties&#146; offices, under PPERA. Paragraph 3
of schedule 1 extends that to provide powers of entry into the premises
of anyone who has donated to a political party or regulated donee. That
has the potential to erode the willingness of law-abiding citizens to
donate to political parties. It would take only one heavy-handed use of
the powers in someone&#146;s home or office for other legitimate
donors to take fright at the prospect of giving money to political
parties. Last October, in a speech at the university of Westminster,
the Prime Minister pledged to curtail powers of entry with a new
liberty test. I gave details of that in my earlier
remarks.</div><a name="0811121000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
part of Lord West&#146;s review into powers of entry, the Home Office
estimated the powers of entry that are in force. I have voiced my
concerns on that issue in a previous debate. A study of state powers of
entry by the Centre for Policy Studies, last year,
warned:</div><a name="0811121000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
many cases, discretion as to what is considered as reasonable behaviour
in exercising an entry power is left to the judgment of those wielding
the entry power...Many powers are drafted so broadly that the
citizen has little or no protection if officials behave officiously or
vindictively. Some carry draconian penalties for obstruction, including
heavy fines and prison sentences of up to two
years.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is with that in mind that I proposed my amendments in an attempt to
insert some statutory safeguards into the
schedule.</div>
<a name="0811121000490"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="0811121000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
amendment No. 94 fails and paragraph 1(5) remains in the schedule, it
would need to be amended. Amendment No. 95 would insert into paragraph
1(5) a higher threshold test for the commission to satisfy before it
could enter premises. A high value is necessary to prevent a fear among
small party donors that a bequest in a will, or a cheque for a friend
who is running as a candidate in an election, might result in their
home or office being invaded by the commission. The amendment would
focus the commission&#146;s mind on the abuses and offences that are
the most flagrant contraventions not only of the Bill, but of the
spirit of transparent party funding. This is a question of balance, but
at the moment there is no balance.</div>
<a name="0811121000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
95 would operate a secondary safeguard. Once the commission had
satisfied what I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>will call the threshold value test of &#163;10,000, it would have to
prove that it had reasonable grounds for believing that an offence had
occurred. It would then have to formulate its arguments and
investigations into a cohesive submission to the justice of the peace
when applying for a warrant. The idea of entry powers being given to
investigate donations of a few pounds is bizarre, if not
excessive.</div><a name="0811121000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 96 concerns the point of entry and goes together with the
safeguards envisaged in amendment No. 95. It provides that entry would
have to be authorised by a warrant, and that a police constable would
have to be present to ensure that the commission acted within the law.
The constable would also provide vital assistance to those acting on
behalf of the commission in entering premises. We have no wish to
create a cadre of have-a-go heroes under the auspices of the
commission. We see the use of powers of entry as the last option
available to the commission. Their use should be the nuclear option, to
be used when all attempts to elicit the required information, or to
co-operate with the individual or group suspected of an offence, have
failed. Does the Minister share that view, or does he think that they
will be used pre-emptively?</div>
<a name="0811121000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such
circumstances, the owner of the premises might not co-operate.
Amendment No. 98 would make provision for the use of reasonable force.
In drafting those powers, I have attempted to safeguard the commission,
the property and its owner, so that only the accompanying police
constable would be able to use such force. There is no need for the
commission directly to have such powers. That is the police&#146;s
role, and I hesitate to provide anyone else with such powers. Given the
unlikelihood of that last resort being used often, I see no practical
difficulty in requiring the commission to act in that fashion. Does the
Minister agree that such powers of entry would, and should, be used
only in a few exceptional cases?</div>
<a name="0811121000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate
that we have only just received Government amendments Nos. 122 and 123,
so I have not given them a huge amount of thought. I certainly have not
had the chance to consult on them. We think that they pick up on the
comments of Peter Wardle, the chief executive of the commission, in our
evidence session of Thursday 6 November. When discussing the
commission&#146;s current monitoring and inspection powers, he noted
that they were typically used to run audits on the documents and
records of bodies that receive policy development grants. That came
about from a need to assure Parliament that such funds were being spent
in an appropriate manner and in accordance with the terms of the grant.
He
said:</div><a name="0811121000473"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That
is inspection and audit; we do it already and we think that the current
powers are adequate for
that.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government seem to have taken to heart what he went on to say, and that
is to be welcomed in light of the Bill&#146;s other deficiencies and
the tight time frame in which it is being rushed through. Peter
Wardle&#146;s succinct comments give some understanding of the
Government&#146;s rationale behind the amendments. He
said:</div><a name="0811121000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
feel that the current powers are adequate to do the job we need to do
regarding inspection. One can see why, for completeness, the powers
have been extended, but we are not convinced that we need those powers.
If Parliament were to have concerns about that particular aspect, we
would be relaxed provided that the current powers are preserved so that
we can continue our inspection and monitoring
role.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Political
Parties and Elections Public Bill Committee, </i>6 November 2008; c.
43, Q104.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div><a name="0811121000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what the
Government seem to be attempting with this amendment; they have limited
the right of entry under paragraph 1(5) to only the commission&#146;s
role as an auditor/inspector of financial documents. We welcome this
moment of clarity from the Government and support their main principles
and rationale in this regard. Indeed, this amendment echoes the
sentiment of many of our own amendments relating to the
schedule.</div><a name="0811121000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
many ways, amendment No. 97 can be read in line with amendments Nos.
95, 96 and 98. The schedule makes much reference to those people
&#147;authorised by the Commission&#148;. In fact, almost all the
powers granted to the commission under the schedule are also available
to those individuals, yet we can find no reference in the Bill to a
definition of who they are. Perhaps the Minister can assist me with
this. My amendment No. 97 to paragraph 1(5) proposes solving that
problem by specifying who may be authorised by the commission to
exercise these powers. I have deliberately limited those powers to
high-level employees of the commission, at least, and left it marginal
in respect of who else should be included and why. Given that these
powers of entry are unlikely to be used in all but the most extreme
cases, it is justifiable to expect the commission to send an individual
from management. Doing so would ensure that both the commission and the
owner of the property take such a person, and their on-the-ground
assessment,
seriously.</div><a name="0811121000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not wish the commission to send people, such as its cleaning staff,
for instance, to raid premises. Furthermore, given the seriousness of
the exercise of this power, the ability simply to authorise anyone is
not only worrying but would call into question the commission&#146;s
integrity.</div><a name="0811121000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000593"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The debate on these amendments comes back to the
distinction, which I was trying to make in the previous debate, between
the commission&#146;s powers of inspection and its powers in respect
of the investigation of criminal offences. The Government are now
offering, in amendment No. 123, greater clarity in distinguishing
between the two, making it clear that the powers laid out in schedule
1(1) may not be used as investigative powers when investigating a
criminal offence. That clearly separates the two. It therefore follows
that the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Huntingdon, which
talk about the sum at issue&#151;amendment No. 95, for
example&#151;are no longer relevant, because the inspection power is
not to do with amounts of money at stake in respect of an offence, but
with ensuring that people are complying with more general requirements.
Nevertheless, his other points still
apply.</div><a name="0811121000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government still want there to be a power of entry for the purpose
of inspection, they have to think through precisely how that is going
to work. What the hon. Gentleman said about ensuring that constables
are there, that the powers are clear and that officials of a civil
regulator are not resisted with force is still pertinent. The
Government need to think that
through.</div><a name="0811121000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
generally, the Government need to think through what the purpose is of
having a power of entry for an inspector. Precisely why do we need
inspectors to have powers of entry and under what circumstances, when
they are not investigating offences? This brings us back to the point
that the hon. Gentleman made about the Electoral Commission&#146;s
not being entirely enthusiastic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>about having these powers and not seeing a great deal of benefit in
them. If it is to have such powers, they need to be in more of a civil
than a criminal context. If there were a clear link in the system
between the failure to disclose a document following a reasonable
request by the commission, and a power of entry at some point after
that because of failure to comply, that could be justified. However, at
the moment I see no link between the process for requesting disclosure
and the power of entry, which seems to appear out of nowhere. I ask the
Government to reconsider sub-paragraph (5). As the hon. Gentleman said,
amendment No. 94 is a probing amendment; nevertheless, this aspect of
the Bill needs to be
reconsidered.</div><a name="0811121000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000594"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We welcome these probing amendments. We will have
to resist them all, but the fact that we have tabled Government
amendments on this issue shows that we are conscious of the need to get
it right and to be flexible in doing so. We are not prepared to render
the Electoral Commission ineffective, however, particularly as we are
expanding and intensifying its role as a regulator. We must ensure that
in doing that, we give it effective
powers.</div><a name="0811121000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are prepared to respond to concerns. The hon. Member for Huntingdon
asked me directly whether we can expect the powers to be used rarely,
and the answer is yes. I want to put it on the record that the
commission should use them with great care. However, is it important
that they exist, not least as a backstop and a deterrent to behaviour
that none of us wants to take
place.</div><a name="0811121000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall go through the amendments in order. Amendment No. 94 would delete
paragraph 1(5) of schedule 1, which essentially restates the
commission&#146;s existing powers in relation to supervised
individuals. Those powers allow it to enter premises occupied by
specified individuals to inspect documents relating to their income and
expenditure, at any reasonable time, for the purpose of carrying out
its
functions.</div><a name="0811121000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 95 and 96 would amend the same powers of entry to make them
applicable only in connection with an investigation involving more than
&#163;10,000, and exercisable only with a warrant and accompanied by
a constable. The material difference between that power and the version
in the 2000 Act is the range of individuals to whom it may apply. Most
notably, the Bill extends the commission&#146;s powers to cover
regulated donees&#151;Members of the House and of political parties,
as well as candidates, their agents and permitted participants at
referendums.</div>
<a name="0811121000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">That extension
is being made to ensure that the commission can routinely access all
the information that it needs to exercise its functions. The key thrust
of the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#146;s 2007 report,
which was instrumental in the genesis of the Bill, was that the
commission is currently not equipped to fulfil its role. More recent
events have also brought that to the fore. It has a general function of
monitoring compliance with the rules governing elections and politics
in this country, and we must not lose sight of the importance of that
role. Public confidence in the probity of our political system rests in
large part on the faith that scrutiny can command. It is vital that the
commission be able to access all the information that it needs to
monitor compliance with the rules.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div><a name="0811121000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, real concerns have been expressed in Committee today and on
Second Reading about the extent of that power and the intention behind
it. We have already indicated our intention to move on the issue, and I
am willing to listen further. However, we need to remember that if the
commission did not have such a power of entry, it would be entirely
lawful to refuse to admit the commission if it sought to inspect party
records on party premises. There would be no negative consequence of
that for the party concerned, and such a backward step would be
seriously detrimental to the transparency and scrutiny of our political
system. To remove the power at the very point when we are refocusing
the commission on its monitoring role would send out the wrong message
and deprive it of a potentially important tool in performing that
role.</div><a name="0811121000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would constrain the commission&#146;s existing powers of
entry and make them almost identical to the powers in paragraph 3 of
the schedule that apply in relation to suspected offences. We believe
that that would be a similarly backward step. As I explained earlier,
it is vital that the commission be able to access the information that
it needs to supervise those whom it regulates. Any credible regulator
must have those powers, and it does. It is similarly vital that, where
the commission has reason to believe that an offence or other breach of
the rules has been committed, it can look into it thoroughly and
effectively. Without that power of entry, it would be wholly reliant on
law enforcement agencies for investigations, and that would make it
impotent in the face of apparent wrongdoing. Merging the two powers and
constraining both by the need for a reasonable belief of an offence,
together with the need for a warrant and the accompaniment of a
constable, would not work in practice. The two powers are for different
purposes and, rightly, they are differently
constituted.</div><a name="0811121000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 97 would require a person entering premises under the power in
paragraph 1 to be either a manager at the Electoral Commission or a
police
officer.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000595"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b><b class="B"> </b>The Minister appears to distinguish in this
matter between everything and nothing. This is not a debate about
everything and nothing. In amendment No. 97, it is about
&#163;10,000. However, it need not be that amount&#151;it could be
&#163;5,000 or &#163;500. I am trying to obtain some kind of
explanation that takes account of different scales rather than just yes
and no.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000596"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am sorry if I have not made this clear. I hoped
that I was saying that we realise people&#146;s concerns. We have
indicated that we are prepared to listen to them, and I am happy to go
on meeting concerns as best we can. However, I am not prepared to
remove the powers. It is not everything or nothing. We are prepared to
be flexible about how those powers are exercised. We have already
proposed certain safeguards, we are proposing more and we are happy to
listen to other suggestions. Nevertheless, we must ensure that the
commission remains an effective regulator. That is all I am saying. If
the hon. Gentleman thinks that we should be flexible about how we make
the regulation effective, I am happy to enter into a dialogue about
that. We have already done so, and I will continue doing so. I hope
that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000597"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I welcome the Minister&#146;s response. The
problem is that somebody can be done for having 7s 6d in their pocket
at home. I am trying to understand what would require the commissioners
to investigate and make a distinction between those with 7s 6d in their
pocket and those with &#163;15,000. If there is no difference, the
commissioner must get on with it. He has the law. The law, it seems to
me, is an open and shut case. The Minister is saying that every
opportunity will be given to the commissioners to make the decisions.
That is what is wrong.</div>
<a name="0811121000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000598"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am not altogether following the hon. Gentleman.
Perhaps he could refer to the amendment that he is talking about. I am
sorry if I am missing his point; perhaps he could be a little more
specific.</div>
<a name="0811121000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000599"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am talking about amendment No. 95. When someone
says, &#147;You have 7s 6d in your pocket&#148;, the same powers
are being used as in the case of a man who has &#163;10,000 in his
pocket. What is making that person exercise the powers if it is not the
scale of the things in the pocket?</div>
<a name="0811121000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000600"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am still not altogether clear about it, but in so
far as the hon. Gentleman mentions 7s 6d and all the rest, that will be
a question of judgment for the commission. It is a matter of
proportionality. I am not sure that I entirely follow his concerns, but
if he would like to convey them to me afterwards, I would be happy to
engage with him and try to reassure him.</div>
<a name="0811121000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout, we
have tried to strike a balance. As I said at the beginning of my
remarks on this, we have to strike a balance between not putting
disproportionate burdens on people who are often volunteers and taking
a proportionate response to the offences being committed. At the same
time, we must be cognisant of the point raised by the hon. Member for
Cambridge at the start of his opening remarks that, as politicians, we
cannot exclude ourselves from the kind of regulatory constraints to
which people in other public bodies are rightly subject. It is a
question of proportion and balance. We think that we are trying to
strike the right balance in the application of these
powers.</div><a name="0811121000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I was saying, amendment No. 97 requires a person who enters premises
under the paragraph 1 power to either be a manager at the Electoral
Commission or a police officer. Authorisation of the use of this power
by a manger at the commission would, in practice, be embedded in the
commission&#146;s operation of the power. It is set out in statute
that an entry could only be carried out by a senior member of staff in
that context and could be restrictive and inflexible. In carrying out
its duties, the commission must effectively have the ability to
delegate entry and inspection duties to staff below such a senior
level.</div><a name="0811121000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is not currently a definition of &#147;manager&#148; in the
statute. It might be difficult to interpret what grade of employee
would be capable of using the power. Structures within the Electoral
Commission might change over time and we think that that is an
unnecessary inflexibility. The commission has no intention of using
this power lightly. It is well aware that entering a premises is a
significant step. We believe that it will operate the power
responsibly, as it has done with the existing power to date. It is
worth reminding the Committee again that the commission has had these
powers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div><a name="0811121000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000601"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It might be helpful if the Minister could
describe what he thinks an entry situation would involve&#151;what
would actually happen?</div>
<a name="0811121000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000602"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With respect, I will not pre-empt the judgment of
the Electoral Commission on that. However, I shall say one other thing.
I know that the Conservative party wants to abolish the Human Rights
Act 1998, but if Conservative Members were to listen to my words, they
may have cause to revisit it. Article 8 of that Act gives valuable
protections in precisely these circumstances. That is why it is a good
bit of legislation and why we hope, in time, the Conservative party
will come to realise its value.</div>
<a name="0811121000326"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811121000603"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): I thought
the Minister was saying that politicians ought to be treated equally in
these amendments and the clause more widely. Is it not the case that
the Electoral Commission would not be able to enter the House of
Commons and raid an MP&#146;s office and that they would not be able
to go into the House of Lords, unless the Member was perhaps based in 4
Millbank, which is not formally part of the parliamentary estate? If
that were the case, their office could be raided. Is that not an
inconsistency?</div><a name="0811121000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000604"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> My point related to that made by the hon. Member
for Cambridge: we should not seek to remove ourselves from the general
constraints to which other people in public life have rightly been
subject. That was the general point. In relation to the particular
application of the powers, he has rightly identified some issues. As I
said earlier, the subject of the susceptibility of MPs to the
legislation is an area we are considering at the moment and that we
will continue to explore.</div>
<a name="0811121000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
we are making some progress. Amendment No. 98 provides that no force
can be used by the commission in its use of power of entry in paragraph
1. That is already the case. If the commission were to be authorised to
use force to gain entry to premises, that fact would need to be set out
in statute. In the absence of such a statement, it follows that the
commission cannot use such force. That is evident in the statement
given in paragraph 3(3) that a police constable may use</div>
<a name="0811121000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such force as is
reasonably
necessary&#148;.</div><a name="0811121000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
that wording in the paragraph 1 power, no force can be used to gain
entry to premises.</div>
<a name="0811121000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000605"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the Minister therefore saying that a
constable would have to be present for the power of entry to be
exercised? I think that was the implication of what he just
said.</div><a name="0811121000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000606"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b><b class="B"> </b>If force were to be used. The commission
cannot use force under the Bill to effect entry. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will not press the amendment on the basis that it is not
necessary.</div>
<a name="0811121000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000607"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am not sure whether the Minister is saying
that, as it stands, the schedule implies that the commission can call
on a constable to help it enter premises using force. In fact, some
case law suggests that that might be possible. Alternatively, is the
right hon. Gentleman saying that the schedule does not authorise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>anyone to use force to enter premises?
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Mention has been made from a
sedentary position of paragraph 3(3). The trouble is that that is about
investigatory powers and Government amendment No. 123 would separate
what is stated under that paragraph from what is stated under paragraph
1. We need more clarity about how the proposals would work
together.</div><a name="0811121000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000608"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> If the commission were authorised to use force, it
would have to say so under the Bill. It does not, so it follows
therefore that it cannot. However, a police constable may use force. I
hope that I have made the position more clear, and that the hon.
Gentleman accepts that the amendment is not
necessary.</div><a name="0811121000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000609"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the Minister saying that, if a constable is
not taken along, and the commission is not allowed in if it turns up at
the premises, it has to go away again? Does that mean that it will have
to go to the premises with a
constable?</div><a name="0811121000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000610"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> It would depend on the circumstances. If force is
necessary, there would have to be a warrant and a constable may use
such reasonable force as is necessary. That is the point. The
commission is not authorised to use force. It would not necessarily
have to go to the premises. Some things could be
consensual.</div><a name="0811121000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000611"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the Minister saying that the power would
normally be used pre-emptively? Will he say how it is likely to be
used?</div><a name="0811121000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000612"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I will resist
the temptation to speculate on how the Electoral Commission might, in
individual circumstances, seek to use the power. As I have explained,
we want to give it the power as a backstop, should it be necessary for
it to use it. We also hope that it will be a deterrent and encourage
people to comply with regulations, and not give the commission any
cause to even think about using such a power. I cannot speculate about
every occasion on which the commission might or might not seek to use
it.</div><a name="0811121000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000613"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I want to come back to the meaning of Government
amendment No. 123 and its relationship with paragraph 3 of schedule 1,
the issue that was raised from a sedentary position. It is important to
get the matter straight. The amendment states that
the</div><a name="0811121000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;power
conferred by paragraph 1(5) may not be used to enter premises and
inspect documents for the purposes of an investigation by the
Commission of the suspected offence or
contravention.&#148;</div><a name="0811121000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
3 refers to powers when a person is causing an offence or when a person
has
contravened</div><a name="0811121000477"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
restriction or other requirement imposed by or by virtue of this
Act&#148;.</div><a name="0811121000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
original reading of Government amendment No. 123 was that,
by virtue of what it states about &#147;suspected offence or
contravention&#148;, it was separating paragraph 1
entirely from paragraph 3, and that nothing under paragraph 3 will
apply to the right of entry under paragraph 1. That raises my original
question about what does apply. We need to be clear about that because,
if that is not the case, the amendment would not achieve the full
separation between the inspection power and the investigatory
power.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000614"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We have moved on to consider the Government
amendments. After issuing the hon. Member for Huntingdon with a final
invitation not to press his amendments, I can ask him and the rest of
the Committee to consider accepting ours. I will, if I may, come to
Government amendment No. 123 after speaking to Government amendment No.
122.</div>
<a name="0811121000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have tabled
our amendments in response to concerns that have been raised. As I have
said, those concerns are considerable and it is important to get the
measure right. Although the commission&#146;s proposed new powers
have existed in some form since 2000, and they are the same as other
regulators&#146; powers, we none the less realise the sensitivity of
the measure. We realise that to some extent&#151;notwithstanding what
I said about the need for politicians not to exempt themselves from
scrutiny and regulation&#151;politics is a particular
activity.</div>
<a name="0811121000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon has frequently referred to the importance of
volunteers, so we have to be careful not to discourage volunteer
activity. It is important that we do not criminalise inadvertent
mistakes or discourage decent people, acting out of public spirit, from
participating in political life. In that spirit, we have tabled our
amendments.</div><a name="0811121000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power in paragraph 1(5), which restates the existing powers of entry,
can be exercised by the commission for the purposes of carrying out its
functions and does not require a warrant. That is because the power
does not allow force to be used to obtain entry. It can also be
exercised only at a reasonable
time.</div><a name="0811121000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to the power in paragraph 1(5), the Bill also gives the
commission a new range of powers to access information reasonably
required for its investigations into suspected offences or
contraventions of the 2000 Act from any person who might
hold it. Paragraph 3 of proposed new schedule 19A creates a power for
the commission to apply for a warrant to enter premises occupied by any
person, to search those premises and to seize documents. A warrant may
authorise the use of reasonable force for those
purposes.</div><a name="0811121000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently,
the Bill introduces a high threshold for a warrant to be obtained under
paragraph 3. The commission will need a warrant to search premises. To
get it, it must satisfy a justice of the peace, on information on oath,
that it has &#147;reasonable grounds for believing&#148; that an
offence or contravention has been committed and that documents that
have been withheld following request, or that are otherwise relevant to
the investigation, are on the
premises.</div><a name="0811121000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
exercising the warrant, the commission must be accompanied at all times
by a constable. Anyone who is to accompany a constable on to the
premises can do so only if named in the
warrant.</div><a name="0811121000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that those wider powers are necessary to help to ensure that
the commission is equipped to conduct effective investigations into
suspected breaches of the Act, in conjunction with prosecuting
authorities. Nevertheless, we have noted all the concerns raised in the
House about possible confusion over the powers of search and entry in
paragraphs 1(5) and
3.</div><a name="0811121000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendment to the schedule makes it clear that if the
commission suspects that an offence or contravention has occurred and
it wishes to enter 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>premises to continue its investigation, it must use its new powers of
search and entry by warrant, which has all the safeguards
attached.</div>
<a name="0811121000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000615"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Will my right hon. Friend give
way?</div><a name="0811121000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000616"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I will in a moment. I have given way a lot, and I
am trying to clear up the confusion about what we are
doing.</div><a name="0811121000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission cannot use the power under paragraph 1(5) to
conduct a fishing expedition if it thinks that wrongdoing has occurred.
We believe that the safeguards on the power to enter premises ensure
that use of the power will be proportionate and justified, and for its
proper
purpose.</div><a name="0811121000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000617"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> My right hon. Friend refers to the thresholds that
are required and to a warrant that might be granted by a justice of the
peace. Is he satisfied that the threshold is high enough? Should we be
considering a judge in a court issuing an order, rather than a JP in a
magistrates court issuing a
warrant?</div><a name="0811121000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000618"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> My hon. Friend raises an important point, which we
will actively
consider.</div><a name="0811121000355"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811121000619"></a><b class="B">Tony
Lloyd</b> (Manchester, Central) (Lab): In support of my right
hon. Friend the Minister considering the point made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire, this is not a
trivial point. Those of us who have experience as constituency MPs of
the use and, sometimes, the failure of the warrant system know that
JPs, whom I am sure in all cases are estimable people, do not always
ask the searching questions necessary to determine what ought to take
place.</div><a name="0811121000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is merit in having a higher threshold and a higher level of
interrogation to force demonstration of reasonable grounds for entry to
a premises. Frankly, that is not always the case in criminal law, and
we should not replicate that in the Bill. I hope that my right hon.
Friend the Minister will think about this
matter.</div><a name="0811121000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000620"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for his
comments. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and
South Pembrokeshire have made some important points and a major
contribution to the debate. As I said, the Government are anxious to
listen to what colleagues on the Committee have to say. We understand
the concerns that have been expressed and will continue to explore what
we can do to address them. In the meantime, I am extremely grateful to
my hon. Friends for their contributions, which brought real
enlightenment to the onward movement of the
debate.</div><a name="0811121000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have come to the end of my remarks. I hope that what I have said will
be enough to persuade the Committee to accept the Government

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000621"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister said that the commission is not
equipped to fulfil its role. Various issues come out of that. First, we
are still short on evidence as to why that is the case. Secondly, if we
accept that it is the case, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>it does not necessarily follow that the commission needs powers of entry
in connection with a donation of only a few pounds, for example. Many
of the comments made by hon. Members reflect
that.</div><a name="0811121000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight made an important point when
he said that this is not a black-and-white issue. We must consider the
range of responses and gradations. The more I have heard from the
Minister on this batch of amendments, the more I think that he has not
totally thought through the impact and mechanics of the powers of
entry.</div><a name="0811121000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, I am grateful to the Minister for discussing the amendments
fully and putting the Government&#146;s position on the record, and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000624"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to the part of schedule 1 that deals
with powers in respect of suspected offences or contraventions. The
amendments are consequential upon each other. Paragraph (1)(3) of
proposed new schedule 19A, as set out in schedule 1, says what the
recipient of a disclosure notice may be expected to do to comply with
it. Again, I am conscious of trying to ensure clarity and avoiding
repetition.</div><a name="0811121000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendment No. 88, I sought to require the commission to have
&#147;reasonable suspicion&#148; that the person served with the
disclosure order had committed an offence. When speaking to that
amendment, I sought to strike a balance between the regulatory and
enforcement role played by the commission and the right of the
individual to go unhindered by arbitrary state intervention. With that
in mind, and largely consequent upon that amendment&#151;which, of
course, failed&#151;I believe that by inserting &#147;information
or&#148; or &#147;any&#148; we can do away with the need for
paragraphs 2(2), 2(3) and 2(5). My rationale is as follows.</div>
<a name="0811121000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 2 of
proposed new schedule 19A is
entitled:</div><a name="0811121000478"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Powers
in relation to suspected offences or
contraventions&#148;.</div><a name="0811121000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I noted in speaking to amendment No. 88, disclosure notices should be
issued in such circumstances only by the commission, and disclosure as
expressed by amendment No. 99 would be of any information or documents
that the commission may require for its investigation. To leave
paragraphs 2(2) and 2(3) in place would therefore result in
duplication, as we could give the commission the same powers with only
two words rather than two sub-paragraphs. That, in turn, would increase
clarity and understanding at no cost to the commission&#146;s powers
of investigation.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div><a name="0811121000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
any event, will the Minister please address my suspicion that there
could be a degree of duplication between the parts of the schedule? In
that vein, will he also explain sub-paragraph (5)? If the power of
entry is invoked, will it be necessary to go to a magistrate, as stated
in paragraph 3, and if not, why
not?</div><a name="0811121000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000625"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The amendments would mean that the commission could
not require information or documents from any person who was reasonably
required to provide them for the purpose of investigating a suspected
offence or a contravention.</div>
<a name="0811121000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power to
require documents becomes available when the commission has reasonable
grounds for suspecting that an offence has been committed under the
2000 Act or that another contravention of the Act has occurred. Under
paragraph 12 of the schedule, it is an offence to refuse to comply with
such a request without reasonable excuse. We believe that the amendment
would seriously hamper the commission&#146;s ability to conduct
effective investigations into suspected breaches and contraventions of
the Act, in conjunction with prosecuting authorities. Not only that,
but the technical effect of the provision would be to make unavailable
the power to seek a warrant authorising entry. That is because a
warrant can be issued under paragraph 3 of the schedule only if a prior
request for documents under paragraph 2(2) has been made. However, the
amendment would remove that latter
paragraph.</div><a name="0811121000373"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000626"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the Minister confirming that it is necessary
to go to a magistrate under paragraph
3?</div><a name="0811121000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000627"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Yes, it is. That is exactly right. The technical
effect of the amendment&#151;again, I am sure the hon. Gentleman is
happy to concede the fact&#151;would be an unintended consequence,
which I hope he would not relish.</div>
<a name="0811121000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
cross-party consensus on the need for the commission to become a more
robust regulator, but we believe that the amendments would damage its
ability to do so. Removing the powers would leave the commission out of
step with other comparable regulators, such as inspectors appointed
under the Companies Act 1985. If the commission is granted these
powers, the Government will expect it to exercise them sensibly and
responsibly. When it seeks to use them, it will of course be subject to
the usual requirement imposed by public law to act reasonably; its
actions must also be compatible with the European convention on human
rights, under the Human Rights Act
1998.</div><a name="0811121000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Gentleman has been sufficiently reassured that his
amendment may have unintended effect. I therefore ask him to withdraw
it</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000631"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to paragraph 3, dealing with powers
of entry and search, where again it would seem that the Government have
had some further thoughts since the earlier sittings of the Committee.
However, we still have various concerns in relation to the provisions.
Amendment No. 103 would change paragraph 3 of the schedule to require
the commission to obtain a warrant from a High Court judge, rather than
a justice of the peace, before it was entitled to enter premises in the
course of its investigations into alleged offences under PPERA. I think
this was the point made by the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and
South Pembrokeshire in his earlier intervention on the Minister. That
higher judicial threshold would place a greater obligation on the
commission to ensure that the reasoning behind any use of its powers of
entry was legally
sound.</div><a name="0811121000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
increased experience and expertise of a judge in the High Court would
subject the commission&#146;s arguments that it had reasonable
grounds to a higher level of judicial and legal scrutiny than could be
expected from a justice of the peace. That would act as an important
check and balance on the use of any of the powers, thereby ensuring
that any cases of entry into premises were proportionate and
justified.</div><a name="0811121000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be interested to hear from the Minister how frequently he thought
that the powers of entry in this schedule might be used by the
commission, although to judge from previous remarks he might be
reluctant to give that information. I suspect that it will be
infrequently, so the higher threshold would not place any significant
or undue burden on the commission or prevent it from utilising its
powers effectively.</div>
<a name="0811121000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been
an almost unprecedented increase in state powers of entry under this
Government, as I have explained in earlier remarks. I believe the
amendment offers an important safeguard to members of the public and
those involved in assisting parties. I would like to press the Minister
for some clarification on the proposed mechanism for regulating the
commission&#146;s use of its powers of entry. The mechanism as it
stands allows the commission to seek, through a justice of the peace, a
warrant for entry, where the commission has issued a notice and it has
not been voluntarily complied with. Lisa Klein, director of the
commission&#146;s party and election finance team, noted in the
evidence session last Thursday that there were a number of different
routes to force compliance.</div>
<a name="0811121000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approach
taken in the Bill, which apparently was the choice of the Ministry of
Justice rather than the commission, requires the commission to apply to
the magistrates for permission to go with a constable and see if it can
find the answers itself. The other approach, as used in the United
States, would be for the commission to ask the courts to order someone
to answer the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>questions put to them by the commission. If they did not do so, they
would be held in contempt of court and it would then become a criminal
matter.</div>
<a name="0811121000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
proposed the former criminal route and I would like to hear from the
Minister why that was the case. Furthermore, did they consider the
alternative civil-type route, and if so, why was it dismissed? It is
important that the main check on the commission&#146;s investigation
power is through the judicial system. The commission is acting as a
regulator separated from the Government and if the separation is not
maintained, its legitimacy will break down.</div>
<a name="0811121000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further, while
potentially cumbersome, an affected individual or group has the right
to judicial review of the commission&#146;s actions. As such, it is
imperative that we ensure that the Government have chosen the
correct route for regulation of the commission&#146;s powers in the
Bill.</div><a name="0811121000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a final point, I would like to ask the Minister how the Government
consulted on the proposals to give the commission these powers and the
safeguards that are attached to them. Again, are the powers
proportionate given their powerful scope? We are not yet
convinced.</div><a name="0811121000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 101 is a consequential amendment following amendment No. 124, which
we debated previously. It aims to bring in a threshold of
&#163;10,000, which would mean that the powers of entrance and search
could be used only in respect of the larger issues, which seems a more
proportionate approach.</div>
<a name="0811121000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
Government amendment No. 124 introduces a new sub-paragraph into
paragraph 3 of schedule 1, adding a further safeguard that gives the
commission wide-ranging powers of entry. Our starting point was one of
concern about the lack of safeguards in the paragraph and about the
need to redress the balance between powers and safeguards. We therefore
welcome this Government amendment as a first step along the road to a
clearer and more proportionate allocation of the powers of entry.
However, I have a few small concerns about the amendment that I hope
the Minister will address.</div>
<a name="0811121000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first
concern is about the form and duration of the chief executive&#146;s
authorisation. We would like the measure to specify that any
authorisation must be specific to each case and warrant, in order to
avoid blanket authorisation being given. Will that be the case?
Further, we would like a reasonable time limit to be placed on such
authorisations, so that they have an expiry date and cannot be used
further down the line as a basis for further search warrants during the
same investigation.</div>
<a name="0811121000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like
the appointment system regarding alternatives to the chief executive to
be tightened up through the addition of a need for the agreement, or at
least consent, of the Speaker&#146;s Committee to the proposed
replacement. We would also like a time limit to be placed on the
authorisation of that person as a replacement. Finally, we would like
any such appointment to be made public within five days by way of
notice in the <i class="I">London Gazette</i>.</div>
<a name="0811121000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those changes
would not place an unnecessary burden on the commission, given that it
is unlikely that such warrants will be an everyday occurrence and that
the absence or inability of the chief executive to approve 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>them will be even rarer. The important measures that I have outlined
would ensure that the safeguards operate effectively. As welcome as the
Government&#146;s amendment is, it has the feel of something that was
rushed out on Friday on a reactive basis. That rather underlines our
point that more time is needed between evidence and drafting sessions.
The amendment does not go far enough to allay our concerns about this
paragraph, and I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s comments
on
it.</div><a name="0811121000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000632"></a>David
Howarth:</b> My starting point with this amendment is that it
seems a little over the top to require a High Court judge, who does not
normally deal with warrants in criminal cases, to grant a search
warrant in relation to a fairly minor offence. The point that the hon.
Member for Huntingdon made about High Court judges&#146; experience
is quite wrong; they have virtually no experience in giving search
warrants, because most search warrants are given by justices of the
peace. That is, presumably, why the Bill specifies that it should be a
justice of the peace.</div>
<a name="0811121000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">At first then,
the amendment seems quite extraordinary, but there is a point to be
made. The Bill brings together the situation in paragraph 3(1)(a), in
which someone is suspected of having committed a criminal offence, for
which it would be entirely normal to get a search warrant from a
magistrate, and the situation in paragraph 3(1)(b), in which
someone has</div>
<a name="0811121000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;contravened
(otherwise than by committing an offence) any restriction or other
requirement imposed by or by virtue of this Act&#148;.</div>
<a name="0811121000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the words in
parentheses that cause the problem. We are considering the grant of a
search warrant in a situation in which no one is suspected of having
committed a criminal offence.</div>
<a name="0811121000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">In civil law,
there are equivalents to search warrants. They used to be called Anton
Piller orders in the old days, but then they were renamed with a not
very fancy name. In civil law, if one wants to do something similar to
what is done in criminal law, one has to go further up the judicial
chain. That is the problem with this provision. I have no problem with
a justice of the peace issuing a search warrant in a criminal case, but
I do have a bit of a problem with that if no criminal offence is
suspected.</div><a name="0811121000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000633"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman said earlier that the nature
of many of these powers would or should be through the civil rather
than the criminal route. Is not he proving that I did have a point to
make?</div><a name="0811121000402"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000634"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I accept that point, because the Bill conflates
criminal and non-criminal aspects, and it is not right to have the same
procedure in each case. That adds a layer of complication, and it is
entirely over the top to require a search warrant from a High Court
judge in an ordinary criminal
case.</div><a name="0811121000403"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000635"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I would like the Minister to help me with the
question of what happens when things are taken away. Paragraph 8 of the
schedule says that &#147;documents&#148; include &#147;any books
or records&#148;. If there is a room full of computers, people can
walk in, collect the computers and walk out again. If this happened in
the middle of an election, one can imagine the damage caused to
election organisers. Is there any provision to take copies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div>of what you have got and keep them? Obviously, some computers have to be
removed, perhaps all of them, but should there not be a power to keep
copies?</div><a name="0811121000404"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000636"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I have already made it clear that we are prepared
to look at the question of judicial oversight. I hope that in the light
of that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will withdraw his amendment, but
I do want to assure him that we are exploring this. We have to consult
the judiciary, among others, as to feasibility. We have to take into
account&#151;and I am sure the judiciary will take into
account&#151;the sort of points raised by the hon. Member for
Cambridge.</div>
<a name="0811121000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">The points
made by my hon. Friends, the Members for Carmarthen, West and South
Pembrokeshire and for Manchester, Central are well taken. We recognise
the need to reassure the House on this. These are important powers that
we do not expect to be used often. Perhaps the tightening of judicial
oversight will be a way of providing extra reassurance. I am sorry I
cannot be more specific and enlighten the Committee at this stage as to
exactly what we are proposing but I will come back to the Committee or
the House at some
point.</div><a name="0811121000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Huntingdon asked whom we consulted. As I have said
already, the White Paper was published in June, the Bill was published
in July, and we consulted widely on both, including with the Opposition
parties. I hope that will give him some comfort that we have taken our
obligations to consult very seriously.</div>
<a name="0811121000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also raised the question of why we rejected the
approach&#151;apparently suggested by the Electoral Commission in its
evidence&#151;that we should go down the US route of applying for a
court order and then a sanction being contempt. This was an interesting
contribution from the Electoral Commission. The warrant approach is in
the tradition of this country. We were not aware that the Electoral
Commission favoured a different approach to it. If that is indeed its
position&#151;that it would prefer to go down that route&#151;we
are happy to explore that with it and come back to this Committee.
There are arguments against this route but, as it is the Electoral
Commission that will have to apply the powers, we think its views
important. We have not had the opportunity to discuss this with it but
we will. I hope that gives some comfort.</div>
<a name="0811121000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Isle of Wight raised an interesting point. I know he is much
concerned about what will happen during an election campaign. He raised
similar concerns on Second Reading about the effect of the exercise of
these powers. He has made some very good points about that. The answer
is that it will depend on the individual circumstances. The warrant
will authorise what happens. He is right that the provision does
include computers. That does come within the ambit of this but it will
be for the warrant to take stock. He makes a valuable point. We will
take it away and see if there is anything that can be
done.</div>
<a name="0811121000494"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.45
pm</div><a name="0811121000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also reflecting on some of other hon. Gentleman&#146;s other
points about the operation of the powers during an election campaign,
as I think he is aware. They are important points, as we do not want
any disruption to the normal process of an election campaign. We do not

<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>necessarily think that the commission&#146;s capability as an
effective regulator will be interfered with. I hope that on the basis
of what I have said, the hon. Member for Huntingdon will feel able to
withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="0811121000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope also
that the extra safeguard that we are introducing in Government
amendment No. 124 will be acceptable to the Committee. It produces an
extra safeguard before a warrant can be issued under paragraph 3 of
proposed new schedule 19A. We have tabled it in response to the
concerns expressed on Second Reading that the powers may be mishandled
or treated too casually by the commission. Under the Bill as drafted,
to obtain a warrant to enter premises to investigate a suspected
offence or contravention, the commission must demonstrate on oath to a
justice of the peace that it has &#147;reasonable grounds for
believing&#148; that an offence has been committed and that documents
that have been withheld following a request, or that are otherwise
relevant to the investigation, are on the premises. In addition, as we
have said, the commissions must be accompanied by a constable at all
times when exercising a
warrant.</div><a name="0811121000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth emphasising again that a warrant can only ever be applied for
when there is a history of a lack of co-operation by the subject of an
investigation or by someone who holds useful information. Whether a
warrant is issued is not in the commission&#146;s gift. It must
convince a justice of the peace, or possibly a higher judicial
authority, that it really needs to enter the premises to get hold of
relevant documents that it believes are
there.</div><a name="0811121000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course we recognise the concerns that have been expressed, and as I
have said, I want to meet them while still ensuring that the commission
retains effective powers where necessary. The effect of the amendment
will be to ensure that no application can be made for a warrant to
enter and search premises without the written authorisation of the
chief executive of the commission. If that office is vacant or the
chief executive is absent or unable to act, the authorisation will come
from a member of staff of sufficient seniority, who has previously been
designated by the chief executive for the purpose and whose designation
is still in
force.</div><a name="0811121000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman launched a number of probing questions about the time
limit and whether the Speaker&#146;s Committee should have oversight.
I am certainly happy to raise those points with the Electoral
Commission. As the regulatory authority, it is obviously important that
we ascertain its views, and it will be influential in deciding how we
proceed. However, although I am not closing my mind, I say to him as a
first response to his questions that there could be some difficulty. It
would be one thing if the post of chief executive were vacant for a
considerable time, but the Government amendment covers his
being</div>
<a name="0811121000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;absent or unable
to
act&#148;.</div><a name="0811121000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
might mean a temporary illness or something like that. We need to be
careful about introducing procedures that are too cumbersome and would
interfere with the commission&#146;s ability to discharge its duties
effectively.</div><a name="0811121000415"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="0811121000416"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0811121000637"></a><b class="B">Tony
Lloyd</b> (Manchester, Central) (Lab): It is quite clear that
there is a real attempt to raise the threshold, but I share the hon.
Member for Huntingdon&#146;s desire to probe the matter. The wording
could, ironically, allow the office junior to be routinely designated.
I know that that is not the Minister&#146;s intention&#151;that is
clear from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>what he has just told us. Would it be worth considering a form of words
that would guarantee that the power will not be routinely delegated to
an inappropriate level? It is not likely that the chief executive would
want that, and I know that it is not the Minister&#146;s intention,
but as often in life, we need to ensure that our intentions of today
are honoured in 15
years.</div><a name="0811121000417"></a>

Wills:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend that we cannot be too
careful, but such a scenario is extremely unlikely. As I have said, I
have an open mind on this and I am perfectly happy to consult the
commission. It would certainly not want to trivialise the power in the
way that he suggests&#151;why would it? There would of course be a
test of seniority and experience, and I know that my hon. Friend uses
the office junior as an extreme example to make his point, but the
general point is valid. We want to ensure that there is sufficient
seniority. I think that the hon. Member for Huntingdon was probing how
we define that and ensure that it is at an appropriate level. Those are
perfectly fair points. I would be very happy to explore them and we

grateful for that. It is necessary given the current state of the
clause. He also said that he would discuss with the Electoral
Commission whether the US civil-type approach would be suitable. That
would be helpful too. I am also pleased that he will be taking up my
questions on his amendment with the Electoral Commission and I should
be grateful if he would circulate its reply to the Committee. That
would be important for our later deliberations. On that basis I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000640"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in
schedule 1, page 15, line 41, leave
out &#145;three months&#146; and insert</div>
<a name="08111212000007"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;42 days from the date on which
they were
seized.&#146;.</div><a name="0811121000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000641"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following amendments:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div><a name="0811121000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 26, in
schedule 1, page 15, line 45, leave
out from &#145;within&#146; to &#145;proceedings&#146; and
insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;42 days from the date on which they
were
seized.&#146;.</div><a name="0811121000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.
27, in
schedule 1, page 16, line 2, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) The
Commission may apply a magistrates court to extend this 42 day period
by a further 14 days where they can prove on reasonable grounds that
the continued retention of such documents is vital to the investigation
into offences under this Act which involve in excess of
&#163;10,000.&#146;.</div><a name="0811121000425"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000642"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We now move on to paragraph 4 which deals with
the retention of documents. When read together, amendments Nos. 25 and
26 seek to insert a court-based safeguard into an otherwise possibly
arbitrary power for the commission to withhold documents. The current
entitlement as proposed in the Bill is three months or 90 calendar
days. My amendment would reduce that initial time frame by half, but
would add in the power to have that extended on application to a
magistrate by a further 14 days.</div>
<a name="0811121000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">This inserts
an important judicial safeguard mechanism into the Bill to prevent the
commission from holding documents for an unnecessarily long period of
time and thereby potentially placing an individual or group in a very
difficult position. The retention of documents can cause significant
disruption to individuals, businesses and groups. We must ensure that
we strike a balance between the desire to have an effective regulator
in the commission and the ability of those under investigation to
continue their lives as unhindered as possible. After all, we are all
innocent until proven guilty but the way the current provision in the
Bill is drafted seems, to my mind at least, to flip that principle on
its
head.</div><a name="0811121000427"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000643"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> As the hon. Gentleman has explained, the amendments
seek to alter paragraph 4 and the length of time for which any
documents may be retained. I am curious about how he alighted on the
figure of 42 days<i class="I">.
[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="0811121000428"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000644"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> Is that
wise?</div><a name="0811121000429"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000645"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am interested that he seems to believe that it is
a relatively short period of time.</div>
<a name="0811121000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
said, the amendments would impact significantly on the
commission&#146;s ability to give proper consideration to documents,
which it requires for the purposes of investigating a suspected breach
or contravention of the Act. It is open to the commission to return
documents before the three-month period expires if there is no reason
to retain them any longer. Furthermore, the commission can retain
documents for more than three months only in specific circumstances
covered in paragraph 4. Forty-two days is not a sufficient time limit
within which to expect the commission to have considered documents or
taken steps it considers appropriate to pursue an investigation into a
suspected breach of the
Act.</div><a name="0811121000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
it could require the commission to reach a decision about whether to
take proceedings unnecessarily quickly. I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman would not have intended that to be a consequence of the
amendment. That could lead to proceedings being abandoned, unnecessary
stress and disruption, and everything else that goes with that, when a
longer period might have  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>shown that there was sufficient evidence to justify the proceedings or,
equally seriously, to err on the side of taking proceedings where the
evidence later turns out to be
insufficient.</div><a name="0811121000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is hard to see how an amendment that risks having either effect could
be anything other than damaging to the regulatory regime that proposed
new schedule 19A seeks to support. I do not think that the proposed
extension period in amendment No. 27 properly addresses that point, not
least because the sorts of offence or contravention to which the power
to enter may relate will not always have a quantifiable monetary value.
It is in everyone&#146;s interests to ensure that a proper balance is
struck between the needs of the commission to have time to consider
what evidence it has before it and the needs of the person whose
documents have been taken to know what is to be done with them and to
have them returned within a reasonable period, if proceedings are not
to be taken.</div>
<a name="0811121000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our proposal
reflects the approach taken by Parliament towards other regulators and,
therefore, is based on a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>workable precedent. I hope that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will
withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="0811121000434"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0811121000646"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister said that he was concerned that the
impact of the amendments could be that the Electoral Commission would
have to take a faster decision than it otherwise would, which could
lead to a bad decision. I take his point, but I have tried to address
that issue by saying that the commission would have the right to go
back to the magistrate to request a further 14 days, and I
would not have a problem with that being a recurrent right, on the
basis that the commission would have to justify its wish to keep the
documents. For the moment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
