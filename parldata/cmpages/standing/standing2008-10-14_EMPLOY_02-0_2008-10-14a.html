Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): On a point of
order, Mr. Caton. We were told that it would be absolutely
safe to leave our notes and papers here in the room during the
intermission. That has turned out not to be the case. I wanted to put
that on the record because we cannot be told one thing and then find
that our papers have
disappeared.</div><a name="08101460000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000184"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I understand that that has happened. We shall
try to prevent it from ever happening again. Things are in hand to
recover any papers that have gone missing. I call Mr.
Jonathan
Djanogly.</div><a name="08101460000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101460000185"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): I am pleased that I
took my papers with me to have a little look at them over lunch;
otherwise, matters may have been rather
difficult.</div><a name="08101460000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
are we being asked to give Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs
more powers when those that it has have been used so sparsely, or is
the Minister implying that the Government miscalculated so badly when
they drafted the National Minimum Wage Act 1998? Furthermore, while I
may be persuaded of the merits of proceedings in the Crown court where
an unlimited fine is appropriate for large-scale and malicious acts of
non-compliance, I am not so easily convinced that it has any real
application in the usual course of enforcement. Can the hon. Gentleman
enlighten us and explain what proportion of current cases would be
prosecuted under the new proposed criminal powers and say how many
would remain civil? Furthermore, to date in how many
cases&#151;successful or not&#151;has HMRC applied for the maximum
fine of &#163;5,000? I fear that the Government are trying to hand a
howitzer to HMRC, when it has shown itself loth to use even a pop
gun.</div><a name="08101460000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
sympathise with the Government&#146;s attempt to empower HMRC and
give it the ability to prosecute larger scale offenders, as so
concisely set out by Lord Jones, the Minister in the other place, who
said:</div><a name="08101460000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
do not believe that the sentencing powers available to magistrates
would be suitable in the most serious and exceptional cases where
employers refuse or contrive not to pay the national 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>minimum wage and do not co-operate with a compliance officer&#146;s
investigations.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>
13 March 2008; Vol. 699, c.
GC258.]</div><a name="08101460000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the Government need to show that such a problem actually exists. I am
concerned about supporting the clause on the basis of only perceived
exceptional circumstances for which there is scant, if any,
evidence.</div><a name="08101460000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister can answer the questions that I am about to ask him, I
might find myself more able to support the clause. First, how many
exceptional cases have occurred, and how many are being investigated?
Secondly, how would we prevent HMRC from becoming overly zealous in its
pursuit of actions in the Crown court at the expense of the taxpayer?
Thirdly, if such gross and serial underpayment is being perpetrated,
why has HMRC not heard of it and begun an investigation with a view to
nipping it in the bud before it reaches a stage that requires such
large-scale, legal involvement? If the Minister can provide me with
answers to those questions, he will go a long way towards easing my
concerns.</div>
<a name="08101460000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101460000186"></a><b class="B">Mary
Creagh</b> (Wakefield) (Lab): It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Caton. I congratulate the Minister on
his elevation to the Privy Council.</div>
<a name="08101460000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall speak
briefly about the new powers contained under clause 11. It is important
that we empower our officials to have the full range of penalties
available to them. We talked earlier about the exceptional nature of
the circumstances, but in Yorkshire and Humberside&#151;the region
covered by my constituency of Wakefield&#151;372 investigations took
place last year and there were 158 non-compliant employers. That is a
serious issue for my constituents in Wakefield and for the 140,000
people claiming the minimum wage throughout the area.</div>
<a name="08101460000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give
an example of the sort of people that we are talking about. My friend
Joseph Marshall told me about his son who, before the introduction of
the minimum wage, was earning &#163;2.25 an hour as a landscape
gardener. He earned &#163;18 a day, and was so tired when he came
home because he had worked an extra couple of hours that he would fall
asleep while eating his dinner. It was one of the happiest days in that
family&#146;s life when, in 2001, he got a job as a security guard
earning &#163;4.10 an hour. Obviously his wages have gone up
since.</div>
<a name="08101460000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
talking about vulnerable workers. The hon. Member for Huntingdon has
commented on whether those workers are vulnerable or not, but people
who work so hard that they fall asleep during their evening meal and
rejoice at earning the princely sum of &#163;4 an hour are the
poorest people and most vulnerable workers in the
country.</div><a name="08101460000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
employers decide not to pay the minimum wage, it is a crime like any
other. It is a white collar crime, but it takes money from extremely
poor and vulnerable people. Businesses that avoid paying VAT are
prosecuted to the full extent of the law because they take money from
Her Majesty&#146;s Government. I do not see why there should not be
similar penalties for companies that fail to give their workers the
wages that are due. The clause and the provisions in clause 8 mean that
for employers, choosing not to pay the minimum wage is not a zero
penalty option. I know that my constituents in Wakefield will welcome
the measure.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div><a name="08101460000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101460000187"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): I have every sympathy with and am
totally in agreement with the points that the hon. Lady makes. She
talks about a number of companies that were found not to have been
paying the minimum wage. Does she know how many were prosecuted and
fined out of the, I think, 174?</div>
<a name="08101460000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000188"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> It was 158 companies across the region, and one of
the difficulties is that I have not been able to drill down and see how
many that affected in Wakefield. We must also look at the number of
people affected. Each of those companies will employ between 10 and 100
workers. That is the size of company involved, as larger companies will
have the policies and procedures in place. That probably represents
about 1,500 people across Yorkshire and Humberside, and it could have
been more. Perhaps I could ask the Minister for a breakdown on the
basis of our constituencies, and it would also be useful to know the
numbers of people who have been affected. If he could get his officials
to place copies of that information in the Library, that would greatly
assist us in scrutinising the Bill and in making the case
for these further powers to our
constituents.</div>
<a name="08101460000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000189"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I agree with the hon. Member for Huntingdon on the
importance of enforcement once the failure of an employer to achieve
the national minimum wage is discovered. I have crossed swords with the
Minister on a number of occasions about this, but the chance of an
employer being inspected for non-enforcement of the national minimum
wage is, statistically, about once every 200 years. The Minister
rightly says that we should go after companies if we have evidence that
they might be flouting the law. However, what concerns me, as the hon.
Member for Huntingdon has said, is why those companies are not properly
prosecuted. It is certainty of detection that will make employers
comply with the legislation, rather than the size of the fines. If
companies are not seen to be punished, all the good intentions in the
clause, which I completely agree with, will not come to anything
because employers will feel that they can flout them with
impunity.</div>
<a name="08101460000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000190"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Mr. Caton, it is a pleasure to sit
under your control yet
again.</div><a name="08101460000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am becoming ever more concerned about the numbers that we are throwing
about. We can do damage in that respect; we need to be sure that we are
talking factually. Let me declare an interest. I am the non-executive
chairman of a company employing 140 people, which I started in 1989. In
my experience, everybody that I know is most diligent about paying
above the minimum wage, because over recent years, in most areas of the
country, it has been hard to get labour at the minimum wage. We need to
take that fact into
account.</div><a name="08101460000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000191"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> I know the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
business&#151;we have mutual friends&#151;but that is set up in the
south-east of England, where there is almost a full-employment economy.
That is certainly not so in other areas of country and in other
countries&#151;in Scotland and Wales&#151;in rural areas and in
certain cities in the north, north-east and north-west. Does he
agree?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="08101460000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000192"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> It might be helpful if I told the hon. Lady that
we have a site in Wakefield employing some 20 people. I am delighted to
tell her that we find it just as difficult to get good labour in
Wakefield as we do in other parts of the country. Wakefield is a good
place to employ people. I have knowledge of other areas.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I would be delighted if she
visited.</div><a name="08101460000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned about the numbers that are being thrown about. We ought to
be a bit careful until we get the actual figures, because to talk about
companies with 10 to 100 employees suggests that we are talking about
sizeable companies. Although there is some difficulty, none of us
wishes in any sense to not pay the minimum wage as a minimum. However,
in my experience, those companies employing 100 people that are not
paying the minimum wage would be important ones. We need to talk about
the facts&#151;I am sure that the Minister would agree with that
point. We ought to be careful until we have those
facts.</div><a name="08101460000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000193"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform (Mr. Pat McFadden):</b> I echo the comments
of other Committee members in welcoming you to the Chair,
Mr. Caton. We look forward to serving under your
chairmanship this
afternoon.</div><a name="08101460000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are in danger of conflating two different things in this debate: the
penalty regime as it has operated up till now and the penalty regime as
it is changed by the Bill. That is an important
difference.</div><a name="08101460000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
gave some figures in my opening remarks on the clause, which I shall
mention again to help Committee members. In 2007-08, Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, which is responsible for
enforcing the minimum wage, investigated 4,524 cases; it found
non-compliance in 1,649 cases, of which 96 per cent. were settled
without an enforcement notice being issued. That happened under the
current, unreformed system of enforcement. HMRC issued enforcement
notices to 59 employers and 25 penalty notices for failure to comply
with an enforcement notice. I will mention prosecutions in a moment. It
is important to set those figures out, because they illustrate that, in
the system as it has operated until now, enforcement notices and
penalties exist in the process, but they come at the end of the
enforcement activity. That is what the Bill
changes.</div><a name="08101460000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
thinking behind how enforcement operates has evolved during the course
of the minimum wage. This was a major change to the labour market. We
took a decision in the early years of the minimum wage to operate with
a fairly light touch on enforcement. That was a major change, but the
point that I have made several times during our deliberations is that
it has been in place for 10 years. Non-payment now is somewhat
different from non-payment in the first year or two, when people could
argue that the system was new, that they were ignorant of the necessity
to abide by it and so on.</div>
<a name="08101460000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
changed the enforcement regime over time, and the Bill represents a
major change. The figures that I gave about the number of companies
investigated, penalty notices issued and so on will be changed
fundamentally. Clause 9 states that a penalty will now be automatic for
non-payment of the minimum wage. Instead of being given at the end of
the process, the penalty will be given at the
beginning.</div>

at seeing you in the Chair, Mr. Caton? I have served under
your chairmanship many times and have always enjoyed it.</div>
<a name="08101460000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Minister agree that the current system has provided almost a perverse
incentive to the less scrupulous employer to take what is in effect an
extended loan from their work force by underpaying them? The only thing
that such employers suffered was having to pay the minimum wage after
being notified that they were in breach. By contrast, the regime that
we are looking forward to will apply a penalty much earlier, acting as
a positive discouragement to that bad
practice.</div><a name="08101460000048"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000195"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Employers
who do not pay the minimum wage know that if they are
discovered&#151;if HMRC comes along and says, &#147;You&#146;re
not paying the minimum wage,&#148;&#151;all they will have do, in
all likelihood, is pay the arrears. The figures that I gave show that
relatively few penalties are issued, because the penalty comes at the
end of the process. The point made by the hon. Member for Huntingdon,
which was that we should look at the system as it has operated until
now and make a judgment that we may not need the new powers, does not
really hold, because the Bill will change the
system.</div><a name="08101460000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000196"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point that the
system is changing, and we have accepted the rationale for the change,
but he needs to make the case why the mode of trial must now involve
the Crown court. I do not think that he has yet made that
case.</div><a name="08101460000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000197"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Well, I have not finished speaking yet. I shall
come to
that.</div><a name="08101460000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also asked about prosecutions, numbers and so on. In
2006, discussions were held between HMRC and the Department of Trade
and Industry, the predecessor of the Department for Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, on the idea that, instead of the
system of penalty notices, we should prosecute people. There have been
five prosecutions. The fines involved ranged from &#163;500 to
&#163;3,500. I note that one organisation involved was called
Rascals, a day nursery prosecuted some time ago for non-payment of the
minimum wage. I make no comment on that.</div>
<a name="08101460000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000198"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but
something occurred to me while he was speaking. Is not the difficulty
of enforcing minimum wage legislation the fact that things tend to be
done quietly, secretly and in quite a close way? That does not empower
us as consumers to make choices about which companies we go to, good or
bad.</div><a name="08101460000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, if I were choosing which nursery to send my child to, I would
certainly not choose Rascals day nursery, not least because children
are priceless and I would not want somebody who was being paid less
than &#163;5 an hour looking after the most precious thing in my
life, my young baby. The same applies in relation to hairdressers, the
security industry and the hospitality industry.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="08101460000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I am
choosing which restaurant to go to for a curry, in the same way as I
choose fair trade goods, where possible, in the supermarket, I want to
know that that curry is being made by people who have decent labour
standards, are getting holidays and are not being taken for a ride.
There are a lot of benefits to such matters being dealt with in a
criminal court, particularly the fact that they will then become public
knowledge. The grapevine will be a powerful deterrent, so that people
will choose not to go to a particular firm and so that they will not be
exploited.</div>
<a name="08101460000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000199"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend makes a strong point. The thing
about prosecution in the court is that it is a public event that is on
the record.</div>
<a name="08101460000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000200"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It is worth spending a bit of time on that
because it is important. The point that the hon. Member for Wakefield
makes is a fair one, but those five particular cases would have been
public knowledge anyway because they were prosecuted, I presume, in the
magistrates court, so it is not a question whether such cases become
public or not. Given the facts that we have at the moment, the question
is whether it is justifiable that we also have the ability to prosecute
in the Crown court. As yet, I see no evidence that we need that power,
but I am open to
persuasion.</div><a name="08101460000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000201"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I referred to the fact that there have been five
prosecutions, but 17 cases have been identified by HMRC as ones where
it would have liked to attempt to take a case to prosecution, but was
unable to do so because of individuals&#146; reluctance to testify.
That relates to our argument in respect of this clause, the next clause
and the previous one in relation to HMRC&#146;s powers to take
evidence.</div><a name="08101460000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
caution against judging how the future system will work absent the
changes that we are making in the Bill. Those changes will give HMRC
more powers to take evidence and, as I have said before in our debates,
make it less reliant on the testimony of often reluctant and sometimes
fearful witnesses.</div>
<a name="08101460000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can
overcomplicate the issue. We are not creating new criminal offences
here; there are already criminal offences under the minimum wage
legislation. The maximum fine for those, in a magistrates court, is
&#163;5,000. The clause will enable HMRC prosecutors, in only the
most extreme cases of determined violation of the law, to make a
judgment that the offence is so serious that a fine of &#163;5,000
will not be sufficient deterrent to the company or punishment that
meets the crime. In those circumstances, we want to give those
prosecutors the option of trial in the Crown court, where the fine is
potentially unlimited, although I do not pretend that that will be the
norm or that it will occur in a large number of
cases.</div><a name="08101460000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Solihull is right that she and I have exchanged figures
and points on the question of inspection by rote a number of times. We
do not believe that inspection by rote is the most efficient way to do
this; we try to concentrate on cases where people report non-payment
and sectors of high risk. There are some 1.8 million employers in the
UK. As I said, in the last year, we found non-compliance in 1,650, but
targeted inspection and enforcement represent better use of what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>are inevitably limited resources than simply going round companies by
rote with no regard to the evidence of
under-payment.</div><a name="08101460000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101460000202"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): Will the Minister inform
the Committee of the size of some of those companies that have been
fined? Cannot the law be more flexible and proportional on the matter?
It seems to me that a serial offender such as a large multinational
company should be fined proportionally more if it is serially abusing
the minimum wage, whereas it would be disproportionate to fine a
smaller company a similar amount for erring once or
twice.</div><a name="08101460000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
cannot flexibility be introduced to the scheme? A fine is a fine, and a
punishment a punishment, but we do not want to over-prescribe against
small offenders and make them reduce their work force to meet such
fines.</div>
<a name="08101460000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000203"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The size of the companies involved in
prosecutions so far has varied from small firms to a local authority,
which employed thousands of people. On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point about fines damaging small companies, all businesses can ensure
that they do not incur any extra costs as a result of the Bill&#146;s
introduction by abiding by the law and paying the minimum wage. That is
the point we are trying to
make.</div><a name="08101460000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000204"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Nobody objects to proper measures being taken
against people who wilfully break the law&#151;that is not the issue
of debate&#151;but I would find it helpful if the Minister gave me a
couple of examples from the Revenue in which sizeable companies that
employ large numbers of people wilfully broke the law in that way, and
also provided a case for going to Crown court. That would help us to
recognise whether there is a situation that we need to deal
with.</div><a name="08101460000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until
I have that information, I shall find this matter difficult. The
Minister might say that I should have discovered the information
previously, which is a reasonably fair point, but he might help me
here.</div><a name="08101460000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000205"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has spoken
again, because he has reminded me to thank him for paying tribute to
the Government&#146;s strong economic record, which has made it
difficult for his firm to recruit staff because employment has grown so
much. His comments about effective enforcement being in the interests
of good business are right. The CBI has
said:</div><a name="08101460000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Effective
enforcement of the NMW is crucial to ensure its continuing legitimacy
and support amongst both employers and workers. CBI members therefore
support the government&#146;s decision to re-examine the enforcement
regime for NMW to ensure a level playing field for employers as well as
to ensure that all workers benefit from their rights under the 1998
National Minimum Wage
Act&#148;.</div><a name="08101460000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that we all agree with that
sentiment.</div><a name="08101460000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the size of the employers involved. As I
have said, small employers and a local authority are among those that
have been prosecuted so far. The size of employer varies, and the
clause allows prosecutors to judge whether the severity of the offence
is such that they should opt for trial at the Crown court, which can
levy a fine of more than &#163;5,000.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div><a name="08101460000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000206"></a>Barry
Gardiner:</b> Does the Minister agree that if one were to
combine the comments of the hon. Members for Northampton, South and for
East Devon, who said that it is reasonable to consider making larger
companies pay greater fines, one would have a response to the hon.
Member for Huntingdon? A case such as the one to which the Minister
alluded&#151;that of a large local authority&#151;is precisely the
sort in which the fine that might be paid would rightly exceed the
penalties that could be imposed by magistrates, thus providing the
reason for going to Crown court that the hon. Member for Northampton,
South
requests.</div><a name="08101460000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000207"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> It depends through which end of the telescope
one looks. The first question that we should ask is about not the size
of the employer, although that is a legitimate factor, but the severity
of the offence. If a large employer with many hundreds, or thousands,
of employees makes a mistake, there is a new penalty regime and we
should not lose sight of the fact that the vast majority will be dealt
with under that reformed penalty regime, which is civil, not criminal.
That will be so for large and small
employers.</div><a name="08101460000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause gives prosecutors the power to opt for trial in a higher court,
and it should be seen in relation to clause 12, which provides
increased powers on documentation and so on relating to trial by
indictment in the higher court. To some extent, the two go
together.</div><a name="08101460000162"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5pm</div><a name="08101460000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000208"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister has gone half way to answering my
queries, and I understand his point that the system is changing and
that that is partly the reason for the lack of criminal prosecutions to
date, although I do not believe that any hon. Member would say that the
existing policy has been successful, which is presumably why we are
changing it. I have still not seen proof that Crown court prosecutions
will be required. The Minister is saying that they may be required, and
on the basis of what &#147;may&#148; be required, we would
certainly have 42 days&#146; detention without trial, and a draconian
criminal system. We will give the matter further thought, and perhaps
return to it on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000209"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b><b class="B"> </b>I beg to move amendment No. 16, in
clause 12, page 14, line 9, leave
out subsection
(1).</div><a name="08101460000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment has a similar rationale as that of amendment No. 15 in that
it concerns the balance between enforcement powers and the freedoms of
business. As the Minister said, it is tied in with clause 11. This is a
probing amendment to seek clarification of the clause and its proposed
effect.</div><a name="08101460000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
has extensive powers as a result of the amalgamation of the Inland
Revenue and Her Majesty&#146;s Customs and Excise, not least those
under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which were provided
for HMRC&#146;s fiscal functions by the Finance Act 2007. I agree
with my noble Friend Baroness Wilcox and reiterate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>her concern that there must be a real need for the massive extension of
investigative powers proposed in the clause. More concerning perhaps is
that it could represent the proverbial thin end of the wedge. I would
not wish to hamper HMRC&#146;s good work in enforcing the national
minimum wage, but I am hesitant about freely handing it a hammer to
smash a nut when it may have a perfect adequate nutcracker in its box
of
tools.</div><a name="08101460000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be interested to hear from the Minister what tools the clause
provides to HMRC that it does not already possess, and in what
circumstances it may feel it necessary to use them. For example, in
what circumstance do the Government envisage HMRC using the
investigative powers? Will they be used for all offences, or just for
indictable offences? My understanding is that the clause is permissible
only on the basis that the offence is now indictable, but will the
Minister confirm that that is
so?</div><a name="08101460000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the discussion in the other place about the scarcity of indictable
offences, which the Minister confirmed during our previous debate on
clause 11 stand part, we must ask whether the powers are necessary
given the resulting reduction in civil liberties? In other words, the
clause 12 power is dependent on clause 11, which has not been proved to
be necessary. I am as yet unconvinced that HMRC has found itself in a
situation in which those new proposed powers were necessary, and I
should be grateful if the Minister would point me to specific evidence
of that
need.</div><a name="08101460000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000210"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is important that HMRC has the power
effectively to investigate allegations that offences have been
committed under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, and particularly
the more serious offences of systematically refusing or locally
neglecting to pay the national minimum wage. As I have said several
times on this group of clauses, we should remember that we have to deal
with the fact that vulnerable workers are often reluctant to come
forward.</div>
<a name="08101460000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
behind the clause, and the reason why we oppose the amendment suggested
by the hon. Gentleman is that HMRC investigators are currently hampered
in obtaining evidence of offences to the requisite standard, as we do
not have the necessary powers on search and, to a lesser degree, the
production of evidence. Investigators therefore have to rely on worker
testimony to prosecute employers.</div>
<a name="08101460000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
referred before to the Government&#146;s vulnerable workers forum,
which has been meeting over the past year. It has heard from
representatives of business, trade unions, citizens advice, enforcement
agencies and so on. Time and again we have heard of workers being
reluctant to come forward because they fear that they could lose their
jobs, albeit low-paid jobs, often leaving them with a marginal
existence.</div>
<a name="08101460000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based on
investigations, we know that securing worker testimony can be
difficult, as workers can face intimidation and threats, and sometimes
the loss of employment. HMRC has been forced to abandon some potential
prosecutions as a result of such factors. The hon. Gentleman asked how
many. Between 2005 and 2007, HMRC identified 17 cases in which the lack
of powers of the kind outlined in clause 12 hindered its investigations
of non-payment of the minimum wage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div><a name="08101460000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We cannot have
it both ways. We cannot say that the enforcement effort to date has
resulted in too few prosecutions and that it is not tough enough, and
then say that we are not convinced that we need tougher powers. None
the less, HMRC is able to identify cases in which, if it had had those
powers, it believes that it could have gone further.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000211"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> Would the Minister tell the Committee, for
interest, the geographical spread of those
prosecutions?</div><a name="08101460000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000212"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I do not have that information, but I shall look
into the matter to see whether I can enlighten the hon. Gentleman later
in the Committee&#146;s deliberations.</div>
<a name="08101460000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 12
remedies the situation by enabling HMRC to use the investigation powers
available to it under part II of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984, as it can with other HMRC responsibilities. Those powers would
enable HMRC to require the production of, or to search premises for,
documents of substantial evidential value to an investigation. I
emphasise that those powers will be granted to HMRC only if the courts
agree that documents of substantial evidential value are likely to be
obtained and that such an order is necessary and proportionate in the
circumstances.</div>
<a name="08101460000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon asked whether the powers will be usable only for
offences triable by indictment. I am happy to confirm that that is
correct. As I said earlier, clause 11 relates to clause 12, and vice
versa. The investigative powers in clause 12 could not be used if the
national minimum wage offences were triable only as summary offences,
as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act powers are available only for
indictable offences. The powers in clause 12 would enable prosecutions
for the most serious offences in the 1998
Act.</div>
<a name="08101460000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000213"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the Minister therefore convinced that the
measure will not encourage more indictable offences, because people
will want to use the new investigatory
powers?</div><a name="08101460000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000214"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The measure gives HMRC the power in
circumstances in which, at the moment, they are frustrated, because
they have to rely on witnesses who are reluctant to come forward.
Obviously, the powers will be available only for indictable
offences&#151;I have made no secret of that and have said it several
times. To some extent clauses 11 and 12 go together. Clause 12 will
enable prosecutions for the more serious offences under the National
Minimum Wage Act 1998, such as refusing or wilfully neglecting to pay
the national minimum wage, without having to rely on vulnerable and
reluctant witnesses.</div>
<a name="08101460000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clauses
that we are discussing are all about looking at minimum wage
enforcement and asking, &#147;Have we got the balance right?&#148;
Our view is that the system needs strengthening. I stress again what I
told the hon. Member for Northampton, South: I believe that most
employers are decent and that they want to abide by their obligations,
but I also agree with the CBI that a strong enforcement system is in
the interests of both good business and vulnerable workers. When
developing the proposals in the Bill, our view was that, although the
minimum wage has been a great success, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>the time is right to toughen up the enforcement regime. Clauses 10, 11
and 12 do that. I therefore do not agree with the
amendment.</div>
<a name="08101460000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000215"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Let me first thank the Minister for his
comprehensive response to my points. We are moving from a lax
system&#151;everyone agrees on that&#151;that does not work
especially well, to a tougher regime. No one has a problem with moving
to a tougher or better regime, but the question is whether we have
retained proportionality, because of the level to which we are
increasing the powers. I have voiced the Opposition&#146;s doubts on
that.</div><a name="08101460000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
could be that because the powers of investigation in the clause are
triggered only by an indictable offence, we move from a lax regime that
brings no prosecutions, to an extremely harsh regime, rather than to a
system that brings more prosecutions for non-indictable offences, say.
The enforcement authorities would have to go for an indictable offence
to get the investigatory powers, and I can understand why businesses
are concerned that we are going from one end of the spectrum to the
other.</div><a name="08101460000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is as far as I wish to take the matter at this stage, but on the basis
that we are going to think further about the measure, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="08101460000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000216"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I did not take part in the last discussion but I
listened carefully to all the points that were made. The Liberal
Democrats are minded to support the Government on the clause. It is
important to give HMRC the teeth to complete prosecutions when
appropriate. At the same time, we understand that HMRC might become
over zealous. However, given its record, I would suggest that that is
not likely. We are therefore happy to support the
Government.</div>
<a name="08101460000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000217"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I can understand what the Minister has said on the
clause, but to help with the policing of this measure and the minimum
wage, the understanding of business is an important part of the process
and allows the Inland Revenue and other bodies to do their job
correctly. I would want the Inland Revenue to take that into account in
its codes of practice, because the last thing we want&#151;I am sure
that the Minister would agree&#151;is an over-zealous approach to the
issue, which would do harm to the general involvement of business. We
do not want business becoming protective in this respect. I simply ask
the Minister to seek an understanding of that by the powers that be,
who are given increased powers by the
clause.</div><a name="08101460000163"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000218"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Part of the reason for the measures is the
criticism that the system is not zealous enough. We are told to be more
zealous but asked not to be too zealous. Our overall judgment is that
the system needs strengthening. HMRC has done a good job in recovering
arrears for workers&#151;it recovers &#163;3 million to &#163;4
million a year&#151;and we should not lose sight of that in a
discussion on strengthening the system.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div><a name="08101460000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
would not be introducing the measures if we thought that the current
system was perfect. We do want to strengthen it. I am sure that HMRC
will have heard what the hon. Gentleman said about taking care in
applying the proposals. I repeat what I said: in future, the vast
majority of cases of non-payment will be dealt with by a civil process
and the application of the new penalty procedure. I do not believe that
that will involve any more than a small minority of
cases.</div><a name="08101460000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also think that signals from Parliament are important, and the signal
that we are sending by legislating along these lines is that this is
not a voluntary option but the law of the land. We are strengthening
the penalty regime, and it will be possible to take the worst and most
persistent offenders not just to the magistrates court but to the Crown
court, where the potential fine is
unlimited.</div><a name="08101460000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000219"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We take a slightly different direction in this
clause, in the sense that its purpose is the avoidance of doubt. It
clarifies a question about entitlement that was posed to
us.</div><a name="08101460000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
combined cadet force&#151;the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet Force
and the Air Training Corps&#151;are voluntary, community-based
organisations. I am sure that we are all familiar with them and the
valuable and important work that they do throughout the country. They
currently engage about 130,000 young people in a range of challenging
and positive activities, using military themes based on the culture and
ethos of the armed forces. Cadet force adult volunteers, as used in the
Bill, is the generic term adopted by the Ministry of Defence to refer
to any adult who volunteers to assist alongside military personnel in
the delivery of the MOD-sponsored cadet force programme. There are
currently 26,000 such
volunteers.</div><a name="08101460000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
13 makes it clear that those adult volunteers do not qualify for the
minimum wage. It does not affect those who perform work for the cadet
forces in the course of Crown employment, nor does it affect any
entitlement that cadet force adult volunteers may have to the minimum
wage outside their activities as a cadet force adult
volunteer.</div><a name="08101460000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
volunteers have a long tradition of offering their time and effort for
free. However, along with the high level of responsibility that they
take on in their quasi-military role, there are features of being a
cadet force adult volunteer that might lead to their being deemed
workers, and therefore deemed as coming under the remit of the minimum
wage. For example, some of them undergo special security clearance,
which includes signing the Official Secrets Act; some are trained to
allow safe access to Ministry of Defence facilities and equipment,
including firearms, often to the same level as members of the armed
forces; and some sign personal declarations or agreements to undertake
certain standards of behaviour on joining that could be misinterpreted
as a form of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>employment contract. Although there is no legal entitlement to
remuneration, cadet force adult volunteers may be remunerated for
attendance at weekend training and summer
camps.</div><a name="08101460000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
features are unique to the cadet forces. They stem from their alignment
with the armed forces and enable their activities to take place in a
military environment and to integrate with the military chain of
command. Under the next clause, we will discuss the Bill as it affects
volunteering more widely, but for the purposes of this clause, we
wanted to make it clear, lest there was any doubt, that cadet force
adult volunteers are doing a very valuable job, but it is a voluntary
job that does not bring them into entitlement to the minimum
wage.</div><a name="08101460000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101460000220"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stephen Crabb</b> (Preseli Pembrokeshire) (Con): Has the
Minister or his Department received any representations from
individuals who serve as cadet force adult volunteers saying that they
should be entitled to the minimum

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000221"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We consulted on that. I do not think that there
were a huge number of representations, but the MOD and the Government
more widely were keen to clarify the situation. The exemption will
allow the volunteers to continue to operate as successfully as they do
now, while removing any doubt that exists about the minimum wage. It
will enable them to continue to deliver what are very valuable and
often exciting programmes of challenging developmental activity to
young people throughout the
country.</div><a name="08101460000114"></a>

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
14</h4><a name="08101460000008"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Voluntary
workers</div><a name="08101460000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000223"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> This clause, too, deals with voluntary workers,
but in a much wider sense. It broadens the scope of expenses that can
be reimbursed to voluntary workers without triggering eligibility for
the minimum wage. Again, I am sure that members of the Committee will
be appreciative of the hugely valuable work done by voluntary workers
in all our constituencies. The clause will mean that as well as being
able to reimburse expenses incurred in the performance of duties, which
has been the situation until now, organisations will be able to
reimburse expenses that were incurred to enable the voluntary worker to
perform the duties. That will enable expenses such as those for child
care and travel to and from voluntary work to be reimbursed should an
organisation wish to do that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="08101460000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We received
many representations about the issue from voluntary organisations
throughout the country. We do not seek to place barriers in the way of
voluntary work. In fact, we want to encourage, foster and promote it,
and the clause helps us with that. Voluntary workers are a very special
class of workers, both in the legal sense and in a more general sense.
They can be employed only by charities, voluntary organisations,
associated fundraising bodies or statutory bodies. The exemption for
voluntary workers means that they can continue to give their time for
free without being eligible for the minimum wage. In turn, it also
means that voluntary organisations can continue to benefit from their
dedication and pay them appropriate expenses, enabling them to carry
out the voluntary
work.</div><a name="08101460000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are determined to ensure that voluntary workers are not out of pocket
as a result of their good work, but at the same time it is important to
ensure that low-paid jobs beneath the minimum wage do not emerge in the
voluntary sector under cover of voluntary work. However, neither can we
allow spurious expenses to be claimed as benefits. The clause strikes
the right balance and minimises those
risks.</div><a name="08101460000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000224"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> On a drafting point, or perhaps something more than
that, proposed new subsection (1A)(a) refers clearly to
expenses</div><a name="08101460000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;incurred
in order to enable the worker to perform his
duties&#148;,</div><a name="08101460000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
proposed new subsection (1A)(c) refers to those that &#147;are not
accommodation expenses&#148;. That suggests that at no stage would a
voluntary worker need overnight accommodation. I do not understand why
one contradicts the
other.</div><a name="08101460000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000225"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right that accommodation
expenses are not covered by the clause, as is set out quite
clearly.</div><a name="08101460000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000226"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is it not the case that if the accommodation is
inside the building, the rules are different? I thought that there was
a difference between outside and internal
accommodation.</div><a name="08101460000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000227"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> That is not quite the difference. The difference
is that section 44 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 allows a
voluntary organisation to provide accommodation by paying rent directly
to a landlord, but it does not pay the rental costs to the voluntary
worker.</div>
<a name="08101460000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reimbursed
expenses must have been incurred, or reasonably estimated to have been
incurred, so reimbursement is always for an outlay. The expenses must
legitimately enable voluntary workers to perform their duties, and they
must not be reimbursed for expenses unrelated to their work.
Furthermore, those expenses must be reasonably incurred so that the
voluntary worker does not benefit from claiming excessive expenses. We
will issue guidance to voluntary organisations and volunteers
accompanying the changes in the
Bill.</div><a name="08101460000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
received a significant number of representations on that issue and the
clause was amended in the other place along the lines in front of us. I
believe that that gives significant reassurance to voluntary
organisations and workers that they can receive the appropriate
expenses to enable them to carry out their valuable work without
getting tied up with the minimum wage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000228"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We support the clause and have seen significant
evidence that voluntary workers have been left out of pocket because of
their inability to claim expenses. I would imagine that some likely
volunteers have been unable to volunteer because of that. We hope
therefore that the clause will encourage more people to
volunteer.</div><a name="08101460000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000229"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> We also support the clause and acknowledge the
tremendous work that volunteers do. It never ceases to amaze me just
how willing people are to give of their time, and it is right that they
should be reimbursed for any expenses that they incur. On the
accommodation aspect of the clause, will the Minister explain the
difference between someone finding accommodation and then having to get
the charity to pay the bill, and paying the bill themselves and then
submitting it to the charity? That could present some logistical
difficulties.</div>
<a name="08101460000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000230"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Accommodation was discussed in another place,
too. If an employer or landlord is providing free accommodation in
return for the work, the worker would be entitled to the minimum wage.
That is the case regardless of whether the worker is employed
elsewhere. We took the view that to make provision otherwise would
enable employers to provide accommodation in return for work rather
than pay the worker a wage. All the way through the Bill, we are trying
to strike a balance between appropriately supporting voluntary work and
workers without sanctioning a sub-minimum wage and a series of jobs
emerging around the voluntary sector. That will apply to child care,
travel expenses and accommodation, where the rent is paid directly to a
landlord. In the round, we think that that is the right balance to have
struck.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000231"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I will try not to repeat the fairly lengthy
discussion that we had about offences that are triable either way, in
the magistrates or Crown court. However, clause 15 covers very similar
ground, except that in this case we are talking about offences under
the Employment Agencies Act
1973.</div><a name="08101460000164"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="08101460000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
hon. Members will be aware, employment agencies and agency work have
been rising higher up the political agenda in recent years. The
Committee will be pleased to hear that I do not want to take us down
the highways and byways of European directives. However, at the same
time as we are strengthening enforcement of the minimum wage, we also
want to strengthen enforcement of the regulations surrounding agency
work.</div>
<a name="08101460000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,
under section 5(2) of the 1973 Act any breach of the regulations
governing employment agencies is a criminal offence, triable as a
summary offence in a magistrates court. The experience of the
Employment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>Agency Standards Inspectorate, which is the part of the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform that polices this area of
labour market providers, has been that, although the present approach
has proved effective for the great majority of agencies that are
reputable and wish to comply with the regulations, it has not been as
effective as it might be for the very few agencies that seek to avoid
their legal responsibilities and refuse to comply with the legislation.
This issue was taken up by Conservative Front Benchers, who asked me
several times why there were not more prosecutions under the agency
standards rules. That lack of prosecutions has been part of the problem
in this
area.</div><a name="08101460000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are difficulties related to the limitations of prosecution for summary
offences in terms of adequacy of penalties and limitations of
prosecution powers. The most significant problem occurs when an
individual who has been prohibited from running an agency, because of
their unsuitability on account of misconduct, ignores a ban on running
an agency. The maximum penalty for breach of a prohibition order is a
fine of &#163;5,000, as we discussed before when we talked about
other offences that are triable in a magistrates court. Such a fine may
not be an effective deterrent where the agency is highly
profitable.</div>
<a name="08101460000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
talking about quite specific circumstances here, where someone can be
prohibited from running an agency but they ignore that prohibition
because the activity is so profitable and the maximum fine is
&#163;5,000. In addition, the penalties may not be adequate for cases
where agencies illegally charge, or seek to charge, for work-finding
services, or where they fail to pay agency workers for the work that
they have
done.</div><a name="08101460000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the moment, under the current system there is no scope for the
Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate to prosecute for
&#147;attempting&#148; to commit offences under the legislation.
Again, this means that the inspectorate needs to identify witnesses who
are prepared to give evidence against the agency.</div>
<a name="08101460000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
someone who says that all agency work is at the dark end of the
economy; I do not believe that. I believe that many agencies give very
valuable flexibility and, often, highly paid work to the agency workers
whom they employ or find work for. Nevertheless, in some instances we
are dealing with dark corners of the labour market, and we know that in
those circumstances, relying on witnesses to come forward and give
evidence can be difficult. Therefore, we are again seeking here to
strengthen the enforcement regime. That can be difficult because some
people feel&#151;particularly when they may need to have repeated
contact with an agency to get work time after time on short
placements&#151;that if they give evidence, the work from that agency
may dry up. Of course, we also often deal with migrant workers who are
travelling to and from their home
countries.</div><a name="08101460000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
making the most serious offences under the 1973 Act triable
on indictment or summarily in magistrates courts, the maximum penalty
will be increased to an unlimited fine when the case is tried on
indictment under clause 15. The clause is important in ensuring that
there are appropriate parities for the most serious cases of offences
under the 1973 Act, for the reasons that I have set
out.</div><a name="08101460000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
circumstances are quite specific to agency work, such as issues to do
with the vulnerability of workers and the powers of the standards
inspectorate to prohibit  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>people from running agencies. The question of whether such prohibitions
can be properly enforced when contravening them can be highly
profitable gives rise to some issues. In those circumstances, we have
to ask ourselves whether a &#163;5,000 fine is high enough. The
judgment that the Government have made is that it is not. In those
circumstances, we seek the power to try such offences in a higher
court.</div><a name="08101460000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000232"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> On the question of the clause and the 1973 Act,
we feel that the extension of criminal chargeability is valid and
justifiable in these circumstances. We have seen instances where the
existing powers are not adequate, just as we said that we saw that the
powers were not adequate when discussing clause 11. To that extent, we
have not tabled any amendments and will support the
clause.</div><a name="08101460000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="08101460000017"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause

powers</div><a name="08101460000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000233"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause relates not so much to how offences
are tried as to the wider powers of the agency standards inspectors. It
will increase those powers by enabling inspectors to require a person
carrying on an agency to provide financial records and documents. It
will enable them to require records, documents and information at a
time and place that they may specify. It enables them to require banks
to provide financial information regarding agencies. I will say more
about that in a moment. The clause will also enable inspectors to
remove documents from an agency in order to take copies. We dealt with
some of those issues this morning when discussing minimum wage
enforcement.</div><a name="08101460000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
there are currently problems in assessing the scale of abuses, which
compromises the effectiveness of enforcement against rogue and
disreputable agencies. There is an absence of powers to obtain
financial records from agencies. For example, an agency worker may come
forward and say that the regulations are being contravened. They might
not be getting paid properly, or they might be being levied with
illegal deductions. Even if that case is proved, it can be difficult
for the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate to know whether it is
an isolated case or whether such practices are rife in the
company.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div><a name="08101460000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
investigating serious complaints, the inspectorate needs to find out
the scale of the illegal practices being carried out by agencies
brought to their attention. If illegal payments have been made or
illegal deductions taken, it must know whether those are isolated cases
or whether they are widespread. Given the reluctance of agency workers
to come forward, it may be that significant numbers of workers are in
the same situation and have not had the courage to report
it.</div><a name="08101460000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, the inspectorate does not have powers to obtain financial
information from an agency that does not want to provide that
information. An inspector does have the power to request any person
present on the premises to inform him of the whereabouts of any record
or document that is not on the premises and to make arrangements for it
to be made available. Frequently, the person on the premises is not the
person in charge of the agency. This is a particular difficulty when
dealing with a three-party relationship in which the hirer, the agency
and the worker are all involved. The person in the hiring company will
not necessarily know where those records are. Inspectors have
encountered difficulty in obtaining information from agencies where a
former member of staff may have removed self-incriminating evidence, or
where records are being withheld that may point to another
person&#146;s being involved in the running of the
agency&#151;again, in cases where there is a prohibition and so
on.</div>
<a name="08101460000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there are
a number of circumstances where extra information-gathering powers can
help. That is why we believe that the clause will strengthen the powers
of the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate and allow it to look
not just at individual cases reported to it but, on the basis of those
reports, to find the necessary information to enable it to judge
whether they are isolated incidents or a wider practice that requires a
wider
response.</div><a name="08101460000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101460000234"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Yes, we feel that the provisions are justified.
It is important to stress that we are dealing with a small number of
employment agencies here. The vast majority are excellent employers; in
fact they are among the best because of the nature of what they do.
However, in circumstances where wrong is being done, the situation
could be very bad, so provisions such as this are correct and we will
support the
clause.</div><a name="08101460000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
