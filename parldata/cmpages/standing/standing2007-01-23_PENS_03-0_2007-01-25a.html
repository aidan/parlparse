Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Taylor. Today is a very important day in the pensions
universe. This morning, the European Court of Justice is handing down
its judgment in a case brought by Amicus on behalf of former members of
the Allied Steel and Wire pension fund. That is massively important,
first, for the 125,000 people who have lost their pensions, secondly,
because of the estimated &#163;6 billion compensation bill that the
Government might be ordered to pay and, thirdly, because the Pension
Protection Fund might have to increase its levies on industry by 500
per cent. Has the Minister indicated to you whether he intends to let
us have copies of the judgment or to make a statementon
it?</div><a name="07012574000010"></a>

Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): I beg to move
amendment No. 69, in page 5, line 24, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(aa) the
amounts of the additional pension that different persons are entitled
to
receive;&#146;.</div><a name="07012574000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment to find out the Government&#146;s thinking not
only on this matter, but on how the total pension package will look
over time. The amendment would include the state second pension in the
general index-linking to earnings of the state pension.</div>
<a name="07012574000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 5 has been profoundly
welcomed. It is seen as righting a wrong done by the previous
Conservative Government by ensuring that the value of the basic state
pension keeps pace with the increase in earnings. However, the one
thing that seems to be missing from the list of items covered is the
state second pension, so the amendment would add it to the list. The
state second pension will be index-linked to earnings and accruals and
will keep pace with the rises in them as people pay in during their
working lives. However, in terms of paying out, it is not listed as one
of the items that will be linked with the rise in the level of
earnings. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 84</div></div><a name="07012574000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should make a couple
of points about that. First, I hope that the state second pension will
be a substantial part of people&#146;s income during retirement and I
have recently tabled several questions to find out how many people
receive it. I have not heard people talking about it much in my
constituency, but it is obviously relatively new and its impact has
perhaps not been fully felt. When it first came in, it was dubbed the
carers pension because it would particularly help people with lower
earnings and interrupted work patterns.</div>
<a name="07012574000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe, in fact, that the
level of state second pension will be quite substantial. My hon. Friend
the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that it will be
about 40 per cent. of people&#146;s income in retirement, where they
get both the basic state pension and the state second pension. For an
awful lot of other people, the real issue may be what is in their
personal accounts, occupational pensions and other pension schemes.
However, for those on lower earnings who get the carers credit, the
state second pension will be a really big component of their income
after retirement</div> <a name="07012574000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point that I want to stress to the Minister is that women are
particularly interested in the state second pension, and it is
important that their income in retirement is maintained. Of course,
women live longer than men, so it is even more important that a pension
that is designed for women should retain its value over a longer
period. As we have seen with the erosion of the value of the state
pension, if a pension is not linked to the rise in earnings, over the
longer time that women live during retirement, it will actually lose
value. In addition, the effect of a lack of index linking would, for
women, be more substantial.</div>
<a name="07012574000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The total package in the Bill
is extremely goodand the difference made to the income of
women pensioners will be important. However, it is also important, not
just that women retire on a decent income in their own right, but that
they continue to have that during retirement. Many women do not have
access to personal accounts, but we also know from the work of the
Turner commission that women do not have the same access to
occupational pensions. Therefore, the kind of package that is in the
Bill will be particularly important for them and the state second
pension will be a vital part of their retirement package. Will the
Minister set out what the thinking is on that issue? First, why was the
decision taken not to add additional pensions&#151;the state second
pension&#151;to the list in clause 5? Also will he set out what he
expects the pattern of women&#146;s income during retirement to be
and how their package will be made up?</div>
<a name="07012574000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">When talking to women in my
constituency, I am struck that it is not simply a matter of saying,
&#147;You have had your income and that&#146;s it,&#148; or
&#147;You have your occupational pension.&#148; While they are
working, women receive a package of income made up of different things
and in retirement they have a package of retirement income made up of
different bits of pension and benefits. How is it envisaged that that
package will be made up and, as the value of the state second pension
goes down, what will be brought in to get that income up again? It is
generally accepted that costs increase as people get older because they
need more fuel and they do not have mobility. As this is a probing
amendment to find out how the Bill will work in practical terms, could
the Minster say whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 85</div>the Government will monitor the gender issues surrounding the state
second pension? Also, over time, will they look at the impact of not
having the same index linking for the state second pension as for the
basic state pension and, in particular, would they consider a gender
impact assessment on that
issue?</div><a name="07012574000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The progress
made for women pensioners has been astounding. I know that the
Opposition do not like the pension credit, but it has been incredibly
important for women to maintain their income during retirement. The
carers credit and the state second pension have also been important
additions and the carers credit that is set out in the Bill will
transform the situation for many women. The arrangement in the Bill
will last decades, and as we move forward it is important that we do
not see an erosion of what should be a good and secure package for
women
pensioners.</div><a name="07012574000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000165"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for
Northampton, North for tabling and moving this amendment. I am equally
pleased that she confirmed that it is a probing amendment. She made
some interesting points, particularly about the effects of the Bill on
women, and I am sure that her comments were right. I do not want to
steal the Minister&#146;s thunder, but I suspect that the answer to
her fundamental question is that it would cost too much. However, I am
particularly keen to hear what he has to say about the cost of going
down that road.</div><a name="07012574000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I
correct one small thing? The hon. Lady said that the Conservative party
does not like pension credit. It is important to put on the record that
we would not have introduced it, but have no intention of scrapping it.
However, we want fewer pensioners subject to it as time goes on. As she
well knows&#151;she follows such things closely&#151;about 1.5
million pensioners do not claim pension credit who are entitled to do
so. I hope that that is
clear.</div><a name="07012574000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a real
issue here: the state second pension is an important lifeline for many
people and can makeall the difference to their standard of
living during retirement. There is a double whammy because not only are
the Government not proposing to uprate the S2P with earnings, as the
hon. Lady&#146;s amendment points out, but they are going to
flat-rate it, which will particularly affect medium and higher
earnings. We will debate that at greater length later, hence I have
kept my remarks rather short. She is approaching that from a different
direction, but it is important that we hear from the Minister the
Government&#146;s justification for leaving out the additional
pension from this important uprating
move.</div><a name="07012574000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07012574000166"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I welcome you back to the Chair,
Mr. Taylor, for today&#146;s debate on clause 5, which I
think is probably the most exciting part of the Bill&#151;if
excitement is the right word to use. The hon. Member for Northampton,
North has got us off to an interesting start by raising some important
points about how the state second pension will be uprated in the future
and what the implications will
be.</div><a name="07012574000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, my
party would prefer a better universal state pension at a higher level
earnings link. We have not, therefore, put down a probing amendment
like that of the hon. Lady. However, she has raised an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 86</div>important point that deserves discussion and a
response from the Minister. Her point is that we will still have a very
low basic state pension compared with other major developed countries
and will be flat-rating the state second pension. At some stage there
mightbe an aspiration to bring the two together. In the
meantime, we are moving away, philosophically, from the idea that the
state should provide a second pension related to earnings and towards
the assumption that people will have personal accounts and be
encouraged to save.</div>
<a name="07012574000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000167"></a>The
Minister for Pensions Reform (James Purnell):</b> I am very
interested in what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Will he clarify
something? His party&#146;s policy is to abolish the state second
pension. Through the state second pension, millions of people receive
about &#163;135 a week, which is more than the guaranteed pension
credit of &#163;115 a week. So would his party reduce the amount that
those people receive to &#163;115 a week? If not, how is his
party&#146;s package
affordable?</div><a name="07012574000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000168"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister knows very well that there are many
ways in which to implement a citizen&#146;s pension, including those
put forward by the National Association of Pension Funds and the
Pensions Policy Institute, that do not involve the type of losses about
which he is concerned. However, there is a legitimate concern, which
the hon. Member for Northampton, North raised, that many vulnerable
pensioners such as women who might not have a full work history, whom
the Government might once have intended should rely on a state second
pension, will not be able to do so on one that is earnings uprated.
Further problems might arise as a consequence of the extent of
means-testing in personal accounts. So she has raised legitimate
concerns about whether the pensions architecture that we are putting in
place, without the earnings link to the state second pension, will
serve those vulnerable groups. This preliminary debate has, therefore,
been
useful.</div><a name="07012574000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000169"></a>James
Purnell:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
again, Mr. Taylor. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the
Member for Northampton, North for tabling the amendment, because it
allows us to have what is an important debate about the state second
pension and our uprating proposals. It has also flushed out a couple of
interesting points about Opposition
policy.</div><a name="07012574000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the Liberal
Democrat policy on a state second pension, I notice that the hon.
Member for Yeovil ducked the question again, but he will not be able to
duck it for ever, because I think that about half of pensioners receive
more than &#163;115 from the pension system. They may receive that
through premiums on pension credit for being disabled or being carers.
The hon. Gentleman is not saying whether he would abolish those. Those
pensioners also receive more through the state second pension. Would
the hon. Gentleman set the citizen&#146;s pension at a level that was
higher than what all those people get&#151;at perhaps &#163;170 or
&#163;180 a week? Just going to &#163;115 for everyone would
mean&#163;5 on income tax, so if the hon. Gentleman proposes
a citizen&#146;s pension that involves no losers at all, there would
need to be a significant hike in public spending. I suspect that he
does not propose that, so he would have to take some money off some
people.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 87</div><a name="07012574000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We look forward to him telling
us how he will explain to the millions of pensioners who
receive&#163;130 or &#163;135 a week from their
combination of basic state pension and state second pension which
premiums he would abolish on pension credit. We have asked him that
question a number of times, but he has failed to answer it, and as long
as he does not answer it, we will assume that he would take money away
from
people.</div><a name="07012574000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07012574000170"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): The Minister said
that the proposal would mean an extra &#163;5 on income tax. Did he
mean an extra 5 per cent. on income

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000172"></a>Mr.

the suggestion that pension proposals would lead to an extra 5p on the
standard rate of income tax, it came from the Chancellor of the
Exchequer&#146;s own advisers when they tried to abort this very
reform? Given that, should we really take such suggestions
seriously?</div><a name="07012574000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000173"></a>The

subject of the amendment on the amendment
paper?</div><a name="07012574000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000174"></a>James
Purnell:</b> Absolutely. In fact, the very policy that the
hon. Member for Yeovil proposes was rejected by the Pensions
Commission, which he mentioned, so we notice that yet again he has
failed to answer the point. Until he does, we will not take him
seriously on the subject of
means-testing.</div><a name="07012574000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is important. It gives us an opportunity to talk about the
right way to do earnings uprating. That has been a hot topic for
Governments for many decades. The previous, Conservative Government
broke the link between the basic state pension and earnings. During the
past few years, the present Government have come under pressure to
increase the basic state pension in line with earnings, and we are now
doing so through the Bill, but only because we are able to take the
difficult decisions on the state pension age that make an increase
affordable for the long term. We can discuss that under later
amendments.</div><a name="07012574000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment opens up what will be a recurring theme throughout our
morning, which is affordability and sustainability. The Bill is part of
a carefully constructed package of reforms that we believe are
affordable and sustainable in both the short and the long
term.</div><a name="07012574000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pensions
Commission emphasised the importance of uprating the basic state
pension in line with earnings. It wanted that to be done to give people
a clear and stable set of incentives and certainties on which to build
their private saving. The commitment that we gave in the White Paper
was to link the basic state pension to rises in average earnings, and
the Pensions Bill delivers on that commitment. However, the effect of
the amendment would be to apply that to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 88</div>the value of any additional pension, and I am afraid that the hon.
Member for Eastbourne is right in that regard. I know that that is why
it is a probing amendment&#151;my hon. Friend wants the principles
behind what we are doing to be understood. It would add a further
&#163;14 billion to the annual pensions bill by 2050, which is 0.4
per cent. of GDP, but even setting aside the cost, neither we nor the
Pensions Commission think that it would be the right thing to
do.</div><a name="07012574000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
essential question is whether, within one envelope of public spending,
we should set the pension, at the start of people&#146;s retirement,
at a level that wecan uprate in line with earnings throughout
their retirement, or whether we should give them a bit more at the time
of retirement and then have it going up faster than inflation, but a
bit slower than earnings. We and the Pensions Commission believe that
the latter is better. When pensioners explain to us how they want to
spend their money, they say that they prefer to have a bit more when
they retire and then have an increase in line with a mixture of
earnings and inflation.</div>
<a name="07012574000139"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="07012574000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pensions
Commission said that pensions in accrual should track earnings and that
in retirement, pensions should maintain pensioners&#146; purchasing
power, but not necessarily rise beyond that. The commission also made
it clear that in retirement it is appropriate to maintain overall
pensioner incomes, which includes the state second pension, somewhere
between earnings and prices. The Government agree with this view
because, when one looks at the spending pattern of pensioners, one
finds it is reflected exactly by what they
do.</div><a name="07012574000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where people have
a choice at retirement they invariably choose a higher income over
protection against inflation. For instance, when people annuitise their
pension pots, most opt for the highest income possible&#151;many do
not even buy price indexation. However, it is not just evidence from
annuities that demonstrates that. Evidence from research carried out by
the Pensions Commission, and from independent research commissioned by
us, supports that view, showing that it would be more appropriate to
have a higher initial state second pension that is uprated by prices,
rather than a lower initial state second pension uprated by earnings.
To put it another way, to achieve what the amendment sets out in the
same spending envelope, we would have to reduce the amount that people
got at retirement, which is not what the evidence suggests that people
want.</div><a name="07012574000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Qualitative
research shows that the pensioners who feel worse off are those who
have most recently retired and have seen their income fall, compared
with the amount that they received in employment. The Pensions
Commission&#146;s first report shows that older pensioners are likely
to spend around three quarters of their income. Therefore, our proposed
reforms match the profile of pensioner spending. When pensioners
retire, they spend about 90 per cent. of their income, and they spend
about 75 per cent. of it when they get older. Our reforms match the
profile of that spending, which is highest at the point of retirement,
and uprated between inflation and earnings after
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 89</div><a name="07012574000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there is a further
problem with the amendment, which is that those contracted out of the
state second pension would also face considerable difficulty. We would,
in effect, require defined benefit schemes to provide earnings
indexation for that part of the occupational pension derived from the
state second pension, and the rest of the pension would be indexed in
line with inflation. No private scheme could face the burden of such
commitment and it is clear that additional funding would be required
through the national insurance rebate to provide for future
pensioners.</div> <a name="07012574000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, it is very difficult to imagine the sort of administrative
process we would need in place to identify and uprate the
contracted-out equivalent of the state earnings-related pension scheme
or the state second pension for current pensioners, or how we would
reimburse occupational pension schemes for paying an earnings uprated
element on the Government&#146;s behalf.</div>
<a name="07012574000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have explained to
my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North the reasons behind
what we have done, and why the Pensions Commission recommended it. For
those of us who think that the state second pension is an important
part of the contributory principle and do not want to take it away from
millions of people, the provisions represent the right way of uprating,
and I hope, therefore, that she will be satisfied and withdraw her
amendment.</div>
<a name="07012574000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000175"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I am grateful for that explanation, which sets out
the practical problems and the costs very clearly. I hope that the hon.
Member for Yeovil has not been totting up my bill, thus making it
&#163;15 billion that I have spent. It would be helpful if the
Government would give assurances that they will monitor the impact of
the provisions, particularly on women. If women have only the state
pension and state second pension on retirement, it is important that
they do not find that their position
deteriorates.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000176"></a>James

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000177"></a>Ms

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000178"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in
page 5, line 26, at end insert</div>
<a name="07012574000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;including those claimed by
British citizens living
abroad&#146;.</div><a name="07012574000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rise
with enthusiasm and some trepidation to speak to this amendment. I
should point out that I was criticised&#151;scolded, even&#151;by
the hon. Member for Northampton, North the other day for speaking too
briefly on one of my amendments. She encouraged me to speak for longer
periods. I think it was Oscar Wilde who said that there are two
tragedies in life, one is not getting what you want, the other is
getting what you want. He said that the latter is the real tragedy.
Today, I am afraid that the hon. Lady may get what she asked for,
because the clause covers many important issues on which we may want to
spend more time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 90</div><a name="07012574000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not only taken the hon.
Lady&#146;s advice about the length of my speeches, but learned
tremendously from the way in which she presents her expensive
amendments, which gives me extraordinary cover for my modest proposals.
She describes her amendments as probing, and apparently those words
mean thatthe Minister cannot attribute any excessive public
expenditure to them.</div>
<a name="07012574000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000179"></a>James
Purnell:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman propose a probing
manifesto when he goes to the
electorate?</div><a name="07012574000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000180"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I do not propose a probing manifesto; today I
propose a probing amendment. I want to encourage a good debate by
reassuring Members from all parties that I shall not press for a
Division. I hope that we can have a constructive and intelligent
debate, without people worrying about having to vote one way or the
other. At the end of my speech I shall discuss the financial issues
that relate not only to the amendment, but to the financial issues
behind amendment No. 28 and some of the other proposals that we have
tabled for discussion today.</div>
<a name="07012574000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that at that stage,
Mr. Taylor, you will feel that my comments have been in
order, and I hope also that my strategy will have saved time in the
later debate on amendments to the earnings link. I shall of course bow
to your judgment about what is in order and try to keep strictly to the
financial issues that relate to the amendment before us.</div>
<a name="07012574000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I promise the
Minister&#151;and other Members who want to discuss the financial
issues that relate to the amendment and to the different
proposals&#151;that I shall spend time at the end of my speech
discussing those issues. Following that would be the obvious time for
the Minister to make the points that I know he will make.</div>
<a name="07012574000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope, however, that we can
have a sensible and constructive debate. I am conscious that this is
not a single-party issue. Members from all parties have spoken
passionately in the Commons and in another place about the injustice
that the amendment seeks to address. When I sat on a Delegated
Legislation Committee recently, to which the Under-Secretary responded,
the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) made an excellent
speech about the injustices and consequences of the way in which UK
pensions are uprated. I am also conscious that many Labour Members have
spoken about the issue. The hon. Member for Tooting (Mr.
Khan) secured an Adjournment debate not that long ago.</div>
<a name="07012574000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a serious issue about
the way in which people who have lived in the United Kingdom and are
entitled to the basic state pension have it uprated when they decide to
move abroad. One group of pensioners receives the uprating in line with
the retail prices index, which everybody in this country receives, but
another group of pensioners in about 150 countries does not receive any
uprating at all. Their pension is frozen at that level while they
remain overseas. When they come back, it is returned to the level that
it would have been at had the pensioners remained in the United
Kingdom.</div> <a name="07012574000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
the fact that the Minister has met Mr. John Markham, who
represents a group of pensioners from several different countries. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 91</div>Minister will know how passionately they feel about that potential
injustice. The reason why it is so important is that the Bill will
change the uprating mechanism from prices to earnings. Unless I have
got it wrong&#151;if I have, I hope the Minister will stop me now
before I make a fool of myself&#151;it is proposed to uprate a number
of countries by earnings rather than by prices. The other lot, in the
other 150 countries, will be uprated at zero&#151;they will not
receive anything atall. In other words, the existing injustice
will be considerably magnified. I shall discuss whether the current
situation is unfair and then turn to the financial consequences of
dealing with it, what the options might be, what is affordable or
unaffordable, and what might be a reasonable way forward.</div>
<a name="07012574000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since I have
had this portfolio&#151;it is about 18 months, but that is a long
time in the world of work and pensions&#151;I have raised this matter
several times, but I always receive an unusual response. Even the
Minister for Pensions Reform, for whom I have a great deal of
admiration, and his predecessor, who did an excellent job, seemed
mystified that I had raised the issue.</div>
<a name="07012574000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is odd coming from a
Labour Government, because uprating arrangements for the pensions of
those who live abroad represent an enormous injustice. They are totally
arbitrary and illogical. The Labour Government committed themselves in
1997 to deal with unfairness in society. Indeed, a junior spokesman had
already made a commitment to address the issue if the party got into
power. The Government should be concerned; they should not respond as
if it was an oddity or the obsession of only a few Members.</div>
<a name="07012574000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that those in the
governing party do not think that those pensioners are rather affluent
Tories who have gone abroad, and that they can be written off because
they are not going to vote for the Government or are not sympathetic to
their party, or because they do not have voting rights abroad. I do not
think that that is so. However, we are certainly talking about people
who may have different political views.</div>
<a name="07012574000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should also
remember&#151;I hope we do, if our debates descends into a
party-political knockabout&#151;that many of those people can still
exercise their vote in the United Kingdom. Indeed, I hope that they
will make their voice heard in the debate on pensions. They also have
families in the UK who will have strong views on the subject. Indeed,
many in the UK who may think of moving abroad in future will want the
Government to put in place arrangements that give them the real freedom
to decide where to go.</div>
<a name="07012574000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over recent years, a number of
Ministers have defended the existing situation, saying that people have
a free choice about where to go, and that they should go to countries
where we have special uprating arrangements. In the modern world, our
aspiration is for citizens to be free to make their own decisions; the
idea that they should be influenced by arbitrary historic arrangements
on whether the countries that they choose will allow their basic
pension to be uprated is ludicrous. As a Liberal Democrat, I feel
passionate about that, and I hope that other Members do too.</div>
<a name="07012574000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although it seems a bit of an
oddity&#151;it sounds as if it affects a rather small number of
people&#151;it affects an increasingly large number. The number
drawing state 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 92</div>pensions and living abroad has risen rapidly. It was 575,800 in 1990;
and in 2003 it was 952,000. I do not have a figure for 2005-06, but I
suspect that it is more than 1 million. Only 11 million or 11.5 million
people are drawing the basic state pension, so we will pretty soon get
to the state when one in 10 of our pensioners live overseas.</div>
<a name="07012574000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment, more than half
of the pensioners who live overseas have their pensions frozen. It is
not a minor issue that affects only a few people. It affects many, and
because of the huge disparity in property prices between the UK and
abroad there will be an increasing pull for people to move
abroad.</div><a name="07012574000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000181"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Would the hon. Gentleman accept that many of those
who retire and go abroad are not casting around for where the weather
is better and the living is cheaper? An awful lot are returning to
their families or to their countries of origin after spending their
working lives in this country. It is not quite the pattern that he
presents.</div><a name="07012574000140"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000184"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> It may simply be factual, but I see it as a helpful
fact. The view of Ministers sometimes seems to be that provided that
people are well informed and that the DWP does its job, they can choose
to go to the United States rather than Canada, or pick the right island
in the Caribbean, where some have the arrangements and some do not.
That is not how life works, however. People may have family links, and
if they have a relative abroad who becomes very ill, they may want to
live near them or take up caring responsibilities. My noble Friend Lord
Jones of Cheltenham made a very good speech in the Lords&#151;his
maiden speech&#151;on this subject. He cited several cases that
demonstrate that there is clearly unfairness in the existing
arrangements that people cannot easily avoid simply by picking one of
the random countries where we have the uprating
arrangement.</div><a name="07012574000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that we can have a sensible debate about this issue. I said at the
beginning of my speech that I rose to speak with some trepidation. That
is because this subject has been considered in the House for so long.
When we debated it recently in another Committee,in which the
Under-Secretary was the responding Minister, I gave the following quote
from paragraph 8 of the 1996 report of the Select Committee on Social
Security:</div> <a name="07012574000133"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the early 1960s, criticism of the policy began to build up. By 1963,
the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance was regularly receiving
correspondence from MPs and from pensioners living abroad protesting at
the unfairness of not paying increases to those living
abroad.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, First Standing Committee on
Delegated Legislation,</i> 15 May 2006; c.
4.]</div><a name="07012574000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid that this issue
has been going on for some time. There must be an enormous file
somewhere in the DWP that the Minister could look through, unless it
was lost in the fires of the 1960s, the floods of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 93</div>1970s or the transfer of the Department from one spot to
another&#151;or perhaps it was shredded by some Minister.</div>
<a name="07012574000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue has also been dealt
with in the courts in the past two years, and it may well be again. I
hope that, if we do not make some movement in this place, the courts
might prod us into doing so. There is a fundamental injustice here of
the type that the courts are increasingly being given the power to
challenge. The current judicial view is mostly that this is very much
an issue for Parliament. Lord Justice Laws, who is no obvious relation
of mine, said in 2002
that</div><a name="07012574000134"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the remedy of the
expatriot united kingdom pensioners who do not receive uprated pensions
is political, not judicial. The decision to pay them uprated pensions
must be made by
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="07012574000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an
issue on which we in this place should make a
decision.</div><a name="07012574000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The details
of the situation are relatively well known. I shall not take to heart
too much the encouragement of the hon. Member for Northampton, North to
speak for ever, citing all the countries that have frozen
pensions.</div><a name="07012574000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07012574000185"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Russell Brown</b> (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab): I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will excuse my ignorance; I genuinely do not know
the answer to this question. Perhaps he can help me. If a pensioner
lives overseas but their income puts them into a category in which they
must pay tax, where do they pay it&#151;in the UK or in the country
where they
live?</div><a name="07012574000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000186"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister may correct me, but I do not believe
that such a pensioner would pay tax in the UK. Of course, neither would
they receive the benefits that they would have in the UK, such as the
use of the NHS. The hon. Gentleman makes a serious and proper point
about the balance of financial advantage to the UK of having people
move abroad. We might, as he fairly suggests, lose some tax revenue
from people who move abroad, although if they are receiving only the
basic state pension, they are likely not to pay much tax anyway, given
the level of personal allowances for senior citizens. Nevertheless, he
raises a serious point, which I shall take up later in my speech, about
the need to understand better how much we are saving as a consequence
of people moving abroad and how much more we would have to spend under
the proposal. Whatever his view on whether we should uprate pensions
for those who move abroad, however, we surely cannot defend the current
situation, in which some are uprated and some are not. He will know
that even Ministers have admitted that the situation cannot be defended
on the basis of any logical and rational
system.</div><a name="07012574000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000187"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> On the point about the balance of advantage, has
the hon. Gentleman given any thought to pensioners from Australia and
Canada, for example, who are resident in this country and do not get
uprated pensions and so may claim means-tested benefits here? On the
other hand, the Exchequer may save costs respecting poorer pensioners;
although there is an assumption that these are all wealthy people going
abroad who might entertain the Prime Minister for his holidays, those
who are relatively poor might go to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 94</div>Spain because they will not have to pay a lot of heating bills, but
might claim means-tested benefits to top up their pensions from Spain
or any other foreign
country.</div><a name="07012574000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000188"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an excellent point. The
debate and any changes would need to happen in the context of
reciprocal arrangements so that there was some fairness. If we were
proposing changes, we would expect that back from other countries. It
is worth mentioning briefly which countries we are talking about. My
understanding is that those counties with uprating
arrangements&#151;I take this from a parliamentary answer from
October 2004&#151;are those within the European economic area,
including Gibraltar, and those with which the United Kingdom has
reciprocal arrangements, which include Barbados, Bermuda, the Channel
Islands, Israel, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, the Philippines,
Switzerland, Turkey, the USA and the separate republics of the former
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. About 152 other countries do not have
uprating arrangements, and Members might be interested to know that the
gender impact is that a disproportionate number of the individuals
affected by the failure to uprate are women. We have a relatively
recent parliamentary
answer&#151;</div><a name="07012574000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000189"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The hon. Gentleman used the word
&#147;disproportionate&#148;. Are the figures around somewhere? I
would be interested to see
them.</div><a name="07012574000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000190"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Yes. The figures that I have probably go back a
couple of years, but the Minister might have some more up-to-date
figures. When the parliamentary answer to which I referred was
received, some 478,000 pensioners&#146; pensions were frozen. There
are now some 520,000, so the proportions will not be far off. Of those
478,000, about 288,000 were female and 191,000 male. Perhaps that
reflects life expectancy issues to some extent, but it also underlines
the fact that somebody moving abroad, of either sex, who ends up living
for a long period after they move will end up feeling the squeeze from
the failure to uprate. Not only will their pensions not only fall
behind earnings and the income of the rest of the population, which is
usually the issue of concern to this place when we talk about people
living in this country, but potentially fall in real terms.</div>
<a name="07012574000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a long list of
individual countries where uprating does not take place, because that
is the case in the majority of countries; there are about 152 such
countries. A great deal of frustration and mystification is caused by
the fact that many of those countries are the Commonwealth countries,
which we have close relationships with and which a lot of people move
to. The latest figures that I have on that, from February 2006, which
are from a parliamentary answer of December 2006, show that there are
about 240,000 such pensioners living in Australia and 153,000 in
Canada. We should bear it in mind that those who move over the border
to the United States of America do have their pensions uprated, whereas
people in Canada do not. There are also 46,000 such pensioners in New
Zealand and 37,000 in South Africa. I understand that pensioners in
those four countries make up 90 per cent. of the pensioners whose
pensions are frozen.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 95</div><a name="07012574000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some extraordinary
anomalies, which people frequently raise. The hon. Member for Daventry,
who spoke for the Conservatives during our debate on the issue last
year, mentioned something that I had not spotted&#151;the uprating in
Guadeloupe and Martinique, which are both French overseas territories
and therefore fall under the European Union rules. However, in other
countries out in the Caribbean there is no uprating. Indeed, there are
considerable differences even among the countries with which we have
close links. For example, people living in Bermuda, Gibraltar and the
sovereign-based area in Cyprus all have their UK state pensions
uprated, but those on the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands,
the Falkland Islands, Montserrat, Pitcairn Island and St. Helena, and
those in the dependencies, do not receive the uprating. That is an
additional bizarre situation, in which pensioners in British overseas
territories do not receive the
uprating.</div><a name="07012574000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s excuse at times has been that they were not able to
negotiate reciprocal arrangements with other countries. However, in
this case they would be negotiating with themselves, so one would have
thought that it would be quite easy to secure an agreement. Those in
the know will also be aware that if there were any pensioners on the
British Antarctic Territory and the British Indian Ocean Territory,
they would also have their pensions frozen&#151;frozen pensions in
the Antarctic is one of the in-jokes of the frozen pension world, so I
thought that I would give the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare an
opportunity to contribute on that
point.</div><a name="07012574000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
current situation. The question is why we got there. My understanding
from listening to the debates and the ministerial explanations to date
is that we got there in part because when the situation first arose of
significant numbers of people moving abroad from the UK, the basic
state pension was not regularly uprated each year. As the helpful
Library briefing note for the Bill
confirms:</div><a name="07012574000135"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
statutory duty to increase state pensions annually in line with
inflation was first introduced by section 39 of the Social Security Act
1973&#148;,</div><a name="07012574000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">with the first
uprating of that type in 1975. The briefing
continues:</div><a name="07012574000136"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before
this, pensions, and other National Insurance benefits, had been
increased at irregular intervals by a series of National Insurance
Acts.&#148;</div><a name="07012574000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was perhaps
not the same assumption as exists today that prices would rise year on
year in a way that necessitated an automatic annual uprating.</div>
<a name="07012574000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">By the late &#146;60s and the
early &#146;70s, when inflation rose to historically high levels, it
became necessary to uprate social security benefits annually to prevent
people from falling behind in real terms. The uprating was introduced,
and the 1974 Labour Government linked pensions to earnings&#151;a
link that was broken in Lord Howe&#146;s first Budget after the 1979
election.</div> <a name="07012574000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems
to be the explanation of how we got out of the habit of automatic
upratings, although another explanation was given by a participant in
one of the debates in the House of Lords. The issue was debated by the
Cabinet in the 1970s, when there was concern about the outflow of
foreign exchange from the United 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 96</div>Kingdom. At that time, we had an unhealthy balance of payments and the
exchange rate was constantly in the news, which was used as a further
constraint and reservation in relation to annual
upratings.</div><a name="07012574000141"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="07012574000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are now in a
very different situation, and Ministers have acknowledged that that
situation does not have a strong logic. Indeed, in a debate initiated
by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) in the Commons in
2000, Lord Rooker admitted that the existing situation was illogical.
Referring to the issue of which countries are uprated and which are
not, he
said:</div><a name="07012574000137"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I have
already said that I am not prepared to defend the logic of the present
situation. It is illogical. There is no consistent
pattern.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 13 November 2000; Vol.
356, c. 628.] </div><a name="07012574000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the debate
that we had relatively recently in Committee, the Under-Secretary, who
is with us today, acknowledged that aspects of the existing situation
were not necessarily logical. He also mentioned that upratings were
less frequent in previous periods than they are now, which is partly
why we are in the present situation.</div>
<a name="07012574000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I mentioned earlier, my
noble Friend Lord Jones of Cheltenham devoted part of his maiden speech
to this issue in the Lords on 25 October 2005. I commend him on
selecting the slightly unconventional subject of people living outside
the United Kingdom for his speech. He made a powerful case against the
unfairness of the existing system and recalled a constituent from his
time as the Member for Cheltenham. She had wanted to move to Canada to
be with her son and the rest of her family in the later period of her
life. She then found out about the frozen pensions rule, but she
initially thought that it was simply an administrative glitch and that
it would be resolved in short order when the Government found out that
it existed. After a while, however, she found that it simply would not
be resolved. She told my noble Friend that if she did not move abroad,
it would be too late and she would die. She therefore moved out to
Canada, but she now lives in very straitened
circumstances.</div><a name="07012574000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
demonstrates the point that we discussed earlier. For some people, this
is not simply an issue of moving to a country where they can get an
uprating and where the temperature averages above 80 F for most
of the year. People have other links&#151;often family
links&#151;with countries, which means that they cannot pick and
choose which country to move to without severe personal
consequences.</div> <a name="07012574000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
noble Friend cited two other issues to highlight the potential
injustice of the current provisions. One was the small number of
British overseas territories. There is particular frustration about the
way in which the current anomalies affect pensioners there. The small
number of pensioners who live in those countries&#151;at the time, it
was about 572&#151;are not covered. It is a great irony that
successive Governments have voiced commitment to places such as the
Falkland Islands and spent billions defending them in recent years for
reasons that we all know, but that people who moved to such places from
the United Kingdom do not have their pensions uprated. My noble Friend
met the commissioner from the Pitcairn Islands, where, at the time, no
individuals were affected by the regulations. However, the commissioner
told my noble Friend that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 97</div>he would be retiring and would be caught by them. He was therefore a
particularly strong supporter of my noble Friend&#146;s suggestions.
I shall return to the financial aspects of the issue
later.</div>
<a name="07012574000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000191"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The Falkland Islands are a slightly different
case. Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that it is perhaps not best to
base his argument on the needs of people in the overseas territories?
Their needs are indeed substantial, but they do not relate to
expatriate pension requirements. Their numbers are tiny and the
circumstances are very particular.</div>
<a name="07012574000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000192"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her comments. As
she will know, my case is not that we should have an unlevel playing
field; I am simply seeking to highlight the injustices and
irrationality of the existing system. If any of us bumped into someone
on the street and told them about that bizarre situation and explained
that people in some British overseas territories do not get
uprated&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> This is a discussion that we have
the whole time in pubs in Yeovil. I do not know what the Minister
discusses in his constituency, but compared with many issues, this one
affects a lot people. I do not want to get too party political,
however, because I am trying to keep the debate on a higher
plain.</div><a name="07012574000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07012574000193"></a><b class="B">Mark

different parts of the Committee.The hon. Gentleman is

for Northampton, North is egging me
on.</div><a name="07012574000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000195"></a>Ms

way?</div><a name="07012574000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000196"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I shall just clarify one point. The hon. Gentleman
will be delighted to know that I am coming to the end of section 3 of
my speech, which is about why the existing system is unfair, and
reaching the large and extensive section 4. I suspect that he has been
looking over my shoulder and spotted that I am coming on to how we deal
with the financial issues. He will be reassured by that. But first I
shall give way to the hon. Lady, who is urging me
on.</div><a name="07012574000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000197"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> On the subject of higher plains, airports are the
main thing that the overseas territories need, so the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s talk of expatriates&#146; pensions is obscuring
the issue. He must stick to the relevant
areas.</div><a name="07012574000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000198"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> As ever, the hon. Lady is trying to outspend me in
commitments to build airports. All I am asking is that some 572
pensioners get their uprating. I hope that that was a probing
suggestion that she
made.</div><a name="07012574000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a final
serious point to make about unfairness before I move on to the
substantial section of my speech dealing with finances. My noble
Friend 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 98</div>Lord Jones referred to the possibility that in future, some people in
this country who are at or just over the conventional retirement age
might want to move to other countries, perhaps to do voluntary work or
to use their skills in the developing world. He spoke about people with
medical expertise wanting to go to Botswana to help deal with the
HIV/AIDS pandemic. Some overseas Governments want people from the
United Kingdom with such skills to settle in their countries and to
help.</div><a name="07012574000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does it make
sense that we should prevent people from exercising their own free
choice&#151;this is why Ifeel passionately about the
issue&#151;by penalising or rewarding them financially for choosing a
particular country? Whether people like it or not, we live in a world
in which it is easy for people to move to different countries, take
advantage of our fantastic planet and not to get stuck in one place.
Governments have no right to impede people&#146;s free decisions to
live where they
like.</div><a name="07012574000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07012574000199"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Adrian Bailey</b> (West Bromwich, West) (Lab/Co-op): I
listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s summary of the
speech made by the noble Lord Jones. Did Lord Jones indicate in his
speech whether he might come under any of the categories outlined by
the hon.
Gentleman?</div><a name="07012574000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000200"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> No, and neither would I make plans, even under a
Conservative Government, to flee abroad at the first possibility,
although I do not rule out such things. However, I would want Lord
Jones and the hon. Gentleman to be absolutely free to make such
decisions and not to feel that the choice of where they spend their
long retirement or dying days&#151;however the period is
described&#151;is being determined by politicians selecting
particular countries as worthy of being dealt with
differently.</div><a name="07012574000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn
now to finances, which I am being urged to come on to.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare will be
reassured to know that this will be the final stage of the
introduction. Ministers have admitted that the existing arrangements
are illogical. I am not singling out the Minister here: I think that
both Government and Conservative Front Benchers have pointed out the
large costs involved in tackling the issue. Of course, such things must
be taken extremely seriously. However, when Ministers talk about the
cost, they do so in terms that are designed not to solve the problem,
but to block serious consideration of it. The figure that they start
bandying around&#151;I shall save the Minister some
time&#151;is&#163;3 billion, which they say would be the
cost of implementing the reform in its most ambitious terms. I use the
figures that relate to the prices link; only recently did we establish
what the Government intend to do on earnings, and we will need those
figures to be
uprated.</div><a name="07012574000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to
take an intervention if I am wrong, but I understand that the &#163;3
billion figure is the cost not only of moving from a frozen pension to
a prices uprated pension for future upratings and future pensioners,
but of doing that for all pensioners who now live abroad&#151;even
those who moved abroad 30 or 40 years ago. The figure represents the
cost of bringing their existing pensions up to the same level as in the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 99</div>United Kingdom. Moreover, it also includes the cost of compensating
them&#151;the Minister must let me know if I am wrong&#151;for all
the money that they did not receive over the past 10, 20, 30 or 40
years as a consequence of their pensions not being uprated.</div>
<a name="07012574000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">No one, not even the hon.
Member for Northampton, North, with her generous probing amendments,
seriously suggests that we should go back and tell a pensioner who
moved to Australia in 1960&#151;I do not know whether they would
still be alive&#151;not only that we will bring their pension up to
the current level, but that we will refund all the money that
wasnot paid right back to 1960. That would be
absurd.Not even the most enthusiastic pensioner groups
realistically expect that to be delivered. Can we therefore put the
&#163;3 billion to one side, and acknowledge that no one is asking
for all those missing payments to be
made?</div><a name="07012574000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that, in an excellent contribution to an earlier debate, the
hon. Member for Worthing, West said that it is worth bearing in mind
what that &#163;3 billion means. It is the money that we have saved
by not paying those pensions to people who have moved abroad. That
emphasises the fact that it is money that has been lost to those
pensioners; it is not remotely what it would cost to make a sensible
forward-looking change.</div>
<a name="07012574000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other cost that Ministers
give is more sensible; it is for the more plausible policy that the
overseas pensioner groups are pressing for. That policy would be to
have upratings hereon, using the retail prices index or whichever
measure is being used for pensions in the United Kingdom, and
presumably to bring the pensions up to the existing UK level. Instead
of rebating people for the 20 or 30 years during which they received
low pensions, we would bring their pensions up to the existing basic
state pension level and index it. The Government have given figures for
that over the years of about &#163;400 million per annum. That is not
an immodest sum, given how much the Chancellor of the Exchequer plays
with each year in his Budget, although I note that he always seems to
find another &#163;400 million or &#163;500 million for odd
gimmicks, particularly before general
elections.</div><a name="07012574000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is one
option, although I do not think that it would find favour with any of
the three main parties in the House, as I have not only said in earlier
debates, but stated straightforwardly to the overseas pensioner groups
that have come to see me and will also have seen the hon. Member for
Eastbourne and others. Given all the other public expenditure
priorities, no Government would be willing to bring up to the level of
the basic state pension the pensions of those who knowingly moved
abroad under such circumstances a number of years
ago.</div>
<a name="07012574000142"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="07012574000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must look
for a solution that deals with unfairness in a way that is financially
manageable. In the light of the amount of time left, I will save my
speech about costs until the earnings uprating discussion, as that may
be a more suitable time for such remarks. Nevertheless, in terms of any
changes made to the Bill, we need something that is sensible and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 100</div>affordable, and I assure the Minister that at thegeneral
election we will propose a better deal for pensioners&#151;in
contrast to the Labour party and to the Conservatives, who seem to be
promising not to pay out any
more.</div><a name="07012574000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000201"></a>Mark
Pritchard:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="07012574000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000202"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> No, I will finish this section and then give
way.</div> <a name="07012574000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, we
will state in clear terms what our pension promises are, how we will
deliver them, how the costings will work and how we will pay for them,
in the same way as we do for all our manifesto. The Minister can then
comment on that.</div> <a name="07012574000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me make a suggestion to the Minister on what the Government should be
looking at in relation to earnings uprating. The hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire proposed a new clause the other day that
highlighted a particular problem and talked about the types of changes
that might be sensible and affordable, although he did so in
particularly rigorous terms, so as to meet the constraints of the
shadow Chancellor by making his figure a zero sum. My proposal would
bring the costs down massively from the figures of &#163;3 billion
and &#163;400 million.</div>
<a name="07012574000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would start to uprate
pensions from where we are now. Of course, the cost would grow over
time; the cost of all Government expenditure grows over time, as does
the tax revenue, which grows at the rate of earnings, as the Minister
well knows. That cost would be much lower, however, at about &#163;15
million or&#163;20 million, on the basis of a prices link in
the first year. Obviously, the cost would grow after that and would be
significant in 10 or 20 years&#146; time, but the figure of
&#163;15 million or &#163;20 million is much more manageable. My
proposal would be fairer to pensioners who move abroad from now, and
would in a small way ameliorate the situation for existing
pensions.</div> <a name="07012574000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise
for taking up so much time, but this is an important issue. I hope that
the ministerial responses will not be based on the assumption that we
are proposing all sorts of things that are totally uncosted and
unmanageable. Instead, please may we have the assumption that there is
unfairness and that we should all think about how any party might
introduce affordable solutions? Can we please think about the issue in
terms of the problem that is now emerging as a consequence of the
Government&#146;s plan to earnings uprate some countries and not
others? That will mean the gap between people in different countries
and their sense of injustice will grow even more rapidly.</div>
<a name="07012574000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see how Governments of
any party can ignore that injustice for ever. If the Minister said,
&#147;Yes, I accept that. We will look at the possibilities of doing
something about it, although we may phase the process over years and
years to make it affordable&#148;, at least we would be finding some
way out of a problem that we have been trapped in for 44 years. It is
depressing that there is a sense from the Government that this is an
illogical situation and that nobody is willing to think of any way out
of it.</div> <a name="07012574000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">If all that
the Minister was willing to say today&#151;this would be a very big
step in Government policy, so he will probably not say it, much though
I would like him 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 101</div>to do so&#151;was that he would ask Lord Turner or another suitable
person to look at the issue and propose an affordable solution, it
would be a positive development. He could report back in a
year&#146;s time if that was necessary, but if he would only be
willing to look for a solution that would deal with this injustice, I
would be enormously relieved and gratified.</div>
<a name="07012574000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a social injustice
here and we have to think of affordable ways of correcting it.
Sometimes, fairness has a price, and I hope that the Minister will
explain how he intends to end the existing unfairness and how the
Government could think about paying the price in a way that would not
impose an unacceptable
burden.</div><a name="07012574000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000203"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Yeovil for
engineering this debate within the confines of the Bill. The issue is
important and deserved the exhaustive examination that he gave it. I
was interested to see that he seems to be suffering from a fit of
financial continence today, compared with the first sitting of the
Committee. I wonder whether that has anything to do with the brief chat
that I had at a reception last night with his hon. Friend the Member
for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who seemed a little taken aback at what I
had to say about Liberal Democrat spending
commitments.</div><a name="07012574000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000204"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that
there is not a lettuce leaf between me and my hon. Friend the Member
for Twickenham, who not only fully agrees with all our proposals on
pensions but&#151;I should make this clear&#151;reports back
everything that he learns from the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="07012574000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000205"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b><b class="B"> </b>All I can say is that in an admittedly
brief conversation, the hon. Member for Twickenham did growl at me that
what I mentioned were not spending commitments. However, one
man&#146;s spending commitment is&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Yes,
it is another man&#146;s probing amendment&#151;or another
lady&#146;s. I have to say that, in my years of serving on Standing
Committees, I do not think that I have ever come across a probing
amendment that cost &#163;14 billion, but who knows? Perhaps there is
one lurking out
there.</div><a name="07012574000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">This important
issue is also a long-standing one. It certainly bubbled to the surface
of my mailbag quite rapidly when I was first elected in 1992. The hon.
Member for Yeovil described how it had begun to build since the 1960s.
I pay tribute to John Markham, who I think has met all the Front
Benchers now. He is a powerful advocate for Canadian residents in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 102</div>situation described and he speaks for the Canadian Alliance of British
Pensioners.</div><a name="07012574000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
already seen the figures. Roughly 1 million UK pensioners live abroad,
although that figure is going up all the time, and about half get the
uprating and half do not. I recently tabled a series of questions on
the issue, and the hon. Gentleman was good enough to quote from the
answers to one or two of them. He set out in more detail than I intend
to do the vast list of countries where the uprating does not take
place. Numerically, we are talking mostly about Australia&#151;the
latest figures that I have show that there are about 220,000 such
people there&#151;Canada, where there are 142,000, and South Africa,
which I think has the third highest number, with nearly
35,000.</div><a name="07012574000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
schedule to the relevant answer lists many countries where the uprating
does not take place. As the hon. Gentleman said, it depends on
countries being in the European economic area&#151;Switzerland is
also included, interestingly&#151;and on reciprocal social security
agreements. I was slightly surprised that in his otherwise exhaustive
commentary, he did not go into the issue of reciprocity in great
detail, but perhaps I will at least have something new to say on the
subject in this
debate.</div><a name="07012574000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000206"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I was leaving it for the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="07012574000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07012574000207"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am most obliged. We have reciprocal agreements
with a strange collection&#151;I was about to say
&#147;bizarre&#148;, but I do not want to start an international
incident&#151;of countries. It includes Barbados, which sounds fairly
straightforward. My father retired to Barbados, although I do not think
that he ever mentioned this issue to me. The list also includes Bosnia
and Herzegovina. I imagine that some people retire there, but one
wonders why. Turkey is also included, and of course the
USA.</div><a name="07012574000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the most
dramatic contrast is between people living in Canada and people living
in the USA. I have already explained how an ageing rock star can go and
live in a large mansion in Florida and get their retirement pension
uprated&#151;no doubt helping to defray the costs of the Prime
Minister and his lady wife staying for weeks on end&#151;but if they
lived in Canada, that would not be the case. As the hon. Gentleman
said, if they lived in
