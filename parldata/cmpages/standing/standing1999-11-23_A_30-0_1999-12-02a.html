<H4><center>Other definitions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 802, in page 104, line 23, leave out `on' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`under an express'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. I know that you will keep us in vigorous good order.
<P>
We are debating part XVI, which deals with collective investment schemes. This amendment and most of our subsequent amendments are technical, which we tabled due to substantial representations, of which the Government will be aware, from the security lawyers and the trade body, the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. They are all concerned either with tightening the definition of collective investment schemes making provision for possible future developments, so that the Bill does not frustrate that, or preventing unintended results of bringing investment trusts within the definition of collective investment schemes, including knock-on effects in terms of tax legislation.
<P>
In relation to the present definition of unit trust schemes, there has been much legal debate as to what is meant by the reference to the property held on trust. In one view, that includes even constructive trusts, which are not express trusts but arise by operation of law. Examples include partnerships in which up to four partners hold on trust for everyone, and when a purchaser has received a legal title to a property without having yet paid for it. It is clearly intended that there should be an express trust. We have been advised to that effect by Richard Sykes QC and we feel that it should be spelled out.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
Before I deal with the amendment, I should like to say a few more general words about this part of the Bill, which I did not have the opportunity to do during our previous sitting. I shall try to do so as quickly as possible.
<P>
Part XVI of the Bill deals with collective investment schemes and concerns an aspect of the Financial Services Authority's activity—product regulation of collective investment schemes—that differs in some ways from the subject matter of other parts. In many parts, the emphasis is on competition to facilitate and encourage—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not like to start off in this way, but the Economic Secretary is dealing with the amendment. If she wants to make comments about other parts of the clause in the clause stand part debate, she will be completely in order. However, she is dealing with amendment No. 802.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall speak to the amendment and make my other remarks in the event of a clause stand part debate.
<P>
The amendment would change the definition of a unit trust scheme by providing that property must be held under an express trust, instead of requiring it to be held on trust for the participants. That is unnecessary; indeed, in theory the change could limit the definition in ways that we would not want. In particular, the amendment would have the surprising effect of potentially limiting the scope of what could be an authorised unit trust scheme but not necessarily of what would be a collective investment scheme.
<P>
The definition proposed in clause 207 is used in the Financial Services Act 1986 and has worked perfectly well for several years. Therefore, I see no case for extending it and I ask Opposition Members to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> For the reasons that we gave, it is necessary to have clarity and for the law to be clear for the future. The Government should accept the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendments Nos. 785 and 786 were suggested collectively by those in the industry. They would have the same effect for authorised open-ended investment companies—OEICs—as amendments Nos. 717 to 721A would for authorised unit trusts. They would permit the formation of authorised OEICs that did not qualify or did not want to qualify as Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities and for a UCITS certificate. They also relate to authorised OEICs that do not qualify as UCITS. Amendment No. 708 relates to the same point.
<P>
Amendment No. 718 would amend clause 213. The words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in accordance with the scheme''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would allow the FSA to authorise different kinds of schemes. Those who want to qualify for a UCITS certificate would have to be available for the purpose of redemption at the request of the holders, which is the wording in article 1(2) of the 1985 directive. The current interpretation of that requirement in the FSA regulations is that it requires redemption of units or shares at least once a fortnight. The amendment would also allow the FSA to authorise schemes under which the ability to redeem or buy units or shares might be less frequent.
<P>
We understand that the FSA is already consulting—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is the hon. Gentleman speaking to amendment No. 718, which is not in this group? We are talking about amendments Nos. 785, 786 and 708 to 710.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I believe that I am talking about amendments Nos. 785 and 786.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The FSA is consulting about limited issue or limited redemption schemes. The amendment would enable the FSA to specify the maximum interval allowed between redemptions and the purchase of new units. The aim is to achieve a definition that will allow the development in the United Kingdom of investment companies which have flexible capital but which, subject to the scheme's constitution as approved by the FSA, may not be open to the repurchase of shares on a continuous basis.
<P>
It is important for the investment fund industry that legislation is sufficiently forward looking so that firms can develop innovative products in response to consumer demand and maintain the United Kingdom's competitive position in the face of the similar innovative products being developed in the European Union and elsewhere. The amendment would establish with greater clarity which offshore schemes should be classed as collective investment trusts and, hence, subject to regulation if marketed in the United Kingdom.
<P>
May I to speak to amendments Nos. 708 to 710 now, Mrs. Dunwoody?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you.
<P>
Amendment No. 708 is key. The Government will have received many representations from other interested parties on similar amendments. It relates to the difficulty of interpreting the phrase that begins with the words ``or which'' and ends with the words ``redeemed or repurchased'' in subsection (2)(b)(i). The FSA highlights those difficulties in its letter.
<P>
Similar words were included in a Lords amendment to the Bill. That amendment was intended to cover investment companies that are not obliged to repurchase or redeem shares, but do so in practice when requested to do so by the shareholder. However, subsection (2)(b)(i) can be interpreted as covering any case in which an investment company repurchases its shares. The words in brackets:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other than under other provisions''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will exclude United Kingdom companies repurchasing shares under the Companies Acts and European companies doing so under corresponding provisions, but will not provide an exemption for companies incorporated elsewhere. We are especially concerned about employee schemes that use companies affected by the provision and about limited partnerships that may forfeit their shares in investment trusts if additional contributions are not made. The correct and easiest solution would be for participants to request such redemptions.
<P>
There are knock-on tax effects. Investment trusts, such as Dublin based closed-ended funds, could fall by mistake within the distribution rules if redemptions arise, perhaps to reduce discounts on share prices. Those trusts could be unintentionally caught in the tax rules for distributing and non-distributing funds.
<P>
In summary, this is technical territory. I do not think that the Government intended investment trusts to be entangled by such fiscal or regulatory matters under the provision. We, and the industry, think it extremely important that the matter should be tidied up.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I should say at the outset that I do not want the Committee to agree to the amendment on the definition of an OEIC. I should like to consider that definition further, with a view to making the appropriate change in due course; in doing so I shall bear in mind what the hon. Gentleman said. I am aware that, in practice, the definition contained in the 1986 Act, which is similar to the definition used in the Bill, has raised a number of questions within the industry, particularly with respect to overseas vehicles. As the hon. Gentleman said, a case can be made for greater clarification. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 708 and 710 seem to have been designed to answer some of the points raised during consultation. However, an OEIC is a tricky thing to pin down, and it is vital that, in considering the definition, we do not open up potential gaps in the important investor protection controls set out in part XVI. Although we would all know an OEIC when we saw one—rather like an elephant—defining too tightly what does or does not constitute an OEIC is another matter. In fact, we are probably looking at quite a lot of grey—again, rather like an elephant.
<P>
We are mindful of the need for greater certainty when appropriate, and some key features of an OEIC are likely to have a bearing on further changes that we might propose, They include, for instance, whether shareholders will expect their shares to be redeemed or repurchased, the regularity of repurchases or redemptions, and the proportion of capital in relation to which the right or expectation of redemption will apply. As I said, they are difficult questions, and it does not necessarily help to give black and white answers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): The Economic Secretary obviously realises that it is a very technical subject, but she must have her own idea of exactly what constitutes an OEIC. Will she stray out of the grey and give us her own definition?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to tempt me, but I cannot be tempted at such an early hour. I have already said that it is difficult to define an OEIC, and I hesitate to offer a definition at 9.11 am. However, we note the suggestions in the amendments and believe that they could deal with some of the problems raised this morning.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 708 and 710 would exclude from the definition of an OEIC those redemptions or repurchases that might, in theory, be made at the instigation of the board of a company but are, in fact, made in response to a participant's substantive expectation that a redemption or repurchase would occur.
<P>
Amendment No. 785 proposes that redemptions or repayments may be made only in accordance with the scheme. I am not sure whether that adds to the debate. If a formal scheme does not exist, do the Opposition intend that a company should not be an OEIC even if, in practice, it was redeeming or repurchasing its shares and generally behaving like an OEIC? I am not convinced that it would be appropriate to accept any of the amendments, but in the light of my undertaking to reconsider the definition, I hope the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 709 seeks to make further changes in the definition of an OEIC by making it clear that the price at which shareholders are able to redeem their shares must be ``not significantly different from'' the value of the underlying property. However, the test contained in the Bill—the same as in existing legislation—uses the formulation that the price must be ``related to'' that value. I am not convinced that that change is necessary, although I appreciate that it tracks the language used in clause 213 in respect of redemptions or repurchases of units in authorised unit trust schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give us her view of what constitutes a reasonable gap between the redemption price and the underlying value? We have heard a lot of vague terms, but we cannot pin down exactly what is meant.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am not sure that I can help the hon. Gentleman on that point, but we believe that more work needs to be done. I am trying to sketch out some of the difficulties, and I am glad that he is responding.
<P>
It is important to remember that the two formulations have different purposes. Clause 213 is concerned with the criteria that must be met for a unit trust scheme to be authorised. Clause 207, however, is concerned with the definition of an OEIC. There is a good reason for the test being more broadly drawn in clause 207, as that definition is intended to cover both authorised and, in future, unauthorised OEICs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps I could just finish what I am saying.
<P>
The clause 213 formulation covers only authorised unit trusts. Therefore, it is not appropriate to accept amendment No. 709 or to look further at the point it raises as part of our proposed further deliberations on the group of amendments we have just discussed. I ask the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs to withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister's response is unacceptable. The industry has raised such issues for a long time. There are lawyers and representatives of the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds sitting in this Room listening to what is being said—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not refer to the Public Gallery during considerations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody, but we are discussing a serious matter. This aspect of the Bill is wholly deficient and unsatisfactory. If it brings investment trusts within the definition of collective investment schemes, there will be knock-on effects in tax law. More than sufficient representations have been made for the Government to deal with the matter in words they consider appropriate. Now is the time to get the provision right. We do not want any wishy-washy talk about it being a problem that can be resolved in the future. The Bill will be unsatisfactory unless the problem is resolved now.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or such other territory or country outside the United Kingdom as the Treasury may by order specify'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill. as drafted goes a step further than the 1986 Act by extending the words in brackets under clause 207(2)(b)(i) to corresponding provisions in other European economic area states. At present, the relevant wording is limited to the Companies Act and its Northern Ireland equivalent. Our amendment would provide greater flexibility in the future by permitting the Treasury to specify other territories or countries in addition to states in the European economic area. In our increasingly global world, it is necessary to sustain the international competitiveness of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is obviously right, but the amendment proposes that we extend the provision one step further than we would like to go. The provision, as drafted, will be an improvement to the position under the 1986 Act, which relates only to the Companies Act provisions and, hence, excludes only United Kingdom companies. The inclusion of a carve-out of EEA equivalent provisions has been welcomed widely.
<P>
However, the amendment goes further than that and would exclude companies that redeem their shares in accordance with provisions under third country non-EEA laws. We have carefully considered the issue, but have concluded that, on balance, such a provision would be inappropriate.
<P>
Parallels with third country laws will not be exact, and specifying territories in the way that the amendment proposes would involve making difficult judgments about the entirety of company law in a given country. We would have to monitor constantly the laws of a relevant country; we would also find that legislation quickly became out of date. In the light of these difficulties, therefore, I doubt whether the principle of amendment No. 711 would be workable. However, I appreciate that concerns raised in consultations about the current definition of an OEIC related to entities that were neither United Kingdom nor European economic area-incorporated. The best way to tackle those issues—if, indeed they can, or should, be tackled—is not by providing what would amount to a further wide-ranging exemption from the definition of an OEIC, but by assessing whether anything in the current basic definition of an OEIC can be clarified. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Our amendment would not impose anything: it would provide greater flexibility and give the Treasury a power. We cannot see any argument against that, because the Treasury would not be able to use the power as it saw fit. The provision is inappropriately narrow, especially given that the widening of the EEA is already being tackled and there are as many problems with EEA member country legislation as there are with the legislation of other states, as the FSA would admit. It seems plain stupid not to deal with the whole subject now on the basis that it is left to the Treasury to decide which countries to add. Therefore, we wish to put the amendment to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 712, in page 105, line 13, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and in relation to any other collective investment scheme means the person, if any, having responsibility under the arrangements constituting the scheme for the day to day management of the property of the scheme.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment which relates to the definition of the term ``operator''. The current definition, which is similar to that in earlier financial services legislation, covers unit trust schemes with a separate trustee and OEICs, but not other types of investment scheme. Identification of the operator is important for the purposes of defining a collective investment scheme and for determining whether someone is carrying on a regulated activity—which includes establishing and operating a collective investment scheme in paragraph 8 of schedule 2.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I appreciate that on reading the current definition it might be thought that there is a gap. The gap—such as it is—may relate to certain kinds of unauthorised unit trusts and certain forms of overseas scheme. However, I am not convinced that expanding the definition of operator as amendment No. 712 proposes is appropriate. It should be clear in any given case who is operating a scheme. The Bill does not provide for the issue of who may be operating a certain type of overseas scheme, thus leaving the flexibility to recognise different sorts of arrangements in other jurisdictions.
<P>
The amendment would provide too strict a definition, so accepting it could open up all sorts of difficulties. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it. If he does otherwise, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 736 to 738, and 755 to 758.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> These are technical changes only.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to make a few points about part XVI in our stand part debate.
<P>
Pooled investment schemes may appeal to many types of investors, offering people with limited time or investment skills or with modest means access to an attractive variety of investment returns, including those from equities. Such attractive returns would otherwise be available only to the better-off and better advised or more sophisticated investors who can buy professional advice or make investment decisions for themselves.
<P>
I sometimes think of collective investment schemes as the investment industry's best kept secret. Despite relatively powerful growth of about 370 per cent. in real terms over the past seven years, direct retail holdings in collective investment schemes amount to only 5 per cent. of all personal holdings of savings and investments. That is modest in comparison with the 16 per cent. held in bank and building society accounts and the 55 per cent. saved through life assurance and pensions funds.
<P>
However, that very growth tells a tale in itself, reflecting the growing popularity of, first, personal equity plans and now individual savings accounts. The Government hope to broaden and deepen the popularity of saving through ISAs as the schemes become better known and confidence in them develops. Much of that saving will use collective investment schemes.
<P>
Turning to the structure of a collective investment scheme, I shall first deal with a straightforward point about terminology. I have been talking about authorised collective investment schemes as if there is only one kind. In fact, there are two kinds: authorised unit trusts and open-ended investment companies. The first is a trust and the second a company. They are first cousins or even blood brothers, as they have a lot in common. There is a third kind of scheme, the so-called recognised scheme, which essentially involves certain kinds of overseas scheme that can be marketed to the public in the UK. I shall address that scheme in due course, as it relates to clauses 235 and 254. However, the essence of a collective investment scheme is that a number of investors choose to make common cause in investing their resources.
<P>
To make that structure work in practice, the FSA has power to make rules on a variety of ancillary matters. The most important of those is, arguably, pricing: the objective is to ensure that investors are treated fairly so that they have confidence in the schemes to which they have entrusted their funds. That is why some of the clauses that we shall discuss in future specify matters that the FSA will have power to regulate. The Government are considering reinforcing those powers and, in some modest way, extending them. When it is possible to do so, it often makes sense for the FSA to have the scope to adapt the rules from time to time to reflect the requirements of the changing market.
<P>
The provisions of part XVI ensure that the FSA will now have the power to specify the range of investments in which authorised schemes can invest, although the FSA must, of course, have regard to our international obligations, for example the provisions for the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directive, which impose constraints on the types of investments in which UCITS schemes may invest.
<P>
In addition, the Bill contains some important new provisions, allowing for the first time, express provision for the FSA to grant rule waivers and modifications regarding authorised unit trusts and, we intend, OEICs. We have also introduced rights for the operators and trustees of authorised schemes to refer matters to the tribunal in certain circumstances. That change should benefit the industry and demonstrates our commitment to establishing a regime that delivers a properly equipped, yet fully accountable, FSA.
<P>
As well as those specific changes, the Bill delivers one fundamental improvement to the existing position—the introduction of a single regulator. At the moment, operators of collective investment schemes might be authorised by the FSA, regulated for investment management purposes by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation and, in many cases, have their marketing activities regulated by the Personal Investment Authority. All those functions will be regulated by the FSA, which will be a distinct improvement.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The clause remains gravely defective, particularly in the respect that I mentioned. The Minister must be aware that the provision is reasonable when the repurchase of investment trusts arises at the volition of the individual owning the shares, but when they are repurchased compulsorily—for whatever reason—it will cause major problems in tax and security law. Employee schemes can be structured as limited partnerships—or such vehicles underneath. There can be bad leavers in compulsory repurchase and it would be ridiculous if the Bill caused a company holding shares to become open-ended in a collective investment scheme, which would bring about regulatory and tax consequences.
<P>
There is widespread concern—not just in the City but in many companies—over these issues. We cannot possibly support the clause until the problems are put right. Many legal representations have been made to the Government, so I am astonished that they have not addressed them.

Government No. 782.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We move on to chapter II of part XVI, which deals with the restrictions on the promotion of collective investment schemes. That plank of investment protection is critical and clause 208 broadly continues the marketing prohibition contained in section 76 of the Financial Services Act 1986, although it has been updated in line with the proposals under clause 19 concerning financial promotion by unauthorised persons. The clause aims to be more technology-neutral than existing legislation.
<P>
The Government amendments will bring clause 208 further into line with the basic restriction on unauthorised and unapproved financial promotion contained in clause 19, as amended by the Committee in July. The Government amendments propose a new formulation concerning invitations or inducements to engage in investment activity to ensure that the communications to be caught are more clearly promotional. I hope that they will not be controversial.
<P>
The basic position under clause 208 is that authorised persons cannot issue an invitation to participate in a collective investment scheme unless that scheme is approved—unless, that is, it is an authorised unit trust, an authorised OEIC or a recognised overseas scheme. The clause also allows exemptions for other schemes to be marketed other than to the general public in circumstances to be set out in the FSA's rules. That carries forward the broad picture painted by the 1986 Act,
<P>
The one significant difference between the existing position under section 76 of the 1986 Act and the position that clause 208 will create relates to territorial scope. I thank the hon. Members for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) and for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) for raising that important issue by tabling amendments Nos. 154 and 155, which would limit the prohibition under clause 208 to communications issued
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to a person in the UK''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should re-cap briefly on the position under the 1986 Act and on the Government's thinking. It should be remembered that the substance of the discussion applies only to unapproved collective investment schemes; authorised unit trusts, authorised OEICs and recognised schemes are exempt from the prohibitions under section 76 and will be exempt under clause 208. We are only considering vehicles such as venture capital funds, ostrich farms and other potentially risky schemes.
<P>
Section 76 applies to advertisements issued by authorised persons that are ``issued in the UK''. That phrase has been widely interpreted by the market as meaning that that section applies only to promotions received in the United Kingdom. The logic behind that interpretation is that an advertisement is not issued until it is communicated or received. The view is that the current territorial scope under the section applies, first, to advertisements that originate in the United Kingdom and are sent within it and, secondly, to advertisements that originate outside the United Kingdom and are sent into it, which I shall refer to as inward promotions.
<P>
Members of the Committee will note that I have referred to the view I have taken of the territorial scope of section 76. The phrase ``issued in the UK'' is subject to interpretation; the interpretation that I have just described is the one accepted in certain quarters. Amendments Nos. 154 and 155 would restrict the territorial scope of clause 208 to that which I have just described as applying to section 76. One important consequence of that approach would be that the collective investment scheme marketing prohibition would not cover outward promotions—those that originate in the United Kingdom but sent outside it.
<P>
By contrast, the territorial scope of clause 208 is more widely drawn and it could catch outward promotions. The only promotions that will not be caught by the prohibition—apart from those concerning approved schemes—are those that originate outside the United Kingdom and cannot have an effect here. We have proposed the same basic approach in relation to the clause 19 marketing prohibition but, as members of the Committee will recall, the Treasury has the power to make exemptions from that prohibition through secondary legislation. As the recently issued second financial promotion consultation document noted, we think that it is important to be able to restrict outward promotions issued by unauthorised persons so that the FSA can play a full role in international regulatory co-operation and the UK's reputation as a safe and clean place to do business is maintained.
<P>
Under the clause 19 prohibition relating to unauthorised persons, if an unauthorised operation were to be set up in the UK to target, say, Canadian investors, we propose that that unauthorised operation be subject to UK legislation. If the legislation were breached, the operation could, if necessary, be closed down to assist the Canadian regulator.
<P>
On further consideration, the arguments may be different in relation to the promotion by authorised persons of collective investment schemes. As clause 208 applies only to persons who are authorised and as the FSA will have authority over those persons anyway, it can, if need be, discipline them under its own rules in order to assist an overseas regulator. I agree, therefore, that the need to prohibit outward promotions in clause 208-type cases is, arguably, much less great.
<P>
As one might expect, there is a European Union dimension to all this. Hon. Members will know of the draft e-commerce directive and the draft distance marketing directive, both of which propose a more fully home-state approach to the regulation of marketing. I was a little surprised by the Opposition amendments because they would enshrine in the Bill a principle of regulation that could go wholly against the tenor of what is evolving in Europe. While I have some sympathy with the substance of the amendments, they should not be adopted in the form proposed. I want to consider further the possibility of introducing, in due course, amendments with a similar substantive effect to what Opposition Members propose, subject to three important points.
<P>
First, it is vital that the legislation can adapt quickly and simply to developments in Europe. We see great benefit in the proposals contained in the draft European directives and, as I said, we support their idea of home-state control. It is therefore likely that an approach of the sort proposed may need to be changed as and when further developments in the European regulatory landscape occur. We are committed to playing a leading role in those developments and the Bill needs to be flexible enough to cope with them.
<P>
Secondly, an additional, UCITS-specific angle needs to be addressed. The UCITS directive requires the UK to prevent UK schemes that would qualify as UCITS but which are not authorised as such from being marketed in the rest of Europe. Thus, that is one case where restrictions on outward promotions would in any case be necessary.
<P>
Thirdly, it is worth making it clear that even if the basic clause 208 prohibition were cut back so that it applied largely only to inward promotions, we consider it vital for the FSA nevertheless to retain the ability to make rules on outward promotions. The regulators are currently able to do that under the Financial Services Act regime and we propose to continue that approach in the Bill. Although the basic clause 208 marketing prohibition might not apply to outward promotions, the FSA would nevertheless retain the ability to regulate the manner and content of the marketing of outward promotions. That is clearly important for the FSA to be able properly to regulate a firm as a whole.
<P>
In the light of what I have said, I hope that Opposition Members will feel able to withdraw their amendments.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Opposition amendments have not been moved.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. Perhaps when they have been moved, I shall ask that they be withdrawn.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 804, as it appears to be closely related to the other two amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have allowed the Minister to go on, but it is normal to allow hon. Members to move their amendments before replying to them. However, as we are already in that position—and as everything in this Committee appears to be uniquely interesting—perhaps the Minister should continue.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am not sure that I should continue after your remarks, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I feel obliged to do so, none the less.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 713 and 714 would change the basic restriction in clause 208 which, as hon. Members will recall, prevents unregulated schemes from being marketed unless they are marketed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``otherwise than to the general public''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under the exemption that is laid down by FSA rules. Hon. Members no doubt know that that phrase is used in section 76 of the Financial Services Act. The amendments propose that instead of allowing promotions to be made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``otherwise than to the general public''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the FSA's exemption should simply cover persons ``of specified descriptions''. Presumably, those persons could be the general public.
<P>
I am not convinced that the change is appropriate. A central purpose of the prohibition is investor protection. It would not be right to weaken it. Unregulated schemes are not subject to the same safeguards as authorised schemes. For that reason, it is appropriate that there are constraints on how they are marketed. The Bill's provisions, in particular those set out in part XVI, attempt to safeguard the general public. I would not wish to weaken that.
<P>
The FSA will have the power under clause 208(5) to provide exemptions to allow for certain schemes to be marketed other than to the general public. Indeed, it has that power under the Financial Services Act 1986. The 1991 promotion of unregulation schemes regulations also reflect the use of that power. Those regulations allow the promotion of schemes otherwise than to the general public in specific circumstances, such as to various categories of more expert investor and existing scheme members.
<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Would the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) like to speak to the amendments? He has the unique advantage of knowing the Minister's response before he gets to his feet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
Government amendments to clause 208 are satisfactory and unobjectionable. However, they do not address what lies behind amendments Nos. 154 and 155. All amendment No. 734 does is to use the financial promotion language to replace what is in clause 208(1), but no restriction is placed on UK investors only. In the interests of supporting the UK's competitiveness, it is vital to include the territorial limitation.
<P>
On amendments Nos. 154 and 155, the extension of the marketing restrictions on unregulated collective investment schemes so that they apply even when the recipient is outside the UK, is contrary to the obligation of the authority to have regard to the desirability of maintaining the UK's competitive position, which is the much coveted principle that is set out in clause 2(3)(e). We are not aware of a scandal that might require the extension of restrictions. The mere fact that the financial promotion regime is extended to cover communications sent to recipients outside the UK, even if they are not oral communications—the only case where the extension applies now—is not sufficient justification for the extension of the marketing restriction in clause 208.
<P>
The effect of clause 208(1) without a restriction to the UK would be that, in every country in which the regulators allow the marketing of what we call collective investment schemes to private individuals or small companies, the only firms who would not be able to access the market would be those that are authorised under the Bill. If the local regulator allows marketing to particular classes of investor, that investor would not expect regulators in other jurisdictions to forbid it and would be surprised if they did so. Accordingly, the reputation of the UK would not benefit from the extra prohibition. Extra restrictions on UK firms would put them at an uncompetitive disadvantage. That cannot benefit the UK. In particular, there will be problems for venture capital partnerships that want to market themselves around the world. The Government say that they want to do their best to help and support that industry. Indeed, its product is a classic example of the vehicle to which my comments relate. Closed-ended schemes are also not subject to clause 208.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 713 and 714 address the exemption from the prohibition for promotions otherwise than to the general public. Amendment No. 713 would remove the vague concept of the general public and allows promotion to ``persons of specified descriptions''. Clause 208(6) elaborates on what is meant by promotion otherwise than to the general public. It introduces another vague category of persons for whom participation would be unsuitable. Amendment No. 714 would remove subsection (6) which would be covered by ``persons of specified descriptions'' in subsection (5) as amended by amendment No. 713.
<P>
The amendments would give the FSA greater flexibility in determining what unauthorised collective investment schemes can be promoted to identified categories of persons without having to be concerned whether the categories may constitute the general public.
<P>
The main thrust of our amendments addresses the problem that where British businesses provide products that are regulated by the FSA, they will be at a competitive disadvantage when marketing them in Europe or elsewhere, which is contrary to one of the Bill's principles. The industry is concerned about the creation of that disadvantage. The Government's amendments do not go far enough.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall not test your patience, Mrs. Dunwoody, or that of Committee members by repeating myself. However, I said that we will consider the points raised by amendments Nos. 154 and 155 and table further amendments. We are grateful to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) for highlighting the issues. We do not believe that the clause is contrary to the competitive principle. The FSA will need to frame its rules under parts XVI and IX in a way that is compatible with all its objectives and principles.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): Is the Minister undertaking radically to rewrite the clause to take account of the issue of competitiveness as raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs? She rightly said that clause 2 requires the authority to take account of the desirability of maintaining the UK's competitive position, but clause 208 appears to conflict with that principle. It is not an adequate defence to draw attention to the purpose of clause 2 without responding to my hon. Friend's concerns. The clause is directly and explicitly contrary to the interests of the British financial services industry which will be at a disadvantage when competing against other firms in overseas territories. To include that contradiction in primary legislation requires a fuller explanation.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We do not believe that the clause will create those problems. The right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised the issue of competitiveness in earlier debates, and a letter on competition is on its way to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. Perhaps, with his permission, I can copy that to all Committee members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I find that unsatisfactory. The clause has been in draft form for a long time. We have raised the issue of competitiveness before, including in today's debate on another clause. There has been plenty of opportunity for invisible notes to be penned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> We tabled the amendments in July, so the issues have been before the Minister and the Treasury for five months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend reinforces my point. The situation is creating a lot of uncertainty. The Government constantly stress the need to get the Bill on the statute book as soon as possible and Conservative Members made an effort by permitting a carry over of the Bill for precisely that reason. It does not help that the Government are still in a shambles about what are really quite elementary issues.
<P>
I know that I am not an expert on collective investment schemes, but I can read English and I understand what my hon. Friend was saying. It seems beyond dispute that UK firms, or rather, firms that are ``authorised persons'' under the legislation will be put at a disadvantage in selling their products to other territories because regulators in those countries may permit the advertising and promotion of some of these schemes, but firms that are registered from here will not be able to advertise them by electronic and other means. That clearly puts them at a disadvantage. A subsequent letter from the Minister is not necessary to illustrate that; it is plain from the clause. We need an explanation now. The hon. Lady must have thought about it and had a purpose in mind when instructing the draftsman to draft the clause thus.
<P>
If we are wrong about this issue, the Minister needs to explain why. If, however, we are right, there is a conflict with the Government's good intentions in clause 2, which charges the FSA to have regard to the desirability of—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The situation is completely unsatisfactory. What has the Minister been doing? She has been reading her brief, but she should have been putting herself in a position to give considered responses to the factual points raised by Conservative Members.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Perhaps I might add my weight to the point that is being made. I have been trying to take in what the Minister has been saying, but it is not clear whether she supports our concerns sufficiently to order a drastic rewriting of the clause, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and I agree is necessary. She seemed to change her mind.
<P>
I note that in the pre-Budget report that was announced just a few weeks ago by the Chancellor, the Minister said—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is vital that in fulfilling its statutory objectives the FSA continues to regulate in a way which does not unnecessarily distort competition. A healthy and competitive market is in the interests of consumers and practitioners, providing greater choice, innovation and opportunities for growth.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the light of that terminology, it strikes me that clause 208 fails abysmally in what we are assured the Government are trying to achieve with this Bill. We need a stronger undertaking from the Minister that she will stand by her words and those of the Chancellor just a few weeks ago on promoting competitiveness and not disadvantaging UK firms in the promotion of their products in overseas markets. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, it is another wholly unsatisfactory mess. The Government have had months to think about it, yet even now they appear to be thinking on the hoof. We need rather better assurances than we have been given.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> There is no need for a drastic rewriting of the clause. As I said, I have some sympathy with the issues raised by amendments No. 154 and 155 and I gave a clear commitment to take them on board. However, we do not believe that the amendments are satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister and I am glad to hear that, by and large, the Government take the point of the amendments. However, we tabled them back in July and we offered to discuss any of the issues, yet here we are in December, with those points still not adequately addressed. We would have liked an opportunity to vote on them in order to register their importance and the need for them to be dealt with promptly.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 803, in page 105, line 42, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) a collective investment scheme which is not a body corporate and is closed-ended'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 805, in page 106, line 8, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8) A collective investment scheme is closed-ended unless the rights of the participants are rights falling within section 207(2)(b).'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 803 would remove the special marketing restriction on unregulated collective investment schemes for closed-ended, unincorporated investment funds. All collective investment schemes that were closed-ended would be outside the marketing restrictions, regardless of whether they were bodies corporate. Even a closed-ended investment fund would still be regulated as a collective investment scheme for the purposes of the authorisation requirements and would still be subject to the normal marketing restrictions under clause 19. There is no readily apparent reason why closed-ended investment funds should be subject to the extra marketing restrictions under clause 208. In addition, it seems anti-competitive to provide an exemption from those marketing restrictions for closed-ended bodies corporate, but not for unincorporated closed-ended bodies.
<P>
The original restriction on the marketing of unincorporated collective investment schemes was introduced by the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958. Under that Act, different restrictions were applicable, dependent on whether the underlying property was securities; only if schemes did not consist of securities could they be marketed freely by authorised firms. That restriction occurred because there was no requirement for the authorisation of someone involved in the scheme. Accordingly, there was no set of extra restrictions under that Act equivalent to those to be required under clause 208 for securities funds.
<P>
The only risks that could arise concerning open-ended rather than closed-ended investment funds are, first, that assets might not be available to allow investors to redeem when they want to and, secondly, that the constant movement into and out of investment assets could lead to difficulties in management. Those risks alone would require the extra marketing restrictions on open-ended investment companies. Such problems do not arise with closed-ended bodies corporate; nor do they arise when the closed-ended investment fund is not a body corporate. We appreciate that clause 208(1) merely repeats section 76(1) of the existing Act, but such over-regulation is now surely due for correction by the new Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 805 would define a closed-ended collective investment scheme under proposed paragraph (d) of clause 208(4). Such schemes are not currently subject to the marketing restrictions of clause 208. We have used the definition of ``open-ended'' found in clause 207(2)(b).
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Amendment No. 803 would exclude from the clause 208 marketing prohibition those collective investment schemes that are not bodies corporate but are closed-ended. In practice, closed-ended unit trusts and, quite rightly and typically, venture capital limited partnership arrangements could be included. I cannot accept the amendment: it seems to go against the essence of what we are trying to protect against under this part of the Bill.
<P>
Bodies such as those that I have mentioned are most likely to be closed-ended. I grant that much of part XVI is concerned with regulating open-ended entities. Since their capital can fluctuate, it will be especially important to ensure that the investment vehicle is stable. It is also important to ensure that investors' assets are safe and properly administered—that investors can realise their assets at a decent price and that, overall, they can get value for their money.
<P>
Although the capital of open-ended bodies can fluctuate—hence the need for protection—open-endedness is a desirable feature. That allows participants to get their money back, a feature not necessarily available for such closed-ended schemes as the amendment proposes. Consumers need protection, and participants in closed vehicles, which might not have a readily realisable or liquid investment, need protection just as much as the next person.
<P>
The amendment would mean that closed-ended regulated bodies could be marketed freely to the public without the protections afforded by the product regulation under part XVI. Members of the Committee will recall that we discussed in the context of clause 206 the fact that UK-incorporated investment trusts, which qualify under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, should not fall within the scope of part XVI. The Companies Act protections in relation to redemptions and essential maintenance of the capital requirements for which the Act provides, give investors protection in relation to those entities.
<P>
The requirement that investment trusts are listed on the London stock exchange is important for providing some liquidity and represents an important layer of protection for investors' interests. That is an important distinction. The fact that closed-ended vehicles which are approved investment trusts might be outside the scope of the legislation does not make the case for excluding closed-ended bodies more generally.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members will reconsider the amendment in the light of my comments. If not, I must ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
Amendment No. 805 is related to amendment No. 803 and deals with the definition of what constitutes a closed-ended vehicle for the purposes of the exclusion that is proposed. That is unnecessary. Given that the amendment relates in part to the amendments to the definition of an OEIC, which we discussed, I hope that it will be similarly withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I said earlier, this is an area of over-regulation. It would be better to correct it, but it obtains at present. We do not want to put the amendments to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to single property schemes, with which clause 209 deals. As far as we are aware, few schemes have taken advantage of the equivalent provision in the Financial Services Act. One of the necessary characteristics of such schemes is that one must deal in their units on a recognised investment exchange. That might be too restrictive. The amendment would allow the authority to specify alternative means by which to deal in units in such schemes.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment would expand the sorts of single property scheme that could be exempted from the marketing prohibition under clause 208. It provides that a single property scheme can be exempt if participants can deal in the scheme's units in accordance with Treasury regulations.
<P>
Clause 209 and section 76 of the 1986 Act provide, on the other hand, that single property schemes can be exempt only if units are dealt with on a recognised exchange or offered conditionally on a listing. The criterion for listing is key to the exemption for single property schemes, and we propose to continue it under the Bill. It is especially important in this case because single property schemes might be less liquid than other collective investment schemes, which might, for example, invest in securities. The requirement to list single property schemes provides an important element of liquidity, which is a key factor in investor protection. I therefore hope, that, having heard my comments, Opposition Members will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This is not sufficiently important to put to a vote. However, it is incorrect to say that being listed on a recognised investment exchange necessarily adds liquidity to property schemes.

This is a probing amendment to clarify whether the restriction on approval of promotion in clause 210(1) applies to approval by an authorised person of the promotion by an unauthorised person of what clause 208(5) describes as ``schemes of specified descriptions'', which are exempt from the general prohibition in clause 208(1). In our view, the restriction should not apply. What is the Government's position?

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I do not disagree with what I understand to be the broad principle behind the amendment, but I am not convinced that the clause prevents what the amendment intends.

For the sake of clarity, perhaps I should remind hon. Members that although the basic clause 208 marketing prohibition might not apply in certain circumstances, the FSA could nevertheless apply financial promotion rules to promotions falling outside it. I would expect that to mean that the FSA can apply rules concerning approval of promotions as well. However, I would be happy to reconsider the hon. Gentleman's point to see whether any drafting amendments are needed to achieve the desired result. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment, in the light of that assurance.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss clause 212.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Clause 211 is a minor gem at showing how the Bill can be completely opaque and rather difficult for the layman. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If an authorised person contravenes a requirement imposed on him by section 208 or 210, section 120 applies to the contravention as it applies to a contravention mentioned in that section.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It appears to be completely circular and requires one to look at another clause. I raise the subject because the explanatory notes are admirable on the clause, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If an authorised person contravenes a requirement under clause 208 or 210, a private person who suffers loss as a result may claim damages.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand that. Is any effort being made to try to draft the Bill so that it is immediately accessible and comprehensible to people who are not lawyers? Many trying to earn a living in the market will rely on the Bill to guide them, and it is also designed for consumers. The Government make much of the fact that the Bill is all about protecting people. If so, my innocent suggestion is that the draftsmen could be nudged a little from time to time to try to make it clearer.
<P>
The previous Government had a programme of writing and rewriting statutes in plain English. A section in the Treasury was given over to that and draftsmen and the private sector were asked to employ their talents to make legislation easier to understand. In one of their Finance Bills, the present Government, then the Opposition, ensured that some effort was made in that direction. If we expect people to respect and obey the law, the least that we can do at our end is to make it clear. The clause is by no means the most spectacular example of badly drafted and confusing legislation but, given that she has now received a little more refuelling on the issue, I should like the Minister to say whether she agrees that the matter is important and whether she will ask the parliamentary draftsman to bear it in mind when drafting future amendments.

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Although I do not believe—sadly, perhaps in some ways—that consumers will rush around with the Act in their hands for protection or have it by their bedside, I have some sympathy with the right hon. Gentleman's point, as I am sure does the parliamentary draftsman who must be a keen reader of the Committee's proceedings in the Official Report. I am happy to bear it in mind.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 716, in page 107, line 27, leave out from `rules' to end of line 30.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 789, in page 111, line 26, leave out from `by' to `trust' in line 28 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`such information or documents as may be prescribed by'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 716 concerns the requirement for a solicitor's certificate confirming that the trust deed complies with FSA regulations before a unit trust can be authorised. The requirement goes back to the procedures adopted by the Department of Trade and Industry prior to the Financial Services Act 1986. It would be more flexible to update it under the Bill to allow the FSA to stipulate its requirements for authorisation rather than including such a requirement in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 789 deals with the procedure under clause 221 for altering authorised unit trust schemes. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a proposed alteration involving a change in the trust deed must be accompanied by a certificate signed by a solicitor to the effect that the change will not affect the compliance of the deed with the trust scheme rules.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As with amendment No. 716, the provision would replace the specific requirement for a solicitor's certificate with a more general requirement that any notice involving an alteration must be accompanied by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such information or documents as may be prescribed by''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the trust scheme rules. The rules may stipulate a requirement for a solicitor's certificate, but the purpose of our amendment is to provide flexibility as the requirement for the solicitor's certificate may not always be appropriate.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, amendment No.716 would remove the requirement in the clause. However, I am tempted at this juncture to ask whether Opposition Members sought legal advice before tabling it. If they did, I must commend them and their legal advisers for arguing for a lesser rather than a greater role for lawyers. The Government's commitment to light-touch regulations is catching on in all sorts of ways.
<P>
I do not agree that there is a good reason to remove the requirement that a solicitor must confirm that a trust deed meets all the relevant requirements. Trust deeds can be notoriously complicated beasts and, for a scheme to be set up, it will be necessary for legal advice to be taken. In addition, providing the FSA with a solicitor's certificate will, to some extent, save it time and money. That money will probably be passed to firms by way of fees in any event.
<P>
If firms have to give the FSA a solicitor's certificate, it will effectively save them having to pay twice for the same work. Given also that investor protections are an important feature of the Bill's provisions, a lawyer's certification that a scheme meets all applicable requirements is an important extra layer of comfort. Let us not forget that certifying trustees is not a new concept. As the hon. Gentleman reminded us, an equivalent provision was made in the 1986 Act for stock exchange listing rules and other special provisions in relation to trustees.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 789. It is likely that an operator will have obtained a solicitor's input when amending a trust deed, so I see little additional burden in requiring a certificate to be given. The amendment leaves open the possibility that the FSA could apply the rules that require the provision of a solicitor's certificate for variations of a trust deed once the scheme is approved, but obviously not before a scheme is approved. However, we believe that the requirement for a certificate is sufficiently important that it should be included in the Bill.
<P>
In the light of my remarks, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It is not an earth-shaking amendment. Our intention was to create flexibility and to allow the FSA, if it saw fit, to remove the requirement for a lawyer's certificate. However, it is not a major issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> All the amendments relate to the same proposition: that the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities requirement that unit holders must have a right to repurchase their units, which has been interpreted by the FSA as requiring a redemption date once every two weeks, should apply only to UCITS-qualifying unit trusts. If the FSA saw fit to permit it, that would apply also to authorised unit trusts with limited redemption rights or redemption rights that are subject to conditions. That could include authorised unit trusts established for stakeholder pension scheme purposes as a pooled pension investment or PPI. At present, the FSA takes the view that an authorised securities fund cannot be established as a PPI because, in order to satisfy the pension requirements the investor must accept restrictions on his ability to redeem. Authorising a trust established as a feeder fund could be established as a PPI, but that would add another fund layer to the structure and is inefficient.
<P>
The amendments would allow an authorised securities type fund to be established as a PPI, with restrictions on redemption consistent with the requirement for pensions, which would self-evidently save money in that more frequent redemption days result in more frequent calculations of value. For these purposes, amendment No. 718 is the most important, as it requires redemption in accordance with trust scheme rules. Amendment No. 721A would place all the UCITS qualifying requirements into clause 216, which deals with the conditions necessary to enjoy the rights conferred by the UCITS directive.
<P>
A further consequence of the amendments would be that the manager or trustee of a non-UCITS authorised unit trust could be established outside the EEA. At present, under the 1986 Act and the Bill, the manager and the trustee of an authorised unit trust scheme must be incorporated in am EEA state, whether or not it qualifies as a UCITS. The manager or trustee must be an authorised person so that the FSA's regulatory oversight is present. It may be prudent to require the manager or trustee to have a place of business in the United Kingdom, but the principle is that non-EEA financial institutions should be capable of becoming the manager or trustee of an authorised but non-UCITS unit trust.
<P>
It is most extraordinary that major United States and Swiss financial institutions in this country are not included; they are every bit as strong as EEA institutions. EEA bodies come under UCITS, which is a defined EU product. However, with non-UCITS unit trusts, there is no good reason why Deutsche bank could fulfil those provisions but Citibank could not.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I hope to convince the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is undesirable. As he says, under the amendment, authorised unit trusts whose managers or trustee bodies were incorporated outside the United Kingdom would be allowed to set up in this country if they were also authorised here. The amendment would, for example, allow a London branch of a US or an Australian company, as opposed to an English incorporated subsidiary of that company, to act as manager or trustee of an authorised scheme. That arrangement would clearly not meet the requirements of the UCITS directive, so authorised unit trusts that want to passport around Europe as UCITS schemes would still need to meet the UCITS criteria.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I think that I made it clear that the amendments relate only to non-UCITS schemes.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am not clear about that. We believe that the amendments relate to UCITS schemes. If the hon. Gentleman is still not clear about that after listening to my speech, he can comment further.
<P>
In practice, under the amendment, the FSA could find itself dependent on internal regulatory co-operation vis-a-vis the managers or trustees of schemes. For example, if a London branch of an Australia entity could become the manager or trustee of a United Kingdom authorised scheme, the FSA would, in theory, have to regulate the worldwide operations of the Australian entity. However, if the Australian entity were to set up a United Kingdom incorporated subsidiary—that is, a separate legal entity—such issues would not arise and the entity would meet the incorporation test in clause 213(3).
<P>
In addition, the amendment does not address the difficult legal problems that might arise if an overseas trustee were to become insolvent, nor does it take account of the fact that the Bill provides mechanisms for overseas-based schemes to obtain recognition under chapter V of part XVI. In short, the amendment is not appropriate to the interests of investor protection. Therefore, I ask the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs to withdraw it. If he does not do so, I shall ask the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
Under amendments Nos. 718 and 719, subsections (8) and (9), which deal with the price at which unitholders can sell or redeem their units, would be deleted and replaced with a requirement that participants must be able to have their units redeemed or realised in accordance with the provisions of the trust scheme rules. Again, that is not merited in the interests of investor protection.
<P>
A central feature of the legislation on authorised unit trusts is that units can be redeemed or sold at a net asset value-related price. Indeed, that is required under the UCITS directive. There is no good reason to weaken or change that basic requirement for other authorised funds. Such a change would not be in the interests of investor protection. The amendments would remove the entitlement to redeem units, thereby letting in closed ended schemes. If those amendments are pressed to a Division, I shall ask the Committee to vote against them.
<P>
On amendments Nos. 720 and 721A, clause 216 deals with the FSA granting a certificate to a unit trust that complies with the requirements of the UCITS directive. No doubt, Committee members are aware that article 46 of the UCITS directive requires a UK UCITS wishing to be marketed in another member state to send the host state authorities an attestation from the UK regulator, stating that the UCITS fulfils the conditions required by the directive.
<P>
Clause 216 allows for exactly that. It provides for the FSA to issue a certificate saying that the UCITS complies with conditions in the relevant community measure. I therefore see no reason why the clause should be expanded as the Opposition amendments suggest, as it is drafted in a way that gives effect to the directive.
<P>
Of course, the amendments are partly related to some of the amendments to clause 213 that we have just discussed. I explained why we considered changes in those amendments to be inappropriate.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 790 relates to clause 221.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It is a consequential amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, it is indeed. I need say nothing further about it, if the hon. Gentleman feels that it is not necessary for me to do so.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a point about non-UCITS schemes. Yes, it is important that some UCITS criteria should apply to all schemes under this part of the Bill. They are important for investor protection, as is the level playing field mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Subsection (8) refers to entitlement to redeem and there is some scope for flexibility in interpreting its wording. However, we must exercise care in navigating that area. The directive states that units must be repurchased at the request of holders, and we must ensure that that requirement is met. Within that wording, the FSA can manoeuvre to allow sensible repurchase periods.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> With the greatest respect, the Treasury has engaged in slightly unclear and—dare I say it—narrow-minded thinking.
<P>
The first matter raised by our amendments which, we believe, the Government will wish to right soon, is permitting pooled pension investment for stakeholder schemes as a requirement for keeping down their costs. We propose that only on the basis of express FSA permission, not of it being a right to have a non-UCITS that has less frequent redemption dates. Therefore, we do not accept that there is a risk, as the FSA would be in the position of seeing that, in such a scheme, it makes sense to have less frequent valuation dates.
<P>
Secondly, I made it clear that we were talking only about non-UCITS authorised trusts. We reluctantly accept that those in the UCITS regime have to have all the rules that go with such a regime. However, when a UCITS has an Italian bank or fund manager as trustee or manager, it is much more difficult for the authorities to deal with any problems, than is if the UCITS has an American bank as trustee. In the latter case, the law has greater similarity and the regulation is much better. In fact, it is practically ridiculous to have vehicles in this country under passporting. For example, it is ridiculous to have a branch of an Italian bank when the Italian bank is manager or trustee and not have US ones for non-UCITS vehicles. Again, that would be on the basis of FSA permission, and it would not open matters up, as it would be up to the FSA to come to an arrangement with the USA in relation to permission.
<P>
Finally, under our proposals branches of non-EEA banks would have to be members of the compensation scheme in the UK, so UK citizens could go and sort things out if everything went wrong. However, EEA banks are not members of the compensation scheme unless they choose to be, so UK citizens have to go knocking on the door in Rome. I repeat that the amendments propose, not a carte blanche, but flexibility for the FSA in our global climate. The issues may not be hugely important, but we shall want to press them to a vote. Our proposals are commercially sensible and not to accept them would be marginally damaging of Britain's position.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 748 to 754.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> These seem to be important matters before the Committee relating to approving changes of rules and the circumstances in which this may be done. Perhaps the Minister will expand slightly on her proposals.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall endeavour to be as brief as possible.
<P>
The clause provides that no alterations or changes can take place to an approved unit trust scheme without the FSA giving its approval or at least not notifying its disapproval. The clause carries forward the effect of section 82 of the Financial Services Act 1986 and, similarly, gives effect to the requirements of the UCITS directive.
<P>
The power is to protect investors. The clause carries forward the effect of section 82 of the Financial Services Act 1986; similarly, it gives effect to the requirements of the UCITS directive.
<P>
The power will protect investors. Some alterations to a scheme could have an adverse effect on investors, or expose them to unacceptable risks, so it is vital that a trustee or manager is fit and proper to do the job. This obviously goes as much for replacements as for those in place at the date of the initial application for authorisation. Where the FSA has been notified of a proposed alteration to the scheme or replacement of a manager or trustee, the change cannot he made until either the FSA has given its approval or, if it does not respond, until one month has elapsed from the date on which the notice was given to the authority. With changes of trustees or a manager, the authority will not approve a replacement unless the new person satisfies the relevant requirements of clause 213. Similarly, with a change to the scheme itself, the trust deed will still have to comply with the trust scheme rules made under clause 218.
<P>
Amendment No. 752 deals with a technical aspect of the way in which the clause now works. Subsection (6) currently provides that neither the manager nor the trustee of an authorised unit trust scheme may be replaced except by persons who satisfy the requirements of section 213(2) to (5). The subsections relate to the independence of the manager and trustee and the need for them to be authorised persons.
<P>
The provision aims to ensure that the FSA does not approve the change unless the proposed replacements will continue to satisfy the requirements of clause 213, just as those who held the posts on initial authorisation would have had to do.
<P>
At present the subsection takes the form of a straightforward prohibition. What it should do—the amendment provides for this—is place a duty on the FSA to satisfy itself that the persons concerned meet the appropriate requirements of clause 213. Clause 213 takes this form for initial applications. It is also designed to cover a scheme, which is dealt with in clause 213 subsections (2) to (5), as well as managers and trustees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that. In many instances the amendments improve the drafting of the Bill, and are fairly uncontentious. I have one point about consultation. What representations will the FSA invite before changing a manager? The notes on clauses refers to the authority taking action to withhold approval, having heard representations. Perhaps this refers to a change in the rules. Where is it included? Does it apply to a change of personnel?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am not sure that I can answer that now, but I shall write to the right hon. Gentleman. I do not think that it affects the substance of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I look forward to the Minister's letter, although I am a little surprised by her response because of what is stated in the explanatory notes. The Government are legislating by sending letters to the Opposition. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the Minister's offer.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 794, in clause 227, page 114, line 3, after `under', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`this Part of'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 852, in clause 249, page 125, line 3, after `under', insert

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 224 deals with the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Revocation of authorisation orders other than by consent.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (1)(b) allows an authorisation order to be revoked if it appears that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the manager or trustee of the scheme concerned has contravened a requirement imposed on him . . . under this Act''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would narrow the provision by referring to requirements that are imposed on the manager or trustee by or under this part of the Act. The requirement and qualifications for authorisation as stipulated in part XVI include the detailed trust scheme rules in clause 217 and the scheme particular rules in clause 218. A withdrawal of authorisation would occur if there is a contravention of those provisions rather a contravention of a requirement that is imposed by other provisions, which may have no bearing on whether the scheme should authorised.
<P>
Amendment No. 794 relates clause 227 which gives the FSA powers to give directions in particular circumstances. Clause 271(1)(b) has a similar provision to that in 224(1)(b), which I have just discussed. This amendment has the same purpose—to limit the FSA's powers to contraventions of the requirements imposed by part XVI, as opposed to the requirements imposed by the Act generally.
 Amendment No. 852 relates to clause 259 and is essentially similar. Under clause 249, the FSA
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may direct that a scheme is to cease to be recognised''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under clauses 239 or 241. One of the grounds on which the FSA can exercise that power is if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the operator, trustee or depositary of the scheme has contravened a requirement imposed on him by or under this Act''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For the same reasons that I gave when speaking to the other two amendments, we feel that the FSA's powers should be limited to the contraventions and requirements that are imposed under part XVI.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> If I have understood the hon. Gentleman's remarks, we will just have to agree to differ. I do not dispute the effect of his amendments, but I take a different view on their necessity.
<P>
It is vital that the FSA can take action when any requirement imposed by or under the Bill is breached. If, for example, a trustee or manager were to breach a rule imposed by clause 116 in part IX, which concerns financial promotion, or the general rule-making power in clause 110, the FSA should, if appropriate, be able to take action in relation to the scheme. That is an entirely reasonable and sensible approach, although I gather from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that he does not agree. I hope that he will withdraw his amendments but, if not, I shall encourage hon. Members to vote against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The FSA is all-powerful anyway, but as we see it, clause 224 and the related clauses endeavour to list the particular circumstances that the FSA would normally consider grave enough to end authorisation. It is right that with something as material as that, which affects investors and not just operators, the circumstances should be defined, which is what clause 224 does. It therefore seems logical that, having listed the circumstances that would cause the ending of authorisation, the clause should tie the ending to those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Obviously, the FSA must behave proportionately. If there is no danger to the scheme or cause for concern, the FSA could not revoke authorisation, but it could do so if a rule breach under another clause were relevant. It would be most odd to exclude other potential breaches from the FSA's consideration, but that is what the amendment would do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Without prolonging the agony, clause 224(1)(a) seems to cover that. I do not think that there is anything in the Bill requiring the FSA to act in a proportionate manner, although such a provision was in one of our amendments which the Government rejected early on. This is illogical. We do not need clause 224 if the FSA has full discretion as to when to end authorisation; either we define the circumstances, or we leave the authority with full power.

made by it under clause 227. Under that provision, either the manager or trustee may apply to have the direction revoked or varied. As drafted, clause 231(2) provides that, if the FSA decides to revoke or vary the direction, it must give notice of the revocation or the variation only to the person applying. Given that both the manager and trustee will have a valid interest in any revocation or variation, it seems more appropriate to require that any such notice should be given to both the manager and the trustee, which is the intention behind the amendment.

In the light of my desire to reflect further on the matter and my acceptance that it is a relevant point, I hope that Opposition Members see fit to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 232 allows the FSA to give directions in urgent cases without going through the warning notice procedure. As drafted, the Bill gives no qualification to the FSA's power to issue a decision notice under clause 232(1). Our amendment would qualify that power in such circumstances, restricting it to cases in which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is desirable in order to protect the interests of participants or potential participants''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are sure that that is the intention behind clause 232 but, as drafted, it gives the FSA an almost blanket power to, for example, call for all sorts of things. We consider it only right and proper that the power should be defined to situations of need.
<P>
Clause 232(9) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person to whom a decision notice is given under subsection (1) or (5) may refer the matter to the Tribunal.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, under clause 232(10) is a requirement that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Tribunal must determine whether the decision to give the direction or make the variation was (at the time it was made) reasonable in all circumstances.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 797 is a probing amendment to determine whether the use of the word ``must'' is intended to ensure that the tribunal deals only with the particular matters identified under clause 232(10), or whether it may deal with other matters that may be relevant to the case.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Amendments Nos. 796, 797 and 854 all relate to the FSA's urgent intervention procedure. Rather than debate them now, I again assure Opposition Members that we shall consider further all the clauses relating to urgent procedures under parts IV, XII and XVI. It is therefore likely that such provisions will change.
<P>
Amendment No. 853 is slightly different, being intended to limit the ground on which the FSA can revoke a scheme's recognition even in non-urgent cases. The limitation would be that only the interests of potential or actual United Kingdom participants should be taken into account. The substance of that point has been raised in various places, and we touched on it on the question of territoriality in the debate on clause 208. However, we have suggested that it would be more appropriate to discuss the territorial scope of the basic prohibition and the FSA's rule-making power in the context of clause 353.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> For the past hour and a half or so, we have been subjected to the legislation being amended almost by correspondence course. On clause after clause, we have been told that it is entirely pointless our being in Committee today to discuss whether the clauses should remain in the Bill, because the Government will change them at a later stage.
<P>
Will you make a judgment on whether we are wasting our time, Mrs. Dunwoody? The Government have had months to reconsider the clauses and a lot of time to consider our amendments, especially those tabled before the summer recess. Yet even at this late stage on a Bill that started its passage in July 1998, the Government are unable to say what the final clauses will look like and whether they will bear any resemblance to what we are supposedly debating. It seems absurd that we should continue on the provisions when the results of what we debate may be entirely different on Report.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Luckily, the Chairman has to work out only whether the amendments in the amendment paper are in order. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the amendments are correct. The Committee has proceeded in its normal, interesting way and, so far as I am concerned, we can proceed with the sitting quite cheerfully.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I forgot to elaborate on amendment No. 853. It is a probing amendment and we are interested to hear the Government's response. There seem to be conflicting definitions in relevant clauses.
<P>
We are happy not to press amendments Nos. 796, 797 and 854 to a vote on the understanding that the Government said that they would redraft the relevant provisions and that they took our point that the emergency powers should be used only in genuine emergency.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We want to reconsider the urgent intervention procedures and we are doing so.
<P>
It is wrong for the Committee to become tied up in the comments that some hon. Gentlemen have made, because this is a technical Bill in which it is not as straightforward to decide when to debate a matter as on some Bills. The consequent changes in some parts of the Bill are far reaching.
<P>
We have already suggested that we shall consider the question of territorial scope in much more detail when we come to clause 353. The amendment is intended to raise issues, and I would have thought that the Opposition would be pleased that we are taking account of them. That is the point of our debates and the point of a good Opposition as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the Minister giving way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have finished.
<P>
<B>Mr, Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I, too, wanted to intervene on the Economic Secretary. A little more humility on the Government Benches would be in order. I wish to make a serious point about scrutiny. This is the Committee's last opportunity to examine these clauses in detail. The Government are sweeping everything forward by wanting to make amendments on Report, on the Floor of the House. That may be a long process, but it is hardly a substitute for what the House asks us to do in Committee, and it is not an isolated example.
<P>
Even during our short debate this morning, Mrs. Dunwoody, you will have witnessed the fact that whenever we apply any pressure, the Government admit that there is something in what we say and that they will reconsider the matter. They admit that the provisions are defective and that they cannot proceed in the form in which they were published. However, as my hon. Friends and I have pointed out, the Bill was published 18 months ago. Even some of our amendments were published months ago.
<P>
It is rather frightening that Ministers and the Treasury, and even the FSA, rarely seem to understand the marketplace that they seek to regulate. They all have enormous powers—the FSA is already a de facto regulator—but they are in total confusion about the UK market, its interaction with overseas jurisdictions and on such matters as changing the rules at short notice.
<P>
I am in a quandary about how to proceed. It would help if the Economic Secretary were to say in advance what other parts of the Bill are causing confusion. We do not want to not waste time trying to make sense of the Bill's provisions when they dissolve in our hands as soon as we start to examine them in Committee. It is a genuine procedural point for you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
One of our intentions is to give some certainty to market operators and the City of London about the direction in which we are going. That is impossible, particularly because, when admitting that a clause is defective, the Economic Secretary does not indicate in which direction the Government will move on Report. The more scrutiny that is given to the Bill, the more uncertainty and confusion is caused. That must be detrimental to the UK's financial services industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Almost all the points that I wanted to make have already been made. [
Laughter.] The Minister seems to find that highly amusing. It is either that or a stream of comments made by the Government Whip from a sedentary position—normally made in complete ignorance of the matter under discussion.
<P>
The Bill was subject to a carry-over procedure as a result of an attempt to achieve a consensual approach. I very much welcome the flexibility shown today by the Economic Secretary to some of our amendments, and I would not want the record to imply anything other than our support for that flexibility. However, we find it astonishing that such flexibility should come at this late stage; it will pack the Report stage, which will amount to another Committee stage.
<P>
There was no need for the Bill to have been in such a parlous condition. If the Government did not like our amendments, which we tabled as early as July, they could have brought forward sensible amendments of their own much earlier. We are now in December, and four and a half months have gone by. The Government have failed during that time to make sensible proposals in answer to our amendments. If we are to continue proceedings in that way, we shall have to carry on making the same sort of points that we have made so far. That will only delay proceedings, rendering them slower than the Economic Secretary would like, but there is no alternative; it is our duty to make the points that are of concern to the City. As has been said, the Committee is proceeding in a rather unusual way, but I am afraid that that is the only way in which we can proceed, which is interesting but perhaps disappointing.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall be brief, because I do not wish to detain the Committee. I entirely repudiate the idea that the Opposition represent the City. Indeed, I think that some people in the City would vigorously repudiate that notion.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Wells that the Government are not confused about future clauses. We are trying to get the detail of the Bill right so that it works well. That is what the Committee is designed to do, and it does Opposition Members no good to make light of the process, nor to condemn the Government for acknowledging that the Opposition occasionally table amendments that merit further consideration. Some matters will be dealt with on Report, but I remind hon. Members that we have not yet debated clause 353, and that such issues can be raised when we do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I cannot let the Economic Secretary get away with that. She is dressing up the whole process as a consultation exercise. Genuine consultation would mean that she read our amendments when they were tabled and that, if she could not accept them, she could either table other amendments or refuse them on the grounds that the Bill was correctly drafted. She says that she cannot accept our suggestion, but she does not know what hers are either, and that at some undefined future date she will table unspecified amendments that she is sure will gain the general assent of the House. That is not consultation; it is legislation by rumour or, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, by correspondence course, with the Committee, which is made up of a limited number of hon. Members, cutting out the outside world, unless we are to be told that our letters will be published and circulated as a giant FSA consultation exercise. That is a shambolic way to proceed with an important Bill that affects the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people in the marketplace. It is not good enough for the Economic Secretary simply to fall back on the oft-repeated assertion that that shows how eager the Government are to consult. Consultation means not only making suggestions, but responding to other people's ideas.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have allowed that contribution to go on for a little longer than I would have done normally because there were some points to be made. I hope that the hon. Members will now return to the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment, which would restore the wording of the draft clauses for consultation published in April—wording that was dropped from the June print of the Bill. The restored wording—especially the reference to allowing the capital to fluctuate—would confirm the Government's intention to allow the possibility of establishing companies in which the capital fluctuates without being fully open at all times. That point emerged from our consultation with the City.
<P>
With reference to the Minister's recent comments, various lawyers and City organisations found the Treasury unwilling to listen to their representations over the summer. As a result, we wrote to 158 key organisations, institutions, practitioners and lawyers to seek their views on the Bill. Many of the points in our amendments have resulted from that exercise and are representative of the City's views on the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> This is a technical amendment. Members of the Committee will recall that in April, when we first published the draft part XVI provisions for consultation, the equivalent of what is now clause 233 included the provision as suggested in the amendment. We removed that provision when the Bill was introduced because, on further consideration, we decided that it was already implicit in the drafting that the sorts of bodies incorporated under the clause could take the form contemplated in the amendment. Although we agree that bodies incorporated under the clause can allow the capital to fluctuate and can be created in a form that does not require membership, it is unnecessary to state that expressly in the Bill. It is already permitted by the clause. The additional provision is therefore neither helpful nor necessary, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his probing amendment.
