you, Mr. Caton. As ever, it is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship. I wish first to direct my questions to Mr
Fazackerley. It would be helpful if the Committee got an idea of the
scheme described in your evidence, which you were working up, to use ID
cards to gain certain benefits within the airports system.<a class="bkMark" name="10062948000025">&#160;</a>

                           </em> In broad terms, we were using the ID
card scheme to lever some improvements to what had become quite a
time-consuming and onerous process to get an airport ID card. We felt
that giving the added identity certainty that would come with the ID
card would enable us to do that. We managed to win the argument to
extend the validity of the airport ID card to match that of the
national ID card. At Manchester, that meant we moved from a three-year
cycle for renewing the ID card, which was quite a painful process, to a
cycle that was up to 10 years long. We also used it as a lever to
debate with other airports the ability to hold individual data files
and, with the person’s permission, to transfer that data file to
a new employer or to a different airport, so that moving between
airports or employers could be a much easier process for employees,
because they would not have to redo all of the stuff that they did for
airport ID
cards.<a class="bkMark" name="10062948000026">&#160;</a>

to streamline and speed up, and to make the process of getting an
airport pass easier. There were some marginal benefits; for example, we
dramatically reduced the amount of data that we were holding on
individuals, because we felt that we did not need data that the
Government had, but I guess that that is fairly
marginal.<a class="bkMark" name="10062948000094">&#160;</a>

benefits that we were trying to lever for airside workers were not
linked to the national identity card as such. That was just a vehicle
for improvement. Those benefits could as easily be achieved with the
second-generation biometric passport, with the fingerprint. Could we
lever the same benefits with the first-generation chip passport that we
have now? Possibly, but it would depend very much on whether we could
link the systems to which we have access, to verify that the passport
was genuine and belonged to the person. I believe that that could be
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="10062948000098">&#160;</a>

thoroughly to overhaul and review how we do things. It gave a spark to
talking to other airports. We have now aligned with places such as
London City airport, and we are trying to get other airports to do the

terrorism. I got one because I thought it was a safe and secure way of
proving identity. It was not a scheme that I was party to when it was
being constructed—or deconstructed; I am not sure how that will
work. I could see that possibly, if it was a watertight way of proving
identity—for example, through biometric

the convenience and security of proving identity. It is an absolute

I am being facetious, but I am astounded by how much information is
known about me through my using my mobile phone—I get
cold-calling on my mobile—and through spam e-mail. I have not
surrendered any of that information; it is information that is in the

Conservatives were certainly quite vocal about that, but you cannot
legislate for what is going to happen in the future. You cannot not buy
a car because there is going to be some change in legislation that will
mean it depreciates the minute you choose to drive it. I had faith in
the scheme and, as a member of the British public who paid to take part
in a scheme that was lawful and that was promised, I believe, a 10-year
lifespan, I would have thought that that promise should be honoured. It

it had been a compulsory scheme—if the cards were being forced

voluntary. It was entirely your decision; nobody forced you to spend
£30 on something when you knew that a Government who pledged to
get rid of the cards could be elected. In the end, it was your decision

argument. The ID card came with a 10-year lifespan, and that at least
should have been honoured. I would have been quite happy to have been
able to use it for the lifespan of the card. When you buy a television,
it comes with a three-year guarantee. If you take your TV back before
the three years are up—if it is faulty or there has been some
change in the mechanism so you can no longer use it—you are
within your rights to get your money back, or to have your television
updated. I am afraid that I do not recognise your

the ID card said on the tin. It cost £30 and in return I got a
10-year guarantee that I could prove my identity with a little piece of
plastic in my purse. It is not for me to worry about the implications
of deconstructing a Bill—this is what you are all here for and
it is not what I do. With the greatest of respect, it is wrong to push
me in that direction, because that is not what I mean at

some kind of crusade. I am in the supremely fortunate position of being
a columnist for a newspaper which means that I have the great honour

thing. That is beautiful. It is democracy in process. I saw the ID card
as a great scheme and I wrote about it. I said, “This is
marvellous. I think everyone should get one if they want one.”
My moot point about all this is that there has been a great argument
about the Big Brother element of the ID card and that data protection
will be compromised. I have not asked anybody to get an ID card, but
the people who do not have them are telling me not to have one. I
wonder who the Big Brother is here. So whether or not my driving
licence has a picture on it, whether or not it fits in my purse, this
was a personal choice. It seemed like a very reasonable scheme and a
fair exchange for £30. I do not see that there is a great
problem with that.<a class="bkMark" name="10062948000175">&#160;</a>

go into liquidation and that is a consumer choice, but this, as she
said, was an Act of Parliament—it was part of the structure of
Government. People use comparisons all the time because they are easy
bullet points for ID cards. They talk about driving licences and taking
your telly back, but that sullies the whole issue of what ID cards
represent.<a class="bkMark" name="10062948000183">&#160;</a>

was a real risk that the identity card database—we have not
really talked about that with you this afternoon—was an attack

civil liberties. The sloppy way in which databases have been
safeguarded, judging by what I have read, is more of an issue than the
information at the time of surrendering. I do not have a problem. This
always sounds clichéd, but I am a law-abiding citizen: I do not
have anything to hide or anything to prove. If you want to know my
name, my age, what I do for a living and even my religious identity, I
do not have a problem. If you want my thumb print, that is fine,

that the huge queue to get into Parliament earlier was an almighty
scrum with people screaming that they were going to miss their 3.30
appointment, because of what seems to me, with respect, to be a fairly
hackneyed scheme to get into the building. It would be so much easier
and smoother if people had identity cards that they just had to slip
in. I had my photograph taken here—what for? I did not object;
this is who I am. There is a lot of sound and fury about data

                           </span> May I ask almost exactly the
same questions? Mr Fazackerley, I do not know whether you or your staff
have had the opportunity to use the card in some of the ways that were
being asked of Miss Epstein. Have you or your staff had the opportunity
to use the card, and how simple have they found its use, not just in
the work situation, but in the wider
world?<a class="bkMark" name="10062948000239">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I think that mainly the people I know
have made use of it for travel. Initially there were one or two
problems, because knowledge of the card had not got out, particularly
to airlines, but that was soon solved. It is used mainly for travel,
and the reason is that had the evaluation period led to a full
roll-out, the intention was that banks, retailers and so forth would
have the ability not just to visually check cards, but to biometrically
check them. Of course, that has not happened, but that would have been
the engine to make them more
useful.<a class="bkMark" name="10062948000240">&#160;</a>
