                  </span> On a point of order,
Mr Hollobone. It is good to see you in the Chair after another break in
the Committee’s proceedings. I shall not trespass too much on
the Committee’s time or business, but it is important that I
raise a point of order in relation to Members’ declarations of
interest in
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000032">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Huntingdon,
has responsibility for representing the Government on parts 1 and 2 of
the Bill in the House and in this Public Bill Committee. On Tuesday 19
July, at the commencement of the Committee’s fifth sitting, he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I
declare an interest as a non-practising solicitor who has never been in
receipt of legal aid.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official
Report, Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Public Bill
Committee,  </em>19 July 2011; c.
159.]<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000346">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Since
the Committee last met on 15 September, matters have come to light that
suggest that his declaration was incomplete and a breach of the rules.
The relevant section of “Erskine May” states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>

required to declare ‘any relevant pecuniary interest or benefit
of whatever nature, whether direct or indirect, that he may have had,
may have or may be expected to have’… The Committee on
Standards and Privileges has made it clear that it would regard it as a
very serious breach of the rules of the House if a Member failed to
register or declare an interest which was relevant to a proceeding he
had initiated.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000347">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A series of
investigations by <em>The </em>
                  <em>Guardian</em> and <em>T</em>
                  <em>he
</em>

                  <em>T</em>
                  <em>elegraph</em> newspapers has led to the
publication, between 16 September and today, of some seven articles
that, inter alia, allege that the Minister has other interests that are
directly relevant to the Bill and should have been declared. They
include his membership of Djanogly Family LLP, which underwrites
insurance; his brother-in-law’s ownership of two leading claims
management companies—Going Legal Ltd and Legal Link Introductory
Services Ltd; his children’s ownership of shares in  his
brother-in-law’s claims management companies; his ownership of
shares in several companies with insurance interests at a level that is
above the limit for declaration, which is the annual parliamentary
salary; and the fact that a quarter of his declarable stock holdings
are in companies that are members of the Association of British
Insurers.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have raised the matter with the Cabinet Secretary in letters of 20
September and 3 October, and I have asked him to investigate possible
breaches of the ministerial code. However, as the matter pertains to
the Minister’s declarations in the Register of Members’
Financial Interests and before the Committee, I thought it necessary to
raise it here, first, to give the Minister the opportunity to correct
his declaration and, secondly, to ask for your advice, Mr Hollobone, on
what steps the Minister or I should take to put the matter properly on
the record and to investigate any breach of the
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For
the avoidance of doubt, I note that the Minister amended the Register
of Members’ Financial Interests on 23 September 2011, a change
which was published on 28 September, to state that his registrable
shareholdings and minority shares in Djanogly Family LLP had been
transferred to a blind trust on 26 October 2010. That late declaration
is itself a breach of the rules, and was made after his declaration in
Committee and the publication of the press articles. However, according
to documents filed with Companies House as late as 6
September 2011, the Minister is still registered as a member
of Djanogly Family LLP, which is inconsistent with that entry. In any
event, he has made no attempt to address the further interests to which
I have referred, including those of his close
relatives.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
the matters that, in my submission, should have been declared in
Committee are significant, as they reveal a direct or indirect
pecuniary interest that the Minister and close members of his family
have in companies and trusts that may benefit from the legislation he
is
promulgating.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
report in <em>The Guardian</em> today alleges that the Minister and his
civil servants worked closely with the insurance industry in building a
case to support the Bill, from which they and he may benefit. Previous
reports in <em>The Guardian</em> and <em>The </em>
                  <em>Daily
</em>
                  <em>Telegraph</em> have alleged that his close relatives have
benefited or will benefit financially from their interests in Going
Legal Ltd and Legal Link Introductory Services Ltd. They are claims
management companies, of which the Minister is also the regulator, and
which have been strongly criticised by both the Solicitors Regulation
Authority and the Solicitors Disciplinary
Tribunal.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is difficult to see how a reasonable person  would not perceive
those matters as being, at the very least, conflicts of interest. The
Opposition, therefore,  believe that the Minister should
withdraw from further

to indicate whether that is now the proper way to
proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000040">&#160;</a>

today, Mr Hollobone. I am pleased to say that my amendments 274, 275

explanatory notes
state:<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“This
clause amends the current provisions in Schedules 1 and 2 to
the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008…which set out the
duration of youth rehabilitation orders. Under the current provisions
where an order has multiple requirements which may themselves be time
limited it can be unclear when the order is completed. In some cases
this can result in the requirements being completed before the end date
of the order requiring the case to be returned to court to revoke the
order.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000348">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Subsection
(1) amends Schedule 1 to the 2008 Act to enable the court to specify
different completion dates for different requirements attached to an
order and for the end date of the order to be the same as the last
completion date for a
requirement.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000349">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Subsection
(2) inserts new sub-paragraphs (6A) to (6D) in paragraph 6 of Schedule
2 to allow a magistrates’ court to extend the end date of an
order by up to 6 months where a further requirement is imposed but only
on one occasion. If the order is extended under these provisions then
it may extend beyond the three year maximum length set out in Schedule
1.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000350">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
amendments seek to change the maximum period from three years to two,
but I accept that the provision to extend by six months is sensible; I
have no argument with that. However, I believe that going beyond three
years could be burdensome and counter-productive. In effect, the
amendments substitute two for three. As I said, I have no issue with
the extension of six months in the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000054">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Our amendments are different from those tabled
by the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, although I suspect
they have the same point. While we agree that it is sensible to allow
the orders to continue rather than to refer people back for an
alternative punishment, we have concerns about the length of the
orders. The right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd corrects that by
saying that they should be limited to two years, but with the possible
extension of six months. We agree that they could be extended. That
seems sensible, efficient and clear in the light of the
Government’s concerns that there would not be a contiguous
period between the sentences being carried out and the sentence of the
order—in other words, the actual work undertaken.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, the
idea that orders should continue beyond three years is wrong in
principle. By definition, such orders relate to young people, and three
years is a long time in a young person’s life. It is unusual for
community orders to last for three years or longer. I can see how the
Government have got themselves into this position, but it would not be
sensible to allow the period to be extended beyond three years, because
doing so would increase the chance of breach. It puts a heavy burden on
young shoulders to say, “You will be undergoing a form of
punishment or rehabilitation”—call it what you
will—“that will last for a substantial part of your
teenage life.” Three years is a long enough period for orders,
and the amendments would limit them to that
length.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000056">&#160;</a>

sure whether congratulations are in order her, but, since she is my
opposite number, I regret her move. We will miss her infectious good
humour; it is a shame that the hon. Member for Hammersmith is immune to
that infection, as was illustrated by his rather tawdry point of order
at the beginning of proceedings. It is with some regret that we must
continue to enjoy his company—our sentence continues without any
prospect of early release.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000057">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
congratulate other Opposition Members of the Committee, including the
hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, who will become the Parliamentary
Private Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition—that may be a
very long stretch indeed to serve. The hon. Member for Stretford and
Urmston is absent, but we congratulate her on her move to the Front
Bench to speak for the Opposition on women and equalities. The hon.
Member for Makerfield is, no doubt, already being briefed on the
responsibilities of being an Opposition Whip. We congratulate
Opposition Members whose careers have advanced, no doubt because of
their contributions to our proceedings in Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments seek to amend clause 69 to reduce the maximum duration of a
youth rehabilitation order. The hon. Member for Hammersmith has said
that it would be unusual for orders to last longer than three years and
I am happy to concede that point. Bearing that in mind, however, I
shall make the case for inviting the Committee to resist the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At present, a
sentencing court may impose a youth rehabilitation order with a maximum
duration of three years, which cannot be extended. The clause amends
the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 so that an extension of
up to six months will be allowed when a court is dealing with a breach
of the original YRO, or an application to extend it, and wishes to
allow additional time for a component requirement to be
completed.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments tabled by the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd would
reduce the duration of a YRO to two years. The right hon. Gentleman
does not want to amend the provisions of the clause that allow the
court to extend an order, so his amendments would, effectively, provide
that the maximum duration of a YRO, if extended, as he explained, would
be two years and six months.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hammersmith do not aim to
reduce the duration of an order, but to amend the clause so that the
court may extend an order but not beyond three years. The amendments
would therefore provide that the maximum period of a YRO would be three
years, whether it were extended or not.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We oppose the
amendments. While we have some sympathy with the arguments put forward
by the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd and by the hon. Member
for Hammersmith, the clause should remain as it stands. This is a
matter of judgment, and our judgment comes down on the side of
consistency of framework.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000063">&#160;</a>

accept that three and a half years is a long time for a person to be on
a community order. I want to emphasise that, for
under 18s, that power would be exercised rarely. In our view, however,
it is important, in the interests of consistency of the sentencing
framework, to align that additional flexibility around the end of the
order with that that we are applying to the adult community order in
clause
55.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000064">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> We have to deal with the issue of boundaries, and
we also have to try to deliver some clarity and consistency in the
framework. We are not going to go around seeking difference simply to
make it different in principle. The hon. Lady seems to say that, on a
point of principle, we need to make the youth orders different from the
adult orders, just for the sake of their being different. I am
unconvinced by that. We need to bring some more clarity and consistency
to the sentencing
framework.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause will make it easier for the courts to deal with a breach at the
end of the order, as well as allowing the offender to complete the
order, where a delay has occurred through no fault of his own. The
youth rehabilitation order provides an alternative to custody, and as
such is often given to offenders who have committed serious offences.
For those offences, especially for older youths, a longer order may be
given. Courts should have the same power, as they would for an adult,
to extend the sentence beyond the original end date if a breach occurs
or in circumstances where the offender has been unable to complete the
sentence within the specified time
frame.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
we have an inconsistent time frame between youths and adults, we will
fail to deal adequately with what changes at the age of 18. Most orders
will not require the maximum length, even if extended because of breach
action. It is for the courts to assess the appropriate length of an
order. Sentencing guidelines provide comprehensive guidance on the many
factors that should be taken into account when sentencing a person
under 18. I am confident that sentencers are well equipped to assess
the right length of sentence, but they need to have sufficient
flexibility to deal with the range of offending and offenders who fall
to be dealt with by a
YRO.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also point to subsection (1), which provides for the order’s end
date to align with the date that the last requirement of the order is
completed. That makes it clear to the offender that, if they meet the
requirements of the order, they will no longer have it hanging over
them. That is an important change. Furthermore, there is specific
provision under paragraph 11 of schedule 2 of the 2008 Act for a court
to revoke a YRO early in cases where the offender has made good
progress or is responding to treatment or supervision. That provides an
additional incentive for the young offender to complete their order.
That power is often used by youth offending teams to reward positive
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have greater sympathy with the amendments tabled by the right hon.
Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, because they at least recognise the need
for flexibility at the end of the order. I am not, however, convinced
that 
<div class="columnNumber">

               <p class="tabbed">I
hear what the Minister has said about the rare occasions where the

word “consistency”, because we need to design a system

for dealing with youth offenders in a way that, to put it crudely,
actually pays
off.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000072">&#160;</a>

that it will be helpful, but there we are. The amendment is a probing
amendment. I do not intend to press it to a Division, but such matters
are a real worry to many organisations that are, to put it in the
vernacular, in the know. The Prison Reform Trust feels very strongly
about the issue. We may return to the matter and I accept the
Minister’s argument, but I am still unhappy about the length of
some orders although, as he said, they may be in the minority. With
those few comments and the Committee’s consent, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the

                  </strong> The amendments are short. None the less, they are
important. As it stands, the provision provides for a £250 limit
on fines for breach of a youth rehabilitation order for under-14s to
apply to under-16s. The current limit for 14 to 17-year-olds is
£1,000, which would now apply to 16 and 17-year-olds, and could
be counter-productive. I see no reason why the current limit of
£250 should not remain in respect of under-14s and under-16s
because, if we are to impose a huge financial burden on such young
people, that might have unintended consequences if, for example, a
young person has been 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 672<a class="bkMark" name="Column672">&#160;</a>
                  </div>involved in acquisitive crime. Will they fall into the trap of further
acquisitive crime in order to pay off that £1,000
burden?<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is not meant to be soft on crime, but it would be consistent to apply
the £250 fine to under-14s and under-16s, so it is a realistic
measure. If we are  to encourage young people possibly to
breach their rehabilitation orders to clear a seemingly large fine,
that would be a waste of everyone’s time and counter-productive
in the
extreme.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000081">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My feelings about the matter are broadly
similar to those of the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd.
Although my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland raised a matter
of principle in respect of the difference between adults and children,
our objection to clause 69 was practical, as is our objection to clause
70. We do not take issue with the fact that it is appropriate to
introduce financial penalties for young people. However, one has to be
aware of the practicalities.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Most young
people do not have substantial means of their own and therefore the
burden is likely to fall on their parents, who in turn are unlikely to
have substantial means of their own. No doubt the Government would like
to use the clause to achieve the collection of more money by way of
fines, but they are not doing a very good job of that. It seems a
triumph of hope over expectation to say that simply by imposing
substantially higher amounts for quite young children the amounts
collected will increase, so all this is totemic. It is simply saying,
“We wish to appear tougher by imposing a higher financial
penalty.” In practice, it will have the opposite effect. It will
bring the law into disrepute if it is effectively unenforceable, simply
because people will not have the means to pay.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000083">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The levels of
fines envisaged—£2,500—are substantial. Most young
people of the age at which the fines would be imposed would not even
have a concept of that sum of money, let alone the means to pay it. For
that reason, we do not think that the clause is sensible—the
right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd made a similar
point—and it should not be in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000084">&#160;</a>

the courts from imposing on young people under 18 the new proposed
maximum fine of £2,500 for a breach of their youth
rehabilitation order. They would restrict the maximum fine to
£250 for under-16s, and £1,000 for 16 to
17-year-olds.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000085">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The youth
rehabilitation order is the community sentence for under-18-year-olds.
We intend to bring the fine limit for the breach of a youth
rehabilitation order into line with that of the breach of an adult
order. We wish to ensure that sentencers and the public have confidence
in community sentences and that punishments for breach are robust.
Where the young person or their parent have sufficient means, the court
should be able to impose a substantial fine if the child fails to
comply with the court’s sentence. Courts will still be required
to consider the offender’s means when setting a fine. We do not
expect courts to impose a very high fine where there is no prospect of
a child or the parent being able to pay it. This is not totemic. There
will be cases where plainly the parent—or indeed the
child—may have the means to 
<div class="columnNumber">

There is an argument for it. No doubt there will be people of very
substantial means who would be able to afford it. However, in the end,
it is a question of appropriate judgment. It is consistent and
appropriate to set the fine at £2,500 to bring it into line with
the level for adult breaches. That is why we have settled on
£2,500. I therefore urge the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw

the outset that the Government will not ask the Committee to support
the clause, which deals with magistrates’ sentencing powers. The
ensuing amendments in this group, to which I will return in a moment,
are based on the removal of the clause, but I will first explain why we
do not want to include it in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
stated in our Green Paper “Breaking the Cycle”, the
Government had proposed to repeal the provisions relating to custody
plus, intermittent custody and the related increase in
magistrates’ sentencing powers in the Criminal Justice Act 2003.
As drafted, they were overly 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 674<a class="bkMark" name="Column674">&#160;</a>
                  </div>complex and impractical, which was perhaps why they were never commenced
by the previous Administration. This Government have never ruled out
the possibility of increasing magistrates’ powers at some point,
if the case for it could be made. The recent disturbances have rightly
provoked further debate on that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Magistrates Association and others have raised the question of whether
increased sentencing powers would enable magistrates courts to deal
with more cases, and whether that would therefore speed up the justice
system. However, issues have to be considered about, for example, the
effect that increased magistrates’ powers would have on the
right to elect for Crown court trial. Recent events mean that it is
worth giving further careful thought to that issue, and in that light
we no longer think that it would be appropriate to repeal the existing
power at this
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
therefore propose that the unimplemented provision should remain on the
statute book while we consider the case for magistrates having
increased sentencing powers. For that reason, I will not ask the
Committee to support the clause. I should also make it clear that we
intend to continue with the repeal, as provided for in clause 72, of
the long-unimplemented and, in our view, unworkable custody plus
sentences.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
405 will remove clause 114(3), which contains a regulation-making power
that was designed to allow for changes to be made to maximum terms of
imprisonment on summary conviction. If clause 71 is removed, there is
no need for that specific power, which was intended to ensure that the
maximum term of imprisonment for any offence did not exceed the
magistrates courts’ sentencing
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000098">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
390, 391, 394 and 395 relate to the new knife offences in clause 113.
Amendments 390 and 394 increase the maximum penalty for the two knife
offences on summary conviction from six to 12 months. I stress that
that relates to the maximum penalty, not the mandatory minimum
sentence. Amendments 391 and 395 will  insert transitional
provisions such that the reference to “12 months” should
be read as “six months” until the provision increasing
magistrates’ sentencing powers is actually implemented. In other
words, that will allow the provisions on offences to be implemented
independently or before any change to magistrates’ sentencing
powers, and it will bring them into line with the offences that have
been created since
2003.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
may assist the Committee if I also mention that a similar provision
will be needed for the offence that will be created by clause 32(4),
which, as members of the Committee will remember, relates to the
offence of unlawful disclosure of information about financial
resources. As the Committee has concluded its consideration of that
clause, the Government intend to return to it at a later stage and to
table equivalent amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally, the
Government have withdrawn new clause 5, which would have
made equivalent changes to clause 71 for armed forces legislation. We
want to maintain consistency across the civilian and military
sentencing systems, so new clause 5 will no longer be appropriate if
clause 71 does not stand part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This group of

reaction to the new circumstances that have arisen from the

doing so, we are retaining the provision to increase

surprised when we saw the clause, because, before the general election,
the Prime Minister said that magistrates should be allowed to lock up
young thugs to end the crisis of order on our streets. We thought it
strange, therefore, that the clause was included. We believe that
magistrates courts’ powers are appropriate, so we are pleased
about the Government amendments. However, we wonder what the Secretary
of State for Justice is doing at present, as he seems also to
have been overruled by the Attorney-General, who said, on
7 September, in evidence to the Justice Committee, that
consideration should be given to raising the maximum sentences that
magistrates can impose, not least—he is right about
this—because it is much cheaper to run a case in a magistrates
court than in a Crown court.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000104">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has not said that he is about to implement the power in subsection (2)
of the 2003 Act, but that he will keep it on the statute book while
considering increasing magistrates courts’ sentencing powers.
The Opposition support that, but during his review the Minister should
take into account another aspect of the provisions in the 2003 Act,
because it is not just a question of the either way
sentences.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000105">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Section 280
of the 2003 Act also refers to schedule 26, which would
increase the penalties for many offences. I shall not read out the full
list of those penalties, because there are 30 or so, but some of them
are especially important, so I want to remind the Committee about them.
The offences include false statements on benefit claims, and various
firearms offences, including trespass and being drunk with a firearm.
There are many offences relating to animals, offences under the British
Nationality Act 1981, offences relating to testing for presence of
drugs, and road traffic offences, including drink-driving, which
Ministers have been considering at the instigation of my hon. Friend

relating to the prohibition of commercial dealings in human organs,
assaults on constables, offences under the Financial Services and

wants to increase the length of time to which magistrates can sentence
people from six to 12 months. That, as he has already said, relates to
the custody plus regime, which was legislated for in 2003. Clause
72 would remove it. As he has bitten the bullet on clause
71, I want the Minister to think more carefully about clause
72. We are opposed to it, because even though the provisions were not
implemented, they are sensible. It would be a good idea to keep them on
the statute book. I will set out
why.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000112">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">All
hon. Members know that there is a problem with the effectiveness of
policy on short-term prison sentences. There is a group of persistent
offenders committing crimes, and they generally receive custodial
sentences of less than six months. They can be some of the most
troubling offenders for communities. The problem with the current
regime is that if a person is in prison for six months, they rarely get
the kind of courses and programmes that are designed to address their
behaviour. When they are released for the second half of their sentence
in the community, they are not supervised by the probation service.
Once again, the problems and the underlying reasons for their offending
behaviour are not being addressed. The custody plus regime was designed
specifically to address that.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The problem
is not new. In 2001, the previous Government set up the Halliday review
whose report
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“One
of the most serious deficiencies in the present framework is the lack
of utility in prison sentences of less than 12 months. Only half of
such sentences are served…and the second half is subject to no
conditions whatsoever. The Prison Service has little opportunity to
work on the factors which underlie the criminality because the time
served in custody is so limited–and yet these sentences are used
for large numbers of persistent offenders who are very likely to
reoffend.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000351">&#160;</a>
               </p>

will give some of the reoffending statistics in a moment. The report
continues:<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000115">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">This
need could be met by requiring those who serve short prison sentences
to undertake programmes under supervision after release, under
conditions, which–if breached–could result in swift
return to custody. Under such a sentence, the initial period in custody
could be any period between 2 weeks and 3 months, and the period of
supervision could be any period between (a minimum of) six
months and whatever would take the sentence as a whole to less than 12
months. Such a sentence would be potentially more punitive in its
effect on offenders who breached their conditions than any existing
prison sentence of under 12 months.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000353">&#160;</a>

I am not happy about it. In 2007, 59.9% of offenders sentenced to 12

that custody plus, which rests on the balance between time in prison
and supervision outside, is the way to go. I understand completely that
it is expensive and that the Government are looking to make reductions,

the appalling rate of reoffending once offenders get into our justice
system. We need to find ways of creating resources to deliver
interventions. Hence the whole social finance investment in
Peterborough, which is so welcome. Hence the fact that Serco is putting
in resources to deal with offenders in Doncaster. That pattern will be

clause repeals the uncommenced provisions in the Criminal Justice Act
2003, which would have introduced custody plus and its variant,
intermittent custody. The custody plus provisions introduced a new
scheme for adult custodial sentences of less than 12 months. It was
designed to ensure that all such sentences consisted of a short period
of custody followed by at least six months on licence. The provisions
were not commenced under the previous Government, who accepted that
they were unaffordable and, in the case of intermittent custody,
unworkable. That remains the case, and it is therefore right that we
should take the opportunity to repeal those uncommenced provisions. By
remaining on the statute book, they have added considerably to the
complexity of subsequent legislation and have complicated an already
wretchedly complex sentencing
framework.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000130">&#160;</a>

one statute rather than, as currently happens, having release
arrangements that are still dealt with under the Criminal Justice Act
1991. That was another legacy of the failure to commence custody plus.

about time that something was done about clearing it up. There is a
difference of approach between the Opposition and us: we agree about
the objectives of driving down rehabilitation, but we differ about
whether mandating our professionals on precisely what to do under
statute is appropriate. Such an approach was followed by unbelievable
amounts of performance management, target-setting and central direction
to the Prison Service and the probation service about precisely how
they should deal with the people in their charge, as though those
services did not actually share the policy objectives of the
Administration and had to be told precisely how to undertake their
responsibilities. That took away from them the flexibility and,

                  </strong> We do not have to mandate the probation service by
statute. We will find ways, and it will come forward with others,
particularly through the two probation trust pilots that we are
running, to help deal with such offenders. The probation service is
already doing so under integrated offender management and through the
management of persistent and prolific offenders, with the police, the
local authorities and the Prison Service. That is already happening. As
we do not have the resources to underpin a statutory mandate from
Parliament, it is sensible to get shot of the statute provision, and in
doing so, enable our professionals to deliver the outcome that we all
seek, help enfranchise them as far as possible to best use the
resources that we put at their disposal, and find new resources for the
criminal justice system, not least as part of our wider social justice
agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000137">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I fully agree with my hon. Friend’s
reasoning about removing the provision from the statute book. I believe
passionately in the principle behind intermittent sentences, which I
hope we can introduce in future. However, the present system will not
have the capacity, finances or management ability to provide for such
sentences in the next Parliament or the one after that. It will take
substantial reform to introduce such a system; it took the Norwegians a
long time to get there. When the prison system is able to look at the
matter afresh, it will be appropriate for another Parliament to do so,
and on a far wider basis than in the current statute provision, which
would serve no purpose in this Parliament or the
next.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000138">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I endorse the
thrust of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Ipswich. I, too, have
been a long-standing supporter of the concept of custody plus,
intermittent sentences and a proper combination, where appropriate, of
short periods of custodial sentencing followed by intensive and
effective supervision in the community. When the Labour party was in
government, we sought to create such a system using custody plus as a
framework.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am
surprised by the Minister’s degree of anger, because there is
broad agreement on that model across the House. The argument seems to
be about resourcing 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 681<a class="bkMark" name="Column681">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the model and about freedom for professionals in the
system—although we are not clear from the Minister’s
exchange with my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland whether
that freedom would extend to the probation service—to determine,
without statutory guidance, whether to engage in intensive supervisory
activity with offenders in the community.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The provision
relates to sentencers as well as to those who deliver sentences, and we
need a framework that encourages them to make appropriate use of the
community element of sentencing options. If we devise sentences that
draw sentencers in that direction when appropriate, we will reduce, to
a degree, the amount of money that we have to spend on the custodial
system. The Minister seemed to imply that custody plus and intensive
community activity would pile on cost, and we accept that the system is
not cost free; but he does not acknowledge that if we designed more
effective sentences that resulted in people spending less time in
custody, there would be at least some measurable impact on the costs
borne in the Prison Service.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland said, there would be other wider
cost implications for society, too, such as lower reconviction rates,
which would result from good quality community interventions for
offenders who would otherwise receive short sentences. In addition,
there would be a wider impact on offenders’ domestic and social
circumstances. In particular, if people spend less time in custody and
are engaged in community programmes instead, it is more likely that
their family will hold together and that they will keep their home.
They might also be able to keep a job, which is one reason why I am
keen on considering intermittent custody, which enables people who hold
a job to be at work during the working week and, if appropriate, to
serve a short period of time in custody when they are not at
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000144">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
should be more willing to accept the thrust of the Opposition’s
argument. He should not be so angry about the fact that he is not keen
on the way the provisions would pan out. Instead, he should look for
constructive ways to achieve the objectives that it seems we all share.
If the Government are doing that, can the Minister guarantee that there
will be resources to make it effective? To expect lower reconviction
rates without putting the means in place to achieve them is to box
himself into a corner. It cannot
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000145">&#160;</a>

amount of press coverage when custody plus was launched. Yet it was
never implemented. It was

naive of me to hope that the Government will introduce an effective

want the provision retained on the statute book. I want to see the
Government working towards making it operational, rather than decrying
it and the difficulties. I welcome the commitments given by Government
Members about the value of good quality, rehabilitative community
sentences and, as we debate later clauses, we shall probe further the
degree to which they will put their money where their mouth is. In the

                  </strong> We are not in for a marathon. The amendments would
remove the age criterion from the bail reforms, so that they applied to
children as well as adults. They would also extend the availability of
remand from its being only for domestic violence cases, as the
Government have proposed, to its being for any case where there are
substantial grounds for believing that if released, the defendant would
commit an offence that caused physical or mental injury to any other
person. The amendments would also retain many of the provisions under
the status quo for adult bail. They would ensure that there were only
minor alterations to part 1 of the Bail Act 1976.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000182">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The first set
of amendments would remove the Government’s new plan to impose
the “any real prospect” test. I understand why the test
has been applied and I fully applaud what the Government are attempting
to do. I believe, however, that there are possible unintended
consequences that we should discuss. None of us would want to see
people remanded in custody for offences for which they will not be
sentenced to a term of imprisonment, if found guilty. We all start from
that point. However, the test is too narrow and could lead, for
example, to dangerous offenders or offenders who may abscond being
released on to the
streets.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000183">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
2010, 31,664 offenders absconded while awaiting trial. That is a vastly
reduced figure compared with the 57,500 who absconded in 2003. Although
the latest figure is still too high, it is foreseeable that it will
increase if the Government make it more difficult for the courts to
impose bail on defendants who may abscond. In short, the number of
absconders has fallen. Now is perhaps not the time to allow that figure
to
increase.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000184">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Prison Reform Trust, while welcoming the intention to remove the power
of courts to remand in custody defendants who would be unlikely to
receive a custodial sentence, refers to the 2007 figures. That year,
some 11,400 of the 55,000 people remanded in custody were subsequently
acquitted—21%—while another 30% received a non-custodial
sentence. The Government are rightly responding to that problem. The
average waiting time for those remanded in custody was 13 weeks. Those
legally innocent people were subjected to a damaging legal sanction.
The fact that a majority of people remanded in prison awaiting trial
did not subsequently receive a custodial sentence clearly demonstrates
that the current practice is unjust, arbitrary and imposes punishments
that are sometimes disproportionate to the
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000185">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While I
accept the Government’s intention and, in effect, fully agree
with the need for something to be done, I refer again to the law of
unintended consequences. There is some concern that the any real
prospect test may prejudice some cases at a later stage. It is
foreseeable that juries or judges may view an earlier decision to
remand a defendant in custody as a tacit implication of guilt, which is
not the case. The belief is that defendants are innocent until proven
guilty. The Magistrates’ Association said:<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“It
effectively places the court considering bail in the same position as a
sentencing court; it is unclear whether it is for the Crown’s
case to be taken at its highest. Many bail cases are required to be
decided on minimal information without the availability of reports and
ability of defence solicitors to effectively take instructions and
mitigate. This but for all the most obvious or simple cases [where bail
would usually be granted anyway] is seen as a fundamental weakness of
the test.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000355">&#160;</a>

because they have spent a period on remand and there may have been
changes in their circumstances, notably becoming free of drugs? Does he
agree that there is evidence that a sentencing judge may decide that
because of advances made on remand a non-custodial disposal is
appropriate in the particular circumstances, and that that may skew the
figures?<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000190">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his
support in principle for what we are seeking to do. The amendments in
the group before us all affect provisions relating to
defendants under the age of 18. Amendments 283, 284, 315 and 316 refer
to matters of substance, and amendment 282 removes provisions to ensure
that the same definitions are used throughout the Bail Act
1976.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 284
would cause the restriction on remanding in custody to apply to
defendants under 18. The effect would be to remove the condition that
the defendant has attained the age of 18 when applying the no real
prospect of custody test in parts 1 and 1A of schedule 1 to the Bail
Act. Amendment 283 makes a similar change to section 7(5A) when a
person is arrested for absconding or breaking his bail
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
315 and 316 affect part 2 of schedule 1 to the 1976 Act in a similar
way to amendments 284 and 289. Part 2 of schedule 1 concerns defendants
accused or convicted of non-imprisonable offences. To ensure a uniform
approach for the no real prospect of custody test, paragraphs 25 and 26
of schedule 10 to the Bill amend part 2 of schedule 1 to the
1976 Act so that certain exceptions to the grant of bail apply only to
those aged under 18 or who are convicted of an offence. The effect of
amendments 315 and 316 will be to expand the restriction on
custody in part 2 of schedule 1 so that it applies to both adults and
those aged under 18
alike.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Given
the right hon. Gentleman’s support in principle, I understand
why it may seem strange that a provision designed to make it less
likely that defendants are remanded in custody should be limited to
adults. Surely 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 685<a class="bkMark" name="Column685">&#160;</a>
                  </div>defendants under the age of 18 should be the first to benefit from such
a provision. I assure the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee that
defendants under the age of 18 are not excluded from the test, but it
is applied to them differently, as I will
explain.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000195">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
reason is that the consequences of being refused bail are different for
those aged under 18, and do not necessarily involve remand to custody
in the usual sense. In most instances, a defendant aged under 18 who is
refused bail will be remanded to local authority accommodation. That
will sometimes mean that they are placed in a children’s home.
In other cases, they will return to their own homes subject to
bail-type conditions. In all such cases, the defendant is accommodated
in non-secure accommodation and, critically, the local authority is
responsible for ensuring and promoting their welfare during that
difficult period. As paragraph 386 of the explanatory notes
states, the existing grounds for refusing bail will continue to apply
to those aged under 18 to ensure that
defendants<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000196">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“aged
under 18 who would otherwise be granted bail under the new test can
continue to be given ‘looked after’ status by the local
authority. This means that the person is assessed by the local
authority and receives appropriate assistance and
supervision.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000357">&#160;</a>

I should be grateful if she could narrow it to precisely the data she

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
equivalent of a no real prospect of custody test  is applied in
respect of defendants aged under 18 in chapter 3 of part 3 of the Bill.
However, in part 3, the test is phrased in the positive rather than the
negative. Therefore, a condition in one of the tests that must be met
before a defendant aged under 18 can be remanded in secure youth
detention accommodation is that there is a real prospect of custody.
Provisions in chapter 3 include measures to restrict the use of secure
remand so that in most cases a defendant aged under 18 receives a
remand to local authority accommodation. Only if one of the two tests
set out in chapter 3 is met can a defendant aged under 18 be remanded
securely in the way that an adult who is not granted bail may be
remanded. An adult who is remanded in custody is sent to prison. The
equivalent for a defendant aged under 18 is detention in a specific
juvenile custodial estate:  a secure children’s home, a
secure training centre or a juvenile young offenders
institution.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000199">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
test for defendants aged under 18 is similar to those that apply under
the Bail Act. The first set of tests applies where the offender is
charged with a serious violent or sexual offence. The second set
applies where the offender has offended while they have been on 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 686<a class="bkMark" name="Column686">&#160;</a>
                  </div>remand, and it is here that the no real prospect of custody test applies
as it does for adults under the Bail Act
1976.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
282 affects paragraph 3 of schedule 10, which is merely a drafting
provision. Provisions elsewhere in the Bill change the definition of a
young person so that it extends to those aged 17, and the expression
“child or young person” is therefore used in various
places to mean under the age of 18. Paragraph 3 of schedule 10 amends
section 3(7) of the 1976 Act. In that section, the existing reference
to a child or young person is intended to mean those under 17. It is
necessary to amend it to make that clear. Removing that drafting change
would therefore cause confusion. In light of all that, I hope that the
right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd will withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000201">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am afraid we are going to have more principled
disagreements in the discussion of these amendments. I want to set them
in context. Currently, the Bail Act provides different rules for three
classes of offender. The rules are different for people who are accused
of committing indictable or either way offences. There is a set of
rules for people accused of committing summary offences and a separate
set of rules for people accused of committing non-imprisonable
offences.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000206">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I confess
that when I first heard about what the Government were going to do with
introducing the no real prospect test, I assumed that they were just
talking about non-imprisonable offences. I think that a lot of people
who do not think about such things all the time might have had that
understanding. The no real prospect test, which the Minister is
introducing, has a description that is perhaps—I do not want to
say misleading, because that would suggest that it was
unparliamentary—open to misunderstanding.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My amendments
are related to indictable or summary offences. We would leave the
Government’s no real prospect test in place for non-imprisonable
offences. I will say what they are. Again, I think that that will be of
great interest to the right hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington.
They include making false statements to obtain a driving licence, being
drunk and disorderly, evading TV licence payment and failing to produce
a railway ticket. They are offences on which what the Government are
saying is fairly reasonable. The number of people remanded in that
category is around 1%, which is about 9,000 a year. We are able to
accept the Government’s proposal for that class of offence.
However, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 687<a class="bkMark" name="Column687">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the Opposition cannot accept it for summary and indictable offences.
Amendments 363 and 364 seek to reverse the Government’s
proposals on part 1 and part 1A offences.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000208">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, people are presumed to get bail unless they are expected to
commit further offences, expected to abscond or not turn up, or
expected to interfere with witnesses or to be a danger to others. The
tests are different for the three different classes of offence. At
present, there would have to be a high level of risk for a
non-imprisonable offence, and medium risk of committing another
offence, interfering with witnesses or being a danger to others for a
summary offence. The level of evidence needed for an indictable offence
is lower, because the offences are more serious. Taking into account
the seriousness of such offences, introducing the no real prospect test
would be
risky.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
remind the Committee of the classes of offence we are talking about.
Indictable offences include grievous bodily harm, sexual assault,
fraud, perverting the course of justice, robbery and burglary. Summary
offences include assault, theft, robbery and burglary. They are so
serious that it would not be sensible for the Government to use the no
real prospect test. The kind of offences that people alleged to have
committed those crimes would commit, the consequences if they abscond,
the risks if they interfere with witnesses and the danger to others are
serious. What the Government are doing with the no real prospect test
undermines community safety and a proper judicial
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000210">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
remind the Committee of what is going on at the moment. As the right
hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd said, 30,000 people abscond a year.
If we go down the Government’s path of having a no real prospect
test, that number is likely to increase. In answer to a parliamentary
question, the Minister told me that the number of offences committed
while people are on bail is 70,000 a year. That is 200 a day, which is
an extraordinarily high number, yet the Minister is going to relax the
number of people who are remanded to prison, so the number can only go
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Pendle (Andrew Stephenson), who has taken an interest in
this issue, has discovered that the offences committed while people
were on bail in 2009 included 27 murders. The Minister wants to save
money, but saving money and prison places at the expense of 70,000
offences a year is simply not acceptable. It is not how to promote
community safety.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000212">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The no real
prospect test could undermine the justice system in another way. The
problem is that there could be grounds for an appeal if
someone’s prospects of being found guilty have been considered
and they have been given bail at the first hearing and then
subsequently been found guilty at the final trial. The Minister needs
to take this measure away and look at it in a completely different
manner. A decision on bail is completely different from a decision on
sentencing. It is a different sort of a thing. What the Minister is
doing is conflating those two things in a most unhelpful way that is
only likely to increase the level of crime in this country.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope that I
have made it clear that we are extremely concerned about this measure.
Our objection is fundamental. It is one of the worst things in this
entire Bill and I will definitely press the amendments to a vote,
unless the Minister tells me that he accepts
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000214">&#160;</a>

me. However, I will have to disappoint her. She
presages her remarks by saying that there was a difference of principle
between us. Her amendments are fatal in her terms to 99% of the
underlying intentions. The one example that she did give us where she
was offering us support was around non-imprisonable offences, which
illustrates the issue that we are trying to address with this
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Schedule
10 makes a number of amendments to the Bail Act that will restrict the
availability of remand in custody. At present, the question of whether
it is likely that a defendant will be sentenced to imprisonment if
convicted is not a consideration in deciding whether he or she should
be granted bail. The principle underlying this provision is that it
should be such a consideration—that is the principle that we are
delivering with this schedule. It is said that decisions regarding
remand sentences are completely separate and they are as the law now
stands. The issue that this Committee and Parliament have to address is
whether they ought to be.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The current
arrangements mean that a defendant can be remanded in
custody—for example, to prevent him or her from committing
further offences—even though the court would not consider itself
justified in imposing a prison sentence for that reason after their
conviction. The hon. Lady has conceded that point of principle. She
would support us on non-imprisonable offences, because of the limited
number of circumstances—she said that the figure was 1%, which I
have no reason to doubt—but she conceded that if the offence was
non-imprisonable, the offender should not be remanded in custody, so we
have her support on that point. All we seek to do with the provisions
that she is declining to support is to use the practicality of whether
someone will reasonably be given a prison sentence as a bail
test.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
existing position should strike people as both odd and unjust. Where
the prevention of further offending is not a sufficient reason for
imprisoning people who have been convicted, how can we justify
detaining them before they have even been tried? Another reason for
remanding defendants in custody is to secure their attendance at court,
but doing so is a very expensive way of getting them in front of the
magistrates, and it is questionable whether that is necessary. If
defendants fail to appear, they can be tried in their absence, and that
already happens for thousands of people who are granted bail and do not
turn up. When they are granted bail, they are warned that the case may
proceed without them if they fail to surrender, and if they do not
appear the trial will go
ahead.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Remand
in custody is often used for someone charged with minor offences to
ensure access to health services, such as mental health treatment, in
prisons, but that is not an appropriate way to access treatment
resources. In general, defendants should not be remanded in custody
when it is apparent to the court that there is no real prospect of the
defendant being imprisoned if they are convicted. That is not some
Alice in Wonderland question of having the sentence first and the
verdict afterwards. The court is not expected to engage in a sentencing
exercise before the trial; the provision only affects cases in which it
is clear at the outset that the alleged crime is not serious enough to
warrant a custodial sentence. When that is the case, remanding the
defendant in custody is generally disproportionate and it is not a
sensible use of prison, as that sort of defendant does not pose a
serious threat to public safety.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000219">&#160;</a>

order.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000221">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> At the end of the day, as I have seen in practice,
a person under those circumstances—very disorganised, in huge
confusion and having psychiatric problems—might be remanded in
custody simply to sort out whether he or she is capable of giving a
plea  to the court, and the judges may ask for a report to be
prepared within 14 days or whatever. All I am asking is whether there
is flexibility in those, thankfully, very small number of
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000222">&#160;</a>

prison as a result of the offence for which they have been arraigned,
they would not pass the no prospect test, but if there is a mental
health requirement, that should be properly proceeded with under the
mental health arrangements. We are not here to abuse the justice system
at very significant expense because other parts of our whole social
justice system are not working properly. Frankly, too many people with
either mental health or addictive health issues should never have made
their way into the justice system in the first place. If we had a
system—which is what we are attending to—that delivered
earlier intervention, with mental health diversion, better addiction
treatment and all the things we are attempting, we would end up in a
better place, rather than having people reposing in custody who,
frankly, should not be there. I can understand why we got into this
position: because the practicality for magistrates, seeing a situation,
is that they think, “Well, if we pop him inside, he’ll
get some health treatment and all sorts of other things sorted out for

into the criminal justice system because they have committed crimes, it
would be sensible to ensure that we have addressed the mental health
issues before we go on, as we have to, to address the justice issues.

Government need to think very carefully about what they are doing,
because they are overturning a substantial body of law and practice,
which has grown up under the Bail Acts over many years. The Bail Acts
have often been criticised by the Conservative party, which says that
bail is given too freely. I find what is happening now, which stands
that on its head completely, difficult to
understand.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000236">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> May I make the position clear to the hon.
Gentleman? He has suggested that an intolerable burden will be placed
on people making assessments, and that is not the case. The provision
applies only where it is clear on the information before the court that
the defendant has no real prospect of being imprisoned if convicted.
The court is not expected to carry out a detailed assessment, and if
the information is equivocal the provision will not apply. That is
clear, and it takes precisely the position of principle that the hon.
Member for Bishop Auckland concedes: with non-imprisonable offences the
provision would have Opposition support. The cases that we  are
concerned with are ones in which people will not go to
prison.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000237">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister is struggling. Just saying that
something is clear does not mean that it is clear. The bail regime sets
out a variety of criteria to be used when considering bail. The
Minister mentioned the issue of further offending: to my mind, it is
fundamental to the rule of law that where there is a severe risk of
further offending people should not necessarily be told immediately
that they can go from the court.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000238">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that when we get to the amendments on indeterminate public protection
sentences, we shall see whether the Government have any solution to the
problem of people who are a clear danger to the public being released
into the community. In the present case—in the wake of serious
rioting, which apparently does affect the Government’s view on
clause 71—the Minister is saying that they are prepared blithely
to tear up the Bail Acts and that criteria such as further offending,
surrender to bail and intimidation of witnesses can all be dealt with
in the casual manner that has been described.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000239">&#160;</a>

the solution is a great increase in trials in absentia is ludicrous. A
trial in absentia may perhaps happen sometimes for minor motoring

circumstance for regret.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000240">&#160;</a>

                  </span> If the hon.
Gentleman had been speaking 10 years ago he would have been right about
more serious offences, but decisions of the Court of
Appeal—there was a decision eight or nine years ago—have
changed the regime on trials in absentia. They are now somewhat more
common, even in the Crown court, than they used to be.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000241">&#160;</a>

say that that is a desirable circumstance, but a series of tests is
applied that makes them more common than they were, and most

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman, as he often does, makes my
point for me, and says that such a consequence is to be regretted.
Indeed, the Minister suggests that an increase in trial in absentia
could be a possible outcome of the provisions becoming law. That is not
something we would wish for, and neither would we wish victims or
witnesses to be put at risk. Louise Casey, the commissioner for victims
and witnesses,
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000243">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Victims’
groups during consultation have expressed alarm about proposals to
remove the option of remand where the offence with which they are being
charged is unlikely to attract a custodial sentence. The removal of a
remand in custody for defendants unlikely to receive a custodial
sentence does not recognise the other safeguards which the Bail Act
provides.”<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000359">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>We agree with that and
that where possible, judicial discretion should be preferred and not
curtailed in the way it is now—that goes back to the point
raised by the Magistrates
Association.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000244">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
withdrawing clause 71, the Minister has conceded that it is appropriate
for magistrates to have greatly enhanced sentencing powers and the
ability to sentence for 12, rather than six, months for a single
offence. The Government should think again about that issue, because it
is a far more significant change than it is presented as being. Either
the Government are being disingenuous, or they have not realised the
implications of the provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000245">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
suspect—I think my colleagues share this view—that what
lies behind this measure is an attempt to save money. It has not
attracted the same degree of notoriety, but it is comparable with the
provision for a 50% discount on sentencing for an early guilty plea,
which aimed to save £140 million. The legislation under
discussion would save rather less, although the Government say that it
will still save a significant sum of money. Such provisions are a way
of reducing the prison population without being seen to be “soft
on crime”—in other words, without reducing tariffs or
saying to the general public and Back Benchers from the
Minister’s party that we are taking a less punitive approach to
incarceration.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000246">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Given the
cuts that the Department has to make, there must be a reduction in the

                  </strong> In my experience, bail decisions are among the
hardest decisions taken by lay magistrates, particularly if they are
sitting alone, which can happen in some circumstances, including the
early stages of a case when less information is available to provide a
sense of whether a custodial sentence is a real prospect.

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have a few questions for the Minister, and a final point for him to
consider. I am concerned that we do not have enough information about
the implications of the proposal and how it will translate in practice.
Some of my written questions ask for a breakdown of who is remanded in
custody, on what grounds, and their gender and ethnic make-up, and that
information is not as available as I would have liked. I would be
grateful if the Minister told us to what degree he intends to monitor
those who receive remand on bail should this change come through, and
the nature of those people who will continue to be remanded in custody.
What breakdown will he track of the reasons for remand in custody and
the gender, ethnic and age mix of those defendants, and so
on?<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000250">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I should also
be grateful if the Minister assured us that if the provisions come into
effect, there will be decent training for decision makers. In my view,
it would be dangerous to ask decision makers to go in and determine
whether there is a reasonable prospect of custody, without a
substantial rethink of the training offered, particularly to lay
magistrates, who will struggle to make such decisions on the basis of
the training that they currently receive. I hope that the Minister will
tell the Committee what training he plans to put in place for those
decision makers. I would be grateful if he told us what monitoring will
be undertaken in relation to the ultimate sentences that people receive
for offences and what happens to reoffending
rates.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000251">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
will the Minister clarify something that he said in response, I think,
to my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland? He said that now, the
ultimate sentence is not a relevant consideration for bail; in the
future, it will be a relevant consideration. Will he clarify whether he
has considered whether it will be a relevant consideration or the only
relevant consideration and, if it is the latter, why he does not think
that it could be one of a number of considerations but has to be the
sole consideration that courts should take into
account?<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000252">&#160;</a>

done my best with those questions, but of course, as with any policy

about whether it is “a” or “the”, it is
“a”. The point that we have been discussing is one of the

come to the Committee and say that there was a problem with the 11,000

non-custodial sentence and that that was a justice issue. He has not
mentioned that group of people. Indeed, they have been mentioned only
by the hon. Member for Broxtowe, who made the very sensible point that
that figure was inflated, and that one reason why some of those people
do not go on to receive a custodial sentence is that they have already

actually interested in the justice issues. They are not interested in
whether the bail decision will undermine the subsequent court process
by allowing more people to interfere with witnesses, by enabling more
people not to turn up. They are not interested in community safety.
They are not concerned that, at the moment, 70,000 crimes are committed
every year, and that number will only go up. What they are interested
in is saving money. The estimate that they have included in the impact
assessment for the Bill is that the measure will save 1,300 prison
places and £40 million. Opposition Members do not think that
this is a reasonable way to save £40 million, because it

the prosecution wishing to exercise the right of appeal set out in
subsection (1) above oral notice of appeal shall be given to the Crown
Court at the conclusion of the proceedings in which such bail has been
granted and before the release from custody of the person
concerned.</p>

of.</p>

appeal under subsection (1) above against a decision of the Crown Court
to grant bail shall be commenced within 48 hours excluding weekends and
any public holiday (that is to say Christmas Day, Good Friday or a Bank
Holiday) from the date on which oral notice of appeal is

any appeal by the prosecution under this section such appeal shall be

the person concerned in custody or may grant bail subject to such
conditions (if any) as s/he thinks
fit.’.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would give the prosecution a right of appeal in a case where
bail is granted and someone is not remanded to prison. The process we

remanded and the defence wishes to appeal.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000282">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The issue was
brought to our attention as a result of the horrific case of Jane
Clough. I do not know whether hon. Members are familiar with the case,
but some  of Jane Clough’s relatives are listening to
the debate, and I commend them on the way in which they have persisted
with their campaign to ensure that the terrible events that overtook
her do not occur again.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Jane Clough
was murdered on 25 July last year by her ex-partner, Jonathan Vass, who
was out on bail, despite the large number of charges against him. In
fact, he had been charged with nine counts of rape and four counts of
common and sexual assault against Jane. The case in which he was to be
tried for those counts of rape and assault was due to be heard, but the
judge decided, notwithstanding what the Crown Prosecution Service had
told him, that Jonathan Vass should not be remanded to prison and
should be released on bail.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000284">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The case
raises two questions. One is about the judge’s decision making;
the other is about the process. I know it is traditional never to
criticise the judiciary, but on this occasion I will. This decision was
quite extraordinary, totally outrageous and completely
incomprehensible. In any other profession, such a decision would have
led to disciplinary action. I would like to ask the Minister what
happened, and whether he is attending to the need to address the
disciplinary issues within the judiciary when its members take
decisions which are so far removed from what the British public would
see as sensible and
reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000285">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My understanding is that the Crown Prosecution
Service had given the judge the information. That is also what the
Crown Prosecution Service itself says. Indeed, that is one of the
reasons why this case is so alarming. It relates to the long-standing
problem of ensuring that domestic violence is taken seriously in the
court
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000287">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend’s experience in the case that
she sets out is not unique. I have dealt with the case of a gentleman
who was arrested for having a store of arms—including
sub-machine-guns—and was bailed, because the police were not
aware that the bail hearing was going to be heard. The police did not
turn up to the hearing, as they did not actually know about it, and so
the judge bailed the gentleman. He went on to commit a further offence,
and when the police went to arrest him, he attacked them with a samurai
sword. It is quite clear that this is not an isolated case, and I was
as frustrated as my hon. Friend was to find out that no action was
taken against that judge, because there is no action that can actually
be taken against judges in such
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000288">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his
intervention, which demonstrates that this unfortunately is not a
one-off episode, and that we do need to address both the performance of
the members of our judiciary and the rules that apply in these
circumstances. My amendment seeks to address the issue of rules, and I
hope that the Minister will do something about the
judiciary.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000289">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment gives the prosecution the right to appeal to another Crown
court judge in a case in which the prosecution believes that remand to
prison is warranted. It does not require the submission of further
evidence. It does require that such an appeal be lodged speedily. That
is important: we are not seeking a massive increase in the number of
appeals. Rather, in very serious cases, in which there are high levels
of violence and risk to victims, there should be a right of appeal. I
hope that the way in which we have set this out achieves that
aim.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the
Minister wants to tell me that my amendment needs some drafting
improvements, and that he wants to take it away to address it and come

                  </div>issue across the House—the hon. Member for Pendle (Andrew
Stephenson), for example, has promoted a ten-minute rule Bill on the

problem. I very much hope that he will give us a sympathetic
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000291">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I want to make some very brief remarks, and to
echo the tributes to Mr and Mrs Clough and their family, who have not
only attended today, but also gave evidence to an all-party inquiry on
the law about stalking, which was expertly chaired by the right hon.
Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd. I am grateful to the Clough family and
to others who gave evidence to that inquiry. The intervention by my
hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, which was addressed by the hon.
Member for Bishop Auckland, raised a very important point. The question
of the assessment of risk is a vital issue, which needs to be addressed
not just by courts but by all agencies which are involved in the
prosecution and monitoring of serious and serial offenders. That is the
real mischief here, and it needs to be dealt with, in order to address
the proper concerns raised by the Clough family and
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000292">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
strongly support a change in the law to allow an appeal against a
decision to grant bail. However, I take issue with how the amendment is
drafted, although the intention is entirely right, as to allow an
appeal from one Crown court judge to another puts that Crown court
judge in an appellate capacity over someone of equal status. That is a
difficulty. If the amendment is drafted so that it would be an appeal
to a High Court judge, that difficulty is cured. I strongly advocate
that approach, as it would make the position clear. The High Court
judge would be the appellate judge on a decision on granting bail.
There would be no question of one judge of equal seniority
second-guessing another. The prosecution would then be put on an equal
footing with those defendants who have the power to appeal to High
Court judges against the refusal of bail.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000293">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is an
anomaly, which this tragic case has illustrated. It is very sad that we
have to be here to learn from a tragedy such as that experienced by the
Clough family to look to a proper amendment of the law. I urge the
Minister to look carefully and expeditiously at this matter and to
introduce an amendment that would allow the prosecution to be on a
genuinely equal footing with the defence when it comes to decisions to
grant or refuse bail in the Crown
court.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000294">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I, too, am aware of the tragic and harrowing
circumstances of this case. I add my voice to those members of the
Committee who have spoken. I agree with the hon. Member for South
Swindon that the only flaw in the amendment is that it would be hugely
embarrassing for one Crown court judge to oversee another Crown court
judge’s decision. It is a small amendment, and it would be
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000295">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Given the
circumstances and the bravery of the Clough family in coming to give
evidence to our stalking inquiry, as well as attending today, which
cannot be easy, we owe it to them and to many other people—alas,
it is not a unique case—to look seriously at this right of
appeal.  I urge the Minister, as the hon. Member for Bishop 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 698<a class="bkMark" name="Column698">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Auckland has done, to take the amendment away and look at it and
incorporate the addition to which the hon. Member

per annum, perhaps fewer, but there is an anomaly and a flaw, and we

               <p class="tabbed">I
have obviously looked at the case extremely carefully, and I wish to
dissociate myself from the criticism of the judiciary made by the hon.
Member for Bishop Auckland. It was not appropriate. I studied the
transcript carefully and, clearly, everyone concerned with the matter
wishes that a different conclusion had been reached. However, there are
lessons to be learnt, not simply that a judge flew in the face of
reason. The hon. Lady’s criticism was not appropriate. Other
flaws in the process need to be dealt with, and they have been taken in
hand by the Crown Prosecution
Service.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000300">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
we are still left with an issue of principle: should there be an appeal
in respect of the decision of a Crown court judge not to remand someone
in custody? One of the issues with which we must deal if we instigate
an appeal process is at what level we end it. The hon. Lady conceded
when introducing her amendment that it would be inappropriate for the
decision of one Crown court judge to be referred to another Crown court
judge as part of the appeal process. If the High Court were then to
examine an appeal process, which would be the obvious next level, do we
create a process whereby there needs to be an appeal from that judge up
to the Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court? We need to know
where the balance properly lies. We must remember that Crown court
judges conduct murder trials. They have serious responsibilities in our
system, and we are considering appeals against a decision by a judge
with significant
responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000301">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have drawn attention to a matter of principle. The Government have
considered it, and we now wish to accept the thrust of the amendment

                  </div>the ten-minute rule Bill proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for
Pendle, with whom we will now properly engage in details about
resources and practicality to draft the necessary amendments in fit
shape to put on the statute book at an appropriate time. I can only
express my hope that that will take place during our proceedings on the
Bill. I cannot give the Committee an undertaking, but we are working
towards it.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000302">&#160;</a>

such action happens within the legislative vehicle that we are
discussing? The Bill will be discussed on Report in a fortnight. It
will be debated in the Lords and the Government can table amendments to
it. No doubt, changes will be made and it will return to us. The
Minister should be able to commit to making amendments to the Bill, the
deadline for which is Easter, in six months. The Government are putting
through many other changes. Everyone agrees that such matters are
important. I hope that the Minister will use this legislative vehicle
to take such action.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000303">&#160;</a>

sufficiently certain of the precise impact, so I do not know what court
processes would be required for a High Court judge to be in place fast
enough. If a Crown court judge bails someone and the Crown Prosecution
Service subsequently requests for that person to go into custody, how
long should he be in custody before a High Court judge is made
available? What processes would be required?<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000306">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Bishop Auckland has made suggestions in her amendment that
are a perfectly reasonable stab at achieving our aim, but I must ensure
that processes are available to underpin measures such as those
proposed. I am happy to assure the Committee that we are earnestly
engaged in that exercise, but we want a system based on proper data and
on proper estimates of the number of times that such a facility would
be used by the Crown Prosecution Service. I wish I were in a position
to give the Committee such estimates now, but I am not, so I cannot
provide absolute certainty. I hope that my concession of the principle
of the case satisfies the Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for
Pendle and, not least, the parents of Jane Clough. They have made their
case, which the Government have accepted in principle. We will try to
find the means to put the proposal in

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Bishop Auckland referred to the case of a complaint against
a judge. Disciplining judges is for the judiciary and, given the
independence of the judiciary, that matter is absolutely not something
on which a Minister would wish to comment. I understand, however, that
there is no complaint against that judge, but we will double-check to
ensure that I have been correctly advised. If that is not so, I shall
write to the hon. Lady.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000311">&#160;</a>

made it clear that the Government have been convinced by the case made
by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle and by all those who have
contributed to the discussions in Committee. We must ensure that we
properly administratively discharge my commitment to the principle,
which I hope the Committee will welcome. I understand that the hon.
Lady wants the proposal to be included in the Bill; so do I. If we
include it, however, we must proceed properly and effectively without
mashing up the administration and leaving problems, such as people
being remanded in custody for too long when a Crown court judge has
sought to release them on bail.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000312">&#160;</a>

suggests that independent members of the Bar are less persuasive than

Bar, will take it from me that that is not what I meant. However, the
CPS has considered the processes in the case. Undoubtedly, such
occasions will occur, and however wonderfully talented independent
members of the Bar are, if they pick up briefs at short notice without
having completely grasped the case, they might not do quite as well as
they ought. He shakes his head—of course, that could never
conceivably happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11101189000314">&#160;</a>

far as the tragic Clough case is concerned, I am content that the
agencies involved have, very properly, examined what happened carefully
and taken the appropriate decisions in light of that tragic experience.
The Government are happy to accept those administrative actions
internally, but the question of whether an appeal from a Crown court
judge, in the way that the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland described,
is appropriate remains open. We are happy to agree the principle, but
now we want to go away and ensure that we can satisfactorily put it
