<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I invite the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) to resume his speech, it might help the Committee if I make plain my intentions for the afternoon. I will suspend the Committee at 5 o'clock for 30 minutes and then suspend it for dinner at 7 o'clock for only one and half hours. That should be sufficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I was talking about whether people with stakeholder pensions will be obliged to buy annuities on retirement. I particularly wanted to point out that the Revenue argument against abolishing the requirement to buy annuities is bogus. Its argument is that pension fund contributions enjoy the benefit of being tax free and that anything other than an annuity would damage the Revenue.
<P>
If one considers what already happens for those who operate draw downs for people up to the age of 75, it will be seen that the position for the Revenue is broadly tax neutral. There may be pluses and minuses but, to the extent that funds are drawn down, they are taxed as income. In the event that the surviving spouse of an individual dies, leaving funds in a pension scheme, those funds are then taxed at death at, I believe, the rate of 35 per cent. They could just as easily be added to an individual's estate or taxed at a standard probate rate.
<P>
The argument that moving to drawdown arrangements would result in a loss of revenue is false. In the present climate in particular, drawdown is likely to benefit pensioners and stakeholder pensioners. It permits them to enjoy the improved capital returns from equity investment, which are likely over time to continue to be significantly better than fixed-interest investment, which underlies the standard annuity. More particularly, the option of when an annuity may be purchased protects a whole generation of stakeholder pensioners from potentially being forced into buying annuities at unfavourable times and subsequently experiencing significant inflation.
<P>
Equity-linked with-profits annuity schemes are at present unattractive to stakeholder pensioners because of the rule that not more than 3 per cent. above the laid-down amount can be distributed. In the event that a return of more than that amount is achieved, it can be deferred to years when equity returns are less favourable, but any accumulated surplus on death reverts to the insurance fund and not to the estate, spouse or heir of the survivor. That discourages many people from using equity-linked with-profits annuities.
<P>
My main point is that the Government are clearly set on the money purchase route for stakeholder pensions. I do not see why an option in the scheme could not be flexible enough to allow final salary-linked pensions, especially if companies were willing to offer that option. They would give pensioners much more security and they would be better able to know what their pension might be. If that is not to be permitted, it is essential that it is not a requirement that an annuity is bought at retirement.
<P>
In addition, the general requirement that applies to certain personal pension schemes that an annuity has to be purchased at the age of 75 should be reconsidered in the light of current pensioners' wishes and what stakeholder pensioners will want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I am interested in the discussion of what happens at the age of 75. I want to gain from my hon. Friend's knowledge of the matter. Why is it in people's interest to delay the purchase of annuities until long after their 75th birthday? I know that annunities are in a bad state at the moment, but given the mortality rate, why might it be in someone's interest to delay?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It is unsatisfactory for people to have to buy annunities at 75 if they go on to live to 95 and if that was a bad time to buy annuities. Similarly, it is unsatisfactory for people to have to buy them at 65 or 70. As has been explained, the enormous increase in the cost of annuities and the decline in their yield are mainly due to the fall in interest rates, but also to the increase in longevity. Committee members will be aware that annuity rates represent a combination of the two factors.
<P>
If one reaches the age of 75 hale and in good health, one's life expectancy goes up. At 75, a male can expect to live to the age of 83; a female can expect to live slightly longer. It can be unfortunate to be locked into having to buy an annuity at the age of 75, possibly on poor terms, to cover another eight to 10 years.
<P>
I infer from a nod from the Minister that stakeholder pensioners would be obliged to buy annuities on retirement. That seems especially inappropriate&#151;under the existing rules for personal pension schemes, there is at least 10 years' leeway. I would impress on the Government the fact that hundreds of thousands, nay millions, of people will have to buy annuities in the next few years. As I argued earlier, some of the Inland Revenue's arguments against people deferring the purchase of annuities and against the possibility of abandoning the principle, are bogus. Both those procedures could be organised on a basis that was revenue-neutral to the Treasury.
<P>
I would impress on the Government the need to reconsider the issue, to look at the tax laws pertaining to with-profits annuities, and to combine a review of the subject with this important legislation. It is not much good creating a situation in which more people will save to purchase pensions, only to find the terms on which they can do so unsatisfactory. They will not thank a Government who held out an olive branch only to disappoint.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> We have had an interesting discussion and I am grateful to hon. Members for having raised such points because there is concern and discussion about them in the House and elsewhere.
<P>
I agree with what the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) said about the Government's skilful management of the economy. She might agree, as I do, with the International Monetary Fund. In its recent assessment of the state of the British economy, that body
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``commended the authorities for the United Kingdom's impressive economic performance in recent years and their skilful management of the economy. Directors observed that a virtuous cycle of rising aggregate demand, employment gains, and higher asset prices had helped the economy sustain a relatively high growth rate, without creating significant inflationary pressures.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that that was the hon. Lady's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> With regard to the IMF, does the Minister agree that the Government's record can only get better when compared with that of the previous Labour Administration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the IMF said, we have an extremely impressive economic record. I thought that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), who leads for the Opposition on such matters, would be especially pleased that the IMF noted:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``on an HICP measure of inflation, the United Kingdom already displayed a greater degree of convergence on inflation with the euro area.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Opposition Members' views on that might vary.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am finding this fascinating, but the subject is only peripherally related to the amendment.
<P>
Mr. Timms
<P>
: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
Inflation is at the heart of our discussion because it is the pensioners' biggest enemy. The fact that inflation is well under control&#151;as the hon. Member for Beckenham said&#151;is extremely good news for those who rely on annuities for their pension. The great majority of annuities are fixed in value, and the biggest threat to them would be another surge in inflation.
<P>
As we have discussed, stakeholder pensions are envisaged as money purchase schemes. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised some important questions on that point. We intend the same arrangement to apply to stakeholder pensions that currently applies to personal pensions&#151;annuity purchase can be deferred until the age of 75, in accordance with the Pensions Act 1995. Income draw down will be available in the interim, but the requirement to purchase an annuity by the age of 75 will remain. That is because of Inland Revenue rules&#151;as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said&#151;and not because of the trust deed, to which the amendment refers in relation to buying an annuity. The Revenue would have a different view from the hon. Gentleman of how tax should be paid and the tax loss that would result if the requirement in relation to purchasing an annuity was dropped.
<P>
It is important to remember that the aim of a pension scheme is to secure an income in retirement. Generous tax concessions exist to help people build up a substantial fund, and it is right that, in due course, the fund should be converted into an income stream that can be taxed. That is the purpose of the arrangement in the 1995 Act.
<P>
There is significant concern about the fall in annuity rates, which are determined by market activity and reflect factors such as life expectancy and long-term interest rates. Annuity rates have fallen, but so has inflation. The best protection that the Government can offer to those purchasing annuities is to maintain our new framework for stability to ensure low inflation in the future. The proceeds from an annuity over the period during which it is in payment&#151;given lower inflation and higher investment returns from the stock market&#151;are not necessarily much worse than they were in the past, when they looked more attractive. Annuities can remain in payment for 20 or 30 years, and although their current starting rates are lower than previously, if the investment fund that purchases the annuity has grown well in recent years&#151;and if inflation is low&#151;they are not such a bad deal.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham suggested that other financial instruments, which the Government had not considered or did not know about, could do the job of an annuity. If so, I would like to know about them. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs did not know of them, and I have heard much more criticism of the annuity arrangement than I have suggestions for alternative instruments. Annuities are dependable and provide a reliable life-long source of income for those who buy them. Any alternative into which pensioners could put their funds must have the same characteristics. I do not think such products exist, but if they do I would be interested to know about them.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham also raised a point that I think was mentioned on Second Reading. She suggested that, in 20 years' time, people will need savings of &#163;100,000 before they are better off than they would be if they relied on income support. That is misleading because the figure is expressed in cash terms. If you express that in terms of today's prices, the figure is about &#163;41,000 at the moment. However, even that figure ignores all income other than the basic state pension, whereas anyone who has worked will have a retirement income in addition to the basic state pension, either through SERPS or another scheme. That would further diminish the figure. So the suggestion that you would need to have savings of &#163;100,000 to be better off than if you relied on income support is misleading.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be very nice to have &#163;100,000 spare, but I do not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I meant to say, if one had that sum.
<P>
Drawdown will be available to people when they retire as an alternative to buying an annuity immediately and as applies to personal pensions. That provision will be retained. However, I am cautious about the benefits of drawdown. It is undoubtedly advantageous for some people, but I think that one needs to have a fund of at least &#163;100,000&#151;some people say more&#151;for it to be a wise course to take.
<P>
Several people have been inclined to follow the route of drawdown to begin with, in the hope that annuity rates will rise, whereas annuity rates have in fact continued to fall. So I would be cautious about urging people to follow that route because they may be better off taking out an annuity. I listened with great interest to what both hon. Members said. No doubt, in due course, we shall want to reconsider the arrangement. However, as I said at Question Time on Monday, it does not seem that any fundamentally different approach is available as an alternative. We are using the arrangments that are already in place for personal pensions for the stakeholder option.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies (Grantham and Stamford:</B> I was pleased to catch your eye only after the Minister had done so, Mr. McWilliam, because it enables me to intervene once during this debate, rather than twice, as I should certainly otherwise have had to do in the light of what the Minister just said.
<P>
It is tempting to jump straight in with that, but I first want to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, who has tabled an extremely pertinent amendment and generated an extremely interesting discussion. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, who knows a great deal about this subject, also made a notable contribution. The Government would be extremely foolish not to listen to Committee members who know the subject, although, as we know, they refuse to listen to people outside the House who know something about the subject and who were looking forward to taking part in the consultation process, which they now cannot do.
<P>
The Minister thinks that that is funny. He has overridden the consultation process, and made a mockery of the whole thing. In fact, he and I were speaking yesterday at a conference of public sector pensioners&#151;I do not think that I am revealing any secrets because it was a public occasion&#151;where much strong emotion was expressed from the floor to the Minister about the fact that he had overridden the consultation process. Representatives of the police, the Post Office and various other pensioners protested.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Although I have a high regard for the police and, indeed, worked for the Post Office for a considerable time, the hon. Gentleman's point does not arise from the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I agree, but the abuse of consultation is a serious matter. In a sense, it overarches every clause in the Bill because every clause might have been different had it been based on a proper consultation exercise.
<P>
I want to make three serious points about what the Minister said. First, it is not satisfactory for him to respond to the amendment by saying that the position of pensioners as regards annuities will be ``not necessarily much worse'' than the previous position. Those were his words&#151;I wrote them down. The first condition relates to the first two words and the second condition relates to the word, ``much''. The situation is not good enough&#151;pensioners face a serious problem. A few years ago, they were looking forward to nominal annuity rates&#151;I shall come on to the issue of real and nominal rates in a moment&#151;that were typically in the teens: between 13 per cent. and 15 per cent., and more with age. The rate is now between 4 per cent. and 7 per cent&#151;although the higher figure, which was mentioned earlier, is an optimistic rate, and people would beat a path to the door of anyone who offered it in the present circumstances. That lower rate makes an enormous difference to people's prospects on retirement.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): Will my hon. Friend confirm that the real rate of return is the percentage figure minus the rate of inflation? With a rate of return of 4 per cent. and an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent., the real return would be 1.5 per cent. When the rate of return was 14 per cent. and inflation was 6 per cent., the real return was 8 per cent. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Sedentary interventions are always to be deplored. They usually prompt the speaker who is on his feet to stray out of order, and the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford does not need much prompting in that direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I must say, that is a bit much! Who was it who started talking about the euro and the IMF a few minutes ago? It was not me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I told the Minister off for doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham made an extremely perceptive point. Nominal and real gilt yields have fallen over the past five or 10 years, and nominal and real annuity rates have both fallen. The real return to pensioners who buy annuities, which they are currently obliged to do by the Government, has fallen, which is serious. It means that everyone is in a worse position. There is a still a problem if that position is much worse or only a little worse, but the figures that I quoted show that the fall has been substantial. It is not good enough for the Government to do nothing about the problem other than try to bury it. Their current mood is that because they have a large majority in the House they cannot be forced to accept our amendments.
<P>
Events during the past 48 hours have made the position even worse. The Budget makes it clear that future generations of pensioners will not benefit from the married couples allowance. They will have to make a downward adjustment by many hundreds of pounds a year to their prospective income on retirement.
<P>
I notice that the Minister has turned to the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities, and is no doubt asking him whether I have got my facts right. I do try to get them right. If the Minister reads the Red Book, he will find that the married couples allowance is protected for people who are born before 1935&#151;the Chancellor referred only to pensioners. That is a typical new Labour sleight of hand. The present generation of pensioners are protected, but they will pass on&#151;as we all will eventually&#151;and new generations that retire will not enjoy the married couples allowance. When people who were born in 1936 retire, they will find to their cost that their projections and assumptions about their retirement should be changed because of this week's events.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister intervenes, I must point out that our debate has again strayed away from the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I must emphasise, for the Minister's benefit, that the position is not satisfactory, and that the Government are making it worse.
<P>
The Minister made two fundamental errors in his response. If I may respectfully say so, he is getting a bit careless. He said that the problem was not great, and that people who take out annuities are not much worse off&#151;if at all&#151;compared with the position that they would be in if they had income drawdown. His explanation was that they had done much better as a result of the stock market performance over the past few years, which boosted the sum in their pension fund, and which they would use to buy the annunity. That is an elementary error. The Minister must know that investment decisions should be based on marginal cost and marginal gain, and not on considerations of sunk cost or previous gain.
<P>
We are talking about someone who has accumulated, as a result of the stock market&#151;an extraneous factor that has nothing to do with the tax or pension regimes, or the Bill&#151;a greater or lesser sum of money. The question of how they use that to their best advantage is not relevant to the amount that they have in hand, which may be &#163;100,000 or &#163;1 million. The Committee has to decide whether people are disadvantaged if they can only use that capital sum to buy an annuity and are not able to retain it in another form of investment from which they can draw an income. That is the important issue. I do not know whether the Minister is trying to confuse us or whether his explanations reflect the confusion in his mind.
<P>
The Minister is obviously concerned about the threshold of savings below which it is no longer worth while saving because of constant means-testing. I have raised that problem on the Floor of the House and in Committee. He said that the figures of &#163;80,000 and &#163;100,000 were not correct; the amount should have been &#163;40,000. Again, he made fundamental errors. He said that someone who had been in work would have accumulated through SERPS or a contracted-out personal pension scheme money that was additional to his national insurance state retirement pension. But that is not true of the self-employed, who have, once again, been forgotten by the Government.
<P>
When the Labour party first thought of stakeholder pensions, it presented them to the country in its manifesto&#151;which we now know was a superficial public relations exercise. The manifesto said that there was much in the scheme for the self-employed. The Government's rhetoric in their first 18 months in office was to assert that the stakeholder pension was great and that it would be wonderful for everyone in employment who did not have an occupational pension&#151;we discovered on Tuesday that that was not true&#151;and for the self-employed. But the self-employed have been forgotten. The Minister's example is meaningless unless we assume that the self-employed cease to exist. It appears that that is the basis for the Government's arguments. That is a deplorable state of affairs.
<P>
The Minister got the figure of &#163;41,000 wrong. Any given sum will be worth less sometime hence if there is inflation. The Minister will probably say that &#163;100,000 at some point in the future is worth &#163;41,000 now, depending on the period and the discount rate that he chooses to use. Had he listened to me, he would have realised that I got around that problem by making my calculations in real terms. I first made this point in the Chamber. By assuming a 3 per cent. real rate of return, a person who saves &#163;1,000 a year will end up with the sums that we are discussing.
<P>
The Minister can have it any way he likes because he can use his own nominal rate of return, but he must index or inflate both sides of the equation by the same amount. If he does that and takes account of the self-employed, his view will be closer to mine. The point is not whether the amount is &#163;100,000 or &#163;80,000, but that people are being invited to waste too much money. It is pathetic and tragic that people who may not be financially sophisticated are being taken in. I shall return to that when we debate welfare issues.
<P>
As for annuities, my hon. Friends the Members for Beckenham and for Arundel and South Downs made it clear that there is a problem. We know that our constituents are worried about annuities, especially as they reach retirement. It is fair to say that no one anticipated the fall in real and nominal rates, which in many ways reflects the reduction in inflation rates and anticipated inflation in this country and throughout the world, which is a positive development. Nevertheless, given that we have the problem, we must do something about it. We cannot leave high and dry those people who invested with a particular set of assumptions in mind, and simply say, ``We don't care&#151;it's too bad. Get lost.'' Nor should we say, as has just been said, ``Well, the problem has not necessarily got much worse''.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The real problem is that inflation is a global phenomenon that Governments cannot control. Does my hon. Friend accept that the risk is that people who buy pensions now, when annuities are expensive, may also be hit by a future increase in the rate of inflation, the recovery of the Japanese economy, and so on? It is a fallacy to assume, as the Minister does, that because inflation is low it will stay low throughout the 25-year life of an annuity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is absolutely right. My hon. Friend makes a key point, which I am glad he introduced into the debate, about people aged 60 or 65 who take out annuities at current rates and who have the good fortune to live to 85. The Minister mentioned the IMF, which I would not have dared to mention in your presence, Mr. McWilliam. That reminded me of the practices of the previous Labour Government which, were the Government to adopt them, would lead to the ruin of such people. However, I shudder to countenance the appalling prospect of the Labour party governing the country for 25 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Is my hon. Friend suggesting that, should I live to the age of 85, I will have to live under a Labour Government for 38 years?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do hope that the hon. Gentleman's response will reflect the amendment and not the look of sheer horror on his face.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) was at least 30 years away from the point at which tax legislation would permit him to purchase an annuity with his pension product. Perhaps he looks older than his years. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend is in danger of losing the support of his colleagues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I apologise to my hon. Friend. I meant to say that he looks younger than this years.
<P>
The Government have done nothing about the matter, but the Conservative party intends to do something about it. Later this afternoon, I shall table with the Clerk an amendment to schedule 2 that would remove the 75-year rule and enable income drawdown to continue indefinitely. That would be reasonable and right for pensioners and would encourage people to invest in pensions. Pensioners would not be deprived of their investment return by the annuity system anomalies to which my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham drew attention, regardless of investment performance, pension costs and difficulties associated with setting up pensions.
<P>
We want people to save and on a basis that would be a good deal for the taxpayer. Currently, capital sums may be retained by individuals until they die and then passed to their heirs. Where such individuals die before the age of 75, the Inland Revenue applies a special rate&#151;I believe it is 38 per cent.&#151;between the standard and the top marginal rate. If the value of the deceased's estate exceeds &#163;250,000, it is liable to inheritance tax as well. The Revenue therefore gets its slice of the action in due time.
<P>
That is a reasonable and responsible provision and I am sorry that the Government are unwilling or unable to adopt it. Their handling of the matter betrays nonchalance and lack of seriousness and thoroughness. They have said some extraordinary things, committed fundamental errors of methodology and shown contempt and lack of sympathy for the self-employed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): My hon. Friend has already established that stakeholder pensions are a dead duck. Will he agree that he is being far too charitable to the Government in his attempts to improve them by detail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes, but perhaps I was not sufficiently clear about what the amendment will do. The amendment will remove the 75-year rule for all the types of pension to which it applies, not just stakeholder pensions. I have said many times that we do not think that many people will take up the stakeholder pension, for the reasons that we have set out, although if it turns out to be the best product for someone, I should be the first to want them to take it up. Whatever the pension product, people will have the benefit of the waiver to the current rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I believe that the Government's own figures have shown that, apart from carers, those without private pension provision are predominantly the self-employed. Out of a work force of some 5 million, and apart from carers, some 3.5 million to 4 million are self-employed. The stakeholder scheme was surely aimed at the self-employed rather than the employed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Indeed, it was. My hon. Friend will recall that the Minister's predecessors said that the self-employed would be one of the major targets of this proposal, but that has not been the case. The self-employed are not mentioned in the Bill and have been treated slightingly this afternoon.
<P>
Our job is to try to improve matters. If the Government do not address them, we shall do our best to do so instead. We shall probably have to await our return to power before we can do much, but in the meantime I repeat my gratitude to my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, and the gratitude of all Opposition Members&#151;no Government Member has taken part in the debate, apart from the Minister&#151;for bringing this matter forward and giving us such an interesting debate. I hope that I shall be able to catch your eye later in our proceedings, Mr. McWilliam, so that I can pursue the matter more extensively.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I do not know whether it is something to do with the amount of hot air being produced in the Room, but it is getting quite hot down here. I wondered if we could take off our jackets.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is perfectly in order. I hope that hon. Members are not suffering from a surfeit of blue cheese and jam.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> As somebody whose feet froze this morning, I am delighted that it is warm this afternoon.
<P>
I also thank my hon. Friends for so eloquently and learnedly backing up my arguments about annuities and the need to encourage the development of different instruments that will give people a better return than annuities currently do.
<P>
I do not misunderstand the fact that the reason for the current system of pensions is partly to enable the Inland Revenue to get its slice. I accept and approve of the way in which at present, one does not pay tax on a pension until one receives the income. Therefore, I was slightly taken aback when the Minister tried to suggest that what I was saying would lead to people not paying tax. That was furthest from my mind. I was trying to suggest that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford has so eloquently proved, there are better returns to be had in the market. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs highlighted a number of them.
<P>
One point that I clearly did not make very well was that, until there is a glimmer of hope that the Inland Revenue will not always insist on annuities, nobody will bend their mind to finding alternatives. That is why the Government must tell us that there is some space for that sort of thinking. There must not only be discussions with the Revenue, the Treasury and the Department of Social Security as to how it can be done; there must be a willingness to accept that new instruments can be developed. I have great admiration for the City as a financial centre and should the space be created, I have no doubt that with the available brains, including those in the Committee, other instruments could be developed that are reliable and provide a better income.
<P>
I referred to someone saving for a stakeholder pension and requiring a fund of around &#163;100,000. I suspect, Mr. McWilliam, that you have the equivalent of &#163;100,000 in your pension fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> At least.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I was reassuring you, Mr. McWilliam, because I had the impression that you thought that there was not &#163;100,000 in your pension fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall the famous occasion when the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) was reminded that he had &#163;300,000 in his House of Commons pension fund?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> That must have brought even the hon. Member for Bolsover to a halt.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am fully paid up in the House of Commons pension scheme and cannot add to it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I hope that you have some space in your Post Office pension fund, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
The income that could be received from a pension fund of &#163;100,000 would equal the amount available from the minimum income guarantee, housing benefit and council tax benefit. As it is not compulsory to contribute to a stakeholder pension, people will see that their best interests do not lie in setting up a stakeholder pension scheme, because they will know that they can take advantage of state benefits and take a good holiday with the money that they would have spent on their annual deposit into the fund. Who could blame them? It would be a sensible decision. The problem is that the Minister believes that people's economic best interests are those which the Government wish them to have, rather than those based on people's own calculations.
<P>
I was pleased to hear from my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford that he wishes to put this broad amendment into a more practical form. I accept that it might not be technically correct and I am glad that he proposes to table another amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend is making a good case. Does she agree that it is fundamentally cruel to tell people at retirement age that they must put their pension funds into an annuity which provides 6 or 7 per cent. and lose the total capital sum, when, at the present gilt rate, they could keep the whole capital sum for themselves&#151;and their widow, if they leave one&#151;and receive a yield of around 5 per cent? The provision does not make sense.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I agree, and perhaps we can consider the matter in more detail when we come to schedule 2. I hope that my hon. Friend's amendment to the schedule will be selected so that we can explore different ways of ensuring that people can maximise the return from the savings which they may have put into a pension fund with difficulty.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have spent a lot of time on the clause and it is right to have done so. After years of planning, consulting and discussion with the industry, clause 1 will made a reality of stakeholder pensions.
<P>
Our proposals for modernising the pension system rest on three linked pillars. The first is the minimum income guarantee, which we aim to uprate over time in line with earnings, so that even the least well-off pensioners will be able to share the benefits of rising national prosperity. The second pillar is the state second pension, which will assure people who have worked and paid national insurance contributions throughout their lives of a pension on retirement above the level of the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The third pillar is the stakeholder pension scheme, which, for the first time, will provide for a large number of people affordable funded pensions so that they can look forward in retirement to a secure income with national insurance rebates that will reflect the state second pension arrangements and which will be more than they could expect from the state pension. The clause puts in place that third pillar.
<P>
Under the clause, the starting point for stakeholder pensions should be on a trust foundation. We have discussed that, and we think that it is the right place to start. We must ensure that at the heart of each stakeholder pension is a mechanism to make certain that the interests of members are protected in a way that was so disastrously absent from the early days of personal pensions. A board of trustees will provide for that. When commending the trust-based approach to stakeholder pensions, the independent Pension Provision Group reported last week that such pensions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will represent genuine consumer power&#151;not just protection&#151;in the market place''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have not ruled out alternatives to trust governance and, if comparable protection can be provided by alternative mechanisms, we will issue regulations to enable them to be used, too. We said that stakeholder pensions will be money purchase schemes and that there will be tight constraints on the level of charges for them. That was contested by Conservative Members, but my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) helpfully drew to my attention the comments on Second Reading of the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government are right to concentrate their efforts on costs and charges, which were too high for many.''&#151;[Official Report, 23 February 1999; Vol. 326, c. 248.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was correct and that is why we shall be setting limits on charges.
<P>
Stakeholder pensions will allow flexibility on the amount and regularity of people's contributions. We are developing the stakeholder pension framework with the needs in mind particularly of those earning between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 a year. That that fact attracted so much discussion among Conservative Members came as a surprise to Labour Members. Most people in that income bracket will want to contract out of the state second pension into stakeholder schemes, which will clearly be to their advantage when the state second pension becomes flat rate which, as the Green Paper suggests, will be in five years or so.
<P>
To begin with, some people in that income bracket will stay in the state second pension. Thereafter, there will be few for whom that makes sense. We want people to make decisions about such matters without the need for individual, detailed advice. We think that about 5 million people will find stakeholder pensions attractive, including 3 million people who have no current funded provision and, to pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, 300,000 self-employed people with no funded provision.
<P>
It is not entirely clear whether new clause 2 is intended to replace clause 1 or to be read in conjunction with it. The latter approach would mean that the new clause, as drafted, would have no material effect. A scheme that did not meet the criteria set out in clause 1 would not be a stakeholder scheme, even if the conditions of new clause 2 were met. I assume, therefore, that Committee members intend that new clause 2 should be the only definition of a stakeholder pension scheme. That would bring within the definition of stakeholder schemes any tax-approved pension scheme in respect of which an employer offers a payroll deduction facility to his employees.
<P>
Opposition Members have made clear their resistance to the requirement to establish schemes under trust. However, new clause 2 would remove all other conditions as well, with the exception of the requirement that schemes should be tax-approved by the Inland Revenue. Schemes would not, for example, be required to meet the minimum standards on charges&#151;supported by the hon. Member for Ryedale&#151;and flexibility. We regard that as an essential safeguard for members and potential members of stakeholder pension schemes. The idea of setting out minimum standards in such a way has been widely welcomed by the pensions industry, the Association of British Insurers and other commentators.
<P>
A curious feature of the definition in new clause 2 is that a pension scheme could be a stakeholder scheme in some circumstances, but not in others, depending on whether the member's employer offers payroll deductions. The result would be extremely confusing.
<P>
It will, of course, be possible for existing group personal pensions to qualify as stakeholder pensions, provided that they meet the conditions set out in clause 1. The Committee agreed earlier with the suggestion in the Green Paper that we should consult on how group personal pensions should be treated for the purposes of compliance with the employer access requirement. There are good group personal pension arrangements, especially when employers contribute, and we sought views on how best to incorporate such employers, to ensure that employees are not disadvantaged by any change.
<P>
Therefore, I hope that the Committee will agree that new clause 2 is neither necessary nor desirable. Stakeholder pensions are a significant step forward in the modernisation of the UK's welfare system. The clause will provide the destination for billions of pounds of people's savings, and will ensure that that destination is dependable and good value for money. It aims to meet the needs of people whose needs are not currently being addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> As the Minister said, we have spent a long time on the clause. I am glad that he said that that was worth while because, on that matter at least, we are entirely at one.
<P>
The essence of the stakeholder scheme is set out in clause 1 and it is right for the Committee to consider all the different aspects of the Government's proposals. There are many matters to discuss, such as costs on employers, but broadly speaking, most of the fundamental issues are in the first clause. If those factors have been sensibly conceived, the stakeholder scheme will be seen as a good idea, but if not, and if the provisions of new clause 1 are found wanting, it is right that the scheme should not proceed as the Government propose.
<P>
It may have just been confusion on the Minister's part when he said that he did not understand how new clause 2 related to the existing clause 1. I understood that, in order to offer an alternative to clause 1, it was necessary to table something called new clause 2. Perhaps I have followed the wrong procedure, for which I take full responsibility, but our intention is that new clause 2 should replace clause 1, which we think is seriously flawed. We have already been arguing against it, and various amendments to it have been tabled.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It may benefit the hon. Gentleman and the Committee if I explain that if clause 1 carries, new clause 2 falls.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> You endorse my interpretation, Mr. McWilliam. I assume that you called the two together because they were alternatives and it did not make sense to consider them separately. I am glad to have your support and I hope that the debate can proceed on that understanding.
<P>
We have already had a thorough discussion of the major elements in clause 1. Stakeholder pensions are weighed down with burdens that the Government have not justified. They have not justified their insistence on trusts being formed. When I asked the Minister about it, he said that trusts would be the first step. He now says that if an equally good alternative legal structure were found, he would be happy to accept it. The basis for doing that is provided for in regulations, although they do not refer to an alternative legal regime.
<P>
That is welcome, but it is a considerable change from the Green Paper. I do not want to be churlish, but our debates, including the Minister's statements to the Committee, will be unclear to the public who, I am sure, will have read the Green Paper. They may have thrown it into the waste paper basket when they realised that they did not have time to respond to it, as they were invited to do.
<P>
Paragraph 29 on page 53 of the Green Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Existing personal pensions will not therefore be able to describe themselves as stakeholder pension schemes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One cannot get much clearer than that. If the Government have moved on that, we welcome it. In that case, let us say no more about that document, which is slightly embarrassing to the Government in that respect. I am afraid that I might have to refer to it in other contexts. If there has been some movement on that matter, the Committee has not been wasting its time or the taxpayer's money in considering it.
<P>
Another aspect of the stakeholder scheme that we fundamentally object to is that it unnecessarily excludes certain types of perfectly viable pension products, one of which is personal pensions, including group personal pensions. The Green Paper states that personal pensions&#151;presumably, including group personal pensions&#151;cannot be included. The Minister was more conciliatory and said that there might be a way to include group personal pensions. If they can be included, so much the better.
<P>
I have completely failed to draw the Government on one matter, in this context or any other, because Social Security Ministers at least desperately wish that it did not exist. I do not know whether Education and Employment Ministers feel the same way. I cannot draw them on LISAs. We have argued throughout that stakeholder pensions should provide a framework in which people can invest via a LISA, but we have had no response about that. Perhaps we will have to wait until we have an opportunity to ask a Treasury Minister before we find out about that matter.
<P>
It is nice that the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities is on the Committee. We are pleased that he is here, but it might have been helpful to our deliberations if a Treasury Minister had been here who could have given us some answers on LISAs. We have heard no answers from Social Security Ministers; they do not want to discuss that rather hateful issue.
<P>
The Minister and I attended another conference in the City. The Minister explained lucidly and in his usual charming way&#151;no one had read the small print then&#151;the proposal for stakeholder pensions, but he mentioned only in passing that the Treasury has some other proposals. When the Minister had left, some poor, hapless Treasury official had to defend her alternative proposals for LISAs. So the discussion was disjointed&#151;one part of the Government's proposals was presented at the beginning of the morning and, at the end of the morning, another quite different set of proposals was presented by an official from another part of the Government. It was all very mysterious, and I was not the only one who was a little surprised.
<P>
We have now established that such schizophrenia exists, but I cannot believe that it is in the national interest. I cannot even believe that it is the Labour party's interests, or in those of the famous media manipulation machine that it is so proud of, that such schizophrenia should be allowed to continue indefinitely. Perhaps it is time that the Prime Minister, or even the most important man of all&#151;Mr. Alastair Campbell&#151;began to focus on the obvious discrepancy between the two arms of the Government that he runs.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): If he has time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Indeed, if he has time while running the rest of the Government.
<P>
We have made a little progress on personal pensions, which, together with that on trusts, justifies many of our efforts in Committee. However, we have made no progress on other matters. The Minister says that people will be protected to ensure that the costs will not be too burdensome so that they take part in the schemes. We have asked him how that will be done, but have had no answer. We have asked him what costs he thinks will be reasonable, but have had no answer. This morning, however, he said that the stakeholder scheme will cost less than personal pensions. How can he possibly know that when no one knows what the cost of stakeholders pensions will be? One cannot say that X is bound to be less than Y, when X does not necessarily have any value at all. That makes no logical or practical sense. I am afraid to say that it really means that the Government do not know whether they are coming or going.
<P>
Today's Financial Times reports that the Government's proposals for the cost, access and terms marking of ISAs&#151;the Government's new tax shelter and investment product to replace&#151;TESSAs and PEPs&#151;have broken down entirely because, the Chancellor of the Exchequer's announcement on stamp duty in the Budget statement made it impossible for those planning to market them to continue to do so at a total rate of 1 per cent.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Again, that is extremely interesting. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is delighted not to be serving on the Committee of another Finance Bill, and that matter is for a Finance Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Perhaps I can persuade you by analogy, Mr. McWilliam, that there is some relevance to what I am saying. The Government's system for CAT marking and other financial products has broken down and has been shown to be non-viable. That does not augur well for the Government's ability to limit a stakeholder's costs, and so undermines the credibility of the Minister's statement this morning, in which he said that stakeholder pensions would be cheaper than paying personal pensions. He does not know now what level of charges can be held, and that probably explains the fact that the attempt to CAT mark the ISA has broken down. It also explains the Minister's reluctance to say how he intends to fulfil the undertakings in the Green Paper, which, in this instance, have not been withdrawn in Committee. Instead, they have been reinforced by what he has said about the Government remaining committed to controlling costs.
<P>
The Minister threw at me the fair comment that if my new clause 2 were accepted there would not be a statutory limitation on costs. In assuming that, he has read the new clause correctly. In the debate on costs that we had the other day, I hope that he heard me say that the Conservative party does not believe in decreeing what should be the cost of any goods or services, as we do not think that that is sensible. We believe that, in efficient markets, the market will establish the right cost. If someone started charging prices that were higher than the market price, more capital would be drawn into that business, and the supply of that product would increase until the price came down&#151;that is how the market mechanism works. Despite all the new Labour rhetoric, it seems that the Government do not believe in that.
<P>
I made an important proviso the other day&#151;I have not thought of it right now&#151;and I make it again. Efficient and competitive markets require open and transparent markets so that competition is maximised. The thrust of the Government's pension proposals, as I have explained to the point at which it must have got home even to Labour Back Benchers, who have not been paying much attention to our proceedings&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Unfair!
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Perhaps they have been. Perhaps they agree with everything I say. As my hon. Friend says, perhaps I am being unfair to the Labour party. I would hate to be unfair to it&#151;when have I ever been known to be unfair to it? There may be an alternative hypothesis. Labour Back Benchers have agreed with so much of what I have said that perhaps they think that it is platitudinous, requires no further comment and can simply pass. That is fine, and I take some comfort from it.
<P>
How does he have a competitive and efficient market in pensions? If such a market exists, the market mechanism will work and the Government will not need to have civil servants or Ministers second-guessing the price of products. That is a nightmarish idea&#151;it does not make any sense.
<P>
In the Bill, the Government have deliberately and gratuitously produced a regime that artificially fragments the market. That is the main problem and our main complaint. It is addressed and resolved by our new clause, which opens up stakeholder pensions to any product. It does not say, ``This kind of product can have this tax regime, and that type of product can have that regulatory regime, and the other type of product will simply have to be allowed off money purchase schemes,'' and so on.
<P>
That is what the Government propose. There is also the Treasury's product, of which it says, ``We are so jealous of it that we do not want to mention it all, so we shall not say what category it falls into.'' That attitude will undermine and segment the market. By doing so, it will place barriers in the way of competition, enhances costs, and ensure that the market mechanism is not working. The new Labour Government are making the same fundamental mistake as old Labour. Labour Governments used to intervene in markets, and consequenty found that markets did not perform efficiently. They had to redress the distortions and additional costs that were generated by their intervention in the market by producing a new regulation, new form of intervention or new subsidy. As a result, the distortion from market reality was even greater. That vicious circle caused Labour economic management to break down in the 1940s and again the 1960s and 1970s. I am old enough to remember the end of that experience, which was pretty ghastly. Opposition Members always refer to that, and to what happened as a result, so I shall not mention it now.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was merely about to remark to the hon. Gentleman that as I was once technically the owner of Adam Smith's grave, I understood exactly what he was saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I bow my head at the mention of that name. He is one of my great sources of intellectual inspiration. Most of them come from north of the border&#151;as, I believe, do you, Mr. McWilliam. Once Adam Smith, David Hume and John Stuart Mill are taken into account, the rest of philosophy can be summed up fairly rapidly.
<P>
On costs, the Government have gratuitously created a problem for themselves. The solution is our proposal to get rid of the artificial barriers and let the market mechanism work.
<P>
Another complaint about the Government, which was not addressed by the Minister&#151;perhaps he was worried about this morning's debate on the matter&#151;related to the issue of advice. Clearly, one of the worst problems with the Government's artificial fragmentation of the market is that individual choices are made more difficult, hazardous and expensive. Not to provide for people to be properly advised on their choices is to invite disaster. I do not use the word lightly. It will be a disaster for many individuals, who will find&#151;perhaps 10 or 20 years later&#151;that they took the wrong decision as a result of not taking independent advice. They may not have been able to afford it at the time and simply followed the advice of the Government's wonderful public relations management machine. If you earn between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 a year&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman knows precisely what I earn. It is the same as every other non-London Member of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Thank you for that guidance, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
We are considering an extraordinary state of affairs. Not one but a series of flaws occur in almost every subsection of clause 1. Two possible solutions exist. One is to abandon the whole exercise and forget the idea of stakeholder pensions. That is not the solution that the Conservative party advocates, and it is not the conclusion that it draws from these proceedings. On the contrary, Conservative Members think that the fundamental idea of requiring employers who can reasonably do so&#151;employers who employ less than 10 people should be excluded&#151;to set up a payroll deduction facility has clear advantages. It will make it easy for people to contribute directly to a pension out of their salary, they will not have to write cheques, and they will think of the money left after deductions as their disposable income. But there is no need to go beyond that. A regulatory framework is clearly necessary, we need to ensure that there is no undue loss of tax revenue, and we wish to continue with the existing tax arrangements. There is also merit in the Government's saying, that one can exclude a certain amount of money&#151;so many thousand pounds a year&#151;from one's taxable income without any questions being asked and without it relating to actual earnings. The amount could be more generous than the &#163;3,600 proposed by the Government&#151;&#163;5,000 would be reasonable. The savings ratio is falling badly in this country at present, so there is every reason to do something about that.
<P>
However, we believe that it would be fatal to say, ``You can choose either that or the Revenue's sliding scale,'' because that would fragment the market. Some products would use one and some the other, which would make it difficult for people to decide what to do. Such an arrangement would almost certainly mean that people would have to move between different products during their working lives. They would not be able to stay with the same pension product, however good it was and however well managed the money as a result. That arrangement would be crazy. Therefore, we propose a very simple structure.
<P>
The Government have not dealt with the &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 figures. What has been said today is extremely dubious. The Government have changed their mind and seem no longer to regard the stakeholder pension as an attractive product for a wide range of people&#151;not, for example, for those without an occupational pension scheme or for the self-employed, despite all that was said before. Such pensions make sense only for people earning between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 a year, although the Government have made the matter more complex by suggesting that they may also make sense for those on higher earnings. We have argued today and on Tuesday that they do not make sense for everyone whose income is between those two figures. Why should people with an existing personal pension unwind it and go into a stakeholder scheme?
<P>
Most people earn less than &#163;9,000 a year, or more than &#163;18,500 a year, at some point in their lives. Those who earn between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 every year from the age of 17 or 18 through to their retirement at 60 or 65 must be in a minority. The proposed artificial system, which would make sense only for people earning between those two figures, would cause the problems of choice that I mentioned: it could also almost be guaranteed that at some point in people's lives, such a pension would be inappropriate for them. That would mean either that people would not be behaving rationally and optimally in their own interests, or that they would have to incur the cost of switching in and out of stakeholder schemes, which is highly undesirable.
<P>
Our solution is integrated, seamless and simple. There is great merit in simplicity. ``Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem'' might be our motto&#151;[Interruption.] I thought that that would wake the Committee up.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall not comment on that, Mr. McWilliam.

Simplicy is a virtue. Complexity needs to be justified; where it cannot be, and where there is an alternative, simplicity is to be preferred. We should adopt a simple procedure in this case.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Conservative party proposes a stakeholder pension that would form a framework, or wrapper, containing any acceptable products, which would be subject to regulation and to the rules of the Inland Revenue. That arrangement would permit people to bring in existing personal pension schemes, or a LISA, if they so wished. As the Minister rightly says, all that it would mean is that employers would provide a payroll deduction facility. I do not think that there is anything wrong with that. What is right about it is that no artificial barriers or costs would be created and there could be as much continuity in someone's relationship with his or her pension scheme as he or she wished. That seems highly desirable and would be an obvious advantage to the increasing number of people who change employers, or are sometimes self-employed and sometimes employed. When they are employed, they will tell their employer, ``This is my approved pension scheme. Will you please pay however much a month from my salary into it.'' The employer will do so, just as he makes provision to pass on national insurance, or tax under pay-as-you-earn. That is the system and no Labour member has suggested that there is anything wrong with it&#151;only one of them has spoken. The new clause has obvious attractions and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I hesitate to speak after my hon. Friend, who was so eloquent on new clause 2 and clause stand part. I start from a slightly different perspective. I can readily recall hearing the Secretary of State's original statement about stakeholders and thinking that the idea was rather good and met a need. However, in the past few days in Committee, listening to the Government's approach, I have become disillusioned. I am not entirely sure that the stakeholder proposal in its present form will make any difference.
<P>
As the proposal is restricted to a small band of people, there will be a considerable gap between those who might qualify for a stakeholder pension&#151;for whom it might be a good idea&#151;and those who can receive an occupational pension. People will often fall through the gap. I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind taking out a stakeholder pension against the background of the new LISAs, which will be far more attractive for those on the envisaged level of income. Unfortunately, there seems to be a battle between two large Government Departments in which a Treasury representative works his or her way through the Department of Social Security, closing offices, turning off the lights and gradually winding down the whole place.
<P>
The Minister said that the Bill was the culmination of all the consultation, but forgot to remind the Committee that consultation is still taking place. As we expect to finish considering stakeholder pensions relatively soon&#151;most of the meat of it is in this part of the Bill&#151;we will not have the benefit of the outcome of the consultation. Therefore, I do not regard the Bill as the culmination of a natural process, but the culmination of a retreat from the original idea put forward by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). We are offered a stakeholder pension in name only.
<P>
In his introduction, the Minister said that the scheme would be affordable. Most people who take out a pension under a scheme will not know that. They will not be able to test that scheme against another, because most such people will not be able to afford to take advice, so they will find themselves stuck in a pension scheme that does not meet their needs. Added to that is the issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham about annuities. We have a system that offers not especially good coverage while one is trying to accumulate the sums of money, and not a very good deal when one comes to purchase annuities.
<P>
The Government's position on clause 1 revolved around trusts. We were told that trusts were a good idea, but it was not explained why trusts were not necessary under the LISA arrangements. To read out the reply that the Minister of State, Department of Social Security gave me, which is set out in columns 63 and 64 of the record of our second sitting on Thursday 4 March, would be tedious and I do not propose to do so.
<P>
I asked the Minister, ``Why trustees?'', which seemed a reasonable question. I am not a pensions expert and I wanted to know. I am the former trustee of a pension scheme and I performed that role in investing for local authorities to the best of my ability at the time. As it would be tedious to repeat what is in the two columns, I shall use an analogy. I know that you, Mr. McWilliam, are keen on the arts. I am sure that you will recall that wonderful 1960s' film ``Zulu'', which portrays the stand at Rorke's drift. In one scene, a young private looks at the array of Zulus standing, ready to overwhelm the garrison and asks, ``Why us?'' To which the sergeant&#151;an excellent performance by Nigel Green&#151;says, ``Because you're here, son.'' It seemed that the only answer that I got from the Minister was a simple, ``Because you're here.'' We shall have trustees because they are there, but for no other obvious reason.
<P>
It was also not clear to me what would happen if a trustee exceeded the prescribed charges. What would happen to the stakeholder pension then? The Minister said that that just would not happen. However, we can envisage a situation in which trustees enter legal disputes to protect the stakeholder pension. If the reasonable cost of a legal dispute could not be exceeded, either a stakeholder pensioner would find himself in the difficult position of having to abandon legal proceedings and being seen as a soft touch, or the stakeholder pension would have to be wound up.
<P>
The worst aspect of the proposals is that a section of society will be offered something, but it will not be the best possible deal. New clause 2 would offer people further down the economic ladder the flexibility of occupational and personal pensions and many of the advantages enjoyed by people who have them. The Bill might be this generation's only chance to get the issue right, but sadly it represents a missed opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> What stakeholder pensions should be about and for whom they are supposed to be, is crucial.
<P>
There are about 5 million self-employed people in this country. Our friendly plumbers, electricians and mechanics, not to mention the odd lawyer, are self-employed. I do not know from where the Minister got the 300,000 figure but I suggest that it is inconceivable that only 300,000 self-employed people are without pension provision. If I understand the position correctly, my point is doubly relevant because the self-employed will not generally qualify for the state second pension scheme under the national insurance arrangements.
<P>
There is a question whether such self-employed people should then do anything. They would be mad to do so, if they are to get something for free under the new earnings-related state pension guarantee. It would be approximately equal to accumulating &#163;80,000 to &#163;100,000 if they entered a stakeholder scheme. The position of the self-employed in relation to stakeholders, compulsory participation and the incentive in the state second pension scheme, is crucial. As I said earlier, the self-employed form the biggest single area of pension under-provisioning.
<P>
There is a second area where I am unclear about what is intended. Subsection (2) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The first condition is that the scheme is established under a trust or in such other way as may be prescribed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I thought that on Tuesday the Minister made it clear that stakeholder pension schemes would be required to have trusts and trustees. Today, he seems to have changed that slightly back to the wording of the Bill, implying that in general they would, but they might not, and that there might be room for something else as well.
<P>
As I said earlier, that brings us straight back to the LISA, which is still unclear. It is not simply a row between the Treasury and the Department of Social Security. The DSS briefing makes it clear that the Department sees the LISA as merely a way of managing money through a managed pool of collective investment schemes, which could also be used for an occupational scheme, an additional voluntary contribution, a personal pension scheme and so forth. There is nothing new in that: any accumulations of pensions can be managed in a spread of collective investment schemes.
<P>
The proposals discussed for some time with the Treasury and led by the head of the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds envisaged something quite different and analagous to the United States 401K arrangements, which did away completely with the need for trustees by means of a simple tax wrapper&#151;a tax wrapper like a personal equity plan was and an individual savings account will be. The conditions attaching to that tax wrapper guaranteed safety and security: one could not invest in high-risk companies, one had to have a certain spread of investments, and so forth. I am still not clear whether the Government intend that a LISA in the 401K form will emerge in future&#151;if they do, it will be of great interest to many people, because it will save the hassle and accounting costs of a trustee scheme, which by its nature is more expensive&#151;or whether they intend the so-called LISA concept to be merely about how the money is managed.
<P>
That leads on to the third issue. I do not want to anticipate subsequent clauses, but will the stakeholder pension that employers offer their employees be purely a collective scheme with a trustee, with the money managed this, that or the other way and those participating paying a unitised accounting proportion? That is how transferability will occur, because the accounting defines their stake in the stakeholder pension as worth &#163;x. Alternatively, will it be possible, as many American companies do, to offer individuals their own pot of managed collective investment schemes, their own LISA, as the LISA was originally intended and as it operates in the United States? I am not clear what the options will be. It is disappointing that, after a week debating the subject, we still have not managed to tease out of the Government precisely where they are going in these crucial areas.
<P>
I support the amendment, which calls for the widest possible definition to permit not only a sensible and rational rethink but the emergence of the simpler and cheaper LISA, which will be more suitable for the self-employed and will enable those who want their own low-cost arrangement to have them.

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friends, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, have rightly made a great deal of LISAs and the lack of consultation. It is interesting that during our long debate on the clause, we have not enticed the Minister to say anything about those two subjects. However, I am open to correction on that point. He seems to be curiously unwilling to talk about the lack of public consultation or about LISAs. Perhaps we should have a sweepstake about whether he is prepared to talk about such embarrassing subjects. Does he think that he will turn into a pumpkin if he mentions them?
<P>
We should not finish our consideration of the Bill while the consultation process is still in progress. It is a pity that we have not heard more speeches from Labour Bank Benchers explaining their point of view. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) mentioned the film, ``Zulu''. I suspect that Labour Members have listened to all of these long speeches in Committee because their Whip says to them, ``You're here because you're here. Your job is simply to listen.''
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) has just entered the Room. He is very quiet, but he is obviously a man of infinite menace. He reminds me rather of a sergeant major in the British Army. He does not say a great deal, but when he does, one knows that he means it. That is presumably why we have heard so little from labour Back Benchers. Some Labour Committee Members are also members of the Select Committee on Social Security. They take an interest in social security, and it would be useful to hear from them occasionally. I hope that the Minister will break the habit of a lifetime and refer to the consultation period and to LISAs.
<P>
Standing Committee members get so many briefings nowadays. I get so many briefings about so many things, and most of them end up in the instant filing system next to my desk. Occasionally, however, one gets a good briefing. I received a briefing document from Fidelity Investments entitled, ```Owning' a Pension: The Key to Successful Second Tier Reform''. That company clearly knows much about pensions, and the briefing makes some good points. I shall put some of them to the Committee&#151;they sum up fairly well our debate on the clause&#151;in the hope that the Minister will respond to them.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gratham and Stamford saved up, as it were, the best wine in his argument for the later stages of this marriage feast that we have enjoyed for the past few weeks. His best point was that nowadays we live in a world in which people change their jobs rapidly and that their level of remuneration also changes rapidly&#151;mainly it moves upwards, but sometimes it moves downwards. A second pension was the best bet for people with an income of up to &#163;9,000. You then move into the stakeholder bracket for those with between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,000&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> No, I know that you do not, Mr. McWilliam&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. I was not going to intervene on the hon. Gentleman's use of the word ``you'' at this stage.
<P>
I would not have allowed a clause stand part debate if the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford had not tabled new clause 2. The clause has been debated extremely thoroughly. The rule on tedious repetition applies not only to an individual Member, but to a group of Members who use the same argument over and over again. If that continues, I shall apply the rule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I hope that I shall not indulge in tedious repetition&#151;I want to make some new points. However, I am rather alarmed that my remarks will be carried on the back of those of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford and that I cannot make my own points. However, I should not dream of taking issue with you, Mr. McWilliam&#151;you are in charge of the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sure that all Committee members accept that there must be competition between pension schemes. The Green Paper referred to the fact that employers who do not have an occupational pension scheme must provide access to at least one stakeholder pension. That suggests that there will be differences between the schemes.
<P>
A person who is in employment will receive a particular band of remuneration, and his employer will be required or encouraged to give him access to different schemes. For competition to mean anything, there must be real competition to allow choice for the employee. It is difficult to see how schemes can compete unless there are significant differences on administration costs and retirement benefits. However, the CAT standards on costs suggested in the Green Paper will effectively preclude actively managed pension schemes from being stakeholder pension schemes because active management costs more to deliver. That is an interesting point. How much competition will there be? How much latitude will the Government allow? How much more will different schemes to able to charge because they are more actively managed?
<P>
That is particularly interesting for me because during the previous Parliament the Select Committee studied pension provision in Chile, which was one of the first countries to develop the concept of encouraging or requiring the great mass of the population to take out stakeholder-type pension schemes. In Chile, the schemes are tightly regulated and employees are required to put around 10 per cent. of their salary into a pension scheme. That is similar to the proposal we are discussing. The system in Chile was one of the main inspirations for the stakeholder pension scheme here.
<P>
In Chile the schemes are so highly regulated by the Government that there is no difference in the performance of different schemes; they perform in exactly the same way. However, employees are allowed to move from scheme to scheme, but because they perform in the same way and the rate of return is the same, the only encouragement companies can fall back on to attract members is to provide inducements as simple as a pair of trainers, which may seem incredible in a sophisticated economy such as ours. The Chilean economy is one of the fastest growing in the world. It has introduced a scheme similar to the stakeholder pension scheme. There is enormous competition between insurance companies and deliverers to attract people to their schemes, but they cannot do what they should be able to do and what I want to happen here. They cannot go to the market place and say, ``Look, we have scheme A, which is actively managed. It may take a few more risks but it will provide a better rate of return.'' They cannot provide such inducements, so they try to bribe people. Will that happen with the stakeholder pension scheme?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Does he agree that actively managed schemes may be more defensive and more averse to risk? When markets are poised for a fall, an offensive scheme&#151;by definition, it would be actively managed&#151;would be more sensible than a tracker scheme. In that case, the assurance that the Minister gave this morning that in all circumstances stakeholder pensions will be a better deal for people who earn between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 a year than personal pensions could not apply. To have a better scheme that would save them from collapse of the market in such circumstances, they would have to be in a personal scheme. The Government's charging formula for stakeholder schemes excludes active management.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> We are coming to an interesting area, which has not been considered sufficiently by Parliament. If we cannot consider it further in this clause stand part debate, we should return to it on Report. Before I discuss the tracker point, I want to make a general point.
<P>
Mr. Pickles
<P>
: In October I had the honour to represent the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Chile, whose Government are making two changes that are relevant to our debate. They are extending the management of schemes by allowing greater investment abroad and they are restricting the number of times that people can move from scheme to scheme. I was impressed that many people were receiving an annual return of 14 per cent. on their pension fund capital. I am not sure that we could make the same boast about the stakeholder scheme here.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members are supposed to address the Chair, not their hon. Friends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend made a good point. His experience of Chile is more recent than mine, which goes back two or three years. Despite the rapid growth in the economy, which can give high rates of return, Chile has found it difficult to ensure that there are both safe investments and different performances within the restraints of a highly regulated market. I am not sure whether Chile has managed to square that circle. Perhaps the Minister is looking for a more relaxed scheme.
<P>
Why use the word stakeholder? It is becoming clear that the idea of a stakeholder&#151;billed as one of the most exciting components of the new Labour product&#151;is, in fact, a mouse. It is becoming a less exciting project. The scheme is called a stakeholder pension because the former Minister for Welfare Reform saw the concept as central to the new Labour project. We were to move from means testing to a stakeholder society in which everyone would be required to make considerable provision for old age, unemployment and sickness. People were to be brought out of the means-tested poverty and unemployment traps.
<P>
The Government had to call this a stakeholder pension because its conception harks back to those glory days in opposition when the Labour party was convinced that it could break the cycle of poverty and unemployment traps. But what we see&#151;it was apparent in the Budget this week&#151;is the Labour party moving closer to means-testing. The great canvass that was painted by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead is being whitewashed by the new regime in the Department of Social Security and by the Treasury. Our debates have achieved a great deal. There is nothing wrong with a stakeholder pension&#151;it is a justifiable response&#151;but it is not a very exciting concept after 18 years in opposition.
<P>
My final point deals with the tracker pension formula&#151;a technical but interesting concept. According to the briefing document, one option would be.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to establish a basic low-cost tracker pension formula against which other schemes can be judged. But scheme managers must have the freedom to offer `extra' services (such as actively managed pensions) at an extra cost.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also suggested
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that stakeholder pension costs should be a matter for competition between schemes''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consistent with the Government's long-term intentions for developing stakeholder pensions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To sum up, what does the Minister conceive the stakeholder pension to be? That may sound a simple question, but it is crucial. Is it just a low-cost tracker pension? Is it a safe investment? How much freedom will fund managers have to promote their policies in an aggressive manner? Freedom will increase competition, but will the Minister, as the guardian of people on relatively low incomes, assure us that their investments and pensions will not be put at risk?

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The great majority of questions were fully answered in earlier exchanges and I shall not return to them. However, a few interesting points were made and I shall try to be helpful.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford alleged that I was reluctant to say anything about what he and some others called LISAs. He told the Committee that he reads the speeches of Mr. Gladstone. I am sure that that is helpful and edifying, but if he paid more attention to what was happening in Commitee, he would notice that I dealt with LISAs last Thursday, which is reported in columns 41 and 42. I made it clear, but I am happy to do so again, that the new arrangements, which are increasingly referred to as pooled pension investments, and which are described in the consultation document issued jointly by my Department and the Treasury, can be used for stakeholder schemes as well as other pension schemes. They are a vehicle that can be used for pension investment and can certainly be used by stakeholder pensions and others. I am happy to put that on the record again. I attended a conference this morning at which I discussed them, and I am happy to do so again.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar asked about trustees. I thought that that subject had been thoroughly dealt with, but I shall make the points again. Trustees will benefit stakeholder pensions in a number of ways. They will deliver better value to scheme members by negotiating with financial service providers on their behalf&#151;a point that I made during the clause stand part debate. I refer the hon. Gentleman and other Opposition members to the Pension Provision Group report, which was published last week. I believe that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford was present at its launch. The Pension Provision Group consists of highly regarded people from the financial services industry, who commended the trustee basis on which the Government intend to run stakeholder pensions. That report, which the hon. Gentleman should study, may answer some of his questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister said that he referred to LISAs in columns 41 and 42. I have read them and he mentions LISAs twice in response to points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I see from my copy of Hansard that we started at 2.30 pm that afternoon, and that I responded virtually immediately&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Twice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Indeed. I picked up on points made about the pooled pensions investment vehicle and I am glad to have done so again.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs repeated his worry&#151;I am sorry that I did not deal with it to his satisfaction the first time&#151;about the self-employed. I quoted a figure of 300,000, which is the number of self-employed people earning between &#163;9,000 and &#163;20,000 a year who do not have a funded pension. They are the self-employed component within the wider group of 5 million. It was said that that is a narrow target, but 5 million people constitute an important group. It is precisely the group whose needs are not catered for under existing arrangements, which is why we are bringing forward this important measure.
<P>
I should also draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to pages 82 and 83 of the Green Paper, where paragraphs 20 and 21 make the point that we want to consult on the possibility of bringing self-employed people into the state second pension. Opposition Members point out rightly, that self-employed people are not in SERPS. Perhaps it is time to allow them into the state scheme through the state second pension. We are inviting views on that idea.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough made the newish point about whether we would allow active management schemes and funds in the stakeholder model. We shall have to wait and see on that, but we continue to consult with the industry about the correct level of charges. The Committee has discussed consultation exhaustively, so I shall not reopen that debate. We want to strike a balance between keeping costs down and enabling people to provide good service.
<P>
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Ryedale said, quite rightly, that the Government were correct in focusing on charges. Serious problems persist with charges associated with personal pensions. At their current level, charges can easily eat up a quarter of people's funds. That is not right, particularly given the need to help those on moderate incomes. At the conclusion of consultations, we shall put forward the charging model and limits that we consider to be right. The industry will then decide what it can offer within the standards that we have set.
<P>
This is a very important clause. The Opposition should not underestimate the significance of the measure, which extends the benefits of funded provision to 5 million people who are not covered by what is currently available. I am enthusiastic about that. I hope that the Committee is too, and that hon. Members will agree to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I rise because one or two points emerge from the Minister's comments. In relation to LISAs, he makes our point for us. If you can use a LISA to set up a stakeholder scheme, why do you need any more&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I intend to go to Hexham market tomorrow and find out the price of you's because we have had an awful lot of them this afternoon, and the price is clearly depressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> If one could use a LISA to set up a stakeholder pension scheme and that would qualify as a stakeholder pension, why does one need complicated structures and regulations? All one needs is a payroll deduction facility for the LISA. The same goes for the other products. The Minister should reflect on whether we need the extremely complex structure that he has put in place. The more we examine it, the more we see its shortcomings, handicaps and perversities in imposing costs.
<P>
The Minister mentioned something startling and opened up a whole new area that we should, perhaps, discuss at greater length: the proposed distortions in fund management. He said that he had not yet decided whether the Government would permit active management.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I thought that that was what the Minister said, picking up something said in the excellent speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough: that he did not yet know whether the cost structure to be imposed on stakeholder pensions would de facto permit actively managed schemes to be offered within that context. Perhaps he will intervene from a sedentary position to tell me if that is what he meant. We all make slips of the tongue. No one, certainly not I, will hold that against him.
<P>
If that is what he meant, it is still a serious matter because it involves yet one more distortion. In other words, if one wants active management, one must have a personal pension or a LISA, or a LISA outside the stakeholder framework. I suppose that, in the light of the Minister's answer, we should have not eight but nine different possibilities, including the LISA within the stakeholder system and the LISA outside the stakeholder system. On the whole, LISAs are actively managed funds. Of LISAs, unit trusts, investment trusts, and open-ended investment companies, the majority are actively managed. If the Minister says that they can be included within the stakeholder system, but not if they are actively managed, presumably, only a minority of them can be included within the stakeholder system. So the Minister has added at least one more choice to what is already a bewildering and irrationally fragmented system. The Minister has now raised the possibility of an initial distortion in pension fund management, which we have not discussed at length. We probably should have spent more time on some of these matters.
<P>
Unless my interpretation is right and Labour Members sitting behind the Minister agree with everything we say, but do not want to embarrass themselves in front of their Whips by standing up and saying so, there is a profound dereliction of duty on their part in remaining silent throughout proceedings on the essential clause in the Bill. Certainly, their behaviour is inconsistent with them being pleased with and proud of what the Government are doing. If they were pleased with this product, they would have jumped to their feet and proclaimed its virtues to the world in general and to their constituents in particular. They have stayed in embarrassed silence. Had we had a more normal debate&#151;had there been a more equal number of speeches from Labour and Opposition Back Benchers&#151;the Committee would have, rightly, taken longer and covered some of the matters raised elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall that only one speech in favour of the Bill was made from the Labour Back Benches on Second Reading?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Indeed. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding me of that significant point. It was striking to those of us who sat through that debate that Labour Members made several notable contributions, all of which were extremely critical of the provisions on pensions, of the so-called welfare reform or of the means-testing of benefits.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are dealing with clause 1, not with welfare reform. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not criticising either myself or my colleague on how the Committee is being chaired. I certainly have not noticed anything abnormal about the Committee, and I have chaired Committees since 1987.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> You misinterpret my remarks, Mr. McWilliam. I am not suggesting that you have been unobservant and that Labour Members had been trying to catch your eye, or that you have deliberately turned a blind eye in their direction. It is striking that Labour Back Benchers have not tried to catch your eye. You could hardly put them up to speak from your position as Chairman. Their silence speaks volumes. It is clear that Labour Back Benchers are not happy, pleased or proud of what is being done in their name.
<P>
The proposal is badly thought through. It is lumbered with unnecessary burdens. To use the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, it is a mouse. I fear that it is a half-dead mouse and that, therefore, there will be tremendous disappointment. In this, as in other matters, someone else will need to do the proper job that must be done to ensure that the possibility of providing for a pension is extended to everyone who can benefit either from doing so or from making a greater pension provision than he or she is making now. The Opposition remain committed to that, and it can best be done under new clause 2. I have the pleasure and honour of pressing the clause to a Division.

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Given what has just happened in Committee, would it be fair to say that the Liberal Democrat party is the ``Don't say; don't know; don't vote party''?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Registration of Stakeholder Pension Schemes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 33, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) The Authority shall, before the pensions scheme is registered under this section, have the power to make such investigations as are reasonable so as to establish whether the declaration under subsection 2 is true.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 12, in page 2, line 33, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) The Authority may whenever they wish, after the pension scheme is registered under this section, make such investigations as are reasonable so as to establish whether those conditions are currently fulfilled.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I caution hon. Members that the amendments are extremely narrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We have had an extensive debate on clause 1, and we also have some extremely important work to do on the rest of the clauses on stakeholder pensions, not to mention the rest of the Bill, which deals with different, but equally weighty matters. In the interests of making rapid progress, and because the essential issues are so important, I do not propose to spend too much time on matters which, although they may have some technical significance, are somewhat secondary. As long as the Government continue to give reasonable explanations of their amendments and new clauses, we shall focus on the essentials.
<P>
It is in that spirit that I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendments Nos. 11 and 12, but, for reasons that I shall explain, I shall seek to catch your eye, Mr. McWilliam, to propose amendments Nos. 13 and 14.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot withdraw both amendments, but he can choose not to press them if he so wishes.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 3, line 11, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 14, in page 3, line 17, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and such fees shall not be greater than the administrative cost of the relevant operation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Amendment No. 13 deals with inspection. It is peculiar that the clause says that the Secretary of State ``may'' make the register open for inspection. We believe that the register should be open for inspection and that there should be no conceivable doubt about it. If the Government do not want to include it in the Bill, the regulations should specify clearly that the register ``shall'' be open for inspection. It may seem to be a small drafting point, but it is an important principle that goes to the openness of Government&#151;a matter in which we in the Conservative party set great store&#151;and to the transparency of the proposed new pension system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This important provision deals with the arrangements under which members of the public and organisations can gain access to the register of stakeholder pension schemes. The register will keep a list of all such schemes. Amendment No.13 would require, rather than allow, the Secretary of State to make the relevant provision. The Government intend to use the powers provided by the subsection, but the convention in legislation is that the Secretary of State is permitted, rather than required, to do something. That is why the clause is phrased in that way.
<P>
However, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government will put the provisions in subsection (7) into effect. Perhaps I should point out that the wording replicates that in the Pensions Act 1993 on the register for occupational and personal pensions.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 14, although I am not sure whether it has been moved.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I explain? I have proposed amendment No. 13. If the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford wishes to press amendment No. 14 to a vote, I shall ask him to put it formally and then I shall put it to the Committee. The amendments are grouped together because they are on the same subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. In the interests of clarity, it was my intention to speak separately to amendment No. 14 and to attempt to catch your eye in a moment. If the Minister is good enough in his response on amendment No. 13, I may have good news for him before I proceed to amendment No. 14.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I was simply about to say that the Government intend not to submit charges for access beyond those envisaged in the amendment. We do not intend using the fee levying power as a means of making a profit or of raising revenue. It is in the Bill to ensure that the registering authority can easily recover the costs of providing copies of the register.
<P>
On this occasion, I can endorse the spirit of both amendments. In the light of those assurances, and considering the technical difficulties that might arise with amendment No. 14, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's comments. His word is as good as his bond, so his statement is as good as adding our amendments to the Bill.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister can show me examples of legislation saying ``may'' but meaning ``shall''&#151;he has already alluded to an Act passed by the previous Conservative Government. Why does he not take advantage of the fact that he is now in government by instructing parliamentary draftsmen to use words in their normal English usage wherever possible? That would be a positive step. If the real intention is ``shall'', for heaven's sake, legislation should say ``shall'' not ``may''. It is a small point, but it is one of general significance in terms of the way we work in Committees.
<P>
We are entirely satisfied by the assurances that we have received, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not think that we should pass too rapidly over the clause. I need to ask a question of elucidation and to focus on one or two points before we leave the subject of registration and the role of the occupational pensions regulatory authority.
<P>
I am always slightly concerned when this Government, with their large majority and formidable media-management machine, simply pass over whole clauses without any explanation. Perhaps they hope that the Opposition will not be awake and that no questions will be asked. It is not a positive impression to give to Parliament or to those sections of the public who follow our proceedings.
<P>
My first question is genuine and is not a footling question at all. I had to read the clause and refer to clause 1 a couple of times to try to understand what it means. I still have not understood, so I ask the Minister to explain it to me. Subsection (2)(b)(ii) mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other conditions as may be prescribed under subsection (1) of that section''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not understand that odd repetition. I did not want to table a technical drafting amendment because the point seems to be fully provided for in clause 1(1)(b), which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other conditions as may be prescribed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that has some special meaning and is not gratuitous and otiose&#151;if OPRA can add conditions unforeseen in clause 1 that schemes must meet to qualify for registration&#151;it is sinister and wrong. We have read and debated clause 1 on the basis that those are the conditions. If OPRA can add other conditions, we should at least know about it.
<P>
We must debate the general point, although not at enormous length unless we find once again that, on our starting to probe, a hole opens up in the Government's arguments. We must think carefully about the issue of regulation. We all agree that there should be proper regulation in financial services. Regulation may be even more important in pensions than in other financial instruments sold to the public, as pensions represent savings that are illiquid&#151;they are put away for a long time, and people cannot get at them except on terms and conditions laid down in Inland Revenue regulations. Apart from owner-occupied houses, pensions represent, on average, the largest household assets in this country. It is important that we get the regulatory framework right, and I am sure that the Minister agrees with that.
<P>
One of the aspects of the market's fragmentation that concerns us, and that we have already debated on clause 1, is the regulatory differences. If OPRA, which is responsible for occupational pension schemes, is now being made responsible for stakeholder schemes, and the Financial Services Authority, which will be responsible for marketing personal pensions and, apparently, for LISAs. There is no suggestion that OPRA should be responsible for LISAs. The Minister may say that I am wrong, in which case we shall be clear.
<P>
The fragmentation of regulation will cause expensive overlaps, which will involve two sets of inspectors going round, talking to the same people and asking for the same books; or, worse, it will cause the opposite&#151;an underlap&#151;a failure to cover the whole field. The Minister and I served on the Treasury Select Committee in the previous Parliament and we came across a number of aspects of underlap in banking regulation involving, for example, the Baring crisis, in which it was clear that some operations were not being supervised by any regulatory authority. That is only an analogy, Mr. McWilliam, and I shall not dwell on it, but it is a pertinent analogy. We do not want that kind of underlap to develop here, as the Minister will agree.
<P>
We are not minded to oppose the clause in principle, but, so that there is no doubt in our minds, will the Minister give us a clear account of the regulatory framework? What is OPRA's role in relation to types of pension? What is the FSA's role in relation to types of pension? Which other regulatory authorities will be involved&#151;his own Department, the Treasury or which? Who is responsible for marketing? Who is responsible for making sure that there is good practice in the management of the pensions, no malversation of funds and no breach of the terms on which the moneys are taken on?
<P>
As the subject becomes increasingly complicated, with people offering stakeholder pensions, personal pensions, LISAs and all the rest of it, it becomes increasingly important that we have absolute clarity. This is the Minister's opportunity to satisfy not merely the Opposition, but the public and the industry that there is clarity and coherence. As I understand the position, there is no coherence, but at least there must be clarity about the lack of coherence and the position.
<P>
Will the Minister set out clearly and definitively the regulatory regime and the rationale for the allocation of roles to the FSA and, in particular, to OPRA? If we have a satisfactory answer, we shall not pursue the matter further. If we do not, we shall have to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the Minister, may I reassure the hon. Gentleman? Hon. Members should not pay attention to my body language. This is the most notoriously uncomfortable chair in all the Committee Rooms in the House of Commons. If I am wriggling and reeling around a bit, nobody should imagine that it means anything other than that my back is sore.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think that I can provide the clarity that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford seeks. Let me first explain that the Occupational Pensions Regulation Authority will have a role here because it has experience and expertise in the regulation of occupational schemes, which are trust based, as we have established. The starting point for stakeholder pensions will also be in trust regulation. Therefore, OPRA seems the appropriate body among those that exist to regulate what stakeholder pensions' trustees do as well.
<P>
I reassure the hon. Gentleman that we do not intend OPRA to promulgate conditions. Its role will be to keep the register and, if necessary, to investigate alleged breaches of the conditions set out in clause 1. It will not be able to introduce new conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In that case, why is the position not fully satisifed by subsection (2)(b)(i), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the conditions set out in subsections (2) to (9) of section 1''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, OPRA will simply satisfy the conditions in clause 1. Why is the reference needed in subsection (2)(b)(ii) to ``such other conditions'' and what could those other conditions be? Is the paragraph redundant? If so, may we get rid of it? If not, may we have an explanation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clause 1 also refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other conditions as may be prescribed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Additional conditions may be introduced, but not by OPRA. The way in which that has been done is correct&#151;it is dealt with under clause 1(1)(b). By seeking registration with OPRA, trustees will be declaring that the scheme meets the minimum standards and a number of other conditions relating to tax compliance. OPRA will register schemes on the basis of that declaration, and where it has grounds for believing that the conditions are not met it will be able to refuse registration. If such a scheme is an existing registered scheme, OPRA will be able to de-register it.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
OPRA will have powers to investigate and, where appropriate, sanction schemes. The powers that it will apply to stakeholder schemes will be broadly similar to its existing powers in respect of occupational pensions. The marketing and promotion aspects, which, by their nature, will be different for stakeholder schemes than for occupational schemes, will be regulated by the FSA. That split has been accepted in the industry&#151;a clear divide exists between the two roles&#151;and therefore should not cause any problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The proliferation of regulators is not, in principle, a good idea. Some strange anomalies exist: the Government are trying to address one of them in clause 8, if I understand it correctly. If so, the Government share some of my concerns. At present, different sanctions apply to failure to pay moneys into pension funds according to the requisite time scale. In the case of occupational pension schemes, employers who fail to pay in money will be descended on by OPRA and criminal sanctions will be imposed. That is not the case with personal pensions. The insurance company or life office running the pension must report to the beneficiary within six weeks that the sum expected from the employer under a group personal pension scheme has not been paid in.
<P>
Will the Minister acknowledge that such a split of responsibilities is inherently undesirable? Would it not be much better if the same regulatory regime were imposed on all pensions? There is no reason to have a specially onerous regime for trusts. Opposition Members are not against trusts; we are simply against imposing them on stakeholder pensions. There is no need for OPRA to apply a heavier and more instrusive form of regulation, which would have more penalties, to trusts.
<P>
Equally, sensible minimal regulation should apply to all other products. Individuals should not have to worry about differing regulation which is another aspect of the error of fragmentation. The ordinary citizen should be able to invest in any approved scheme&#151;whether it is a personal pension, occupational scheme, group personal pension, LISA or stakeholder scheme&#151;with confidence that equivalent rules and sanctions apply for abuse or failure. That is elementary. Under such a system, different schemes have equivalent regulation costs. Differential costs, which falsify the market, create competitive handicaps for certain players and are undesirable for other reasons that have been discussed, would not be applied.
<P>
Although Conservative Members will not oppose the clause in principle, we think that more could be done to introduce coherence in regulation.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Duty of employers to facilitate access to stakeholder pension schemes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 3, line 19, after second `of', insert `10 or more'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 32, in page 4, line 7, leave out from `below' to `or' in line 8 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `&#163;9,000 per year, this limit to be raised annually in line with average earnings.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Both the amendments are important. I must not say that they are very different because, in your wisdom, Mr. McWilliam, you grouped them together. I shall discuss them separately, although I recognise that if they are voted on, they will be voted on jointly. I shall concentrate on amendment No. 30 and seek to catch your eye later in our proceedings to discuss amendment No. 32.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Although the amendments are different, the arguments about them are basically the same, which is why they were grouped together. The hon. Gentleman is seeking at the outset to have two bites at the same cherry. I have already shown a yellow card to Committee members for tedious repetition. The amendments are narrow, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will discuss both of them in one speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I trust that my speech will stick closely to the amendment and to the part of the Bill that it would amend. If the amendment is agreed to, line 19 on page 3 of the Bill would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an employer of 10 or more relevant employees''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We touched&#151;tangentially&#151;on some of the relevant issues in our debate on clause 1. Clause 3 is at the heart of the viability of the stakeholder concept&#151;it deals with the extent to which the scheme will work in practice and how much it will cost the employee and the employer. I shall deal with those considerations in turn.
<P>
The stakeholder proposal in new clause 2 involves a simple arrangement that would help employees to make contributions to their pension scheme through a payroll deduction facility. It therefore involves one more payroll deduction facility. That is a nuisance for employers, who already have to deduct income tax, class 1 employee contributions for national insurance and class 1 employer contributions. They have many other burdens&#151;too many&#151;which is a sad reflection on the present state of the world. They have to deduct Child Support Agency payments under an earnings attachment order, and the courts may have imposed other earnings attachment orders. The new Labour Government have also imposed the duty of payroll deduction in relation to the working families tax credit, and the necessary calculations are onerous. Employers already suffer. It was with some reluctance that we suggested the imposition of another payroll deduction facility.
<P>
Under our proposal, an employer would only have to set up a payroll deduction facility, but the Government's proposal will require the employer to designate a scheme&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the hon. Gentleman's comments but the amendment only involves the difference between up to nine, and 10 or more. Amendment No. 32 involves the difference between a definition that is contained in the 1993 Act and an annual income of &#163;9,000. The hon. Gentleman's comments had nothing to do with those matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It may help you, Mr. McWilliam, and the Committee if I explain my thesis briefly. I shall then argue my thesis, but I shall give the conclusion before the argument.
<P>
My thesis is that the burden of any stakeholder pension, including our own, is significant, that the burden of the Government's version of a stakeholder pension is considerable and&#151;for reasons that we have already explained&#151;probably excessive and unnecessary. It can only realistically be borne by larger or medium-sized employers, and it is utterly absurd&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Oaten </B>(Winchester): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In a moment.
<P>
It would be utterly absurd to impose that burden on employers of one or two people. Hence the distinction that we have made between small employers, defined as those who employ fewer than 10 employees, and medium and large employers, defined as those who employ more than 10.
<P>
I am delighted to give way to a Liberal Democrat Member. I was not even aware that the Liberal Democrat party was here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> I am doubly grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I want to probe him on why his amendment suggests a level of 10. Can he tell us how many companies would be excluded by the amendment? My understanding is that about 80 per cent. of companies employ 10 people or fewer, so the amendment would exclude the majority of the work force.
<P>
Mr. Davies
<P>
: I am aware of that. On the other hand, there is no point&#151;this is the argument that I intended to make anyhow&#151;in producing something that is sold as an advantage for employees if it becomes a disadvantage for employees and potential employees because it deters employers from employing people.
<P>
The regulatory burden on business gets greater the whole time. Last Friday, I had a meeting with a number of business men in my constituency and the most common complaint was about the regulatory burden that they face, which is growing at an accelerated and alarming rate under this Government. In addition, employers face the burdens imposed by the minimum wage, the working time directive, the parental leave directive, the corner-shop tax and all the rest of it.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand all the points that the hon. Gentleman is making, but he is making a clause stand part speech instead of speaking specifically to the two amendments. If he saves this speech for clause stand part, that will be fine, but if he continues through the clause debating each amendment as if it were a clause stand part debate, he will not have an opportunity to make a clause stand part speech, because I shall not allow him to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. McWilliam. The reason why I am speaking to the amendment instead of simply opposing the clause on stand part is that I believe that the Bill should make a distinction between small employers and larger ones. I do not intend to kill the stakeholder concept. Although it is a burden, I accept it where it is imposed on employers who already have a significant number of employees.
<P>
I have taken the figure of 10 because that is the point at which most businesses decide that they need a personnel system&#151;if not a full-time personnel manager, at least somebody with part-time responsibilities systematically covering personnel matters. A small business that takes on three or four people to do the jobs that are necessary to keep the business afloat has neither the time nor the resources to set up separate systems to manage stakeholder pensions, which would place an unreasonable burden on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The first point that the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) made in his intervention was on the figure of 10. My hon. Friend is making similar points to ones that I raised on the Tax Credits Bill, where similar problems arose with regard to the break-up of smaller businesses. Once the Bill had passed its Committee stage, it emerged through the press that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry were very unhappy about the burdens on small firms. It would be sensible if the Minister used the half-hour break to have a word with his right hon. Friends and came back with a statement from them to the effect that they are entirely satisfied with this provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. It sounds like another example of schizophrenia in the new Labour Government. We went over that with LISAs versus stakeholder pensions, and there may be many other examples of that kind.
<P>
The point that I was making directly in response to your guidance, Mr. McWilliam, goes to the heart of the matter. We do employees no favours if we put such burdens on employers that they are not willing to hire in the first place. That is a damaging aspect of imposing on employers the stakeholder regime, particularly the Government's stakeholder regime, which, sadly, has now been accepted under clause 1.
<P>
What concerns me most is the position of somebody who may not employ anybody: he is self-employed, his business is going well, and for the first time, he thinks of taking on one or two people. Most employers would not take on more than one or two people&#151;certainly, no more than 10&#151;when they start to hire employees. However, they will begin to encounter problems when they gradually build up the number of their employees. They have the considerable regulatory burden of accounting for national insurance and tax. Most people&#151;myself included&#151;find it difficult to fill in a tax form. It is a nightmare for small businesses to have to cope with other people's tax. They will probably have to do it in the evening when the customers have gone home or over the weekend because they cannot afford separate accountants. Employers of more than 10 people have full-time accountants, so the problem is not as bad.
<P>
Other regulatory matters, including working time directives and parental leave, also have to be taken into account. The Government want to impose the burden of setting up and designating a stakeholder scheme on the self-employed man or woman who is taking on, or considering taking on, his or her first employee, which will involve a great deal of work and responsibility. The product might not fly&#151;perhaps no one will be interested in the stakeholder scheme&#151;in which case it will be difficult for the employer to meet his or her commitments. He or she would have invested a great deal of expense and time that would have been better spent running the business.
<P>
However, large financial service companies, such as life offices, will be delighted to establish and manage stakeholder facilities for big employers with 1,000-2,000 employees. Those companies will say to them, ``We will take over the whole thing. You can designate our scheme and we will run it for you. The systems are in place&#151;there's no problem. We'll charge you so much per annum.'' I expect that that will happen, but who will be interested in setting up a scheme for a small business?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I said that I would suspend the sitting at 5 pm until 5.30 pm.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Before we broke for tea, I was explaining the responsibility that employers will have under the clause. That responsibility will be especially great for small employers. We suggest that the clause should contain the cut-off point of those employing fewer than nine people. Subsection (2) clearly states that the employer will have responsibility to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``designate one or more stakeholder pension schemes''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know whether the Government understand what the use of the word ``designate'' will mean. The employer will have to take the time and trouble to select an appropriate stakeholder pension scheme and incur the expense of doing so. That burden will be proportionately greater for small employers than for larger employers for the simple reason that larger employers will be attractive to the life offices or whoever else might try to market their services and supply a stakeholder pension facility to employers. Clearly, those who employ thousands of people will be very attractive.
<P>
Fixed costs represent a substantial proportion of the total costs in any such operation. If 2,000 or 3,000 people can be taken on to the books, a fairly good service can be offered at a reasonably cheap unit cost. However, small employers are a different matter altogether&#151;the financial services industry will not seek them out. The smaller the number of employees, the less the employer will be targeted. It will be more important for those employers to take the initiative in soliciting offers and finding them, but they might find that difficult for the reasons that we have given.
<P>
We made it clear that many burdens and costs are involved and that it might be extremely difficult for employers to satisfy their legal obligations under the Bill. Considerable cost and time will be involved. Clearly, no one in the new Labour Government has ever run a small business, otherwise the Government would not dream of including such a provision.
<P>
Instead of focusing on their products and improving them, on solving production problems, on their customers and so forth, employers will have to spend time on the completely extraneous task of evaluating pension schemes. That will be an absolute nightmare. If people take on a single employee, they will be told that they must designate a pension scheme. That will be a major factor that weighs negatively in the balance when someone decides whether to take on employees. Anything that increases the cost of labour reduces the demand for it, so reducing employment. Jobs could be put at risk. We all know that economic decisions are taken at the margin. Such issues are important when considered at the margin and given the interests of small businesses.
<P>
Costs will be involved because people will have to take outside professional advice. Small businesses are rightly reluctant to pay other people to provide services, especially if those services are not related to developing sales or improving productivity. Small businesses are cautious and concerned about the cost of the tax advisers and accountants that they often need. Small businesses frequently complain about bank charges and are conscious of outgoings that may be small, but which are significant to them, as they are trying to build up their businesses. How much more will they resent, and how much more will it be a disincentive to take on employees in the first place if they have to pay lawyers, accountants or actuaries to advise them on what is an appropriate stakeholder scheme to ``designate''&#151;to use the Government's word?
<P>
That brings me to my third point and the most onerous burden of all&#151;the burden of liability. If an employer designates a scheme, unless an explicit clause in the legislation actively protects him from such liability, he could be open to an accusation that the scheme is inappropriate for his employees&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman seems to have lost the interest of all his colleagues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am sure that that is because my colleagues have such confidence in my handling of the proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was not questioning the confidence of the hon. Gentleman's colleagues. I was questioning the fact that the level of conversation was high enough for it to interfere with my listening intently to the hon. Gentleman's speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I was about to say that my colleagues are sufficiently confident in my competence that they need not monitor it to see whether I am going wrong. Now, you have induced complete silence, so I shall have to be extremely careful in what I say, in case I make an error or slip of the tongue. I shall endeavour not to do so.
<P>
The liability aspect is the worst. It is a nightmare for small businesses to incur such liability. Some people have product liability concerns or environmental or third-party liability concerns that are inherent in their businesses. Having to designate a stakeholder scheme puts on employers an extraneous responsibility that is not related to their business or the operational risks involved in it. People in the business of producing food products or widgets, or running a laundry or a restaurant are not in the business of advising on pension schemes, let along taking decisions on behalf of other people about an appropriate pension scheme to designate. It is absurd that an employer could then be sued or held to account for designating a scheme that failed to perform as anticipated, or if there was some sort of fraud or abuse.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We envisage that an employer will discharge his responsibility by giving access to any scheme that appeared on the OPRA register that we mentioned a moment ago. It is not an onerous requirement. As long as the scheme is on the register, which is publicly available, the obligation will have been discharged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am not satisfied by that assurance because the text of the Bill states that the employer shall ``designate''. A provision that expressly relieves employers from that liability should be included in the Bill. I hope that the Minister is favourably disposed to doing that. If we do not have time to table it as an amendment to be discussed at the appropriate place in the Bill, perhaps it could be tabled on Report. I think that the sense of the Minister's intervention was that he shares my view. If so, it would be absurd, unfair and extremely damaging to the success of the stakeholder project if employers were liable, or could have such liability. There cannot be legal doubt about it so that lawyers, when asked, say, ``Well, we can't give you an absolute assurance. We must wait for the jurisprudence, see what happens if a case emerges, how a court interprets `designate', and whether an employer will be considered to have had a fiduciary responsibility on behalf of his employees in making that designation.''
<P>
I read ``designate'' as involving a specific decision made by an employer on behalf of a third party. Inevitably and necessarily in such circumstances, that would involve a potential liability if that decision proved to be inappropriate for those on whose behalf it was made. The phrase is extremely dangerous, and I hope that the Minister, who has obviously taken the point on board, will suggest how the matter can be resolved.
<P>
One suggestion&#151;a serious one&#151;is for the Minister to accept amendment No. 31, which proposes that employees could designate their own schemes. If they did so, and if they could simply take advantage of a payroll deduction facility, the employer would not be responsible. That would remove a major source of concern that would devastatingly inhibit employers' involvement in the matter.
<P>
The Minister is obviously thinking. Let us hope that, by the time that he responds to my remarks, he can make a suggestion. I am sure that we both agree that my fear must be avoided at all costs if stakeholder pensions are to succeed. If he cannot accept my amendment, I hope that we can agree a text to be proposed on Report. I cannot be more open-minded or helpful than that. I will end my comments on the amendment there. I shall try to catch your eye later, Mr. McWilliam, so that I can deal with amendment No. 32, which is important.
<P>
I re-emphasise the fact that there must be a reasonable sense of the burdens that an employer can expect to undertake in order to establish a stakeholder scheme. If there is not such a degree of reason and moderation on the burdens imposed, there will be undue expense for all businesses, and that may be intolerable expense for small businesses. People will be deterred from employing others in the first place. I hope that the Government will accept that that would be a disastrous backfiring of the scheme, and that we must try to avoid it.
<P>
The only way to reconcile the desirability of guaranteeing a payroll deduction facility and a stakeholder pension for a greater range of employees, with the need to guarantee no intolerable and potentially damaging burdens on businesses is to distinguish between the regimes that will apply to small businesses and to large businesses.
<P>
It would be infinitely reasonable if the Minister were minded to accept our amendment. I will not set out its benefits now, except to say that one of them is that employers would avoid a potentially crippling responsibility and liability. A way must be found to resolve the problem, and it needs to be put on the face of the Bill. The ambiguity that exists&#151;and there is a danger of such a liability crystallising&#151;could set at nought all the Government's best intentions for the stakeholder pensions, in so far as they have such intentions at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> I do not intend to hold proceedings up any longer, but the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford has made some important points. All Committee members would be extremely worried if the proposal were to increase the burden on small businesses. All hon. Members who meet with small businessmen in their constituencies are moved by their worries about additional red tape and other burdens. However, Liberal Democrats would give the amendment a more sympathetic hearing if it specified a figure of two or three relevant employees. My worry, which I tried to convey to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford during a brief intervention, is the figure of 10 employees that the amendment specifies. During the suspension of the Committee, while other hon. Members were having a coffee or a tea, I went to the Library to try to discover some relevant figures. That may make me something of a swot&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should be commended for his efforts.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> I fear that hon. Members are right: I was being a bit of a swot. Nevertheless, the figures are interesting&#151;85 per cent. of businesses employ 10 employees or fewer. That represents 3.5 million companies and 6.4 million workers. The amendment would therefore wreck some of the Government's proposed initiatives. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford has not explained who, other than employers, would provide information and advice for those 6.4 million workers. I do not want to encourage too many speeches from him, but perhaps he will answer that point.
<P>
The amendment makes a serious point about the burden on small businesses, which is why I have some sympathy with a threshold of two or three employees. As a former managing director of a company with about 10 employees, I always tried to ensure that I kept up to speed on personnel issues. I would have regarded it as good practice for businesses that employ such numbers to adopt the measures that the Government are suggesting and it is bad practice to suggest that those businesses are too busy to adopt such measures. They do not constitute an unnecessary burden. However, there may be a case for limiting the need to comply with the requirements to businesses that start up with two or more employees. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
I should like to probe the Minister on the back-up, training and advice that will be given to small businesses. Some of their fears could be allayed by making it clear that great demands will not be placed on their time. However, that can be done only through the provision of high quality, simple advice that will allow them to fulfil their duties appropriately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I have two interests to declare. My father owns and runs a small business that employs three people and my wife works on a part-time basis for another small business that employs about eight or nine people and which probably falls within the scope of the clause. You may wish to restrain me, Mr. McWilliam, if you find me straying into clause stand part territory, but I should say that it is not my intention to do so. I shall be brief and my remarks, even if they do stray somewhat, will apply principally to small businesses.
<P>
The Bill will impose yet another burden on small businesses. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford and the hon. Member for Winchester reminded us that small business men in particular are becoming increasingly desperate about the sea of red tape with which they have to cope. Conservatives must share the blame for the yearly increase in red tape, but the Bill will add to that burden. I recognise the faces of some Labour Members of the Committee who, a few weeks ago, participated in Committee proceedings on another Bill, that will impose an even larger burden.
<P>
I do not know where the threshold should be set. I have some sympathy for the view of the hon. Member for Winchester, who made a strong case for a threshold of two or three employees. However, that debate within a debate is complicated by the lack of a proper definition. Subsection (7)(c) defines ``a relevant employee'' as an employee other than those in pension schemes on very low incomes and those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who are of such other description as may be prescribed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What about the most obvious category of all, other than those in occupational pension schemes: those who make their own pension arrangements? That is so unclearly defined that it is difficult to make sense of where the line should be drawn. A sensible line should be drawn somewhere because it would be absurd for the weight of this legislation to fall on an employer with a few employees, all of whom may have made their own pension or equivalent savings provision.
<P>
I cannot support too strongly the point on accountability made by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford. It would be monstrous if a busy proprietor of a small business were pursued through the courts because he found an off-the-peg pension fund&#151;the Minister seems to think that he might do that from the Yellow Pages&#151;which went wrong because it had not been properly filtered by the authorities.
<P>
I want to take the point a little further, because the problem is not just of legal accountability. The clause imposes on businesses, especially very small businesses, legal responsibility. I cannot imagine any circumstances in which my father or my wife's boss, whom I know very well because he is a near-neighbour, would not feel absolutely bound to ensure, whether or not there was a legal requirement to do so, that any scheme in which any of their employees were likely to become involved was a good scheme. Neither is financially qualified and I can imagine them becoming involved in a lot of heartache and work, perhaps for the benefit of one employee who could obtain better advice in the private sector.
<P>
I do not know whether the number should be 10, five or whatever. I am certain that we should tighten the definition of ``relevent employees'' or at least have an assurance from the Minister that people who have already made their own provision will be excluded. Very small businesses should not be burdened in this way.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> You have grouped amendments Nos. 30 and 32 together, Mr. McWilliam, and amendment No. 32 caught my eye. I went to have a cup of tea instead of going to the Library during the suspension so my comments will be a series of questions, which I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford or the Minister will be able to answer.
<P>
Amendment No. 32 refers to an income of &#163;9,000 and, having had the sort of education that allows me to be able to divide, I can divide that by the amount of the national minimum wage of &#163;3.60. Someone earning &#163;9,000 per year would be working approximately 27 hours a week. That is part-time work. What are the arrangements for people who work part-time for a number of employers? Who would be responsible for their pension provision? Would they have a series of stakeholder pensions, or one stakeholder pension? How would they be provided for?
<P>
As the work force becomes more complex and flexible, more people work part-time and the Government are ensuring in other legislation that part-time workers have access to the same rights as full-time workers. It is a practical question. How will people who work part-time be able to provide for themselves through the stakeholder pension system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I have only one question. The hon. Member for Winchester made a helpful intervention in which he said that if we exclude people who employ fewer than 10 people, we shall exclude a large number of companies. I understand that point, although one can reply to it by saying that they should not be an excuse for imposing extra burdens on employers. Where does the process end?
<P>
That is the sweet shop question. If one runs a very small business with a relatively low turnover&#151;for example, a village shop in a rural constituency such as mine&#151;employing perhaps one person, it is unlikely that the employee will earn more than &#163;9,000 a year. One can imagine a farmer who employs an agricultural labourer, or other small businesses in rural areas with relatively low turnovers that employ few workers. Does the Minister envisage there being any cut-off point, or will all employers, however small, even those with one employee, be affectedby the extra burdens on their businesses necessitated by the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I want to ask a simple question following the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) about relevant employees. Relevant employees are defined in the guidance notes as,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all employees who are not eligible to join that employer's occupational pension scheme and who earn more than the lower earnings limit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One class of people who might come within that definition is those whose occupational pension schemes have a two-year waiting limit. Will people who have to wait two years to join a scheme be entitled to join a stakeholder pension scheme, and will their contributions to the scheme be transferable to the occupational scheme? In addition, would it make any difference to such people if the effect was backdated? I think that that will interest the Committee when considering the burden that will be imposed on a small employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It has been an interesting discussion. There seems to be some confusion in the position taken by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. Only a few moments ago, he was extolling the benefits of new clause 2 and the alternative Conservative idea of the stakeholder pension scheme, which is simply that employers should have a payroll deduction facility. There, we see the beginnings of clarity in Conservative party policy. Yet, just a few minutes later, the hon. Gentleman is undermining that by suggesting that a large number&#151;as the hon. Member for Winchester rightly said, 84 per cent.&#151;of employers should be exempt from that requirement. He has already touched on amendment No. 31, which, no doubt, he will introduce shortly. In a moment, he will turn the other way again, and advocate that the requirement on employers should be more onerous. No sooner does it begin to appear as if we have a hint of clear policy from the hon. Gentleman than he immediately starts to demolish it.
<P>
It is intriguing that the hon. Member for Winchester argues with the same vigour, passion and enthusiasm for both positions, even though they point in oppposite directions. He suggested that hon. Members who support the Bill obviously do not know anything about running a small business. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security has experience of running a small business of&#151;in his case&#151;up to six employees. He decided that his business should provide a pension scheme for employees. Labour Members and Liberal Democrat Members have experience of this matter. They recognised that businesses regard pensions schemes as a serious matter and are prepared to take on the responsibility.
<P>
The requirement is not onerous. First, the employer should provide information about a stakeholder pension scheme for the relevant employees. Secondly, the employer should offer a payroll deduction scheme. Employers who offer an occupational scheme to all their employees will not be affected. Employers who offer a pension scheme only to some employees will be afffected, which relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar. Other employers would be exempted from such requirements in relation to employees who can join an occupational scheme or those whose earnings fall below the national insurance lower earnings limit. That relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Beckenham.
<P>
For people who earn thousands of pounds a year through two or more part-time jobs&#151;and who earn less than the earnings limit in each job but more in sum&#151;it is conceivable that neither or none of their employers would be required to provide access to a stakeholder scheme under this clause. I accept that point, but it is right that the lower earnings limit should apply.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I thought&#151;it is a slightly hazy recollection&#151;that, in principle, the Government wished to make the same rights available to part-time employees as to full-time employees, and that pension rights were included. Perhaps that will be in a different Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Those who do not pay national insurance because they are below the lower earnings limit in each of their employments will be treated in a different way, in a number of respects, from those who are above that limit. This is one example of that.
<P>
I entirely accept the strength of the points made by Opposition Members about the need to minimise the impact on business. In the consultation, we have invited views on whether the access requirement should be voluntary for particular groups of employers. In those terms, I accept the force of the points made about very small employers. The Bill would allow exceptions to the access requirement to be prescribed if experience or the consultation shows that that is justified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I find the Minister's comments reassuring. Will the farmer in my constituency who employs one agricultural labourer be able to get an exemption?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The case for an organisation employing one person is much stronger than that for an organisation employing nine people. The question of where the barrier should fall will be resolved by the consultation. A figure of 10 is much too high, and the amendment is too inflexible on that point. As the hon. Member for Winchester rightly pointed out, 84 per cent. of employers would be exempted, which would affect a very large number of employees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I do not think the Minister addressed my point about whether the definition of ``relevant employees'' would be modified so that those who have made their own pension provision would be exempted. If all the employees of a small business have their own pension provision, it would be a strange idea to force that business to fulfil the obligations under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> If there is existing occupational provision for those people, they would be exempted. If they happened to have a number of personal schemes, no, we would want them to have the opportunity to join a stakeholder pension scheme. They may not take it up, but they should have the opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I appreciate that the Minister is trying to be helpful, but he has not answered my final point. For his personal pension, the employee will no doubt have obtained good financial advice, but that puts the employer, not being a financial expert himself, in the invidious position of having to advise an employee to choose something that he has selected without the expertise to do so, against the person's own financial expertise. It effectively puts the employer in the position of being a second-hand financial adviser, which many small business men would not want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, that is not the case. All that is required of employers is to give access to one of the schemes in the OPRA register of stakeholder schemes. That does not mean that the employer recommends that scheme; it simply allows deductions from the employee's pay to be paid into the scheme, if that is what the employee wants.
<P>
If people have an existing personal pension which they are happy with, in many cases&#151;perhaps most cases&#151;they will want to stay with it. We simply want them to have an opportunity to join a stakeholder scheme. For many people in the income bracket that we have talked about it will prove to be in their interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister replied to one of my three questions, but two small but important matters remain. First, if, subject to the two-year waiting list, people become stakeholders, will the benefits that they have accrued be transferable to an occupational pension scheme? Secondly, if the sum can be back-dated, as it can be in a number of occupations, will people still be eligible to join via a stakeholder scheme?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> On the first point the answer is yes. It will be possible for people to transfer what is in a stakeholder scheme to an occupational one.
<P>
I have to confess that the hon. Gentleman has lost me with his second point, but if he will come back to it, I shall be happy to try to respond in a moment.
<P>
You asked the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to deal with amendment No. 32, Mr. McWilliam. I do not think that he did so, but perhaps I should address it briefly. The amendment would also restrict the availability of stakeholder pension schemes.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I thought that your guidance was that it was perfectly in order for me to speak to my amendments separately. I said at the beginning of our debate that I would wish to catch your eye to present the arguments in favour of amendment No. 32 separately.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that my guidance was that the hon. Gentleman should argue both cases while he was on his feet, but that does not preclude him from being called later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is what I thought you had advised, Mr. McWilliam. I shall briefly touch on amendment No. 32.
<P>
Although those earning less than &#163;9,000 a year are likely to be better off in the state second pension than contracted out into a stakeholder pension, there may be good reasons why they would still wish to join the stakeholder pension scheme. For example, someone in the early years of a career in which they expect to make progress beyond their current level of earnings might think it prudent to start making their own pension provision early on and to contract out into the stakeholder scheme before they reach the &#163;9,000 level. Those with a partner with higher earnings might also wish to pay into a stakeholder scheme rather than into the state second pension. Those people should be given the same opportunities as those in the group that we are targeting. Those who can save for their retirement should be encouraged to do so. Therefore, I urge the Committee to resist amendment No. 32 also.
<P>
The proposed requirement strikes a reasonable balance between a modest additional burden on employers and the need to ensure wider access to good-value pension schemes. We envisage that the companies providing stakeholder pension schemes will develop software packages and other products to assist employers to select a scheme and deal with amendments to payroll systems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> Although I understand that the companies supplying the pensions may give information and advice to employers, will the Government also give advice? That might help employers and remove any fear that the scheme will be a burden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman raised that important point in his contribution to the debate about information and support for employers. The Government's role will be kept to a general level. We support pensions education and I mentioned the newspaper advertising campaign, but we believe that detailed advice to employers should be supplied by the scheme providers. There is good reason to be optimistic that they will provide the support, help and software that is needed to make a success of stakeholder schemes. I do not envisage the Government supplying that to any great extent.
<P>
A reasonable balance is being struck. Like the hon. Member for Winchester and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State many employers want to give employees access to a good value pension scheme. Although it is not sensible or reasonable for all employers to run occupational pension schemes, many want to help their employees in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lait:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but he mentioned a small additional burden on employers. The thought that came immediately to mind is that this is one of many small additional burdens. I recall that Conservative legislation required a compliance cost assessment. I have flicked through the Bill and have not come across one. Will the Minister guide me towards it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Lady is right to think that there should be a compliance cost assessment. It is in the explanatory notes.
<P>
Good employers will welcome the opportunity to participate in the scheme. Only a few minutes ago, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford explained that we are talking about providing funded pensions to a large group of people who do not have access to them. The only realistic way of achieving that is to supply them through employers. I think that the Committee shares the objective of providing wider access to funded pensions. The clause achieves a fair balance without placing an undue burden on employers.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Beckenham turns to the top of page 119 of the explanatory notes, she will see the figures. Estimates range from &#163;10 to &#163;25 a year per contributing employee. A full regulatory impact assessment is in the Library.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I lost the Minister. My point is technical and if he does not know the answer now, he may respond later. He said that people can join a stakeholder scheme after a two-year wait. He also said that benefits accrued can be transferred to an occupational scheme. Some occupational schemes with a two-year wait allow a pension to be backdated to the start of employment, which gives a double benefit. Will that affect the eligibility of employees to join a stakeholder scheme?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not know how the backdating works and I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to ensure that I have given a full and correct answer to his question.
<P>
I would have thought that if someone is paying into a stakeholder scheme and has accumulated a sum of money there, it would be possible, subject to the agreement of the occupational scheme, for that to be transferred across. Unless the employer adds backdated employer contributions at that stage, I cannot see that there would be a problem of double counting, I shall reflect on the matter and write to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Minister tried, slightly desperately, to accuse me of inconsistency, but the inconsistency exists only in his imagination. We have made it clear all along that our preferred concept of a stakeholder pension scheme is an open, unrestricted scheme, as I described when we discussed new clause 2, which sadly failed to meet with the approbation of the Committee. If the new clause had been accepted, I would have withdrawn the amendment before us. If new clause 2 and amendment No. 31 had been accepted, we would have had a sensible system under which employers would be legally obliged to provide a payroll deduction facility. They would not have designated the type of pension or incurred the costs and intolerable liabilities involved in doing so and employees would not be in the absurd position of having to give up an existing personal pension if they wanted to join a stakeholder scheme with a payroll deduction facility. Why cannot the payroll deduction be made to a perfectly good, existing pension? The Minister has not begun to answer that question.
<P>
The Government seem to become crazier and crazier. We have now been told that even if all the relevant employees in a firm have their own personal pensions with which they are entirely content, which they consider to be in their best interests&#151;that could be confirmed by professional advisers&#151;and do not need a stakeholder facility, the Government will impose the unnecessary, gratuitous and absurd cost of setting up a scheme which the employer knows in advance will not be utilised by his employees. One cannot be much crazier than that.
<P>
We have won the argument. Like Bernard Shaw and the actress, the Government do not dispute that imposing a statutory obligation on someone who employs one or two people is utterly absurd and that, to use the Minister's phrase&#151;we shall see the full sentence in Hansard in due course&#151;precisely where ``the barrier will fall'' has yet to be determined. There will now be a barrier and I intended to ensure that there would not be.
<P>
The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten), who is a junior ally of the Government in this as in so many matters, made a similar point. He said first that the barrier should be one or two and later that it should be three or four, but that 10 was too many. The point of principle has been gained and I am not so concerned about where, in the Minister's phrase, ``the barrier will fall''.
<P>
I take the Minister's assurances seriously and we now know that there will be barrier, but we do not know where it will be. I hope that it will be nearer 10 than one, but with the assurance that there will be a barrier and that we have won the point, we have done a reasonable afternoon's work and I shall not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
Amendment No. 32 goes to the heart of what the Government are saying. They said clearly that stakeholder pensions are the most suitable vehicle for pension provision for those earning between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 a year. That is what this morning's debate was about. The group that the stakeholder pension will benefit is much smaller than was originally suggested. We established that in an earlier debate, and to what extent we have made progress.
<P>
If the Minister stands by his remark, he must agree that it is utterly absurd and wrongheaded for employers to set up a stakeholder facility for people who earn less than &#163;9,000 a year. Under the Government's definition, those people would be better off with a state second pension.
<P>
The Government's proposals appear to assume that there will be a movement into the state second pension, which I shall discuss in a moment. I can give the Minister the relevant page references if he wants them. The Government assume that that scheme will cost &#163;500 million, and that it is the only suitable scheme for people with incomes of up to &#163;9,000 a year.
<P>
If the Minister stands by his assurances, he cannot logically resist amendment No. 32. The interests of fair play suggest that he should agree to it. It would also help to protect the interests of relatively lowly paid people&#151;we are all concerned about the state of their small savings. The Minister should ensure that a stakeholder scheme is not set up for those people.
<P>
Alternatively, the Minister might believe that stakeholder pensions are more appropriate than the state second pension for some people who earn less than &#163;9,000&#151;he seemed to drop back into that position this afternoon; we have witnessed a mood shift over just a few hours. What is in the interests of people who earn &#163;9,000? How will someone on approximately that income get proper advice? The Minister will say, if he adopts this afternoon's position rather than this morning's position, ``It may be better for you to be in a stakeholder pension.'' There is no clarity here. We shall press amendment No. 32 to a vote. Meanwhile, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 3, line 24, after `employees', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or shall permit any of his employees to designate his own scheme provided that the scheme is a pension scheme approved under Part XIV of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the amendment that I anticipated in my earlier remarks. It would allow employees to designate their own scheme. We do not like the idea of employers designating their own scheme for various reasons. First, employers will face the cost of evaluating the relevant choices and decisions and, secondly, liabilities will be placed on them. The Government have given us no assurances on those matters. The clause will encourage some of the dangers that I outlined earlier, and on that basis alone we should vote against it, unless the amendment is accepted. Thirdly, we do not like the idea of unnecessarily dividing human freedom. Why should not people be able to designate their own pension product, if they want to? Fourthly&#151;and perhaps most crucially, in a practical sense&#151;it is completely barmy to deny to employees who already have perfectly satisfactory schemes the benefit of the payroll deduction facility for their pension scheme. Giving them access to that facility would place fewer burdens on employers, who should not be responsible for designating a scheme for their employees. Employers would simply have to arrange to make the relevant payments.
<P>
The amendment is at the essence of our proposal. It is entirely consistent with new clause 2 and is something that we would have introduced at the outset. In the light of all the difficulties about burdens and potential liabilities on employers, to which I have already referred, I hope that the Government will accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I understand that it is a tradition that when significant events occur outside the Committee but during our proceedings, it is appropriate to draw attention to them. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities has just informed me that the German Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine, has resigned this afternoon, and his resignation has been accepted. I thought that that might be of interest to the Committee.
<P>
On amendment No. 31, it is already the case that individuals can join a pension scheme of their choice. There is no obligation for anyone to join any particular scheme, so the amendment is unnecessary and will not increase flexibility of choice, unless what is envisaged&#151;it is not in the amendment, but it could be in the mind of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford&#151;is a requirement on every employer to give access to every pension scheme that any employee may ask to join. If that is what the hon. Gentleman envisages, it places a considerable additional burden on employers.
<P>
We are simply saying that employers should arrange for deductions to be made from all those employees who wish to be included, and put into one stakeholder scheme. If the hon. Gentleman wants employers to make deductions and give them to any number of pension schemes, that is a considerable additional burden. That is not implied by the amendment, but then, as it stands, the amendment does not change anything at all, so that may be what the hon. Gentleman had in mind.
<P>
We want everyone to have access to a good value pension scheme through the workplace. The clause requires employers without an occupational scheme covering all their employees to offer one, but it does not mean that employees will be obliged to join that scheme. If they wish to join a different stakeholder scheme or a personal pension scheme, they are free to do so. I am glad that the Opposition support the idea of providing access to stakeholder pension schemes through the workplace, but the amendment does not increase people's choice, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Of course, the force of the amendment must be taken in connection with new clause 2.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. New clause 2 no longer exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Committee voted against that part of our proposal, but the amendment is of a piece with that, for which I make no apology. Of course, we intend the stakeholder facility to be made available to any approved pension scheme that an employee might himself designate, a phrase I emphasised in speaking to new clause 2, so the Minister can hardly look surprised. Therefore, the employee carries that responsibility and should also have the choice and opportunity.
<P>
The Minister's objection is that I am placing more burdens on employers than he is. Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security should have spoken in his place on that amendment because, apparently, he is a successful small business man himself and, I trust, would endorse what I am about to say.
<P>
The real burden on employers is not in setting up payment systems involving different sums of money for different employees, because that will happen anyway. Bloggs will have &#163;20 a month deducted, Snoops will have &#163;75, Jones will have &#163;120 and Davies will probably have not very much. That is inherent in the Government's proposal. It is not a problem. One simply feeds different numbers into the computer and the sum is taken off the net income that the employee receives in his salary cheque. Many other deductions are dealt with in that way, and most personnel systems are set up on that basis. That is not a burden.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is perfectly possible to say, ``I have a pension scheme with Fidelity'' or ``I have a pension scheme with Scottish Widows. Would you please take out so much a month for that?'' That is not a burden on an employer. It does not matter if the money has to go to several different addresses. The problem is in the designation, the choice and the work that must be done. The nightmare lies in all the conversations with the pensions industry, sorting out problems that are not germane to the management of the business. That is what employers, including small employers, will face if the Government do not set the threshold high enough. An even worse problem is the professional fees that will be incurred by the need to evaluate the various possibilities before the process of designation takes place. That process imposes substantial responsibilities on employers, which the Minister is wrong to make light of. The third problem is that the liability that stands in the background will overshadow the firm ever thereafter.
<P>
Our system is far less onerous, as the Minister will discover if he talks to small businesses. Putting different bank account numbers, different names and different amounts of money into a computer is not the problem. The problem is in the designation. The aim of our amendment is to make sure that employers are relieved of that burden and that, at the same time, employees gain freedom of choice and an ability to continue their existing pensions, to which we attach so much importance.
<P>
I therefore wish to press our amendment to a vote, Mr. McWilliam, whenever you deem it appropriate.

</FONT><B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 3, line 41, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) An employee shall only be allowed to make a new request to change the scheme into which his contributions are to be paid once every year and the employer shall not be bound to change the level of an employee's contributions more than twice a year.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a simple amendment. If we have lost amendment No. 31, we must retrieve what we can to reduce the burdens on employers. The amendment provides that changes should be made only once a year. If the Minister says that once a year is not right and that it should be 11 months or 13 months, I shall not argue about it, but I want to hear what he says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It may reassure hon. Members if I say a little about the way in which we intend this element of the requirement to work when stakeholder pensions are first introduced. Initially, employers will be required to pass employees' contributions only to schemes designated by them. Individual employees will not be able to insist that employers pay their contributions to a different scheme. I disagree with the hon. Gentleman, because requiring employers to hand over contributions from one, two or three employees to different pension schemes would be a severe burden. However, that relates to the previous amendment.
<P>
An employee could belong to a different scheme, but would have to make his own arrangements to pay the contributions, unless the employer was willing, voluntarily, to pass pay deductions to that scheme.
<P>
We would like to extend the payroll deduction arrangement, but before doing so we want suitable clearing house arrangements in place to avoid placing undue burdens on employers. That would enable employers to make a single payment to the clearing house for all their employees. Whatever stakeholder schemes they belong to, the clearing house would then pass the money to individual schemes. As we said in the Green Paper, we want to consult further on the feasibility and timing of such clearing house arrangements.
<P>
The second part of the amendment concerns the frequency with which an employee could ask his employer to change the level of his contribution. We want stakeholder schemes to offer members flexibility to vary contributions as their circumstances change. We recognise that such flexibility will involve a cost for employers and it is right that there should be a limit on the extent to which employees could vary their contributions. That is why that element of the requirement is subject to a power to prescribe exceptions to it.
<P>
We want to strike the right balance between minimising costs to businesses and ensuring flexibility for scheme members. We shall consult with employers' representatives on the details. It would not be right to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions by putting the details into primary legislation now. That would limit our flexibility to amend the provisions in the light of experience of stakeholder schemes, changing technology and so on.
<P>
We have made it clear that we intend to consult further on the details to which the amendment refers. I have a lot of sympathy with the point raised in the amendment. There should be limitations, but we want to discuss them further. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that it would not be appropriate to put such details in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As I made clear, we are more concerned with the principle than with the time involved. The Minister appears to accept that, so we shall not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
I hope that we can put some credence on the Minister's declarations about consulting&#151;they were made after the 12th hour had passed. I hope that he and/or his colleagues in Government will observe them more sincerely than was the case with a previous, more formal promise to consult in the Green Paper. That promise was torn up just a few weeks after it was made. On the assumption that the Minister will consult properly with employers, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will be brief because we have discussed the clause at length in the debates on the amendments. The clause will substantially improve access to second pensions. That is the purpose of the enterprise. It is a key element in our proposals to ensure that many more people can save for their retirement. The clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> There are some important underlying aspects to the clause. First, it is clear that a company that sets up a stakeholder pension scheme will have no rights to the assets of that scheme, whereas companies can benefit under standard company schemes if they become over-funded. Therefore, an important principle will be established. That has not yet been mentioned.
<P>
Another related issue is, who will pay what for whom. When a company promotes a standard corporate scheme, it can be said to be doing so as part of a remuneration package and in its own interests. Under subsection (4), when a company provides and does the work to agree to its stakeholder scheme, reasonable access must be provided to the representatives of whichever of the stakeholder schemes has been chosen, but at whose cost will that access to staff be?
<P>
Will such access take place in work time and, therefore, at the company's cost? Will it be done in out-of-work hours? Will the company be able to charge the stakeholder pension scheme for such costs? Those are not major issues, but they must be considered when thinking about whether the expenses that employers bear are fair and appropriate. I hope that such matters will be clarified, at least, by regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We have considered certain aspects of the clause in the debates on the amendments, but we must now decide whether we can support it. We are grateful for the two assurances that we have received. First, a limit will be set on the size of firms that will come under the obligations in the clause. However, the Government have not yet decided how many employees a firm will have before it comes within the ambit of the Bill.
<P>
We have also received an assurance that the administrative burdens will be limited; the number of times that contribution arrangements can be changed during a year will be limited by regulation. We must put that down on the positive side of the balance sheet on the clause.
<P>
I am afraid that the clause has two absolutely major problems that make it impossible for the Opposition to support it. First, employer liability has not been addressed. I have offered the Minister a way forward if he wants to take it. A provision could be included that would protect employers from such a liability. If the Minister wants to protect employers from that liability, why does he not accept, or even respond to, my proposal?
<P>
If he does not want to protect employers from the liability, he will place the worst of all of the new Labour burdens on the small business sector. No sensible person would do that if he or she realised what the effect on the employers would be. Once again, that reflect the Government's unwillingness to listen.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government have not consulted small businesses. Had they done so, I have not the faintest doubt that the opinions that they would have heard about the danger to small business and the liability that employers could incur under the clause would have expressed much more pungently than I have expressed them. Employers will incur immediate costs for professional advice to discharge that central liability, or to lay it off on their actuaries, accountants or lawyers so that they can subsequently say that they have taken all the necessary advice. Those two matters&#151;the liabilities and the professional costs&#151;reinforce each other, and the Government have not been clear about them.
<P>
The second matter that we certainly cannot accept is the ambiguity, or the Government's fudge, about the position of those who earn &#163;9,000 or less a year. This morning, we were told that stakeholder pensions are appropriate only to those who earn between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,000 a year. If that is true, it is extraordinary to impose on employers the burden of setting up schemes for those for whom that is, by definition, inappropriate. That cannot be sensible. It might be dangerous if it is a signal to people that they should opt out of the state second pension in favour of a stakeholder pension on the Government's assumptions.
<P>
If the state second pension is not a better deal for those who earn less than &#163;9,000 a year&#151;the Government have it in their power to ensure that it is&#151;we are right back to the problems that I mentioned before. I mention them again because it is about time that the Government focused on them and gave us a response. It is absolutely crazy, irresponsible and thoroughly cruel to tell those who earn &#163;9,000 a year that it is their responsibility to decide whether it is better to be in a stakeholder pension or in a state second pension. The Government refused to accept an amendment that would have ensured that people receive advice in such circumstances. Of course, such people will not normally have access to proper professional advice. What a nightmare to impose on this country a provision under which people who earn &#163;9,000 a year must take professional advice from actuaries to decide which sort of pension to take. That is utterly unacceptable. On those two bases, I am sure that all my hon. Friends will join me in voting against the clause.
