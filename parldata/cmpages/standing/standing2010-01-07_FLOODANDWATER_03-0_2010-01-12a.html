<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000423"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I could not possibly comment on the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
intervention.</div><a name="10011269000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am delighted to be moving amendment 131. The Minister and the Committee
are aware of several definitions of &#147;flooding&#148;. The
purpose behind the amendment is simply to convince them that the
definition in the Bill is defective. The definition of
&#147;flood&#148; in subsection (1) only relates
to</div><a name="10011269000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
case where land not normally covered by water becomes covered by
water.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would love to know the background to that definition, which the
Minister might like to share. It is completely innocuous as it stands,
but it does not go far enough. I hope the Minister and the Committee
will look favourably on what we would like to do, which is to expand
the definition to cover, in
addition,</div><a name="10011269000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
case where water has rested just below the
surface&#148;.</div><a name="10011269000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for that emerged from the evidence session last Thursday, when
we heard that damage to property begins at 300 mm below ground
level&#151;that was established in 1977&#151;and that soil
structure is affected by waterlogging, which can have adverse impacts
on foundations of infrastructure, most notably road and rail
infrastructure but also property infrastructure. I would like to return
to property infrastructure separately. Vegetation and crops cannot
survive in conditions in which high ground water levels
persist&#151;&#151;which is 500 mm below the surface, as
established in 1992. By omitting to include the below-surface level and
failing to acknowledge that flooding begins before water reaches ground
level, a considerable risk could be placed on infrastructure across
England and Wales as well as the damage to property, whether homes or
land.</div><a name="10011269000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the Government&#146;s own top scientists has said that the biggest
challenge we face is climate change, while another said that the
biggest challenge is food security&#151;I forget which was the
Department&#146;s and which the general Government chief scientist.
On both issues, clause 1 serves a useful purpose by improving climate
change and increasing food security. The omission of our amendments
would prevent the relevant authorities from even considering
sub-surface flooding when weighing up the costs and benefits of
flood-alleviation schemes, projects and action. In many instances, that
may make the difference between a favourable cost-benefit assessment
and failure, resulting in many potentially essentially schemes being
sidelined. Are the Committee and the Minister agreeable to considering
our definition as presented in amendment
131:</div><a name="10011269000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
case where water has rested just below the
surface&#148;?</div><a name="10011269000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
any event, will the Minister concede that floods should be redefined to
include waterlogging or saturation of soils within 500 mm of ground
level?</div><a name="10011269000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have related most of my remarks to infrastructure such as roads and
railways, but I hope that the Minister will concede that secondary
flooding is a serious issue. That is particularly the case in Hull. I
visited Hull and saw that for myself. I gather that in other
cases&#151;I cannot remember whether in Plymouth or
Portsmouth&#151;secondary flooding is horrendous and poses all sorts
of problems for the houses affected, and for clean-up and insurers. It
can come back months after the initial  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>flood. Our purpose in drafting the amendment to broaden the definition
is to recognise flood scenarios that can create real damage to
property, infrastructure, vegetation&#151;farmers cannot recover the
costs of damaged crops&#151;and, most importantly, to the numerous
poor households that are subject to secondary flooding. I hope that the
Minister and the Committee will consider our amendment
favourably.</div><a name="10011269000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000424"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have had a request to have the
air-conditioning turned down or switched off. That request has now been
referred to something rather Orwellian called central control, and we
hope that central control will respond
quickly.</div><a name="10011269000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011269000425"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): It is a delight to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Chope. I wish you well in your battle
with central control throughout the
proceedings.</div><a name="10011269000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have waited a long time to get to this stage and I am pleased that we
are finally here. There is much to welcome in the Bill, and it is very
welcome that we have the Bill at all. There is still much to debate,
but I put on record my appreciation of the open way in which the
Minister and his team have approached
discussions.</div><a name="10011269000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
clause 1, we perhaps confirm some people&#146;s worst fears about
politicians, because we have the opportunity to debate what a flood is
for some time. Someone who cannot recognise one has certainly not lived
in Cheltenham. Subsection (2) is comprehensive, but there are a couple
of issues in the clause that I think we are going to address in the
amendments. One, an almost philosophical issue, is the definition in
subsection
(1):</div><a name="10011269000034"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;land
not normally covered by
water&#148;.</div><a name="10011269000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
perhaps implies that floods are unnatural events, that flooding is
bizarre and strange, whereas flooding is part of the natural process of
rainfall and tides, and part of the natural scheme of things.
Underlying some of the difficulties in the Bill is an attempt to get
towards processes that work with nature rather than against it, and
that work with natural landscapes and natural landscape features.
Perhaps that definition reveals an underlying philosophy that a flood
is not natural but something against which artificial defences need to
be erected. It will perhaps be more helpful as we go through the Bill
to look for opportunities to work with nature and the landscape
wherever possible. Ah, peace and quiet at last; the air-conditioning
has been turned
off.</div><a name="10011269000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
then have the different forms of flooding and, as I pointed out on
Second Reading, when the water is flowing down your high street it is
rather difficult to tell which type of water it is and to whom it
belongs. I shall illustrate one problem with the definitions of water
by quoting a couple of examples given to me by the National Flood
Forum:</div><a name="10011269000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
disabled women of 89 rang the office to say her neighbour had changed
the contour of his drive and as a consequence every time it rained the
run-off from his drive flooded her home. She went round to complain, he
was very abusive and refused to do anything about the situation. The
lady rang both
the&#148;</div><a name="10011269000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Environment
Agency and the local
authority,</div><a name="10011269000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only
to be told it
was&#148;</div><a name="10011269000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">not
their kind of
flooding</div><a name="10011269000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
there was nothing they could do to help her. Her only form of redress
would be to take the very costly legal route.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div><a name="10011269000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In another
example,</div><a name="10011269000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
mill owner in south Yorkshire tarmaced a staff car park and after that
every time it rained the water ran down the hill side flooding a line
of terraced houses. They too complained to the mill owner and got the
same reaction as above from him and
the&#148;</div><a name="10011269000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Environment
Agency and the local authority. That tangle of responsibilities and the
inability to work out who is responsible for what led Sir Michael Pitt
to ask for the clear oversight role&#151;the buck-stops-here
role&#151;for the Environment Agency that all of us support. I am
slightly worried because we are not sure that, in all cases, the Bill
delivers that. It is important that we address not only amendment 131,
but amendments 82 to
84.</div><a name="10011269000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
131 deals with the specific concern of the Association of Drainage
Authorities, which has rightly said that damage starts below ground
level. I am not sure that we need the specific amendment that we are
discussing, because there is a definition of ground water at clause
6(4), which
says:</div><a name="10011269000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;Groundwater&#146;
means all water which is below the surface of the ground and in direct
contact with the ground or
subsoil.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should think that that definition&#151;if we can make it explicit in
the definition of a flood&#151;covers the concerns of the hon. Member
for Vale of York. However, I am sympathetic to her amendment and would
happily support it, for the avoidance of all
doubt.</div><a name="10011269000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments 82 to 84 would put a few specific definitions of flooding
beyond doubt and within the scope of the Bill. The first definition
that we are concerned with is groundwater, in a sense making our
objective the same as the one behind amendment 131. The specifics that
we deal with reflect the reality that many of my constituents in
Cheltenham faced when they were flooded. For example, an area called
Little Bayshill terrace in Cheltenham is virtually surrounded by the
River Chelt, which goes round two sides of that road. That little
cul-de-sac ends in a fairly comprehensive wall that is designed to stop
the water coming in and flood defences were installed at the entrances
to that area, with sandbags also put in place in the event of June and
July floods. But it was all as nought, because in many cases the flood
water simply came up through their floorboards. That kind of ground
water flooding was just as distressing and, in a sense, more
frustrating because the people there had put so much effort into
stopping water coming in by other
means.</div><a name="10011269000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to be specific. In respect of the overall definition of flooding
and the responsibilities for flooding that we are passing to the
Environment
Agency&#151;</div><a name="10011269000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000426"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that the problems with
both Mythe and Castle Mead pumping stations were from water coming from
below. All the erroneous media reports about the water being about to
overwash the barriers were unhelpful, because it was about trying to
stop the water coming through from the ground. I sure that he knows
about
that.</div><a name="10011269000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000427"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> My neighbour the hon. Member for Stroud makes an
important point. He is right about the Mythe water pumping station. For
all the media attention on the flood defences that were being put round
the outside, when people spoke about
Mythe&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry; I am confusing that
with Walham electricity substation, which people talked about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>being a few inches from being flooded, although it was water inside the
perimeter rising up at ground level and threatening to damage the
machinery that was the
problem.</div><a name="10011269000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011269000428"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): My hon.
Friend makes a powerful case for amending the definition. In support of
his contention, may I reflect upon my constituency office? It is called
Watergate, which should have given us some indication that we might
have problems before we took the lease. Flood defence has done much to
counteract the fluvial flooding, but we still have flooding from ground
water that comes up in the basement. My hon. Friend makes an important
point.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000429"></a>Martin

suitable title for an office; I am surprised that my hon. Friend has
not changed it.</div>
<a name="10011269000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 83
would deal with a similar issue in respect of surface water flooding
and reflects an underlying concern identified by the National Flood
Forum. It says:</div>
<a name="10011269000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
feel that the Draft...Bill does not go far enough in meeting the
needs of the vulnerable and those in the flood prone communities. We
are concerned that the vital area of surface water flooding is to be
left to Local Authorities to deal with, under the auspices of the
EA&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011269000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
Environment Agency. It goes on to point out the possible practical
difficulties. We will come back to that theme in later clauses and
amendments, and the question whether there should be a horizontal or
vertical division of responsibilities between the Environment Agency
and local authorities.</div>
<a name="10011269000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">This seems to
be a good opportunity to point out that surface water is a key element
of flood responsibility and that we should get the definition right at
the start. For the avoidance of doubt, we should also add ground water,
surface water and, if necessary, the Association of Drainage
Authorities&#146; definition of water below the surface.</div>
<a name="10011269000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 84
addresses a slightly different matter&#151;the two exemptions in the
clause. First, it
exempts</div><a name="10011269000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
flood from any part of a sewerage system, unless wholly or partly
caused by an increase in the volume of
rainwater&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011269000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">luckily
including
snow&#151;</div><a name="10011269000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;entering
or otherwise affecting the
system&#148;.</div><a name="10011269000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
it
exempts</div><a name="10011269000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
flood caused by a burst water
main&#148;.</div><a name="10011269000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is obviously most distressing if floodwater enters the sewerage system,
because foul water contaminates people&#146;s houses even more than
normal floodwater. It seems a slightly clumsy approach. Will the
Minister explain why the Government introduced the exemption only to
qualify it? What breaches from sewerage systems does he imagine are not
caused by rainwater? Rather strangely, subsection (3)(b), which is
about burst water mains, includes no such qualification. A burst water
main that is</div>
<a name="10011269000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;caused by an
increase in the volume of rainwater...entering or otherwise
affecting the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div><a name="10011269000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The flooding
that one sees on the A46 on the Shurdington road in Cheltenham, where
the water main seems to burst every time there is the least amount of
flooding, let alone the one in a century floods that we suffered in
2007, will all be part and parcel of the same flood events. It seems
strange that the floods mentioned in paragraph (b) have no
qualification comparable to that in paragraph (a). Why is
that?</div>
<a name="10011269000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,
we are talking about flooding in total. We are talking about flooding
that is sometimes exacerbated by the failure of structures and physical
systems such as sewers and water mains. It should all be included in
the definition of flooding and come under the overarching
responsibility of the Environment Agency. I see no good reason for such
exemptions. If there is a reason, I am sure that the Minister will
explain it.</div>
<a name="10011269000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011269000430"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): I welcome you to
the Chair, Mr. Chope. It is a pleasure to follow my
neighbour, the hon. Member for Cheltenham, who made some good points,
as did my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York in moving amendment
131.</div>
<a name="10011269000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
pick up on something the hon. Member for Cheltenham said. He asked
whether it was absolutely necessary to make such an amendment, given
that clause 6 defines ground water as</div>
<a name="10011269000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all water which
is below the surface of the ground&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011269000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that the
amendment is necessary because, although the Government seek in clause
1 to define the meaning of flood, no mention is made of water under the
surface. Clause 1(1) attempts to define a flood, and we need to amend
it in order to avoid
doubt.</div><a name="10011269000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York made a good point about water
resting below the surface. Recently, a contentious planning application
of quite large scale was made in my constituency in Longford, an area
with which the hon. Members for Cheltenham and indeed for Stroud will
be familiar. The area floods&#151;there is no doubt about that, as
anyone who lives or travels near there knows&#151;but the contention
was about whether it flooded. In part of the area water rests on the
surface although, even so, some people&#151;usually supporters of the
developers&#151;contended about whether it flooded; in another area
the water rests below the
surface.</div><a name="10011269000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Environment Agency, when assessing that particular planning
application, said at a public meeting that, if the water was resting
below the surface, an area was not considered to be a flood-risk area.
That troubled me. Anyone who lives near that area and anyone who was
flooded in 2007, without any development on the land, would view that
opinion with worry. They would be extremely concerned about houses
being built on that land. Yet, because the water was slightly below the
surface, it seemingly did not constitute a flood risk in the eyes of
the Environment Agency and the appeal to build on the land was granted.
People who live close by will be very worried indeed&#151;some were
flooded and could not get back into their houses for more than a year
because of the floods. They were living adjacent to the land; the
flooding for them is going to be far worse. It is very important that
we add the amendment to clause 1 because if water is resting slightly
below the surface, it is only a few millimetres different from resting
on the surface, which surely constitutes flooding or flood
risk.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div><a name="10011269000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cheltenham also made a good point about land that normally
floods. Separately, the hon. Member for Stroud introduced the problem
that we had at the Mythe water treatment works in 2007&#151;Mythe is
in my constituency, close to where I live in Tewkesbury. The fields
around the Mythe flood several times a year. They do not necessarily
flood at the Mythe water treatment works&#151;that has only happened
on the one occasion so far&#151;but the fields do flood regularly.
They are flooded now, and three, four or five times a year, because
they are very close to the river and the water table is high in that
area. Without wishing to be pedantic, does the Minister consider that
to be &#147;flood&#148;? The area floods so often, but how often is
normal in that respect? I do not mean to be awkward, but would that
land be deemed flooded if it floods so many times a year? Water is
obviously not intended to rest on the land, but because it does so
often, would that be considered a
flood?</div><a name="10011269000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is particularly important that we define flooding in rather more detail
than clause 1 does at present, so I support my hon. Friend the Member
for Vale of York on including water resting below the surface. She went
into agricultural purposes, but I am afraid that I have not researched
the matter in that detail and do not profess to understand too much
about agriculture. However, the amendment is important to the clause
for the purpose of house building. I hope to return to the theme later
this morning, but we are going to have a regional spatial
strategy&#151;it is not quite finalised yet&#151;that proposes to
build something like 14,500 houses in my constituency, in what is
obviously a flood-risk area. The hon. Member for Cheltenham asked
whether we really need to define what flooding is&#151;if we see a
flood, we know it is a flood&#151;but apparently we do for the
purposes of legislation. The threat hanging over us is the building of
so many houses in a flood-risk area. The increase in the number of
houses is massive, something like a 40 per cent. increase on what we
already have in the constituency over the next 16
years.</div><a name="10011269000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we have such a threat hanging over us, it is important that we define
in legislation exactly what a &#147;flood&#148; is. My hon.
Friend&#146;s amendment will help us to do that somewhat more
accurately.</div><a name="10011269000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000431"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> I welcome the spirit in
which everyone has entered the debate in Committee and on Second
Reading. I was not at Second Reading, because I was away in Brussels
unfortunately, fighting the good fight at the Agriculture and Fisheries
Council, but I am glad to be here
now.</div><a name="10011269000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
at the definitions in clause 1 is a good starting point because, as the
hon. Member for Cheltenham rightly said, most people recognise a flood
when it is heading towards them, whether it is coming up through the
basement or down the street. It is important, however, that we have
clarity here, and I think that I can give that. I very much welcome the
nature of the discussion so far, because it is important to try to bolt
down what is and is not covered, and why it is defined as it is. I hope
that I will be able to give the assurances that Members want about why
we have addressed the issue in this
way.</div>
<a name="10011269000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="10011269000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
131 would expand the definition of flooding to include areas with water
just below the surface. I listened with interest to the hon. Member for
Vale of York. The amendment could extend the scope of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>Bill considerably, so that areas with a high water table, as opposed to
areas that are being flooded, would be considered to be flooded, even
though that might be the normal state of affairs. That is an important
area for definition. We do not want to automatically say that every
area that has a high water table is
flooded.</div><a name="10011269000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me expand a little. It is important to distinguish between high ground
water levels, which occur in many areas, and floods. Many Members here
represent constituents who have high ground water levels as a matter of
course, but they are not floods as we would normally know them. We
recognise that flooding may also occur as a result of high ground water
levels, or have been contributed to by them. The definition of flood in
clause 1 is deliberately inclusive rather than exhaustive in that
regard. Subsection (1)
states:</div><a name="10011269000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;Flood&#146;
includes any case where land not normally covered by water becomes
covered by
water.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2)
continues:</div><a name="10011269000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
does not matter for the purpose of subsection (1) whether a flood is

Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): On that point, does
the Minister recognise that land being covered for a period each day
would probably be too frequent an occurrence for the definition? I am
thinking of tidal water. However, if that happened once a month or so,
it would be a less than normal, but regular occurrence. In some cases
it would happen less frequently than a regular tide, but sufficiently
frequently for it to be
noticeable.</div><a name="10011269000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000433"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I want to studiously avoid the necessity
to define regularity or infrequency of flooding in the Bill, and I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will understand why. We have water-meadows that
flood frequently as part of natural processes, and within local areas
it is recognised that they do that. In other areas, there might be
seasonal flooding. Twice a year the Burry estuary in south
Wales&#151;my own area&#151;has high river tides, and if they
correspond with high spring and neap tides we have flooding. The Welsh
salt-marsh lamb that is produced on the marshes there is a benefit of
that wonderful pastureland, which floods not only fairly regularly, but
twice a year at a high
level.</div><a name="10011269000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me explain where the definition comes from. It is important to say that
it is inclusive rather than exhaustive. We do not want to get into the
business of trying to define exactly what we mean by normal or regular
and so on, because this is where the work on the ground goes on and
where the national strategy link to the local implementation of plans
matters. The definition is consistent with EU directive 2007/60/EC on
the assessment and management of flood risks, and with existing
practice. I remind Members what the definition in that directive
is:</div><a name="10011269000077"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;flood&#146;
means the temporary covering by water of land not normally covered by
water. This shall include floods from rivers, mountain torrents,
Mediterranean ephemeral water courses,&#148;&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div><a name="10011269000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate that we do
not have many of those in this
country&#151;</div><a name="10011269000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
floods from the sea in coastal areas, and may exclude floods from
sewerage
systems&#148;.</div><a name="10011269000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me go on, because it is helpful to explain this in the round. It is
recognised that relevant authorities may also need to manage water
below ground for agricultural or environmental purposes, as Committee
members have said. Drainage for agricultural and other reasons is
covered already by the Land Drainage Act 1991 and will be permitted for
environmental reasons by the environmental clauses 38 and
39.</div><a name="10011269000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have mentioned that the definition we are talking about is inclusive.
Putting it in straight terms, it does not exclude water below ground
level. Anything within that definition that contributes to a flood
event is included in it, including ground water. Damage to property,
which we will discuss in respect of infrastructure and so on, begins at
300 mm below floor level, not at ground water level. Just to reassure
the hon. Member for Vale of York, secondary flooding is covered in the
definition, as are any other aspects of flooding in that
definition.</div><a name="10011269000386"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="10011269000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000434"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> If it is included, it seems sensible to put it
in the
Bill.</div><a name="10011269000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
few moments ago, the Minister mentioned, or questioned, our having a
high water table in Tewkesbury, for example, where the Severn and the
Avon meet, although I do not think he was suggesting that because it
floods regularly it should not be considered a
flood.</div>
<a name="10011269000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000435"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> No.</div>
<a name="10011269000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000436"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> Would he accept that that is
flooding?</div><a name="10011269000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000437"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. In
the context of the explanation that I have just given and the
definitions that I have mentioned, and my remarks at this point, it is
clear that what we mean by &#147;flooding&#148; is anything that
contributes to a flooding event, whether that is ground water or
another eventuality. I will come to the sewerage issue in a moment,
because that is important in respect of the hon. Member for
Cheltenham&#146;s asking why we have excluded that and brought it
back in as part of the Bill&#151;because it ties into the
definition.</div><a name="10011269000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000438"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I think that there is confusion in respect of
land not normally covered by water, and the Minister is persisting with
that in his response. I am not talking about ground water, although I
take the point made about it. There is a discrepancy between the
300 mm that will result in damage to property and the
500 mm, which will result in damage to vegetation. That is
why we have come up with the formula to recognise the fact that it is
not just about what is covering the land&#151;that is where the
definition is defective&#151;but about what is below land as well.
The Minister is not addressing that point in his
remarks.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div><a name="10011269000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000439"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I think I understand what the hon. Lady is
saying. I will return to the point about the detail in respect of the
300 mm and the 500 mm, but it is important to put that in context of
the definition of &#147;flooding&#148; being inclusive, so any
aspect in terms of this definition would be
covered.</div><a name="10011269000088"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000441"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I turn now to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points, because doing so might address some of the issues that he
mentioned. Then I will be happy to take an
intervention.</div><a name="10011269000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned what a flood is and how we would recognise it
if it was coming towards us, and the aspect of what is not normally
covered by water. Just to clarify that, it does not have to be rare or
a freak event. We are certainly seeing such events more frequently now
and we recognise that they are naturally occurring events that are
happening more often. We will return to the matter of working with
nature, as the hon. Gentleman commented earlier, on discussions of
subsequent amendments, because we want that to happen in all aspects of
the
Bill.</div><a name="10011269000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question of whose flood water it is&#151;as asked by somebody who
faces a flood incident&#151;is the focus of the Bill. Let me turn to
the detail of amendments 82 to 84, tabled by the hon. Members for
Cheltenham and for Brecon and Radnorshire, which would amend the
definition of &#147;flooding&#148; to include ground water and
surface water from any source, as well as removing the exclusions for
flooding from sewers not caused by rainwater and burst water
mains.</div><a name="10011269000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
exclusions included for sewer flooding not caused by rainfall and burst
water mains are there because those things are covered by existing
legislation, principally sections 37 and 94 of the Water Industry Act
1991, and are best managed independently of other flood risks, since
they relate only to the water and sewerage networks. That needs to be
put in the context of what I said previously&#151;I will return to it
in a moment&#151;which is that any flooding event with a contributing
factor comes into it. I will explain why the exemptions issue raised by
the hon. Member for Cheltenham is
important.</div><a name="10011269000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000442"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="10011269000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000443"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me finish the point. To include those
sources of flooding within the definition of flooding in the Bill would
involve unnecessarily a much wider range of authorities in these
matters and could impose significant
burdens.</div><a name="10011269000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000444"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I have some sympathy with the concern that the
hon. Member for Cheltenham has about flooding from sewerage being
excluded. Pitt made it clear that this was to be a unifying Act,
bringing together all the legislation. The Committee is united in that
ambition. If we are amending other aspects of the Acts that have been
referred to, why cannot we bring those Acts into this legislation? I
think all Committee members would agree on that. It would then be much
simpler for anybody inside or outside this House to understand what
&#147;flood&#148; means. If a house is inundated with sewage, it
causes a lot more damage, there are public health consequences and it
takes longer before people can return to their
home.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div><a name="10011269000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000445"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I give way to the hon. Member for
Cheltenham.</div><a name="10011269000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000446"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I think it might be logical for me to speak at
this point. There seem to be two logical problems with what the
Minister is saying. It is not clear what he is saying about ground
water. He may be saying that ground water becomes a flood only when it
reaches the surface and covers land, even if it has originated from
underneath, but that seems to contradict definitions later in the Bill.
The definition in clause 6(4)
is:</div><a name="10011269000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;Groundwater&#146;
means all water which is below the surface of the ground and in direct
contact with the ground or
subsoil.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
clause 10(2), ground water&#151;that is water below the surface, as
defined in clause
6&#151;</div><a name="10011269000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
one of the flood risks that must be included in local flood risk
management strategies. By a process of elimination, that means that we
must have ground water causing flood risk from below the surface. There
is clearly enough confusion about this for us to want to clarify it
with amendment 131 or amendment 82. It already appears to be an area
that lawyers will try to decide on subsequently. They will pore through
the Minister&#146;s remarks in this Committee as evidence of what the
Bill means. It would be much simpler to accept one of the
amendments.</div><a name="10011269000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000447"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is an extremely long intervention
already.</div><a name="10011269000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000448"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> On the back of those two interventions, I
will reply to the hon. Member for Vale of York first. The Pitt
recommendations were clear. He requested a unified law on floods, not
on all water matters. The Bill therefore does not deliver unified
legislation on all water matters, but it does on floods. We have made
it clear that we want to see consolidation following from the Bill.
This is a short-Session Bill and it is not possible to deal with all
matters now. We have the capacity to manage the water and sewer works
separately, but within the Bill, water companies are one of the risk
management authorities. They therefore have to have regard to the
planning of risk management for flooding in their area and to do with
their
assets.</div><a name="10011269000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000449"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Will the Minister briefly give
way?</div><a name="10011269000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000450"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I have not yet responded to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s original points. Perhaps he would like to intervene
when I have done
so.</div><a name="10011269000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
exemptions, we exclude sewers in so far as they cause floods by
collapsing or being blocked because such eventualities are catered for
in other legislation. We add sewers back because we want the
legislation to include them if the flood is not because of a failure of
infrastructure, but because rainwater has overwhelmed a sewer. That is
the rationale behind the definitions for sewer and ground water. Pitt
was clear that anything within the definition of flooding should be
included; that includes ground water. I hear the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about ground water, but I have made it clear
that ground water is a source of flooding when it rises above the
ground and causes and contributes to a flooding incident. It needs
managing, and that is catered for in clause
10.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div><a name="10011269000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000451"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> That is absolutely not the definition in clause
6(4), which
states:</div><a name="10011269000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;Groundwater&#146;
means all water which is below the surface of the
ground&#148;.</div><a name="10011269000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking not about ground water that has risen above surface level,
but about ground water still below the surface of the ground. Surely
that must be included, and that is the very reason for us tabling the
amendments.</div>
<a name="10011269000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000452"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> We may be dancing on the head of a pin, in
the sense that that definition is, as I said in my opening remarks,
inclusive. Where ground water contributes to flooding, or where a
sewerage incident contributes to flooding, with the horrendous
situation of sewage coming into someone&#146;s house after a flooding
incident, those aspects are covered. The hon. Gentleman wants to
specify ground water within that. I am sympathetic to what he is
saying, but it is not actually necessary. Even though I am tempted, as
a legislator, always to bolt everything we can into Bills, it is not
actually necessary in this
case.</div><a name="10011269000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to address the point raised by the hon. Member for Vale of York
about the difference between the 300 mm and 500 mm and how
that relates to damage to property and crops. The 300 mm, as she knows,
relates to ground level for damage to property, and the 500 mm relates
to below ground for damage to crops. Different assets, by their very
nature, will be affected by water at different depths. It is not
possible to set a specific, universal threshold for all damage, which
could be considered as part of the current definition. There are, as
she has said, different levels for different
assets.</div><a name="10011269000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a technical point made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, the
definition of flood clarifies that the various causes of flood listed
are covered. I heard what he said about the ground water in clause 6,
but I think my remarks make it clear that, in clause 1, anything that
contributes to that flooding event is covered. The amendment that would
add to the list &#147;source of flood&#148; is unnecessary, as
flood retains its natural meaning in the definition as drafted. A flood
is a flood, whatever its source may be. I could not be clearer on that.
I mentioned which floods are not caused by rainfall, and that could be
the collapse of a sewer, for example. If that contributes to an overall
flooding event, however, it is within the definition of the
Bill.</div><a name="10011269000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000453"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> In that case, I press the Minister for an
absolutely definitive reply&#151;yes or no&#151;to the following
question: is ground water below the surface of the ground, as in clause
6 and amendment 131, included in the definition of a flood or
not?</div><a name="10011269000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000454"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Yes; I can absolutely give the clarity
that ground water, when it is in situation, is by necessity as defined
in clause 6. Where that contributes to a flooding incident, as defined
in clause 1, it is clearly a factor to be taken into account, so it is
quite clear that ground water is indeed part of the definition where it
contributes to a flood event that includes any case where land not
normally covered by water becomes covered by water, as set out in the
subsequent subsections in clause
1.</div><a name="10011269000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000455"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am trying to help the Minister, because I am
not talking about ground water. I am talking about the Bill
encompassing within the definition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>waterlogging or saturation of soils. Around 65 per cent. of the Vale of
York probably falls within the definition that he so eloquently put in
his initial response, but with respect to the hon. Member for
Cheltenham, that is not the point I am raising. I am raising the fact
that the present definition is defective because I would wish it to
cover waterlogging or saturation of soils within 500 mm of ground
level. So, I am trying to help
him.</div><a name="10011269000387"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000456"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> In my introductory remarks, I made it
clear that amendment 131 would have the result of expanding the
definition of flooding to include areas with water below the surface,
as the hon. Lady has just remarked. However, the amendment could
actually have the result of extending the Bill quite considerably, so
that areas with a high water table would be considered to be flooded.
It cannot simply relate to a high water table as opposed to where a
high water table contributes to an event of flooding, which is where
this definition is focused. Those are two quite different approaches.
Pitt&#146;s recommendations were clear in focusing on flooding as
opposed to all water management, which is what this definition tries to
deal
with.</div><a name="10011269000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
now turn to the amendments suggested by the hon. Member for Cheltenham.
I hear what he is saying, but I would be reluctant to add something to
the Bill that I do not think needs to be in there, because the
definition does, indeed, encompass the matter. Let me take the proposal
away, have a look at it and see whether it would do any harm to the
Bill&#151;to be honest, I do not think it would do harm, but I do not
think it needs to be in the legislation. Let me take the matter away,
consider it and see what I can bring back subsequently, because I think
we are arguing for exactly the same thing: that where ground water
contributes to a flooding eventuality it should be in the Bill. I am
arguing that that is clearly in the legislation, but for the purposes
of putting it beyond any doubt whatsoever, let me go away and have a
look at the matter and see if we can do what he asks. I am
not averse to
that.</div><a name="10011269000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
regards the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Vale of York, if
waterlogging is part of flooding, it is included in the Bill and there
is no need to have any amendment on it. If the waterlogging is not
linked to water on the surface, it is not flooding&#151;in other
words, it is not included. Just to make it clear: if someone has
secondary flooding or basements are being flooded that is part of this
definition. However, the simple waterlogging of soil is not part of
this definition; it is where it contributes to a flooding
event.</div><a name="10011269000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000457"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving that
explanation, which is now clear. Does he not accept that if the water
is resting just below the surface it might, for example, be unsuitable
to build on that land? The matter is important because there may be a
number of planning applications or, indeed, appeals that revert back to
this legislation to determine what a flood area is. It is very
important that we get this right. Does he accept&#151;I do not think
he does&#151;that water resting just below the surface could
constitute flooding? I do not think he accepts that, and that worries
me.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div><a name="10011269000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000458"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> No. Water below the surface of itself does
not constitute flooding as it is described in the European definitions
or the definitions in the Bill. I think I have made it clear
that a high water table can itself contribute to a flooding event. That
falls within the definition in relation to, for example, flooding of a
basement, secondary flooding and things such as that. We will return to
the issues surrounding planning later within subsequent amendments and
that will be a good debate to have. I have made it clear that I am
quite sympathetic to both points that have been raised, but let me take
the matter away to consider and see whether we can bring something
forward subsequently, because we are aiming to do exactly the same
thing.</div><a name="10011269000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is not a necessity to go further in the way that the hon. Lady is
suggesting because it would extend the scope of the Bill considerably.
However, just to make it clear, in asking the hon. Members for Vale of
York, for Upminster, for Cheltenham and for Brecon and Radnorshire not
to press their amendments, I am sympathetic to what they are saying. I
think we have dealt with the matter already, but I am particularly
happy to take away the suggestion by the hon. Member for Cheltenham and
have a look at
it.</div><a name="10011269000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000459"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I would just push something a little further to
see whether we get an agreement. The water below the surface does not
emerge&#151;obviously&#151;as long as it remains below the surface.
The problem is, once we build on the land, the water does emerge and
the area floods. Am I correct in saying that it is not a flood today
but it may be a flood
tomorrow?</div><a name="10011269000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000460"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is a speech. The Minister has already sat
down.</div><a name="10011269000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000461"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am pleased by what the Minister said and am
grateful that he will go away and look at the issue seriously. The fact
that we have ended up debating it in such detail suggests that there is
a bit of a problem with the definition. Both amendments, although not
addressing identical issues, are on similar
territory.</div><a name="10011269000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
closing, I would like to press the Minister for a reply on one of the
other issues that I raised, relating to amendment 84. Why, in
subsection (3), is there a qualification to flooding from a sewerage
system&#151;</div><a name="10011269000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless
wholly or partly caused by an increase in the volume of
rainwater&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011269000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
does not then apply to a burst water main? I take the Minister&#146;s
point that he thinks the Water Industry Act and other legislation
covers the issue but, as the hon. Member for Vale of York rightly said,
the whole point of the legislation was that it was supposed  to
be comprehensive. Water companies are flood risk management
authorities, according to the later definition in the Bill, so burst
water mains should surely come well within the competence of the Bill.
We should be able to have either the exemptions recommended in
amendment 84 or the same qualification as in paragraph
(b).</div><a name="10011269000124"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000462"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> As I mentioned before, we exclude sewers
in so far as they cause the flood because they may collapse or be
blocked and discharge surface foul water as a result of such an
eventuality. We add them 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>back&#151;this is pertinent to the discussion we have just
had&#151;because if the flood from the sewer is not caused by the
failure of infrastructure but by the volume of rainwater overwhelming
the sewer and contributing to the flood event, we want to include such
an eventuality. That is why we do that. However, amendment 84 refers to
a burst water main not caused by the flood events and we are trying to
exclude that aspect. I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman and
clarify exactly why we have included the one and not the
other.</div><a name="10011269000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000463"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am not quite satisfied with that answer. If the
same qualification applies, why is that not in the Bill? Why is the
same wording as in paragraph (a) not in paragraph (b)? Why have we done
it that way round and not put in the words that the Minister has just
used, about the exclusions being from flooding caused by structural
failures? A burst water main is, by definition, a structural failure,
but the question is what has caused it&#151;is it dilapidation or is
it, as in the regular case I referred to in my constituency, the usual
cause of heavy rainfall, which seems to be excluded from the Bill? At
the moment, I am afraid I wish to press amendment 84 to a vote,
although I am happy not to press the other
amendments.</div><a name="10011269000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000464"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister for his full
reply. However, although I do not intend to press many amendments to a
vote, I would like to persist with my amendment. The reasons are
simple. Recommendation 28 of Pitt clearly
stated:</div><a name="10011269000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
forthcoming flooding legislation should be a single unifying Act that
addresses all sources of flooding, clarifies responsibilities and
facilitates flood risk
management.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the December progress report on the Government&#146;s response to the
Pitt review, the Government stated that the definition lies within that
part of the progress they wish to fall within the
Bill.</div><a name="10011269000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
reason for pressing the amendment to a vote, in spite of what the
Minister said, is that although I take his point on secondary flooding
and the high water table, I think he failed to grasp the point of
excluding such damage, particularly to crops. He failed to recognise
that any definition of flooding has consequences. Leaving that out of
the definition and not supporting the amendment will have serious
consequences for farming and the farming community. On that basis, I
press the amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="10011269000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

wish to make some brief remarks on the amendment and to have a short
clause stand part debate. The amendment is meant to help the Minister
and the Committee by providing clarity. Notwithstanding the definition
of ground water, I believe that the Bill is defective in not referring
to infrastructure above and below
ground.</div><a name="10011269000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister heard the arguments that were put in relation to amendment
131, and the arguments for amendment 132 are similar. I think that the
arguments relating to property&#151;dwellings and road or rail
infrastructure&#151;are well understood. I have a particular concern,
as do other hon. Members, regarding saturation of the ground and the
effects of waterlogging on crops and
farmland.</div><a name="10011269000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000489"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> In relation to clause 2 in general, I have two
questions about the risk-based approach. It seems to run the risk, if
that is the appropriate word, of us moving to a slightly outdated
approach to flooding&#151;an approach that is not about water
management and the management of natural processes, but an approach in
which we seek to avoid supposedly strange and extreme events. We are
talking about moving to an approach that is not just about erecting
defences, but about preventing harm in a more holistic and sustainable
way, not least because the whole idea of using probability seems to be
getting a little doubtful these days.</div>
<a name="10011269000388"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="10011269000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. neighbours from Gloucestershire will remember that we were told in
June 2007 that we had experienced a once-in-80-years flood
event&#151;one with a low chance of recurring. We all looked forward
to 79 years of flood-free existence. I know that that is not quite how
probability theory works, but it certainly did not work that way for
us, because four weeks later we were flooded again with a
once-in-100-years flood.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div><a name="10011269000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Floods are
increasing in frequency and&#151;I hope this is not completely
bizarre&#151;we are expecting climate change to result in
once-in-100-year flood events, of the sort that we experienced
recently, happening perhaps once every three years by the end of the
century. The definition of probability is clearly becoming rather
difficult to manage. Perhaps we should take a fundamentally different
approach. Will the Minister comment on the use of probability and risk
as the basis for
planning?</div><a name="10011269000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
132 seems to be an echo of amendment 131. Although I am
sympathetic to it, if the hon. Lady is right that it does not deal with
the kind of flooding that I am talking about, I would share the
Minister&#146;s concern that it may unduly expand the scope of the
Bill in an impracticable way, so we probably will not
support it.</div>

<a name="10011269000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn
directly to the amendment. It would extend the definition of

state</div><a name="10011269000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;infrastructure
above and below ground&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011269000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause defines
risk, and it lists infrastructure as one of the things that must be
considered when assessing risk and the consequences of risk. The
definition does not exclude consideration of risk to infrastructure
that is underground or partly underground. I wish to avoid introducing
anything into the Bill that could increase confusion; for example, we
would wish to avoid seeking to quantify the depth that is applicable,
as that could vary considerably from case to
case.</div><a name="10011269000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned earlier, the Government acknowledge that sustained
saturation of the ground can cause damage even if water does not rise
above the surface. It is recognised that the management of ground water
levels can contribute to the management of water on the surface.
Indeed, the Land Drainage Act 1991 already deals with
drainage.</div><a name="10011269000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
matter was raised in evidence by Dr. Jean Venables of the Association
of Drainage Authorities, someone whom I meet regularly. That body
represents internal drainage boards, and Jean is a pre-eminent expert
in water level management. Dr. Venables explained that flood damage
occurs not only because of water on the surface, but because water
within a certain depth of the ground can damage infrastructure, such as
roads, railways, properties and foundations. The ADA, the association
that Dr. Venables represents, sought assurances that the terminology in
the Bill would not affect existing practice. I absolutely and
categorically give that assurance, to Members and to all who read of
our debate.</div>
<a name="10011269000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure
the House that I do not expect existing good practice to be hampered by
the Bill. For example, nothing in the Bill should hamper the excellent
work done by the internal drainage boards. The Bill is designed to
ensure that all forms of flood risk are considered in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>as joined-up a fashion as possible. The issue is pertinent, but I
suggest to the hon. Member for Vale of York that it could be picked up
in guidance, alongside consideration of the definition of flooding, as
such guidance could cover the matter in more detail. That will ensure
that the intended effect is not lost, and that clear advice that it
would not be appropriate to include in the legislation is offered to
authorities.</div><a name="10011269000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Chope, do you want me to address the issue that the hon. Member for
Cheltenham raised about
risk?</div><a name="10011269000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000493"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It is kind of the Minister to ask. The hon.
Member for Cheltenham put that issue forward in what he thought was a
stand part debate, so it would be better if the Minister could reserve
his response until we have that
debate.</div><a name="10011269000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000494"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> In that case, with those clear
reassurances, including on the necessity of looking at the matter in
guidance, on which we would consult all people&#151;Committee
members, the ADA and others&#151;I ask that the hon. Member for Vale
of York, who has rightly explored the matter, withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011269000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000495"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister, especially
as I am vice-president of the Association of Drainage Authorities, as I
am sure that he is aware. I invite all members of the Committee to come
and visit the internal drainage boards in either Yorkshire or East
Anglia&#151;although perhaps not this week or next week&#151;to see
the excellent work that they
do.</div><a name="10011269000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have one remaining question. The Government&#151;not necessarily this
Minister&#151;have a terrible habit of promising to introduce
guidance and then doing nothing. Does the Minister care to give us a
time frame in which he imagines that the guidance might reach members
of the Committee? It would be marvellous if I were allowed to take it
home to read
tonight.</div><a name="10011269000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000496"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> We anticipate introducing the guidance in
the autumn. I know that &#147;the autumn&#148; is a nebulous term,
but it will be in the autumn, and there will be a proper period of
consultation.</div><a name="10011269000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000497"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Whether this Minister or another introduces the
guidance, that assurance is very welcome. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the

Bill.</div><a name="10011269000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000498"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am most grateful to have the opportunity to
consider clause 2 in more depth. Most Bills have, I think, one
regulatory impact assessment, but rather confusingly, this Bill seems
to have attracted at least six&#151;I have lost count. One in
particular relates to clause 2. In clause 2(2) there is the
definition:</div><a name="10011269000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;Flood
risk&#146; means a risk in respect of
flood.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the moment, I am sure that we would all accept that the strongest risk
of flood is the likelihood of flooding as the snow and ice melt. I
would like to question the Minister on aspects of costs, and on who
might be expected to pick up the costs that flow from the aspect of
risk. We are talking in terms of a combination of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>probability of the occurrence and its potential consequences. I assume
that for insurance and scientific purposes, the Minister is looking
particularly at climate change and at what we can learn in that
regard.</div><a name="10011269000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
page 7 of the regulatory impact assessment relating to the new
definition of flood and coastal erosion risk management, we are told
that coastal erosion risk and coastal flood risk are closely
interrelated, and that there is a strong rationale for considering the
two issues together when decisions are taken about the management of
flooding and erosion. The information on page 8 of that assessment says
that using a valuation methodology promoted by DEFRA&#146;s ecosystem
approach, which is based on the value of goods and services provided by
habitats to human welfare, values for the types of coastal and wetland
habitats that might be typically created through flood and erosion
management range from &#163;200 to &#163;6,350 per hectare per
year, with typical mid-range indicative values of &#163;800 to
&#163;2,750.</div>
<a name="10011269000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those values
include carbon storage, pollution control functions, contributions to
fisheries and recreational benefits. We are further told that the
typical whole-life costs of creating such wetland habitats range from
&#163;15,000 to &#163;124,000 per hectare per 1,000 years, but we
are told that those benefits might include or be additional to any
functional benefit that the habitat provides in reducing flood
risk.</div>
<a name="10011269000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
taken by the idea of reducing risk, particularly as I believe that we
will have only a limited budget for the physical defence structures,
and there are currently some funds available for limiting risk from
various heads of EU funds. If the risk is to be reduced and wetlands
are to be created in that way, will the Minister explain how the costs
are to be met? I assume that the costs that I have just read
out&#151;the minimum is &#163;200, but they may be more than
&#163;6,000&#151;will fall to individual farmers and landowners.
Those are obviously mind-boggling figures. They are very large sums of
money indeed. Where are people meant to find that kind of
money?</div>
<a name="10011269000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2(4)
refers to the consequences of flooding
for</div><a name="10011269000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;human
health...the social and economic welfare of individuals and
communities...infrastructure, and...the environment
(including cultural
heritage).&#148;</div><a name="10011269000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
the Minister expand a little on those, as the explanatory notes do not
say a great deal about them? I know that the list is not meant to be
exhaustive, but with regard to cultural heritage in particular, what
other potential harmful consequences is the Department likely to bear
in mind when assessing
risk?</div><a name="10011269000192"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000499"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will first deal with the overall
approach to risk, which ties together the contributions that have just
been made. The clause defines risk as</div>
<a name="10011269000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the combination
of the probability of an occurrence with its potential
consequences.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011269000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It defines
&#147;flood risk&#148; as</div>
<a name="10011269000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a risk in
respect of flood&#148;,</div>
<a name="10011269000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">and &#147;coastal
erosion risk&#148; as</div>
<a name="10011269000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a risk in
respect of coastal erosion.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011269000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">It sets out the harmful
consequences to be considered in assessing those risks, but that list,
to be clear, is not exhaustive.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div><a name="10011269000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cheltenham rightly raised the issue of figures such as one
in 75 or 80 years, or one in 100 or 200 years, being bandied about; we
are seeing that happen again, even post-Cumbria. It is interesting to
discuss whether that is the right formula to present to the public. If
we say to a member of the public, &#147;This is a one-in-100-year
eventuality&#148;&#151;those are terms that we use&#151;they
would rightly say, &#147;Well, we now have a few years until it
happens again,&#148; yet probability, of course, means that such
events could happen in a series of years. If we said to someone that
the risk that they will be rained on when they go out their door is one
in 50, they would take a rain coat with them just in case. We need to
find a better way of explaining the risk to the
pubic.</div><a name="10011269000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to why we use the risk-based approach, the probability
approach and the &#147;one in x years&#148; terminology. In recent
years, most professionals involved in flood and coastal erosion risk
management have stopped using the return period terminology that we are
talking about. They refer instead to the annual probability&#151;the
chance of an event happening. Climate change will undoubtedly affect
the standard of protection provided by a scheme, and where a
probability is quoted, it is generally for the end of the expected
lifetime of any scheme, taking account of climate change.</div>
<a name="10011269000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
pointing out that both DEFRA and the Environment Agency&#151;the hon.
Member for Vale of York might want to comment on this point&#151;are
currently working on updated guidance. They constantly keep that under
review to take account of the projections published in the summer.
Initial findings show that the existing guidance is broadly accurate,
as a representation of likely future change, but we have to keep that
under
review.</div><a name="10011269000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must consider how we publicly present what the probabilities mean. The
list in subsection (4) is not exhaustive or limiting, but it is
intended to illustrate the broad range of impacts of flooding that
might typically be considered. Further guidance on assessment of risk
and appraisal projects will be provided to accompany the national
strategies for England and Wales. There will be an opportunity to feed
into that revision as we introduce the national
strategies.</div><a name="10011269000389"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="10011269000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to refer to aspects of cultural heritage. I do not want to be
exhaustive because I am not a Minister from the Department of Culture,
Media and Sport, but broadly speaking, we see it as referring to
examples such as historic sites, which would benefit from improved
defences whatever form those defences might take. There might also be
recreational benefits.</div>
<a name="10011269000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact
assessments we carry out on the defences we need and on our responses
to flooding and coastal inundation put prices on economic impact and
identify the costs to be funded. I am happy to explain the technical
detail of how we reach our conclusions.</div>
<a name="10011269000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Vale of York asked who would meet the costs of flooding. Let
me make it clear that the costs will always be met by Government when
they are delivered as part of a flood management programme. We have
made it clear that we want to see local innovation and input as well.
In some of the pilots we have launched 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>over the past six months, we said that we want to see local initiatives
and ideas because they can add value to the national
approach.</div><a name="10011269000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000500"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The point about the one in x years terminology is
that it is not only rather misleading&#151;we saw an extreme example
in Gloucestershire when there was a return not in a year or two but in
weeks&#151;but increasingly unreliable, not least because it is based
on historical data. When the baseline on which the historical data are
calculated is shifting and changing because of climate change, surely
there is a need for a different kind of
approach.</div><a name="10011269000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000501"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I would be interested to hear the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s views on that point, so perhaps he could write to me
with any ideas he has. We constantly keep the matter under review, and
we also consider what is happening with climate change and what it
means for the probability and likelihood of flooding events as well.
The current review shows that the broad analysis is correct at the
moment, but we must keep the matter constantly under review. There is
an opportunity for Committee members and others to have an input in the
process as we take it forward to sit alongside the national
strategy.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000502"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I beg to move amendment 3, in
clause 3, page 2, line 33, before

&#145;re-instating&#146;.</div><a name="10011269000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000503"></a>The

following: amendment 4, in
schedule 2, page 39,  line 35, after
&#145;of&#146;, insert
&#145;re-instating&#146;.</div><a name="10011269000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000504"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Amendments 3, 4, 5 and 6 all serve the same
purpose and underline an opportunity to improve land and water
management at the same time as reducing the risk of flooding. The
importance of the word &#147;re-instating&#148; as opposed to
&#147;restoring&#148; was explained to me by the Woodland Trust. It
said that if someone is to restore an historic oil painting, they work
on the original, repairing damage. If they are to reinstate an historic
oil painting, it implies that the original is lost or destroyed and
they need to create a new version that is the equivalent of the lost
one. The concepts, therefore, are different.</div>
<a name="10011269000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
nice to see the possibility of reinstatement included in the Bill. The
best example is woodland recreation, which comes from the Woodland
Trust. It points out that woodland is more effective at retaining water
than other kinds of landscape, such as grassland,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>and that it can lead to a 10 to 20 per cent. reduction in flooding.
Woodland delays the flow of flood waters downhill to the flood plain
and so reduces flooding and harm to properties and structures on the
flood plain.</div>
<a name="10011269000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Woodland
obviously has other benefits; it prevents soil erosion and can be a
source of sustainable biomass. It is therefore a genuinely sustainable
energy source. That is an example of how good water management can tie
in with good management of the landscape, a positive approach to
biodiversity and so on.</div>
<a name="10011269000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Woodland is
only one example of things that could be reinstated. I imagine that it
would take a long time to reinstate peat bog, but there are other
opportunities, such as natural wetlands and river banks. Whole water
channels could be reinstated. This is a good opportunity to reinforce
the possible ecological credentials of the Bill and to set out the
Government&#146;s firm intention&#151;I think it was set out in
their water strategy, &#147;Making Space for Water,&#148; and
reinforced by the organisation Blueprint for Water&#151;to work with
nature and the landscape to seek opportunities to meet other
environmental objectives alongside the simple one of reducing
flood
risk.</div><a name="10011269000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000505"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> It is always a delight to serve under your astute
chairmanship, Mr. Chope&#151;I hope that in the future we
can at least warm up a bit. I want to raise one simple point and I use
this group of amendments to take that opportunity. The matter is
something about which other colleagues and I have been asking for some
time. We are fortunate to have a DEFRA Minister leading on the Bill, as
I wish to ask whether we can use the single farm payment more
effectively to do the sort of things the hon. Member for Cheltenham has
mentioned about landowners having a reasoned approach and being willing
to allow their land to flood deliberately or being encouraged to use
their land in such a way that we can restore wetlands or develop
natural balancing tanks. I am concerned that we are spending all this
time on legislation when the real changes we want to see relate to the
implications of using existing policies more effectively.</div>
<a name="10011269000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to hear from the Minister on that because, certainly in terms of
coastal flooding, there are good examples of single farm payments
supporting landowners who face the reality that their land will
sometimes be unusable because it will flood. Such an approach protects
property or other land that seems to be more valuable. I hope the
Minister will say something about that when he sums up and that he will
say how the legislation will encourage and catalyse the sort of things
that the EFRA Committee has long been arguing for, as he knows.
Although it has not just been me who has argued for such things, I was
one of the instigators, as he will no doubt
remember.</div><a name="10011269000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000506"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I welcome this debate, because it is
important and it gives me the opportunity to put on the record the fact
that we consider the cause of reinstatement a valuable contribution of
the Bill, and to explain why it can be delivered within the clauses we
have at present. We too want the matter to be dealt with&#151;let me
be categorical about
that.</div><a name="10011269000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and his colleague have tabled a
series of amendments  that affect provisions where the Bill
lists things that might be done in the course of flood or
coastal  erosion risk management. The amendments would affect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>subsection (3)(b) in clause 3 and paragraphs 24, 29
and 47 of schedule 2. The schedule amends other Acts, which
means that the amendments would affect the definition of risk
management not only in this Bill, but in the Coast Protection Act 1949,
the Land Drainage Act 1991 and the Water Resources Act
1991.</div><a name="10011269000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
phrase</div><a name="10011269000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;maintaining
or restoring natural
processes&#148;</div><a name="10011269000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
in the Bill and each of the Acts as an example of a thing that may be
done as part of risk management. The amendment would add the word
&#147;re-instating&#148; in each instance, so that the phrase is
changed to read, &#147;re-instating, maintaining or restoring natural
processes&#148;. In each instance, the list is intended to provide
illustrative examples of things that may be done; it is not an
exhaustive catalogue of things that are
permitted.</div><a name="10011269000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy to agree that re-instating natural processes might usefully be
done in the course of managing flood and erosion risk. Let me give one
example, because we are not waiting for the Bill to get on with it.
Following the Pitt review, a working group was formed, including the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Natural England,
our principal adviser, to look at shoreline management plans and to
ensure that, wherever possible, natural processes were given careful
consideration as the way forward. We are already going along these
lines, as the hon. Member for Cheltenham
knows.</div><a name="10011269000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is not necessary because the Bill, as currently drafted,
already allows natural processes to be reinstated, and we would want
that to happen where appropriate. Inserting the word
&#147;re-instating&#148; would have no useful direct effect. For
all intents and purposes, I can confirm that
&#147;re-instating&#148; is synonymous with
&#147;restoring&#148;. On that basis, I ask the hon. Member for
Brecon and Radnorshire not to press the amendment, because the Bill
already enables the function that the amendment seeks to be carried
out.</div><a name="10011269000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn to a matter that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud has
raised previously in Committee and in debates on the Floor of the
House. What we do with a combination of payments to farmers, whether
through single farm payments, the uplands changing landscape scheme, or
other stewardship schemes, is important because of the contribution
that such things can make to wider land management issues, including
flood risk management. When walking on top of the Plynlimon hills in
Wales, the source of the Wye and the Severn, it is possible to see what
can be done up there in terms of allowing the land to be
rewetted&#151;not with the Woodland Trust in this instance, but with
the Wildlife Trust, with which I have been up on those
hills&#151;thereby contributing significantly to the management of
flood risk further down. Our incentives in respect of uplands
stewardship schemes can recognise that, which is important. We seek to
do more in that regard, working with farmers and
landowners.</div><a name="10011269000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
regard reinstating as important and we are moving ahead with it in
practice. The word &#147;restoring&#148;, as used in the Bill,
gives the opportunity for reinstating as well. I hope that the hon.
Member for Cheltenham will ask leave to withdraw the amendment, which
has been useful in allowing us to probe the Government&#146;s
intention and that of our agencies in interpreting the clause.
Reinstatement is important for the way
forward.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000507"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s remarks
and accept them in the spirit in which they are intended. There is
slight frustration in Bill Committees because, occasionally, we come
across amendments that seem to be well enough drafted and are accepted
by all parties but the Government seem incapable of going through the
mental process of accepting them, even though it might help and put
things beyond doubt if they accepted an Opposition amendment as drafted
just once in a while. Doing so would be good for their
soul.</div><a name="10011269000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyway,
on this occasion the Minister has been explicit and said that he
accepts that reinstatement is within the remit of flood risk management
work, as set out in the Bill. I hope that explicit statement is enough
and that in future someone making a grant application for a
reinstatement scheme is not told by a grant-making body that their
scheme does not fall within the scope of the Bill. That would be the
practical result of not making such things clear enough. I
optimistically hope that will not be so, but look forward to quoting
the Minister&#146;s remarks in Committee, should that eventuality
ever
arise.</div><a name="10011269000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000510"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Amendment 85 would insert into the list of things
that can be done in the cause of flood or coastal erosion risk
management a more specific approach to managing the natural landscape
on a landscape scale. That is on a similar theme to other amendments we
have discussed. It would
include</div><a name="10011269000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;managing
the use of land, natural habitats, woodland and other natural landscape
features with the result of reducing flood risk or reducing
erosion&#148;.</div><a name="10011269000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is interesting to note the use of the word &#147;result&#148;
rather than &#147;aim&#148;. The aim in most cases of good land use
and the management of natural habitats is not reducing flood risk, but
a wider environmental objective such as the increase of biodiversity or
the provision of a pleasant landscape in which people can enjoy
recreation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div><a name="10011269000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
another opportunity to reinforce the use of the natural landscape as a
means of reducing risk in an holistic and sustainable way. It is not
just waterways in the landscape that are seen to have an impact; water
passes through the whole landscape. Therefore, land use in general can
have an impact. Woodlands are one example and agricultural land is
another. Such uses should all be recognised explicitly as contributing
to the management of flood
risk.</div><a name="10011269000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1 would do a similar job, but it leaves out the vague terminology of
clause 7 and
includes</div><a name="10011269000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;landscape
scale objectives, including how the strategy will protect biodiversity,
semi-natural habitats and encourage native woodland
creation.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a slight risk that other environmental objectives of the kind
referred to in passing in clause 7(2)(j) are often these days reduced
to CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions and that we think only of climate change.
However, it is important to set out other possible environmental
objectives. We have tried to expand on that provision to define what
such landscape scale objectives might be. They could be to protect
biodiversity and semi-natural habitats such as hedgerows and native
woodlands, or to encourage native woodland
creation.</div><a name="10011269000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the Woodland Trust for advising us on the amendment. It
pointed
out:</div><a name="10011269000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Individual
tree planting and woodland creation is a crucial component of landscape
scale action. In relation to water management these new woods could
mitigate flooding whilst contributing to wider environmental
objectives. Indeed, the evidence shows that woodland creation
alleviates flooding and reduces flood risk whilst conferring a range of
other benefits to the environment and landowner. For small floods,
woodland has a greater flooding reduction effect than other habitats
such as grassland. Modelling also suggests that woodland can mitigate
large flood events on floodplains by absorbing and delaying flood
flows...</div><a name="10011269000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">Certain
simple amendments to the Flood and Water Management Bill could help
ensure that landscape scale opportunities are scoped and implemented in
the future. The Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management strategies
could encourage government&#151;national, regional and
local&#151;and its agencies to investigate the opportunities for
landscape scale actions such as native woodland creation and the
protection of semi-natural
habitats.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
use of the phrase &#147;landscape scale&#148; is significant
because much of what comes under the Bill, particularly the provisions
on local flood risk management strategies, is reduced to local
authority areas. Some existing planning law, such as PPS25 with which
the hon. Member for Tewkesbury and others will be familiar, narrows
down the consideration even further to individual sites. That makes it
difficult to look at the landscape as a whole and at the opportunities
for managing water in it. One of our objectives in discussing the Bill
is to try to broaden its scope at planning level to look at the whole
landscape and the way in which it treats water. This is an important
amendment and I would like to hear the Minister&#146;s response to
it. Amendment 2 was tabled on exactly the same basis and does the same
thing to clause 8, which refers to
Wales.</div><a name="10011269000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000511"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I do not automatically resist all
amendments; I hope that I will show that as the Committee progresses. I
will listen to all hon. Members, and we will explore where I think
there is a good legislative opportunity. Let me also turn that on its
head and say that, sometimes, I will try to explain why legislation may
not be necessary. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>I am a pragmatic and sometimes reluctant legislator. If we can clearly
address issues within the legislation available, maybe the hon.
Gentleman will agree with
me.</div><a name="10011269000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I pay tribute to the hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Brecon and
Radnorshire and to the Woodland Trust for inspiring debate on this
important issue? The amendments are interesting and would strongly
direct the national strategy towards emphasising the protection of
biodiversity, the saving of natural habitats and the creation of native
woodland. I acknowledge that there are strong links and, in some cases,
critical dependencies between the way in which we manage flood and
erosion risk and the state of some aspects of the natural environment.
That is absolutely clear. Indeed, flood and coastal erosion risk
management has had, and continues to have, a profound impact on the
biological and geological diversity of coastal, river and wetland
environments. I also acknowledge that the creation and
protection of semi-natural habitats and woodlands can have clear flood
management benefits. In that respect, I have a great deal of sympathy
with what the hon. Member for Cheltenham seeks to achieve with the
amendments. I will, however, explain why it is not necessary
to accept them.</div>
<a name="10011269000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aspects
of the natural environment that the amendments focus on are not the
whole picture. In fact, there could be more. Clause 3(3)
lists</div><a name="10011269000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;examples
of things that might be done in the course of
flood...management&#148;.</div><a name="10011269000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is therefore an illustrative list of examples. It is not meant to be an
exhaustive catalogue of things that are permitted. Furthermore, if I
accepted the amendments, there could be unnecessary duplication with
maintaining or restoring natural processes, which is already on the
list in clause
3(3)(b).</div><a name="10011269000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000512"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The distinction is between a process and a
feature. Land use and the management of natural landscape features are
not necessarily the same as managing a
process.</div><a name="10011269000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000513"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed, I understand the distinction, but
let me explain further. The hon. Gentleman touched on the desirability
of working at landscape scales as well as simply building defences, and
on the need to contribute to sustainability and environmental
objectives; we fully agree. However, the need to contribute to
sustainability through flood and erosion risk management functions is
already covered by clause 27, which centres on sustainable development.
For the record, clause 27(1) notes
that</div><a name="10011269000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
authority listed in subsection (3) must aim to make a contribution
towards the achievement of sustainable
development.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover,
section 4 of the Environment Act 1995, centring on the aims and
objectives of the Environment Agency, also covers the
issue.</div><a name="10011269000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
matters, and the desirability of using natural habitats and landscape
features, will be better reinforced by the guidance that will result
from the Bill rather than by their inclusion in the Bill itself. It
already has them bolted down, but we also need to introduce the
guidance, which will provide an opportunity to flesh out, much more
than the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment would, the sort of
possibilities that we envisage. For example, I would expect
objectives for water quality and the historic environment, including
creation of woodland. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>One of the best days that I had last summer, going into the autumn, was
with the Woodland Trust, looking at and searching for ancient trees
with its volunteers&#151;that is part of our cultural and historic
environment as well. I would expect such things to be given due
consideration in the national
strategy.</div><a name="10011269000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
while I would expect the strategy to address what contribution flood
and erosion risk management might make to creating and restoring
natural habitats where appropriate, I would not want to single out
native woodland over and above, say, wetlands or coastal habitats,
which might even have a more direct connection in certain areas with
how flooding and erosion is managed. We need to think wider, which is
where the guidance gives us the opportunity. Through the guidance
we&#151;the loyal rather than the royal &#147;we&#148;, including
the Committee&#151;can be more specific in steering the types of
contributions that the flood and erosion risk management strategy might
make to achieving wider environmental objectives. I suspect that is
what hon. Members are trying to tease out and what the Woodland Trust
is trying to get
at.</div><a name="10011269000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are bound to be strong links between the management of flood and
erosion risk and environmental objectives for the foreseeable future.
However, we cannot foresee all details or all priorities, so it is
better to keep the requirement on the face of the Bill to specify how
the strategy should contribute to the achievement of the wider
environmental objectives without specifying here and now what could be
a narrower set of objectives. I have expressed my great sympathy with
the objectives of the proposers of the amendment and illustrated how we
can deal with such objectives. For all those reasons I ask the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011269000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000514"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I must admit that I am not entirely sure I follow
the ministerial logic. If the list is explicitly not exhaustive, as he
stressed, I do not see how adding to it can limit it&#151;that may be
a logical discussion to be had
elsewhere.</div><a name="10011269000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept from the Minister&#146;s remarks, which were positive about
landscape scale objectives and the management of natural features as
well as processes, that the Government&#146;s heart seems to be in
the right place. I slightly regret that they do not feel able to make
that explicit in the Bill, but perhaps we shall have to return to the
specific definition of &#147;sustainable development&#148; to which
he referred. The Sustainable Development Commission has at times been
rather frustrated with the way in which the objectives of sustainable
development have been mangled by various Departments&#151;I am sure
his is not one of them. Given the good intentions expressed, I am
content to beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011269000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000517"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I would like to make some general points about
the clause in a small stand part debate, so I shall limit my remarks to
amendment 7.</div><a name="10011269000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pitt
recommendations were clear. In recommendation 16 he called on local
authorities
to</div><a name="10011269000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;collate
and map the main flood risk management and drainage assets (over and
underground), including a record of their ownership and
condition&#148;,</div><a name="10011269000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">while
recommendation 17
was:</div><a name="10011269000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;All
relevant organisations should have a duty to share information and
cooperate with local authorities and the Environment Agency to
facilitate the management of flood
risk.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recommendation
90
specified:</div><a name="10011269000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;All
upper tier local authorities should establish Oversight and Scrutiny
Committees to review work by public sector bodies and essential service
providers in order to manage flood risk, underpinned by a legal
requirement to cooperate and share
information.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of amendment 7 is to specify especially when items of
information, in particular the mapping, have been prepared, that under
the duty set out in terms of examples in clause 3(3)(i) to prepare,
gather and
disseminate</div><a name="10011269000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;maps,

pm</div><a name="10011269000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
points about this have been made on the Floor of the House, but they
might have escaped the Minister&#146;s attention, because it is
always said that if someone 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>wants to keep a secret, it should be said on the Floor of the House as
it will not go any further. However, I want to explore to what intent
and purposes the mapping by Ordnance Survey will be made widely
available and how the information will be posted. The most advanced
mapping is undertaken by the Environment Agency and the Met Office. A
certain amount of mapping of properties is done by districts. The
mapping of highways is done by county councils. Unitaries undertake
both, while a certain amount of modelling and mapping is done by
insurance companies. The idea of inserting in the clause the phrase
&#147;to all interested parties&#148; is to emphasise the point
that, for example, when the National Flood Forum holds meetings after
flood events, it does not always invite insurance companies along. That
just seems plain daft. If all the interested parties are to be brought
together, all the relevant ones should be there and obviously insurance
companies have a role to
play.</div><a name="10011269000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have raised the issue of confidentiality elsewhere, and it goes without
saying that the information that we believe should be shared must
respect that confidentiality. However, when the information and mapping
has been gleaned by public funded bodies such as the Environment
Agency, the Met Office, Ordnance Survey and, to a certain extent,
districts and counties, we want to know why it is currently not being
shared and what measures under clause 3(3)(i) the Minister is proposing
to take to ensure that it will indeed be
shared.</div><a name="10011269000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for recommendation 90, we were told in the December progress report
that it is covered by the Bill. The Minister would help me enormously
if he told me where such information was
located.</div><a name="10011269000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
sum up, the purpose of the modest amendment is to press the Minister on
what measures he intends to take to make sure that all the maps, plans,
surveys and other information are reaching the right
people.</div><a name="10011269000267"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000518"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Vale of York
for explaining her amendment, because until she did so just now, my
main criticism was that it seemed a wee bit vague. I was not quite
clear who the interested parties were or how information was to be
disseminated to them. I imagined lawyers or all sorts of people who
claimed to be interested parties having a field day with the amendment,
if it were accepted, by saying that they had not been
consulted.</div><a name="10011269000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the hon. Lady has raised an important issue that gets to the heart of
some of the measures that relate to insurance and information that we
might be discussing later in our proceedings. I understand that already
in existence are inundation maps that reveal the risk of surface water
flooding as well as the more common river flooding maps. They are not
at the moment shared with the general public or insurance companies,
but with more professional consultees such as local authority finance
departments.</div><a name="10011269000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
potential threat is posed by revealing some information. Not everyone
wants to hear the information that their house faces a flood risk, as
that would pose a threat to their house price, their insurance premiums
and the excesses they are charged. It would create other issues
relating to insurance and might even threaten the resale of the house.
However, it would be wrong for that information to be disseminated to
insurance companies, for instance, while their policyholders could not
get 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>hold of it. The hon. Lady&#146;s amendment raises a critical issue,
and I will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s reply before
passing judgment on
it.</div><a name="10011269000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000519"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The amendment is useful as it teases out
such issues, and I thank the hon. Member for Vale of York for tabling
it. The amendment would add &#147;to all interested parties&#148;
after</div>
<a name="10011269000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;preparing,
gathering and disseminating maps, plans, surveys and other
information&#148;</div>
<a name="10011269000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">in the list of examples
of things that might be done under clause 3. Amendment 91 would require
the national flood and coastal erosion management strategy in England
to specify a single communication about flooding for all members of the
public.</div><a name="10011269000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
amendment 7 emphasises the need to disseminate information to
interested parties, it is not critical to ensuring that that happens.
The list to which the amendment applies is an example of what might be
done in the course of flood and coastal erosion risk management. The
clause does not need refining in that way to ensure that interested
parties receive information. Best practice on engagement with
stakeholders and consultation will be addressed better through the
national strategy or the accompanying guidance, which will contain
great scope to explore and explain fully what is required in respect of
disseminated
information.</div><a name="10011269000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
a body that prepares and gathers maps, plans, surveys or other
information and does not at least disseminate it to interested
parties&#151;who vary from situation to situation, as the hon. Member
for Cheltenham said&#151;will be at risk of challenge for failing to
act reasonably in discharging its functions. That will also encourage
bodies to do the right thing in terms of disseminating information.
There are drivers for ensuring that the information is properly
disseminated.</div><a name="10011269000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision as drafted does not suggest any limitation to the
dissemination of information; a body may go further. If appropriate,
bearing in mind what the hon. Gentleman said, it could make that
information available generally and not just to the interested parties
specified. Amendment 7 could cast doubt on that by suggesting some
limitation. There is no limitation in the Bill as drafted. If it is
felt that maps or information are useful and could be distributed more
widely, there is no reason why they should not be. The Bill will allow
that to happen.</div>
<a name="10011269000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 91
would require the national flood and coastal erosion management
strategy in England to specify a single communication route for all
members of the public concerned about flooding. To deal with one aspect
of that suggestion, the Government and the Environment Agency are
working to ensure that the national Floodline, of which hon. Members
will be aware, becomes the single point of contact for members of the
public concerned about flooding. Another aspect is that the Environment
Agency now routinely provides information, including flood maps, on its
website. We are starting to do that work already, so there is no need
to legislate for it. It is already in train as a result of the Pitt
review, which can be fleshed out in both national strategy and
guidance.</div>
<a name="10011269000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the
question understandably asked by the hon. Member for Vale of York, our
recent Pitt update showed the progress being made on aspects 90 and 91.
Aspect 90 says:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div><a name="10011269000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;All

Committees to review work by public sector bodies and essential service
providers in order to manage flood
risk&#148;.</div><a name="10011269000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was highlighted that that would be covered in the Bill. I refer the
hon. Lady and Committee members to paragraph 54 of schedule 2, which
gives provision to do so. It is within the Bill, and we are taking it
forward.</div><a name="10011269000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
aspect, in terms of data, is that we have  a pan-Government
agreement&#151;a PGA. It provides Government bodies such as the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Environment
Agency, Natural England and so on with access to core mapping data from
a number of suppliers, including Ordnance Survey. The PGA is managed on
behalf of the Government by the Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government.</div>
<a name="10011269000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
has tabled a good, intelligent amendment to allow her to probe for such
information. We can do a lot more in guidance and in the strategy, and
work is already under way, but we do not want to limit what can be
done. A future Minister might say to the Environment Agency or others,
&#147;Why not make that great information available to
everyone?&#148; As the Bill is currently drafted, we can do
so.</div>
<a name="10011269000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000520"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Will the Minister elaborate on why information
from Ordnance Survey is so freely in the public domain, but not that
from the Environment Agency or the Met
Office?</div><a name="10011269000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000521"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Lady makes a good point. I think
that we can do more. Certainly the Secretary of State and I have had
discussions on increasing the intelligence and quality of the
data.</div>
<a name="10011269000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cheltenham made the observation that&#151;although not due
to reluctance on the part of the Government&#151;it is not always
appropriate to swamp everyone with every piece of information. The
right piece of information needs to be put in the right place so that
it is understandable and usable. There is further scope for that, and
the Bill as drafted will allow us to do more. On that basis, I ask the
hon. Member for Vale of York to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="10011269000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000522"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I neglected to refer to amendment 91
earlier, so I shall speak to it briefly. It underlines a point made by
the National Flood Forum. It is important that the public should have a
single point of contact for flooding. I detect from the
Minister&#146;s remarks that he expects the national Floodline to be
that contact point. That would be reassuring.</div>
<a name="10011269000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister assure us that the sort of examples that I gave in my opening
remarks will not occur when phoning the national Floodline&#151;that
there will be no categories of flooding for which people will be told
that it is the wrong kind of water or the wrong sort of flood, or that
it is ground water more than a certain number of millimetres below
ground level? Will he confirm that the national Floodline is intended
to be a comprehensive service designed to provide a single point of
contact that can be important for those who find themselves in a
situation of real distress and confusion? It is important that they are
given clear, straightforward, simple answers to their
questions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div><a name="10011269000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000523"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed. The important point is to whom the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents should speak if their house is
flooded, no matter what causes it. The Environment Agency provides a
national Floodline, but we are planning to enhance the service in order
to provide a one-stop shop. Through it, home owners and businesses will
be provided with information on all forms of flooding that are relevant
to their location.</div>
<a name="10011269000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will also
be providing for local authorities to investigate flooding
incidents&#151;in the past it has not always been clear who is
responsible&#151;for the publication of information and for the
compilation of a register of flood and coastal erosion risk management
assets to ensure that there is clarity of responsibility. That should
mean that local authorities can also deal with queries from local
residents. We see the national Floodline as a one-stop
shop.</div>
<a name="10011269000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000524"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The Ordnance Survey, like the Met Office, might
fall under a different Department. However, in a spirit of
co-operation, and because we can return to some of these matters later,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000526"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> New clause 25 basically requires the
Environment Agency to submit a formal objection to any large or medium
scale planning application that is proposed for land designated as
being a flood risk. I also want to define medium and large scale, which
could mean the building of more than 10 houses or the building of a
public commercial industrial unit covering an area larger than half an
acre. Just as importantly, I should like to discuss what flood risk
means.</div><a name="10011269000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had considerable debate on that already this morning, when we
tried to define what &#147;flood&#148; meant, although I do not
think that we reached any satisfactory conclusion, and we discussed
what risk means and what risk management means. I shall try to go a
little bit further in my amendment. An area should be designated as
being a flood risk if there is evidence of its having flooded in the
past, meaning that water has rested on the surface of the land or just
below its surface&#151;I do not intend to go over the arguments that
were made before&#151;or if the Environment Agency, in consultation
with the local planning authority, has reason to believe that the area
might be subjected to flooding in future, or if the local planning
authority or the Environment Agency are of the opinion that building on
a section of land would be likely to increase the risk of other pieces
of land flooding as a result of water displacement. That is an
important
point.</div><a name="10011269000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause goes to the heart of what we are doing here today&#151;and
this week and next week&#151;which is to protect houses, businesses
and public services from flooding. Some of my remarks may stray into
what might be considered to be responsibilities of the Department for
Communities and Local Government, which is inevitable when we discuss
such a
Bill.</div><a name="10011269000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am particularly concerned because we often hear that flood-risk areas
are protected by PPS25. I do not accept that argument, having looked at
it, studied it and seen how it works. Yes, it says that building should
not take place in flood-risk areas, but it qualifies that considerably
and allows building to take place in flood-risk areas using the
exceptional tests. It is a matter of opinion what amounts to an
exceptional test or, indeed, an
exception.</div><a name="10011269000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against
that background, I want to talk a little bit about what I am really
concerned about, which I mentioned briefly earlier: the regional
spatial strategy for the south-west, which is not finalised yet. We
have had 35,000 representations on that strategy: I think that you will
be familiar with some of those, Mr. Chope. In my
constituency alone, that strategy proposes to increase housing by about
40 per cent., as I mentioned earlier, adding another 14,500 or so
houses to the stock of roughly 40,000 houses in my area. I could talk
about why I feel that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>those projections are flawed, but you may pull me up if I go too far
down that road, Mr. Chope. For example, the projections are
based on growth forecasts, although it is difficult to predict what the
growth in the economy will be this year, never mind over the next 16
years, and it assumes that building should take place in principal
urban areas rather than scattering it around to villages that might
want some housing. Any projections of that nature are flawed. I also
object to its being drawn up regionally, rather than democratically and
locally. There are many objections to the RSS system and the way in
which it is put together. In essence, I am concerned because where on
earth are we going to find the space for those houses in an area that
is obviously and clearly a flood-risk area? Should we have to find that
many houses? Surely, we should be sensitive about what happened in
2007.</div><a name="10011269000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cheltenham is correct to mention not only July 2007,
but June 2007, which leads me to a good example of flooding that he
will be familiar with. In June 2007, which was, just to remind
Committee members, a month before the big flood, I visited some houses
in Prestbury, close to Prestbury Park race course, which is often
referred to as Cheltenham race course although it is in my constituency
not the hon. Gentleman&#146;s&#151;and long may that be so. The
residents told me that they had lived there for 40 years and had never
known there to be a flood. I found that curious, but then I started to
think about it and analyse it and realised that two things had happened
that could&#151;I do not know for sure&#151;have contributed to the
flood. One was that something like 150 houses had been built further up
the hill just above Prestbury, at a place called Noverton lane. That
was a controversial development, on what were previously green fields
that could soak up the water. There was some concern about whether the
run-off from the houses would send the water down the hill into
Prestbury, and that it would be called a flood. I shall
perhaps not go too far into this here because I am sure that we will
come back to it: two culverts were placed in Prestbury some years ago
but not joined up. Why on earth not, I do not know, but that obviously
worsened the flooding, and one of the culverts had been damaged and not
repaired, which made it even worse. That relates slightly to a separate
amendment, but the fact that the houses were built on the top of that
hill must have contributed to Prestbury&#146;s flooding, even though
the new development supposedly had new drainage systems that would take
care of the run-off. In that case they did
not.</div><a name="10011269000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was in June 2007; those very same people were flooded again in July
2007. The hon. Gentleman talked about the perhaps inappropriate use
these days of the concept of probability of flood risk. Those people
might have been told, &#147;This is a one-in-250-years flood&#148;;
it was two in one month. I do not think that we can continue to use
that concept, that we can say that July 2007 was a one-in-250-years or
a one-in-1,000-years event. We have not been measuring flooding for
that long. Also, every single day of our lives we are rightly told
about the dangers from climate change and about how global warming will
cause the weather to be very different, unpredictable and more extreme.
I understand that, and the evidence is that that will be the case.
However, we cannot use that argument one minute and the next say that
this is a one-in-100-years or a one-in-5,000-years flood. We cannot put
both those arguments 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>forward at the same time. My point is that we have to take the weather
conditions over the past few years very seriously, and not simply write
them off and say that it is very unlikely that they will happen again.
It happened again this year, not in my area but up in the north-west,
where we saw some terrible flood damage. Again, I read on the front of
<i class="I">T</i><i class="I">he Times</i> that that was a one-in-1,000-years rainfall.
Has rainfall been studied for the past 1,000 years? I doubt
it. Can the next 1,000 years be predicted? I doubt it. That simply is
not the way to address the problem. We have to be very careful about
where we build
houses.</div><a name="10011269000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the 2007 flooding, there was a development up Bredon road, which is
just going out of Tewkesbury. Houses that were being built at that time
flooded. Shortly afterwards there was another application from a
developer to build even more houses up that road. It is absolutely
unbelievable that anyone should want to do that, with total disregard
for the people living there, and for anybody who was likely to be
flooded as a result of taking up green fields. I want to stress how
important the theory of water displacement is. My concern is not only
about whether the new houses will flood, although that is an important
consideration, partly because of the difficulty there would be in
getting insurance&#151;on Second Reading and in the evidence session
last week, we heard some examples of how that has become very
difficult&#151;it is about the damage that they will cause to nearby
houses. I spoke earlier about how building in a place called Longford
in my constituency will make the flood problem worse for other people
as well. That is the case in many different areas in my constituency.
Only yesterday I had a call from a developer who wants to build on
green fields that were identified by the regional spatial strategy.
They got terribly upset because I was quoted in the local newspaper as
saying that the land floods, and that building on the land would cause
other houses to flood. Let them be upset; it is a fact. People have
seen water on the land and nearby houses flood, and for that reason it
would be very inappropriate to build in those areas.</div>
<a name="10011269000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many
cases, the Environment Agency does not object sufficiently strongly or
as often as it should. When we were discussing floodwater on or just
below the surface, I gave an example of when the agency said to me that
it had not objected to a particular planning application because the
water was below the surface. However, it should have objected to that
application because if it goes ahead it will cause more
problems.</div>
<a name="10011269000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes&#151;it
is only a fairly small number of cases percentage wise but the impact
is important&#151;the advice of the EA is ignored. The new clause
cannot go as far as to correct that because it would be beyond the
scope of the Bill, but the EA should carry out an assessment throughout
England and Wales to determine which areas of land will flood. Although
it can be assisted by local authorities, the job is not as big as it
might appear. The EA should designate certain areas as flood risks if
they qualify under the items that I have listed. Then it should submit
a formal objection through planning applications. I understand that
that may not prevent some applications from going ahead, but it will
give a very serious message to developers. Quite often, such matters
are determined on appeal. If the Environment Agency is objecting and
sending in an objection to the planning inspectors it should carry some
weight.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="10011269000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
my new clause will not necessarily stop all inappropriate development
and that it is difficult to define flood risk, as we saw in an earlier
debate. It is difficult to frame in legislation what should really be
common sense. People who live in such areas, who are flooded and who
have visited those who are flooded know whether building should take
place in those areas. It is difficult to write it down. I have spent
far longer framing this new clause than I have spent speaking on it,
but that is probably the nature of this kind of thing.</div>
<a name="10011269000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister treat this new clause seriously and sympathetically because it
is a very important matter for the people in my constituency? The
Secretary of State was extremely helpful at the time of the floods.
I have heard him say of London, &#147;We are in a
flood-risk area here, and yet we still have to have building.&#148; I
do not think that the analogy is accurate or useful. It is very
different in the area in which I live.</div>
<a name="10011269000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
earlier touched on the water table. He said that it was very high and
that it did not take a huge amount of rainfall to cause further
flooding. Much of my constituency is underwater several times a year to
the extent that sometimes we do not even notice it. Such is the danger
that one can drive past flooded fields without even noticing. My
concern is that if we continue to build on green fields that would
otherwise soak up water it will cause a great many more problems for
the people who not only buy those houses but already live
there.</div>
<a name="10011269000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">We suffered
terribly in the floods of 2007. It was an absolute nightmare. People
were out of their houses for more than a year. Men, women, children,
the ill and the elderly had to live in caravans over Christmas and
through the winter. It was a terrible
situation.</div><a name="10011269000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand in Tewkesbury&#151;we live where two rivers, the Avon and
the Severn, come together&#151;that things will be difficult and that
we will have floods now and again, but we are saying,
&#147;Let&#146;s not make it worse unnecessarily.&#148; That is
the spirit behind the new clause. Thank
you.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000527"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am pleased to be following my neighbour the
hon. Member for Tewkesbury on this subject. I do not have designs on
many parts of his constituency, but the gentle slopes of Prestbury Park
is one part that I might covet. I point out to him that the race course
is officially known as Cheltenham race course.</div>
<a name="10011269000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">With new
clause 25, the hon. Gentleman raises an important issue that we have
addressed in new clauses 7 and 8. I regard the matter as so important
that should new clauses 7 and 8 fall&#151;and I will press them to a
vote&#151;I will happily support new clause 25 as an alternative,
although it addresses the issue in a slightly different way. It tries
to define high flood risk, whereas new clause 7 commands the Secretary
of State to produce the definition. Either way, we need that
definition, because Sir Michael Pitt rightly concluded in his
report:</div><a name="10011269000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Development
control is a central part of the process of managing flood risk, by
avoiding development in risk areas where possible and, where such
building does take place, by ensuring that risk is reduced both to the
development itself and for those living nearby. Planners and developers
must pay proper regard to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>the risks, as should those purchasing properties. We believe that the
latest Government guidance&#151;PPS25&#151;should deliver this, and
that it should be strengthened if it does
not.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
practical experience, to which the hon. Member for Tewkesbury referred,
and which is also my experience, is that PPS25 is simply not up to the
job. Recommendation 7 of the Pitt report is:</div>
<a name="10011269000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
should be a presumption against building in high flood risk areas, in
accordance with PPS25, including giving consideration to all sources of
flood risk, and ensuring that developers make a full contribution to
the costs both of building and maintaining any necessary
defences.&#148;</div><a name="10011269000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is simply
not happening. Given that PPS25 is failing, we need to introduce the
presumption against building in high flood risk areas into the Bill
by  other means. New clauses 7 and 8 are designed to do
that.</div><a name="10011269000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 7 is designed to provide for the way in which high flood risk
areas are defined, to include not simply areas at risk from river
flooding, as currently defined by the Environment Agency and its maps,
but those at risk from the various forms of flooding that we have
already discussed, including ground water and, most importantly,
surface water flooding, which was responsible for a great deal of the
property flooding in my constituency in
2007.</div><a name="10011269000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall give a precise example, which neatly illustrates why PPS25 fails
so completely. First, PPS25 is far too site-specific, in that it
narrows the consideration down to whether net surface run-off and other
considerations are being addressed on the specific site of a particular
planning application. It does not look at the landscape as a whole or
allow for the consideration of flooding being exacerbated elsewhere,
especially in an extreme flood event, and it certainly does not do what
Sir Michael Pitt asked, which is
ensure</div><a name="10011269000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
developers make a full contribution to the costs both of building and
maintaining any necessary defences.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011269000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I gave an
example on Second Reading of a neighbourhood&#151;which is partly in
my constituency but, at the moment, most of it is in the hon. Member
for Tewkesbury&#146;s constituency&#151;called Warden Hill. It is
downhill of another neighbourhood called Leckhampton, which, again,
straddles the constituency boundary between our two seats. There was
recently an exercise to examine flood risk in that area and to look at
how the 40 or 50 properties that flooded in Warden Hill in
2007 could be protected. Consultants for Cheltenham borough council did
a detailed analysis of the whole landscape. They went beyond Warden
Hill and looked at Leckhamption, and produced some interesting maps
designed to inform possible flood defence options.</div>
<a name="10011269000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those maps
showed an area of Leckhampton that currently consists of green fields
and was flooded in 2007. A map was produced with a large area of blue
blocked out to show all the places that were inundated. That is exactly
the area on which the RSS, to which the hon. Member for Tewkesbury
referred, is planning to put 1,300 houses. That is an area, which
planning inspectors, who informed what are technically the Secretary of
State&#146;s proposed modifications to the RSS, spent roughly five to
10 minutes examining, before concluding that it was an appropriate area
for development.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div><a name="10011269000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result,
we have had a succession of planning applications to build on that
space, and they were live when the consultants were looking at flood
risks. Consequently, the consultants took those applications into
consideration and, fearing that that development might actually go
ahead, chose a flood defence option that did not use the landscape, the
natural features or the natural holding ability of the green fields at
Leckhampton, but focused entirely on hard defences in Warden
Hill.</div>
<a name="10011269000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we will
now have some &#163;700,000 worth of flood defence work in Warden
Hill. In itself, that work is very welcome, but it will be more
expensive than the option that should have been pursued, which would
have used landscape features. In fact, the overall cost of the work
over time will be hundreds of thousands of pounds more than the option
that was explored but not chosen, because it was thought that it would
prompt opposition from developers in the area uphill.</div>
<a name="10011269000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
is that PPS25 is completely useless in this situation. First, regarding
the planning applications that have already been submitted for this
green field area, there have been debates about PPS25 and about
Environment Agency objections to the development taking place. Those
objections have almost always been withdrawn. When I recently asked
Environment Agency staff why they were withdrawn, one explanation that
they gave was that, once again, it was the wrong kind of water and that
actually this was not main river flooding, but generally surface water
and inundation of the fields. Therefore, this area was not one of those
about which, under PPS25, the Environment Agency was supposed to be
giving advice. I must say that, from my reading of PPS25, I was a
little surprised by that and there is certainly some confusion here.
That led to the Environment Agency&#146;s withdrawing its objection
to developments and once it has withdrawn its objection, it is
virtually impossible for local campaigners or local authority planners
to maintain that there is a flooding risk to the satisfaction of
planning inspectors, even though, as we have seen, there is now
documentary evidence that there is a flood risk in this
area.</div><a name="10011269000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
the chances are that, one day, one of those planning applications might
succeed. We hope that we will defeat the RSS before that happens and
that we can consign the whole glorious thing to the dustbin. Clearly,
however, in terms of flood policy, the system is not working at the
moment.</div>
<a name="10011269000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
when that extra cost was placed on general taxpayers, because the money
will ultimately come from the Environment Agency, there was no
suggestion that the developers whose planning applications had caused
the increase in price&#151;by moving the defence work to hard
defences in Warden Hill&#151;would bear any of that extra cost.
Therefore, Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s recommendation that we should
ensure that developers make a full contribution to the costs of any
necessary defence has failed in this example, too.</div>
<a name="10011269000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">PPS25 is not
working, and we need to be quite explicit that areas with a high flood
risk can be identified and that, as set out in new clause 8, local
authorities have an explicit power of citing high flood risk as a
reason for refusing planning permission.</div>
<a name="10011269000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Michael
Pitt decided, probably quite rightly, against a blanket ban on building
on the flood plain. In any case, such a ban would not address surface
water flooding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>and would probably be too draconian. Nevertheless, we need to give local
authorities a clear and unambiguous power to refuse development and
stop processes such as the RSS, should they ever appear again, from
imposing development, which would make the flood risk worse, on areas
that they have identified as high flood risk areas, according to
whatever system or definition we
agree.</div><a name="10011269000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have known about this problem for years. The Foresight study, which I
think was as far back as 2004, certainly identified creeping
urbanisation as a major contributor to flood risk and it is time that
we tackled that issue and sorted it out. I am afraid that Sir Michael
Pitt was too optimistic, perhaps too naive, in hoping that PPS25 was up
to the job. It certainly is
not.</div><a name="10011269000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000528"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned Sir
Michael Pitt&#146;s report. I think that he was at the meeting that I
attended when Sir Michael Pitt admitted, and I paraphrase, that the
Government&#146;s 3 million house target had compromised his ability
to rule out building in flood risk areas. I paraphrase, but that is
very much what Sir Michael Pitt said at quite a large meeting, which I
think the hon. Gentleman attended.</div>
<a name="10011269000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000529"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman may well be right. Certainly,
that is an area of policy on which, for all the fine words that emanate
from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on wider
environmental objectives, we find that other Departments, specifically
the Department for Communities and Local Government, seem to go in
precisely the opposite direction and pursue their plans pretty well
regardless of the environmental consequences locally in many
cases.</div>
<a name="10011269000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Giving local
authorities the power to say no to inappropriate development which they
know, which they can prove, and which consultants have told them, will
increase flood risk is crucial. It is crucial for our constituents and
people throughout the country. If we do not address the issue, we could
end up in a situation whereby new housing estates are built in such
areas. The Association of British Insurers, whose tolerance is enormous
but not infinite, will eventually say, &#147;Frankly, if the
Government had the opportunity to stop those kinds of developments but
refused to take action or to address inappropriate development in flood
risk areas, why should our members insure those kinds of
houses?&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div><a name="10011269000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will be in
a situation whereby we have built whole housing estates that are
absolutely uninsurable, which will, therefore, become very low quality
housing in the end. The price will fall and they will potentially
become neglected. We will be in a terrible situation of urban blight in
those areas, not to mention the fact that they will, of course, almost
inevitably flood at some stage. They, too, will suffer along with the
people downhill of places where flooding has been
exacerbated.</div>
<a name="10011269000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to
tackle the issue. I hope that new clauses 7 and 8 will do that. As I
said, I will press them to a vote. Should they fall, however, I would
happily support new clause 25 as a very constructive
alternative.</div>
<a name="10011269000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011269000530"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> Given that my two colleagues have spoken, I do not
see why I cannot have a go. Such is the wide wording of new clause 25,
tabled by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, that I feel I can make a
couple of points in response to what both hon. Members said, but I
would also like to address a particular problem.</div>
<a name="10011269000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reality
in Gloucestershire is that those of us who live in the vale have come
to expect to be the major providers of land for new housing, and,
indeed, new employment. Historically, that has always happened. Looking
at the balance in the county&#146;s provision, it is increasingly the
case. It may be seen as inevitable, given the nature of the evolution
of the geography, geology and riverine system of the Severn vale, but
it leads to several specific problems.</div>
<a name="10011269000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
River Severn is mercurial. We live in the Severn vale because at
various times the river has moved its course quite dramatically. It
will continue to do so. That causes me some difficulty, because my main
point is about not just where we decide to build, but the consequences
for other parts of the Severn vale. That is often ignored, which is why
new clause 25 is quite cleverly worded: it looks at the consequences of
that new development. One of our problems is that, even if we
chose&#151;</div><a name="10011269000394"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1
