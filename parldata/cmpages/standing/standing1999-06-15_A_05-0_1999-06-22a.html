<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Ainger </B>(West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire): Before we adjourned, I was responding to an intervention from the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), in which he had asked me for my view of the current arrangements for emergency towing vessels around the coast of the United Kingdom. I am on record as saying that the provision of those vessels should be all year round and not just in winter. It is worth saying that the previous Government did not respond quickly enough to the Donaldson recommendation on the availability of emergency towing vessels at key points around the coast. That may have contributed to the extent of pollution from the Sea Empress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ainger:</B> Perhaps I may finish; the hon. Gentleman could then intervene.
<P>
Lord Donaldson recommended in May 1994 that there should be emergency towing vessels at key points around the coast. Captain Belton was commissioned to produce a further report, and delivered it in 1995. It is significant that, despite that, no emergency towing vessel was available in the western approaches until October 1996, some eight months after the Sea Empress had run aground. The point that I was making in relation to Lord Donaldson's most recent report concerned the speed with which the present Government responded to his recommendations. On the recommendation to provide emergency towing cover for the western approaches, the previous Government were dilatory to say the least.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> For the record, I would like to note that my views are close to the hon. Gentleman's&#151;both on the performance of the previous Government and on the current situation. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the current Government have failed to bring the provision of emergency towage up to the necessary levels?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ainger:</B> The current level is of winter-only cover for the three key points: the north-west of Scotland, the Dover straits and the western approach. However, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is consulting to see whether it might be possible to fund emergency towing cover and other anti-pollution measures.
<P>
The international oil pollution compensation&#151;IOPC&#151;fund places a levy on organisations involved in the movement of oil around the world in order to provide compensation after a spill. It is peculiar that we do not have a system in place that would require organisations to pay a levy to prevent pollution. It seems ludicrous that substantial sums are being paid into the IOPC fund without such a parallel fund existing. I do not object to the IOPC levy being raised&#151;far from it; my constituents benefited considerably from that fund following the Sea Empress disaster. They did not want to, but the fund was available to provide compensation; they see the logic of having a levy designed to prevent pollution. That we have been able just to provide winter-only cover in this country emphasises the need seriously to consider a levy to provide the technical expertise to pay for the Secretary of State's representative, who will intervene in salvage operations. The same levy could provide substantial funds to pay for emergency towing vessels and other ancillary equipment&#151;aircraft and so on&#151;which are required to be on standby, at not inconsiderable cost, to tackle any major pollution incident. I understand that the Department is in consultation with the industry about developing a levy, with the main aim of preventing pollution.
<P>
Members of the Committee who were present on Second Reading&#151;I think that most hon. Members who are currently here were present&#151;will know that I raised the issue of the sadly regular incidents of pollution from the Broken Hill petroleum company, which owns the oilfield in Liverpool bay. Members who represent constituencies on the north Wales coast have told me about the need to get to grips with that company. It is an unusual situation, because the offshore industry in general has a good record on pollution. Given the regularity of the incidents, it is clear that the company has not got to grips with its anti-pollution measures.
<P>
Under the new clause, the Secretary of State and the various agencies will have the power to intervene to ensure that the Liverpool bay oilfield does not continue to pollute, and that nor will any other offshore installation. Lord Donaldson clearly discovered an anomaly, and I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and his Department on reacting so quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake (Carshalton and Wallington):</B> It is obviously right that offshore installations should be brought within the scope of the Bill, and I therefore support the amendment. However, I should like to seek clarification from the Minister in respect of an intervention that I made earlier.
<P>
Storage of nuclear waste under the sea would clearly not fall within the remit of the amendment, because it relates only to the petroleum industry. Does legislation control that activity? If not, would it not be appropriate to table an amendment that would allow for the eventuality of establishing some form of control for nuclear waste that is stored under the sea?
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I should like to respond to the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green), who asked whether the Bill's powers relate only to events after an accident. Lord Donaldson recommended that similar powers as those that apply to ships should be provided for offshore installations. The Merchant Shipping Act 1995 legislates for powers after an accident has happened, and the powers in respect of installations are similarly constrained. In case the hon. Gentleman wonders whether it is sensible to limit such powers to events following an accident, I should point out that the health and safety regulations normally provide for the period leading up to an accident. The aim of those regulations is the prevention of accidents. If, despite all best plans and preparations, an accident occurred, the powers in new clause 2 would come into operation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) asked about the storage of nuclear waste under the sea. I think that it is best to write to him, rather than giving a snap answer. We are, of course, under pressure, and there is a requirement under Ospar&#151;the Oslo and Paris convention 1992&#151;agreed in Sintra a year ago to reduce radioactive emissions to sea to background levels within 20 years. However, the hon. Gentleman raised a rather different issue&#151;the storage of radioactive waste.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger) spelled out the position with admirable succinctness and accuracy. Under the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971, the Department of Trade and Industry is prosecuting the Broken Hill Petroleum company for the first Liverpool bay oil spill, and is investigating the second.
<P>
I think that that answers all the points raised, and hope that we can, as seems to be the sentiment in the Committee, agree these important changes to the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 3, line 29, after `consequential' insert `and minor'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 24.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The current regulatory regimes operate under the ``polluter pays'' principle. The regulator is obliged to recover from opeators the full cost of operating pollution control regimes. However, the Environmental Protection Act 1990 does not enable charges levied by one regulator to be recovered from the money spent by another. Under the new control systems, we aim to achieve greater co-operation between regulators&#151;in particular, between the Environment Agency and local authorities. For example, the Environment Agency will draft certain guidance notes that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will issue to local authorities. At the moment, under the 1990 Act, it is not possible to recover the cost of that guidance. The Bill includes provisions to rectify that.
<P>
However, the provisions in the bill will take effect only when local authority regulated processes are phased into the new regime. The amendments, therefore, are designed to enable the recovery of the cost of producing the guidance during the transitional period between the enactment of the Bill and the phase-in date. It is a relatively small point, but one necessary to cover that administrative lacuna.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> It is impossible for any of us with a sense of history to want to miss an opportunity to debate clause 4 with the Minister. Sadly, however, I will, I think, restrict myself to asking two small questions on the issue raised by the Minister's amendments.
<P>
The first arises from the Minister's explanation of amendment No. 24. Does he have any guidance on the cost that the proposal is likely to place on local authorities? He said that there will be some cost in that they will be carrying out regulation that they have not previously carried out. Transitional and on-going costs will obviously be involved. Could we have some idea of the magnitude of the costs that will be incurred?
<P>
The second question concerns amendment No. 23. Will the Minister clarify the need to insert the words ``and minor'' after ``consequential''? Does it mean that all the changes in that provision are minor, or is it a term of art, applying only to some of the changes? Those are the only two points of clarification that I would like from the Minister on this group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman some information on the first of his two points. In the past, the DETR produced local authority guidance, and the taxpayer met the cost. That was not reasonable under the ``polluter pays'' principle. From this year, the Environment Agency will do the work. It is right that it should be able to recover the cost from operators. The total cost of producing the guidance is about &#163;100,000 a year, which works out at about &#163;7 or &#163;8 a year for each operator.
<P>
Amendment No. 24 introduces a minor&#151;I am not sure whether that is meant to be a pun&#151;amendment to the 1990 Act. Technically, it is not a consequential amendment, but we judge it to be a minor one.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was asking about the wording of amendment No. 23.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I apologise. The hon. Gentleman did indeed refer to amendment No. 23. I had best filibuster for a few seconds&#151;the technicalities are quite extraordinary. Amendment No. 23 inserts the word ``minor'' to cover amendment No. 24&#151;an answer that surprises us both.

<P>
Amendment proposed,No. 27, in page 4, line 22, leave out subsection (10).&#151;[Mr. Meacher.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is a shame that the Minister has moved the amendment formally at this relatively early stage in the evening. I should like to obtain some explanation of the thinking behind the clause, partly because it involves one over-arching concern about the Bill&#151;costs and burdens. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee accept the ``polluter pays'' principle. It is a sensible principle on which we can move forward, and Opposition Members support it as it was set up under the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
<P>
Will the Minister enlarge on an answer that he gave a few moments ago about one specific aspect of costs, and let the Committee know whether he anticipates that the extra costs that will be incurred under new regulations will fall on regulators, either nationally or locally? Is it assumed that the percentage paid by the polluter&#151;presumably the ideal is 100 per cent., and neither more nor less&#151;will be changed by the Bill? The explanatory notes on the clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government intends that most costs should be recovered from operators''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clearly implies that some of the costs that will fall on the public sector will be increased as a result of these measures. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain where the costs will fall and by how much they will increase. In particular, if there are increased costs on local authorities as a result of this measure, do the Government have any plans for a compensation mechanism for local authorities? Those are some of the central questions surrounding the Bill, and I should be grateful if the Minister could flesh them out with some detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon, Member for Ashford raises a question that is more appropriate to the very brief debate that we had just a moment ago. The purpose behind amendment No. 27 is simply to delete the standard provision inserted by the House of Lords to avoid questions of privilege. I think that the hon. Gentleman is not challenging that, but merely hooking on questions that he wants to pursue on what is purely a formal amendment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about extra costs falling on regulators. Charges will be designed to recover costs wherever it is practicable. We say that most costs willl be recovered because a very few may be irrecoverable&#151;pollution inventory costs, for example, where a permit is not yet in place. That is a rather exceptional circumstance, but it is why we say that most costs will be recovered. In the great majority of cases, they will be. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that a satisfactory explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation that there will only be a small number of cases in which costs will not be recoverable. Does he have aa rough idea of the magnitude of the costs in question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that the answer to that is no. If we do get a rough idea of the magnitude, I will let the hon. Gentleman know in writing.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Before the Committee concludes its proceedings, Mr. Atkinson, may I take a formal opportunity to thank you, in particular, for the extremely expeditious way in which you have conducted the business of the Committee? I think that this sitting took 38 minutes, during 15 of which we were occupied in a Division. I also recall your chairing of our first sitting: you were extremely fair and brisk, which we look to Chairmen to be. I thank you very warmly for the manner in which that was done.
<P>
May I also thank my hon. Friends for conducting themselves in the spirit of the Committee? It has not been the longest Committee stage that I can remember, but I am pleased that Government Members produced some useful, relevant and important contributions. I also thank the Opposition, both above and below the Gangway, for the civilised and thoughtful way in which these matters have been discussed. Once again, Mr. Atkinson, thank you very much.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> May I add to the Minister's gracious comments my own thanks and those of Opposition Members to you and to your fellow Chairmen of the various sittings, all of which have been conducted in a business-like and expeditious way? I extend thanks to the staff of the House who have enabled the Committee to run smoothly.
<P>
I thank the Minister for providing me with my introduction to the subject. I am sure that he is as grateful as you, Mr. Atkinson, and I that the Committee stage has not been as long as that of the National Minimum Wage Bill, which formed my previous experience of such matters. I shall also thank my hon. Friends: I am especially pleased to have had the historic experience of having provoked my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) to a rebellion. I am sure that that experience has been shared by many of my hon. Friends in the past, and I am glad to have joined their undoubtedly distinguished group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson: I must also thank the Minister on behalf of my hon. Friends and I myself. I also echo the comments made by the Minister and by the hon. Member for Ashford.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank members of the Committee for having dealt with the matter in a good-hearted, humorous and business-like way. I shall pass the comments of the Minister and of the hon. Member for Ashford on to Mr. Hood and to Mr. Bill O'Brien.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
