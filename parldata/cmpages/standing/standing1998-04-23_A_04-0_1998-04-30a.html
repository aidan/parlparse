<H2><center>Standing Committee A</center></H2>
<H4><center>Thursday 30 April 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]</center></H4>

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If hon. Members want to remove their jackets for greater comfort, they may do so.
<P>
I have studied the Official Report of our debate on the amendments tabled to clause 6 carefully, and I believe that the arguments have been well rehearsed. Ordinarily, I would therefore move straight to a vote on clause 6 stand part. However, I am told that representations have been received that require a further airing, so on that basis, and provided we do not revisit the ground covered on the amendments that we debated on Tuesday, we can have a clause stand part debate.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>The New Opportunities Fund</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Spring </B>(West Suffolk): First, may I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale? I understand your injunction, but we have had representations and further concerns have been expressed about the issues. The twin elements of the clause--the additionality and the arm's-length principle--are at the heart of our objections.
<P>
Under clause 6 and schedule 2, the New Opportunities Fund will be established as a body to distribute lottery funds for initiatives specified by the Secretary of State in connection with the new good cause. The Secretary of State will be given an order-making power to specify such initiatives and to give directions to the New Opportunities Fund. The notes on clause 6, helpfully provided by the Government, state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``rather than providing general support to its sectors as the other distributors do, it will support a rolling programme of specific initiatives. These will be determined by the Secretary of State by order following consultation and directions on the approximate expenditure on each initiative, its duration and targets will be made through directions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The new good cause is therefore qualitatively and substantively different from the existing good causes.
<P>
I remind the Committee that proposed new section 43B refers to grants
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which are designed to give effect to such initiatives concerned or connected with health, education or the environment as may from time to time be specified in an order made by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is confirmed in proposed new section 43C, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In exercising their functions under section 43B the New Opportunities Fund shall comply with any directions given to them by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the theme at the heart of the debate.
<P>
The additionality principle was accepted by Lord McIntosh of Haringey during the Bill's Committee stage in another place, when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I think the Committee would agree from the force with which the arguments have been made that to many noble Lords, this is the most important single issue in the Bill.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 19 January 1998; Vol. 584, c. CWH41.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We fully accept that and I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for allowing us to air our concerns again.
<P>
I thank, in his absence, the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn), because he supported our amendments. I see from the speeches made by Liberal Democrat peers in another place that Lords Falkland and Redesdale, in particular, supported us comprehensively. On Second Reading, Lord Redesdale said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The problem is that the Bill goes a long way towards destroying the principle of additionality.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 18 December 1997; Vol. 584, c. 761.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is at the heart of the issue.
<P>
The Prime Minister defined additionality in the White Paper, ``The People's Lottery'' when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We don't believe it would be right to use Lottery money to pay for things which are the Government's responsibilities''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the Bill contradicts that assertion.
<P>
The public's continuing confidence in the national lottery and in the Government's good faith is at the heart of the issue. The Bill will enable the Government to make the lottery a different animal from that which it was originally intended to be.
<P>
In a BBC interview, the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin) rather gave the game away. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I think what we said in Opposition was clear, and it was right at the time that the lottery was introduced. But what we have now is a situation where the Budget spending level is set, and we have said that we are going to stick to that level for two years. I think it's right that a Government can say: We have a different view of how the lottery should operate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is precisely the point. The Bill will violate the very principles on which the lottery was first established. The public will regard as wholly unacceptable the Labour party's admission that election manifesto commitments can be broken when a party comes to power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): Does my hon. Friend agree that the statement by the hon. Member for Hove is based on the bizarre and wholly bogus notion that the Government are bound by the previous Government's spending plans?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is exactly the point and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making it. As I have said before, we have heard a great deal about control totals, which have been affected by the substantial EMU rebate and by a Treasury underspend. Additional sums of money that do not breach those totals have therefore been available to the Government. However, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has been singularly unsuccessful in obtaining any additional funding from the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): When referring to my interview during the BBC programme ``On the Record'', the hon. Gentleman should have completed the second of my quotes. I continued by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``That is a view that we've consulted on. We've received the consultations back and we're now developing a Bill to reflect those priorities, so I don't think there's anything wrong with that, I don't think they're compromising the lottery in any way''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With regard to additionality, I pointed out to the hon. Gentleman the other day that those directions were originally brought about by his right hon. Friend the Member of South-West Surrey (Mrs. Bottomley).
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I fear that the hon. Gentleman has totally misunderstood the point. A political party that makes a manifesto commitment and which implicitly breaks it on coming to power, risks breaking the bond of trust between Government and electorate. The hon. Gentleman is evidently supporting the view that such an action can be justified. He will rue the day that he uttered those words, because they will return to haunt him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I do not know why the hon. Gentleman looks to the sky. He started the debate, when we might otherwise have voted on the clause.
<P>
It is disingenuous of the hon. Gentleman to say that the Government are breaking their promises. We made clear before the general election our commitment to changing the way in which the lottery is run. That is what the Bill will do and that is why we are scrutinising the legislation. The hon. Gentleman should examine the 1992 Conservative party election manifesto before suggesting that we have broken our promises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> At the risk of testing your patience and indulgence, Mr. Gale, I must point out that, during the Committee's proceedings, the hon. Gentleman voted against his own party's manifesto commitment, which was to set up a fund that would not come into effect until after the millennium. The hon. Gentleman supported that commitment when he stood for election by the people of Hove and now he has broken it. A moment of quiet reflection on his part would therefore be appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Does my hon. Friend share my sense of depression that even relatively good-natured new Members such as the hon. Member for Hove appear to have been infected by the attitude of their superiors? I refer to the belief that the Committee debating process is an irrelevance and an irritation that should not be taking place at all because new Labour's Bills do not need to receive such scrutiny.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am rapidly forming the opinion that this debate should not be taking place at all. I was expecting some new comment to be made. Will hon. Members now return to the clause 6 stand part debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The principles that underlie our objections to the Bill and to this particular clause are very clear. Public services should not depend on contributions that are variable and voluntary. The national lottery does not exist to finance that which is merely desirable and it should not be regarded as a hidden, cost-free, painless form of tax.
<P>
The Secretary of State has said that core funding by central Government will continue, citing the examples of school buildings and national health service beds. Once he has secured his additional powers, will he go down the route advocated by The Sun--that great supporter of the Labour Government--and use the lottery to pay for NHS beds or school textbooks? The Bill will empower the Secretary of State completely to replace core funding with money from the national lottery.
<P>
The Prime Minister, speaking about information technology, said that every educational institution should be involved in the information super-highway. I understand that the national lottery is to contribute some &#163;220 million to child care facilities and yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer has already announced the allocation of &#163;80 million for that purpose. Where is the additionality in that?
<P>
My noble Friend Lord Skidelsky said in Committee in another place, that we must have simple tests based on common sense, and that view has received the support of my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Mr. Prior). Unless people understand the distinction upon which additionality is based, they will lose confidence in the national lottery and the good causes may begin to suffer. Those good causes were originally chosen for the benefit of traditionally under-resourced areas such as the arts, heritage and sport. Once the Secretary of State has acquired his additional powers, the temptation may be to extend the principle of additionality into the grey areas that I have described and thus to endanger the very foundations of the national lottery. That is why clause 6 is critically important.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the former Prime Minister has said, Chancellors avoid giving financial support to some areas of national life for political reasons. The national lottery was designed to alleviate that kind of underfunding. It was intended to build up the country's sporting activities, artistic endeavour and heritage for future generations. That endowment for the future is being put at risk.
<P>
The Minister in the previous Administration who took the original Bill through its Committee proceedings was my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key). On Second Reading of the Bill that we are now debating, he said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``When my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) and I took the original legislation through the House, we acted on the best evidence provided by our officials. Our decisions were based not on some dogmatic dislike of what the Secretary of State is now proposing, but on strong evidence from lotteries around the world as collated by our officials. That led us to conclude that breaching the principle of additionality would reduce the revenue from and attractiveness of the lottery. That was our principle and that is why we always entrenched additionality. What has changed?''--[Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 169.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) made a similar point when he talked about the impact on libraries. He quoted an article by Liz Forgan that appeared in the Evening Standard on 17 December 1997 in which she asked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in what way is this spending on health, education and the environment different from the Government's normal spending on health, education and the environment? Send for a Jesuit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My right hon. Friend, who introduced the lottery and won public support for it, went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Treasury theology is usually erected as a Treasury defence against spending Departments. Here we have a spending Department conniving with the Treasury in the deployment of the theology.''--[Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 204.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is crucial to understanding why clause 6 is so dangerous.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport admitted that money has been spent on librarian training. The lottery needs to evolve because people's needs and aspirations are constantly changing. However, as my right hon. Friend, the former Prime Minister remarked, capital spending undoubtedly would have moved towards revenue spending as capital projects were completed.
<P>
The National Lottery etc. Act 1993 had the noble aim of maintaining the arms-length principle, a clear distinction on additionality and public confidence.
<P>
The hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) talked about desirable projects. Aftercare facilities and training for librarians and teachers are desirable, but they should be financed by central Government taxation and funding. Education is funded by the state, although parents contribute to supplementary school activities. Information technology is essential to the success of future generations and to a flourishing modern economy and so it should be financed by central Government taxation. That is a common-sense test. The Government have blurred the distinction between what is essential and what is desirable. That became plain when the hon. Member for Slough made a spurious distinction between core and mainstream subjects in schools, thus missing the point entirely.
<P>
I turn to the arms-length principle. The millennium dome at Greenwich provides an alarming example of the difficulties of attracting sponsorship. A project with costs of &#163;758 million has to secure funding to succeed. We have heard comments on that from the Sports Council, the chairman of the Arts Council, the National Lottery Charities Board and Lord Rothschild. The Sports Council, the Arts Council, the National Lottery Charities Board and the Heritage Lottery Fund have produced &#163;25 million each to contribute a total of &#163;100 million to the millennium dome.
<P>
Is that an example of spontaneous combustion? Did it happen in some instant way? Of course we should celebrate the millennium; people and organisations should make a contribution, either to the dome or to the whole project--of whose total cost the dome accounts for only 20 per cent.

<P>

<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): My hon. Friend makes a valid point, but has he considered the implications of the sudden rash of new appointments at the head of the organisations that he mentioned? They include Mr. Gerry Robinson at the Arts Council, and he appeared in a Labour Party political broadcast during the general election. The public will be worried that those independent bodies are considerably less independent than they used to be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is exactly the point. My hon. Friend is right: increasingly, power is being concentrated in the hands of the Secretary of State. That goes well beyond patronage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I fear that the debate is going well beyond clause 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I shall move on rapidly. If, without any legislative pressure, bodies that have expressed concern in correspondence to members of the Committee about their funding arrangements and ability to spend the lottery money that is given them are giving up sums of money in the way that we have described, what will happen when the powers of direction and influence are enormously enhanced by the Bill? The precedent is alarming for those of us who want confidence in the lottery to be maintained.
<P>
I turn now to the arm's-length principle. The Government recently published new directions that will reduce the efficiency of the lottery and its overall impact by allowing the distribution bodies to dispense with the requirement to find matching funds. Those directives were devised for the purposes of the Government's political objectives: that is the only explanation, and it is a completely new departure.
<P>
Conservative Members object in principle to the lottery being used to fund what should be the responsibility of Government. We object, too, to the introduction of the provision that effectively gives the Secretary of State power over the New Opportunities Fund. It is no wonder that the Secretary of State does not want to place any limit on the amount of money that he can divert to the new fund. We have sought and failed to secure protection for the existing good causes. That is a matter of shame, because the lack of protection undermines the confidence of the distribution bodies and of the recipients of the lottery money.
<P>
It is not surprising that those bodies are worried. A letter from the National Lotteries Charities Board states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Board is also concerned that, if more than &#163;10 billion is raised by the lottery over the course of the current licence, then the excess should be divided equally between each of the good causes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is typical of the anxiety aroused by the additional powers that clause 6 gives to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My hon. Friend may have seen briefings that I have not, but does he recall seeing any correspondence relating to this Committee's proceedings from other distribution bodies? Is it not a bit odd that other briefings have not been evident?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It is extraordinary how limited the amount of formal briefing has been, although the organisations involved have expressed their unease unofficially to me, to the shadow Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), and to other members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Sport (Mr. Tony Banks):</B> How do we know?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Trust me--to quote the Prime Minister's familiar cry. [Laughter.] I notice the ribald laughter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> It's the way you tell them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Indeed, I entirely agree.
<P>
Distribution bodies are worried about speaking out in public because they are recipients of Government largesse and favour. The Secretary of State will take on additional powers and that puts them in a difficult position. It is hardly surprising that those bodies are nervous of speaking out in the way that they would like.
<P>
Using a wonderful term, the Minister has spoken of the ``seamless flow'' of the relationship between the Secretary of State and the distribution bodies. In our judgment, there is nothing seamless or flowing about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser (Mid-Dorset and North Poole):</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that we have asked the Minister many times for evidence of the discussions purported to have taken place between the Secretary of State and the distribution bodies? To date, no evidence has been presented to us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I entirely agree. If there is such a happy seamless flow in the relationship, there should be no objection to publishing the correspondence that led to it. Regrettably, the Government have failed to provide it, and that undermines confidence in what they tell us. The only explanation for the Government's failure to publish the agreement between the Secretary of State and the distribution bodies is political. Lord Gowrie, Lord Rothschild and the Sports Council have made it clear that they share the considerable anxieties that I have already expressed.
<P>
The order-making power was not envisaged when the lottery was conceived. Both sides of the House--none more rigorously than Labour Members--defended the arm's-length principle at that time. My goodness, how things have changed for the worse.
<P>
Why have the Government not set up the New Opportunities Fund in the same way as the other distributors were set up? It is an entirely different animal, because the arm's-principle and additionality will be put under such challenge and threat by the clause. That will lead to all the implications that I have outlined. The Government can offer no explanation for the order-making power other than that they have a political agenda.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): The hon. Gentleman comes at last, after 20-odd minutes, to the arm's-length principle and additionality. I draw his attention to a quote from Second Reading, when a right hon. Member said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I welcome the establishment of a commission . . . and the fact that distributing bodies will be encouraged to develop strategies''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the arm's-length principle. The right hon. Member added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I also welcome the fact that more soliciting will be allowed . . . The Secretary of State said that joint schemes would be encouraged . . . to promote greater flexibility. All those are sensible, evolutionary steps.''--[Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 209.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The right hon. Member who said that was the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey. She went on--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will be quite entitled to make a speech if he catches my eye, but interventions are supposed to be exactly that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I merely make the point that the remarks of the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) conflict with the welcome given to aspects of the Bill by a former Secretary of State for National Heritage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I regret to say that the hon. Gentleman profoundly misunderstands the Bill. The setting up of a commission is entirely different from what we are debating now. If the Bill merely involved regulation of the national lottery, the speeding up of processes and the simplification of bureaucracy, we would consider it favourably.
<P>
However, that is entirely different from the provisions in new section 43B. I ask the hon. Gentleman to read what that says about the powers of direction and the ability of the Secretary of State to specify by order what can be done. Once action is taken under that umbrella, there will be delegation. However, that is entirely separate from the overarching power. Before the hon. Gentleman continues that line of thinking, he should look afresh at clause 6. Our principled objection is not to the issue he raised; we object to the new authority and the distinct and qualitative difference between the New Opportunities Fund and the other bodies.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State and his successors will, for example, be able, without further reference to Parliament, to allow new causes to benefit from lottery money. That is certainly a new departure; it raises again the question of good faith and of people's confidence in the national lottery. I have said before--I make this point forcibly to the hon. Member for High Peak--that we must protect the integrity of legislation. We must consider future generations; we should not give powers, as will clause 6, to a future Secretary of State who may be less benign or even more centralising and who might therefore fatally damage public confidence in the national lottery.
<P>
There is no point in the Minister telling us that new initiatives will have to be approved by affirmative resolution. That is not the same as primary legislation, and it will not attract the same public support and confidence that primary legislation is known to attract. Members of the public do not understand arcane parliamentary procedures. They need to be satisfied that fundamental changes are properly and adequately debated in the House of Commons. It is symptomatic that the Government, who prefer to handle their relationship with the electorate through spinning and media manipulation, should blatantly ignore Parliament.
<P>
The 1993 Act would have required primary legislation to allow money to be diverted from the original five good causes. The Bill is a wholly new departure. It will give the Secretary of State a mechanism for paying for any new scheme that he chooses to fund. I accept that the New Opportunities Fund will concentrate at first only on healthy living centres, IT and the environment; but with such a precedent, goodness knows what will happen in future. That will undoubtedly depend on the political whims of various focus groups.
<P>
In another place, the Government admitted that the New Opportunities Fund is fundamentally different because the powers enshrined in clause 6 make it so. Lord McIntosh went further, making it clear that the activities of the New Opportunities Fund had deliberately not been clearly defined. That will give the maximum manoeuvring room to any Government, present or future.
<P>
Lord McIntosh said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The relationship is different because the new good cause is different. The existing good causes are pretty well defined and the distributors are in the main well established as expert bodies within their fields. In the case of sport and the arts, the distributors are the key sectoral bodies; the Heritage Lottery Fund was not the biggest player but was well placed to understand the whole sector, and the National Lottery Charities board has quickly established itself as a respected and knowledgeable body in the charitable field.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He summed up by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``By contrast, the new good cause ranges over a vast area. It encompasses health, education and the environment, each of which in itself is broader than any of the other good causes. If, as we do, we want these areas to benefit in a sensible and focused way from the lottery, then we clearly need a different approach.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 22 January 1998; Vol. 584, c. CWH 72.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly the point. For the Government, the Bill's success rests on clause 6, yet clause 6 is at the heart of our fundamental objections.
<P>
I return to the question of additionality. If I may, Mr. Gale, I should like to revisit the subject of healthy living centres. We had a lively discussion about primary care being a core Government responsibility and about healthy living centres being part of that process. By April 1997, 58 per cent. of GPs were fundholders. Since GP fundholding came into being, we have seen an extraordinary transformation in the services that GPs provide. Under the umbrella of the White Paper entitled ``The Health of the Nation'', fresh emphasis was placed--

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the direction in which the hon. Gentleman is trying to lead us, but he is going very wide of the mark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Gale. Many of the services that apparently will be provided by healthy living centres are being provided by the taxpayer--by central Government--through GP fundholding practices. Great emphasis is already placed on preventive medicine, which is part of what healthy living centres are designed to provide. The traditional basic responsibilities of GPs have extended into other areas. For example, palliative care, chiropractic and complementary medicine are flourishing. Healthy living centres have drawn their inspiration from GP fundholding practices.
<P>
Such matters are core Government responsibilties, and it is wrong that money should be removed from those caring charities that represent arts, sports and heritage for what, after all, is essentially the Government's strategy for preventive medicine and all that flows from it. That is my principla objection to the measure.
<P>
As for teacher training, the hon. Member for High Peak gave the game away when he accepted that retraining is already happening. I accept that IT is important for the future of young people, but the hon. Gentleman was saying that because such a skill was new, it required different funding. If that is the case, in 10 or 15 years' time when it is important to adopt within the curriculum another new development, will there by a further raid on the lottery to pay for it? A whole can of worms will open up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> As my hon. Friend knows, Ministers are claiming that there is still an additionality test for the national lottery. Can he think of an example of a health or education project that might fail the additionality test?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. When the Minister responds to what I am saying, he will undoubtedly deal with that matter, too.
<P>
We accept that teachers need to be kept up to speed with modern developments, but the Government are already paying for IT training for teachers through the training and enterprise councils and through grants. A precedent has already been established, and all that will happen is that money will be taken away from the national lottery to replace funding that is already being undertaken by central Government. That will also happen with the health service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> As for education funding, core spending on technology is important as technology changes. The hon. Member for High Peak said that such a situation was a one-off, but it is on-going and must form part of the core spending requirement of the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. That point is right in terms of any Government's commitment to information technology. However, good causes, which have traditionally been under-resourced by Governments, will be the losers because of the Government's unwillingness to commit taxpayers' moneys to areas in which the Government are already involved.
<P>
We have heard much about the national child care strategy and we all look forward to the presentation of the Green Paper. The Minister said that he had not yet seen the Green Paper and I wonder whether the Secretary of State for Social Security has seen it either--we do not know whether the Minister for Welfare Reform has provided her with that information. We will undoubtedly hear about that in due course.
<P>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has boasted about that strategy and said that it is an essential part of Government policy. If he is willing to take credit for the policy, what further definition of a direct political agenda does anyone need? It is unacceptable and outrageous that credit is taken for a policy funded by money taken from the national lottery. It is totally unreasonable for Ministers to claim credit for the success of something funded not by central Government money but by the lottery. As one of my hon. Friends said, where will that process end? What policies will evolve for which Ministers will seek to take political credit although they have been funded by a form of disguised taxation on the lottery?
<P>
I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for having allowed me to air our concerns as comprehensively as you have. Clause 6 is fundamentally flawed. It is the rock on which the Bill is based. It provides for substitution for core Government spending by the national lottery, which sets a wholly undesirable precedent for future good governance. It will enable a Secretary of State to take unprecedented powers. It will allow a fund to be set up that is wholly different in its manner of construction and method of operation from the existing one for good causes. The real question is: what effect will that have on public confidence in the national lottery? The national lottery has been a great national success. It is popular with the people. It has brought massive sums of money to many areas of national life that would never otherwise have received such quantities of money. All of that will be put at risk if politicians get their sticky fingers on such money, as the Secretary of State will do under the clause.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Chairman:</B> Order. At the start of today`s proceedings I said that during several hours on Tuesday the matters raised by the clause had been well debated. I hope that the Committee will agree that the Opposition case has been put admirably and at some length by the hon. Member for West Suffolk. I shall now invite the Minister to respond. Naturally, if he wishes to give way to hon. Members who want to intervene, that is a matter for him.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I call the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green).
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I intended to make some brief remarks and to seek reassurances from Ministers that I sought during our debate on amendments to the clause, but which have not been given. I respectfully suggest that this would provide additionality--to use a topical word--to what my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk has just said, by dealing with other aspects of the clause that have not yet been fully addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. You may recall, or have noticed from Hansard, that I did not contribute to our debate on the amendments to the clause, except for one brief intervention. I prepared a speech that I hoped would be relevant to the issues that you have this morning ruled to be in order. I should be disappointed not to be able to develop those points. Since that debate I have received representations from the National Lottery Charities Board on which I should also like to comment. In no sense do I want to question your judgment, Mr. Gale. I have enormous respect for your experience as a Chairman. I simply make those points in a spirit of helpfulness.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) makes a fair point. He is correct, and I have noticed that he did not speak during the earlier debate. Perhaps I, like other Chairmen, must become accustomed to the fact that Whips speak these days. On that basis and provided that the hon. Gentleman has fresh material to contribute, it would be appropriate for him to make a brief speech, after which I propose to call the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am most grateful, Mr. Gale. I shall try to speak reasonably briefly and to stay in order, but I am sure that you will guide me if I stray.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk said in his excellent speech, it is right to debate clause 6 in detail because it is the heart of the Bill--many issues flow from it. Although I did not make a speech in the previous debate, I listened intently and intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for High Peak. I thought his response significant. Although Ministers, given their experience and savoir-faire in these matters, have been guarded about their intentions, we have heard one or two comments from Back Benchers that are definitely off message.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Arts (Mr. Mark Fisher):</B> Excellent speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am in no way decrying the excellence of their speeches.
<P>
I asked the hon. Member for High Peak who would take the credit for projects funded through the national lottery under the Bill. His reply was very direct and honest. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Of course we shall take the credit for these innovations''.--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 28 April 1998; c. 101.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would not have expected him to say anything different because, of course, that is the crucial truth about additionality.
<P>
We must apply two acid tests to the clause. I have already mentioned one: whether we can expect to see Ministers being photographed smiling outside such projects--healthy living centres or whatever--when they come to fruition, trying to take credit for them as though they had been funded from normal taxation. That is a key issue, which is why I raised it with the hon. Member for High Peak. I am talking not about Ministers from the ministry of culture--as I believe it is now called, in rather Stalinist fashion--but about Ministers for health and education. They will be the ones taking the photo opportunities.
<P>
One of the key difficulties with clause 6, and the Bill, is that it muddies the waters, and is intended to do so, as to what is financed from taxation and what is financed from the national lottery. There will be no attempt to clarify in voters' minds where one source of funding ends and another begins.
<P>
The other acid test is additionality. Ministers have nodded in the direction of the concept of additionality, as indeed they must, given that it was a fundamental basis for the original concept of the national lottery. However, they are just paying lip service to additionality. The concept still exists and it is called by the same name, but it has changed radically. Their new definition is that any kind of spending is additional provided that it does not replace Government spending. That is absurd. That argument can be tested by asking whether any project financed under the Bill could be thought to breach the concept of additionality. I have repeatedly tried to think of a project that would breach additionality under the new, wholly elastic definition but have not been able to do so. I hope that the Minister will be able to give one or more examples and I would be happy to give way to any member of the Committee who can. The fact is that additionality will now mean whatever Ministers want it to mean.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> Like my hon. Friend, I cannot think of an example. If the Government said that they were sticking to spending limits but were going to spend money from the health service budget on healthy living centres or from the education budget on IT training for teachers, no one would blink an eye. That would be core spending on which the Government had decided. However, if they said that they were going to build an opera house or a big sports stadium, everyone would think that bizarre from a Government who claim public spending pressures. That illustrates the difference between the core funding of the New Opportunities Fund and the funding of the other good causes, which the public would not recognise as core funding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for putting it in that characteristically cogent way. That is exactly the point that I am labouring--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> True.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> --to make. I mean labour with a small ``l''.
<P>
Spending from the lottery will always be additional under the Government's new definition, whatever budget the Government set for themselves. [Interruption.] I would happily give way to the Minister. If the Government reduced spending in any area, support from the lottery would still be additional in any given year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give an example of where he believes spending would be reduced to provide opportunities for lottery funding?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman studiously avoided giving me the example that I requested earlier. None the less, because of my innate sense of fairness, I shall deal with his point. I hope that he will deal with mine later.
<P>
I have two points in response to the hon. Gentleman's question. First, the introduction of the new fund will have a depressing effect on the spending available to the existing good causes. We have dealt with that point at length and even your legendary patience, Mr. Gale, would run out if I went into it again in detail. The second point is the fiction about spending limits. Time and again, Ministers, from the Prime Minister down, make the bizarre point that in some strange way the new Government are bound by the previous Government's spending plans. That is not true, politically or legally. Governments are there to make choices.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> That is the choice we make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That is a fascinating intervention. Fine, it is the Labour Government's choice to stick pro tem within our spending plans, but they are not bound by them in some way, as the Prime Minister and the Chancellor would have us believe. That brings into high relief the credibility gap between the spending plans that the Government claim to have inherited--they always use the word ``inherit''--and the wild promises they made during the election campaign. One of the ways of meeting that gap is by siphoning off money from the lottery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the first draft directive issued under new section 43C--in respect of a national child care strategy, for example--makes it clear that the amount of money taken from the lottery will depend upon the Green Paper and responses to it? So in a national child care strategy the money taken from the lottery would be directly traded off against money from general taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I was not going to speak about child care specifically, but I remind the Committee of the brazen remarks of the Secretary of State for Social Security on this smash and grab raid on lottery funds. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It's the public's money, and the public want it to be spent on high quality childcare.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know what direct line the right hon. Lady feels that she has to the British public, but ``the people'' is this Government's great catch-all term. Even though a great many did not vote for them--and even those who did so did not vote for the policy encapsulated in the Bill--the Government think that they can disguise any attempt to siphon money off from the existing good causes as the ``will of the people''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be floundering, so perhaps I can help him. At an earlier sitting, the hon. Member for West Suffolk made the very helpful distinction between lottery funding that replaces Government expenditure, and thus breaches additionality, and lottery funding that extends Government expenditure. The latter does not breach additionality. The Committee accepted that distinction. Will the hon. Gentleman give an example of lottery expenditure replacing core Government funding?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but he has not answered my question. I shall press him on that later, when he responds to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The Minister tried to take my comments in vain. His Department already spends money on librarian training, and the TECs already provide money, which comes from Government grant, for IT training. So I do not understand his point, as precedents exist for the problems that we have identified. The Bill--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whether they are on the Front Bench or the Back Bench, hon. Members undertand that interventions are not speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My hon. Friend answered the Minister's point better than I could have.
<P>
The Bill will not be all good news for Ministers. Regardless of Department--culture, health, education and so on--and of how much the good causes expand to support the Government's re-election campaign as the next general election looms, Ministers must sit down with hard-nosed Treasury men for each year's spending round. Those men will say, ``We don't think you should have more money from us. Why can't you get it from the national lottery?'' It is a two-way street. Ministers will not always benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend almost understates the extent to which Ministers have tied themselves up. They will never be able to convince the Treasury that any new public expenditure should be funded from core moneys rather than from the national lottery. The Treasury will always want to say no to public spending, and it now has the perfect weapon to allow it to do so. The Bill will mean that Ministers will be prevented from spending money on new projects and taking the credit. They will rue the day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That was my point entirely. I bow to my hon. Friend's greater experience of Treasury matters. The Treasury is made up of men who like to say no. They will be emboldened in saying no to those Ministers--
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> That is something we have not heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Oh, has the Minister not heard the word yet? None the less, Treasury officials will be emboldened to say no to those Ministers and their successors when they engage in their annual tussles over spending.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> This morning the hon. Gentleman alleged that the Bill will provide an opportunity for the Government to reduce their spending commitments by replacing them with lottery funding. If he cannot produce evidence to back up that statement, will he withdraw it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> There is no evidence yet, because the Bill is not law. Enough evidence to keep the hon. Gentleman satisfied will become available when it is enacted, and I have dealt with that point comprehensively. If the hon. Gentleman disagrees, he is entitled to make his own speech if he catches your eye, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My basic point relates to the acid test of who will take the credit. We all know what is behind the Bill. It will give Labour Ministers in other Departments the chance to take the credit for spending that is not funded by taxation or by Government spending plans, but by the lottery.
<P>
The arm's-length principle is at the core of clause 6 and washes throughout the Bill. Therefore it deserves a modest amount of discussion. The principle is fundamental to the success and credibility of the lottery, which is similar in some respects to the monarchy. The monarchy is above, not about, politics and that is why it has endured many ups and downs over the years and why it will remain after this Government.
<P>
The lottery should also be above politics. Being seen to be above politics is important to its perceived integrity among those who buy tickets every week and those who apply for grants for good causes. People feel passionately about their applications for lottery money and they sometimes involve hon. Members in their campaigns. Applicants for grants need to believe in the credibility of the lottery.
<P>
I know that you, Mr. Gale, said that you did not want a lengthy debate on health, but I wish to touch on the subject briefly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Before my hon. Friend moves on, will he tell us whether he has had the opportunity to study the notes on clauses, in particular the reference to the New Opportunities Fund? The note on clause 6 clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``NOF alone would receive NOF-specific directions, giving''--[Interruption]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Three private conversations are going on while an hon. Member has the Floor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> The note on clause 6 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``NOF alone would receive NOF-specific directions, giving specific targets and instructions on each of the NOF initiatives.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that not show that the New Opportunities Fund will be different from existing distribution bodies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. The New Opportunities Fund will be a new animal. No one, least of all the existing distribution bodies, should lose sight of that fact.
<P>
I wish to refer to examples from my own experience that demonstrate that we are not discussing esoteric, theoretical or theological issues. We are debating real issues that affect real people making real applications for lottery money. Some people's pet projects will not be successful simply because of the application of the principles set out in clause 6.
<P>
There is not much new in the Government's proposals for spending. For example, the length of waiting lists is an important political issue. When we were in government, the then Opposition chided us endlessly about the length of waiting lists. I know from my experience as a parliamentary private secretary in the Department of Health that using waiting lists is a rather simplistic way of looking at the delivery of health care, but in crude political terms, they are the acid test that politicians often invite people to apply.
<P>
The Government pledged to reduce waiting lists by 100,000. They have failed to meet that pledge and have increased waiting lists by 100,000. What has been described as ``an early pledge'' has become a late pledge. We are assured it will be met, but not told when.
<P>
Tremendous pressures will be exerted to siphon money for the good cause--no one can deny that it is a good cause--of reducing waiting lists. If the pledge on waiting lists becomes ever more difficult to meet--let us leave aside the question of healthy living centres for a moment--does the Minister envisage money from the national lottery being used to reduce waiting lists by paying for more operations and consultants? That would be a good example of a project that is the opposite of one that fails to meet the additionality test that I already asked the Minister to describe.
<P>
The proposal for healthy living centres is a headline-getting product of spin doctors. It does not say anything new or clever. As was made clear, GP fundholding has given impetus to those centres. In my constituency, the district council of Wealden has initiated a project in which GPs prescribe not drugs or tablets, but exercise in leisure centres. That has paid dividends and has had a tremendous effect, especially in improving the general health of older patients and reducing the number of visits that they make to GPs. Prevention is better than cure.
<P>
In an intervention on the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) in an earlier sitting, I mentioned a project in my constituency to move an entire lighthouse called Belle Tout from a crumbling cliff--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Banks:</B> But not to Tottenham.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): It could play in the back four.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> No, the lighthouse will not be moved to Tottenham: that would absorb most of this year's budget for the national lottery, and it would not be popular with the hon. Member for Tottenham.
<P>
The project to move--lock, stock and barrel--the much-loved Belle Tout lighthouse a few yards away from the coastline enjoys enormous support from my constituents. It would prevent it falling into the sea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> But one could not put it on a hill top.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I can see why the hon. Gentleman is a Minister--at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> So the hon. Gentleman has heard something about that too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Well, Steven Norris gets my vote.
<P>
<B>The Chariman:</B> Order. My patience is being tested: will Committee members return to the stand part debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Belle Tout is a worthy and expensive project and Mr. Mark Roberts and others have worked hard to produce complex designs and drawings for moving it. That is a good example of the sort of project that might be squeezed out when the Bill comes to fruition.
<P>
The main theme of my speech is whether the Bill will increase the likelihood that excellent projects, such as that to move Belle Tout, will receive funding. My answer is a resounding no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the number of bids will always exceed the amount of money that comes in? If the Government take money to put into a new good cause, other good causes will receive less money. The Bill will work to their detriment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> There have always been disappointed applicants, but there will be more of them.
<P>
My final example is the Chalk Farm project in my constituency, which is a hotel that has been taken over by a charity that provides training for young people with mental disabilities. The project has proved a roaring success under the redoubtable leadership of Jill Parker and her colleagues. However, it was refused a lottery grant. I have had long discussions with the project's managers about why that happened and about how the application might be re-cast. I doubt whether Ministers will find themselves photographed in front of those projects for which the Bill fails to secure funding.
<P>
You have wisely given Committee members some latitude during this morning's debate, Mr. Gale. I am surprised that the Liberal Democrats have failed to recognise its importance--neither of that party's representatives has bothered to turn up today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is particularly ironic and disappointing that Liberal Democrat Committee members are not here to discuss a clause that deals with the arm's-length principle. That principle was invented by Lord Keynes who, by the most generous definition of greatness, was one of the three great Liberal Democrats of the 20th century. The absence of those Members shows not only contempt for the Committee's proceedings, but a lack of regard for their party's history.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> It is an insult to a great pantomime dame.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am not sure that Lord Keynes could ever be described as that. I want to reach a conclusion today and I think that it was Lord Keynes who said that, in the long run, we are all dead. However, in the long run I shall be ruled out of order.
<P>
I have served on a number of Standing Committees, Mr. Gale, and you have served on many more. One is normally deluged with representations and briefings from interested organisations. Unless my mail is going astray, there has been a paucity of such representations, discounting the odd helpful--if late--letter from Ministers. I have had hardly any representations from the distributing bodies. It is rather like the dog that did not bark. I wonder whether pressure, subtle or otherwise, is being placed on some of those organisations by a Government who are not known for taking dissent lightly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Perhaps the explanation is that members of the arts community are worried that they will not be invited to one of the soirees given by the Prime Minister or the Minister for Sport at No. 10 Downing Street.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not sure that that has anything to do with the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I have received a briefing note from the National Lottery Charities Board. The first paragraph rather limply states that the Board
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``accepts that some of the funds that would otherwise have been allocated to it will now go to the new distributing body.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a blinding statement of the obvious. The use of the word ``accepts'' implies a lack of enthusiasm for the Bill and, I feel, for the board in that respect.
<P>
the note also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the sixth new distributor (the NOF) has been allocated &#163;200m beyond the end of the current licence, whilst the existing five distributors have not been given any firm indications past September 2001.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With classical understatement, the board says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Clarification of whether this is the Government's intention would be welcome.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I too would welcome such clarification. Perhaps the Minister can provide it.
<P>
The board also refers to the expectation that projects set up under the NOF will continue for some time after the end of funding through the NOF. The board is quite reasonably concerned that organisations such as itself might be expected to fund those projects after NOF funding has ceased. That is reminiscent of the controversy over pump-priming versus continuous funding, on which we touched on a previous occasion.
<P>
In conclusion, the Minister has a great deal to answer for regarding clause 6. My challenge to him is that the concept of additionality has been stretched to breaking point. I may, however, be prepared to reconsider my view if he gives me one example of a project that might fail his new additionality test.
<P>
<H5>11.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to Conservative Members for making their weak position so clear. It is bizarre that they should seek to prevent clause 6 standing part of the Bill, because in tabling amendment No. 9 they made it clear that they entirely support the New Opportunities Fund. That amendment specifies projects that they believe that the fund supports, relating to education, the environment and children's play. Conservative Members support the content of the clause and yet seek to prevent it standing part of the Bill. That is a deeply confused position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The Minister is talking complete nonsense, as he knows perfectly well. Given the arithmetic of the Committee, anything that we propose is likely to be voted down. We are entitled to seek clear definitions regarding any clause that is likely to stand part of the Bill and to attempt to tighten those definitions if necessary. The notion that that is a contradictory position is complete nonsense, as the Minister knows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Conservative Members are deeply confused. That is why they have not discussed the content of clause 6 during the stand part debate, but have concentrated merely on the two concepts of additionality and arm's length and their implications. The Committee has discussed additionality at considerable length. All hon. Members agree that it is an important principle and that it is hard to define. That is why the Committee rejects the amendment that tries, rather inadequately, to define additionality. It is a slippery concept.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk contributed helpfully towards the definition of additionality when he made the distinction between expenditure that replaces core Government funding and expenditure that is added on to such funding. The first of those options would undoubtedly breach the additionality principle, but the second, as the hon. Gentleman conceded, would not.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne was incapable of finding an example of expenditure that had replaced Government funding. That holds true throughout the history of the national lottery, under the previous Government and during the past year under this Government. The distinction made by the hon. Member for West Suffolk between replacing and adding on is helpful. It demonstrates that, in common with the previous Government, this Government wish to abide by and maintain the principle of additionality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I do not want to have a go at the Minister personally, but what he is saying is preposterous. He said that no breach of additionality took place under the previous Government and that that had continued under this Government. Obviously, that is because the Government have had no legislative basis on which to do it, which is precisely what the Bill is destined to provide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. Additionality could be breached at any time by the financing of a project. The hon. Gentleman has not been able to give one example to prove that that has ever happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I do not want to prolong matters, but as the Minister is referring to me, I must answer him. As a Government, we may not have got everything right when we set up the national lottery, but we did not breach the principle. I know of no specific example of the present Government's having breached that principle, but they clearly intend to breach it through the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> We totally refute that suggestion. We believe in the additionality principle--and in its practice. It is vital to make a distinction between grant-in-aid, or core Government expenditure, and expenditure by the national lottery. Just as the previous Government held fast to the principle of additionality, so shall we. We shall no more breach additionality that did the previous Government.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the hon. Member for Salisbury had asked what had changed. With regard to additionality, nothing has changed. The Opposition are making an enormous meal out of something about which both sides of the House agree. The same is true of the arm's length principle associated with additionality. There is nothing new.
<P>
The New Opportunities Fund will operate at arm's length, and its chairman and the board members will be wholly independent of the Government, which is what Lord Keynes and others proposed for the original Arts Council. That principle has guided non-departmental government bodies ever since, and it will continue with the New Opportunities Fund.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am sorry to say that the Minister's emollient words have been rendered useless by the actions and words of his hon. Friends on Second Reading--and, indeed, in Committee so far. Many Labour Back Benchers have made it clear that they see the New Opportunities Fund as an ideal way to redress the balance. They say that they want lottery funds to be spent in a more balanced way--that is, in their own constituencies rather than elsewhere. They were appealing to the Secretary of State to ensure that that happened. Even Labour Members do not believe what the Minister has been saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am not responsible for the beliefs, or even the words, of those who sit on the Labour Back Benches. I am being invited to respond to the debate on behalf of the Government. I wish to make it clear that the Government believe in the arm's-length principle. The distinction, which seems to have escaped the Opposition, is that although the Secretary of State is defining the scope of the programme for the New Opportunities Fund through the Bill, the judgment of the chairman and the board members will be independent and at arm's length from the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> If, indeed, the principles of additionality and arm's length are to be maintained as the Minister suggests, why on earth is the Secretary of State taking those additional powers? Why cannot the sixth good cause be set up as an exact replica in legislative terms of the five existing causes? The Minister has been utterly misleading, because the notes on clauses state that the establishment of the New Opportunities Fund

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``gives the Secretary of State an order-making power to specify such initiatives and a power to give directions to NOF concerning the initiatives''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A clear distinction is made in the notes on clauses, which state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Like the other Lottery distributors, NOF will operate at arm's length from Government . . . However, rather than providing general support to its sectors as the other distributors do, it will support a rolling programme of specific initiatives. These will be determined''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this is the crucial point--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by the Secretary of State by order''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The whole operating framework for the new cause is entirely different from the existing five causes. If the Government wished for there to be no conflict on the question of additionality or the arm's-length principle, there was no need to frame the Bill in such a way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The Opposition are being a bit thick. The distinction between defining the scope and direction of the new good cause and inhibiting the choice of projects and independent actions of the chair and board members seems to evade them. That is a bit sad.
<P>
	The hon. Member for West Suffolk asked whether the fund could be set up under the same formula as the other good cuases. He should go back and read the 1993 Act because the other lottery funds have two different bases. Because the charities board and the millennium commission are not matching and working with the grant-in-aid money, they are on a different basis from the arts, heritage and sports boards. The hon. Gentleman should study the Bill before he makes the assumption that one model is to be adopted. We are choosing a marginally different model under the clause, but both the additionality and arm's length principles are enshrined in the Bill and will be maintained by the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> The directions that have been issued in respect of proposed new section 43C state that the distributing fund under the New Opportunities Fund
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will have complied with this Direction so long as the funding outcomes . . . are no more than 0&#183;5 per cent. more or less than the cash value of each percentage.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That implies a degree of direction and prescription that did not apply to the previous distributing funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The definition of percentages was inherent in the original Bill and it is repeated in this Bill. There is a variation in the percentages in the present bill, but the idea that national lottery legislation should define percentages existed from the beginning, when the other party was in power. The Opposition are making a meal of the matter. The New Opportunities Fund is set up not to give general support for a sector at the command of the Secretary of State; but for a rolling programme of specific initiatives. It defines the focus more tightly for the Secretary of State, but the independence of the arm's length operation of the chair and the board members is sacrosanct, and that is important. The projects that will be chosen will be not the Goverment's projects, but those of the New Opportunities Fund. the Opposition may not like that, but they will have to accept it.
<P>
Opposition Members repeated their arguments about whether the fund will damage the other funds. The hon. Member for Eastbourne asked whether it would support hosptial beds or text books. He wanted an example of Government expenditure that would not be eligible for the fund and, inadvertently, gave two such examples. The fund will not fund hospital beds or text books.
<P>
I am happy to repeat that assurance that I gave at an earlier sitting: with regard to the revenue future of the lottery in general and the NOF, the Government have no plans to alter the funding of existing good causes, beyond those that have been announced, which are the reduction of the millennium share to 13 1/3  per cent. and the increase in the share for the new good cause to 20 per cent. in the autumn of 1999. That applies to the year 2001 and beyond. I understood that Opposition Members accepted that assurance from the Government, but they seem to be questioning it today. I give it yet again: the other good causes will not be damaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for responding to my test. He seems adamant that the funds will not be used to finance hospital beds--or to shorten waiting lists, which was how I put it. He is equally adamant, however, that they will be used to support healthy living centres. Once the Minister gets away from the definition of principle, he seems to be thrown back to dealing with cases on an ad hoc basis. How would he define the principle that distinguishes between spending on the one project but not on the other?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am happy to give such a definition. One matter is core Government expenditure--expenditure that the Government are presently making. If the lottery fund replaced such Government expenditure, that would breach the principle of additionality, but it will not replace such Government expenditure, so does not breach the principle of additionality. The Committee may be becoming a trifle impatient with the slow learning curve of the Opposition on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I will roll up two points into one, if I may, Mr. Gale. First, the Minister has repeated the time-honoured Whitehall formulation that he has ``no plans'' to do something. Those of us who have been around for a reasonable time know exactly how much value to put on that assurance--not very much, I fear.
<P>
Secondly--this is a point that the Minister has not yet addressed; perhaps he intended to do so later in his speech--what happens if the calculations are wrong? He will be aware that the good causes are concerned about that. If Camelot raises more than &#163;10 billion during its licence period, how will the extra money be distributed? If it raises less, how will cuts be implemented? As the Minister will be aware, the New Opportunities Fund has a defined cake given to it, whereas the other good causes do not, so they feel that they would lose out.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> If the hon. Gentleman had been attending to previous debates, he would know that we have covered that point. In either of those eventualities, the Government would consult the good causes about what to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The seamless flow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> It is a little rich that when the Opposition seek assurances from the Government and are given them, the Opposition will not accept them, but say that they do not believe a word of them. Why then do they seek assurances? When they ask for examples and are given them, they reject them. They are a hard Opposition to please. Perhaps that is in the nature of Oppositions. We have some experience of opposition and we know that it is a frustrating world, in which the permanent itch of opposition means that Government statements are never satisfactory.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk mentioned the millennium festival fund and was worried that it would siphon off money from the other good causes against the will of the bodies concerned. Unfortunately, he got his figures wrong. He said that &#163;20 million was to be taken from each of the good causes; actually, &#163;15 million to be taken from four of them and &#163;20 million from the millennium fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Was that for cash up front?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> No. Those are the correct figures. If the hon. Gentleman had done his homework, he would have known them. Perhaps he may be encouraged to read the Bill and the Government's proposals a little more carefully before our next sitting.
<P>
Leaving that point aside, the hon. Gentleman was confused. He said, ``Of course we want to celebrate the millennium.'' The way to do so is to spend some money around the country to facilitate different means of celebrations. The hon. Gentleman wants to celebrate the millennium, but criticises the means to do so--the contribution on the part of each of the distributing bodies to millennium festival funds. What does he want? Does he want us to celebrate the millennium, in which case he ought to welcome the fact that each distributing body has contributed &#163;15 million or not, in which case his criticism is perfectly fair but rather stupid?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> We have received correspondence, for example, from the Sports Council. It has expressed concern about the future pattern of lottery funding for sport and its ability to pay for projects as it would like, given the arrival of the new sixth cause. If the Minister believes that the bodies are happy to contribute that money--contrary to what such bodies have said about the overall picture--will he publish correspondence demonstrating their spontaneous eruption of desire to help with millennium celebrations by giving their lottery money?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The distributing bodies' actions are clear. They have all agreed to contribute because they too want to celebrate the millennium through their particular interests--heritage, sport, the environment and so on. They have been only too happy to contribute to a pool for such celebrations. I suspect that there will be initiatives in the hon. Gentleman's constituency of West Suffolk and that money from the millennium festival fund will be sought to celebrate the millenium there. I hope that such initiatives are successful and that the hon. Gentleman will, on reflection, support them. He should realise that they could not be supported had not the distribution bodies sensibly contributed &#163;15 million each, with &#163;20 million from the millennium fund. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He wants the initiatives to succeed, but complains about the money; that is a strange and confused position.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman went on to complain about our draft directions--I emphasise that they are draft directions--and his hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne complained about the flexibility on matching funds, saying that it was a dastardly political plot and that we would use the money for our own ends. We have introduced that flexibility because we, unlike the previous Government, listened to the cries of pain from small applicants all over the country, who say that it is difficult for them to find matching funding. Some excellent projects could not benefit under the previous regime because they were inhibited by the rigidity of the 1993 Act. That seems daft and we have sought to change it by introducing a degree of flexibility.
<P>
If the hon. Member for West Suffolk and his hon. Friends listened to what their constituents said about the difficulty of finding matching funding, they would welcome that flexibility rather than trying to make a political point by accusing the Government of hatching some awful plot. Labour Members have for some time been writing to the Government--to the previous one, who ignored them, and then to the new one--asking for flexibility on matching funding because good projects have not been supported. I hope that all members of the Committee will accept the need for flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister talked about listening to constituents. The most recent complaint I have received is about an application for a sports centre in a very deprived area of Ashford, which has been turned down. It is a joint bid by the local authority, a local further education college and the local community; the Sports Council told them that it was the sort of bid that used to get through, but which was now more problematic because less money would be available in future. That is the reality of what is happening on the ground as a result of the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> We have been over that ground ad infinitum. The causes will get exactly the money that was forecast and which they understood they would receive. We cannot revisit debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> On that point about the smaller, less significant aspects of applications, had I been able to contribute earlier, I would have referred to some of the comments made by Labour Members on Second Reading. They referred to specific expectations that they had of the Bill. Indeed, they were so specific that they demonstrated the truth of what will happen under the Bill. Labour Members would not have such high and specific hopes if they did not think that the Government, with their new, hands-on lottery ride, could not deliver them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The Government do not have a hands-on approach to the lottery; it will continue to be operated at arm's length from the Government. The Government seek to reform and enhance the good work carried out under the lottery for several years. We believe that it could do better work and that is why we have introduced the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne complained that he had not received briefing on specific points. He seemed to attribute that to some dastardly political plot to silence those bodies. I think that he said that they are recipients of Government largesse and favour and, therefore, will not criticise the Government. However, he will agree that most of the people on those bodies were appointed by the previous Government. There have been precious few new appointments, although, sadly, Lord Rothschild, who did superbly well as chairman of the Heritage Lottery Fund, has stood down. The reason that those people have not complained is underneath the hon. Gentleman's nose: they approve of what the Government are doing. They are totally independent. [Laughter.] If the hon. Member for West Suffolk were to ask the chairmen and members of the boards whether they are independent of Government, they would sharply tell him that they are wholly independent. They have given plenty of evidence of that and they will continue to do so. It is their very independence that we prize.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I hope that this will be the last time that I intervene in the Minister`s speech. Perhaps it is just my lawyer's mind, but does not he find it intrinsically unlikely that none of the bodies have even the teeniest criticism of the proposals? If, as he says, we must assume--as part of the seamless flow of consultation, which never seems to be minuted--that they are absolutely 100 per cent. happy and over the moon about the proposals, why would they not write to tell us so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Because they do not need to. Indeed, Mr. Gale, when you and I first served our time in Committee, hundreds and hundreds of amendments were tabled. We were then serving, in this Room, on the Standing Committee considering the legislation to privatise British Telecom. This Bill has so much general support that the Opposition are scrabbling around to find a tiny handful of amendments. I do not want to provoke them, but they have not tabled one amendment to the next group of clauses.
<P>
The truth is that the Bill is popular. The public, the distribution bodies and, if they are honest with themselves, the Opposition--after all, they created the lottery--support it. The Opposition are desperately scrabbling around to find amendments to table, but the truth is that, like the rest of the country, they have the good sense to realise that the Bill is thoroughly constructive and widely welcomed by their constituents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Under clause 6(4), the total sum provided for in the directions in new section 43C is &#163;1.29 billion, not &#163;1 billion. Is that because part of that sum will extend beyond the existing licence period for some of the good causes? If so, has the Minister given similar undertakings to the existing good causes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. He is right to say that the New Opportunities Fund has been allocated &#163;200 million beyond the year 2001, but the Government have no plans to stop the existing good causes being funded beyond 2001 either. We believe that the lottery has staying power and popularity and that it is doing good work, so we expect the funding to continue beyond 2001. I hope that the Opposition support that and that they too believe that the lottery--which they set up in the first place--is doing good, practical work and deserves the support of the House up to 2001 and beyond.
<P>
We are debating clause stand part and, therefore, the content of the clause, which is about establishing the New Opportunities Fund. If the Opposition would allow themselves to consider the fund objectively, they would understand that it is an excellent initiative, which is widely welcomed both by their constituents and by those of all hon. Members. The Opposition should listen to the people, who want those good causes and initiatives.
<P>
The Opposition made it clear in another place that they support the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts. The Opposition welcome parts of the Bill but, for reasons that elude me, and have not been made clear in our debate on these three clauses, they object to the New Opportunities Fund. They are deeply mistaken. If they listened to their constituents, they would realise that there is good work to be done by the fund, which they would be wise to support.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> The Minister spoke about consultation and the pleasure that the public have in what is going on. When the consultation process took place, only 94 members of the public responded. However, responses were received from more than 400 organisations with a vested interest in getting funds from the lottery. Such a consultation process has little merit. Does not the Minister believe that more consultation should have taken place before the initiative was taken?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I cannot remember the exact number, but tens of thousands of leaflets and copies of the White Paper were distributed--I think that there were about 35,000. It was a huge public exercise, meant to alert people to what this reforming Bill would do. To be objective and fair, the hon. Gentleman should realise that professional organisations and others directly concerned are more likely to have the time, the expertise and the legal backing to respond to White Papers.
<P>
The number of members of the public who respond to White Papers is always small. The organisations and institutions most affected are most likely to respond. That is generally true of White Papers, and this one was no different. We gave a great deal of publicity to our proposals. Indeed, the Opposition have made some play over the past few months about the fact that the Government are not averse to using the publicity machine. However, we used it in this instance to try to get across to people what was happening.
<P>
If individuals did not respond, I suspect it was because they approved of the new causes. The professional organisations are directly affected, as the hon. Gentleman and others have made clear on several occasions. If there were things wrong with the Bill, or if we had not correctly gauged the mood of the public, we would expect those 400 organisations to be critical of our plans. But they were not critical; they were supportive of our plans because they, like the rest of the public, but unlike the Opposition, recognised that they are good plans.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> The Minister told us that those who did not respond did not respond because they were happy with what was going on. I put it to the Committee that not responding, or abstaining, is itself a response. That should have been taken into account. It is taken into account in elections; so it should be taken into account in consultation with the public. One should not assume that because people have abstained, they want what you are proposing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That really is a little hard. The idea that the 50 million people who did not write in about the Bill were seeking to abstain and thereby demonstrating their objections is a trifle silly. There was plenty of opportunity for individuals and professional bodies to comment on our plans before the Bill was drafted and introduced. We received comments from 400 professional bodies--a substantial number--because many institutions and organisations are affected by the national lottery. It was right and proper that they should run their eye over our proposals and ask themselves how they would affect them--whether they would help or harm them. The vast majority of those comments--indeed, almost all of them--were thoroughly constructive and made no criticism of the Bill.
<P>
People recognise, as the Opposition appear to have difficulty doing, that the original intention of the lottery as introduced by the previous Government was thoroughly good. The previous Government introduced the legislation rather quickly. I criticised them for that at the time, but with hindsight they were probably right to do so. However, in speeding on with the legislation, they got some things wrong. That is perhaps inevitable with a new, pioneering form of legislation. Generally, they did rather well, but we are seeking to make reforms in the Bill, which is why I hope that it will have the Opposition's support.
<P>
If the Opposition will not listen to the public, perhaps they will listen to Conservative Members, such as the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey. As the Secretary of State pointed out on Second Reading, the right hon. Lady wrote a letter to him about a dyslexia centre in her constituency for which she sought funding, asking for his help and advice about how to do so. She recognised that the lottery was doing good work and that such work could be furthered by the New Opportunities Fund.
<P>
The clause, which I hope that the Committee will allow to stand part of the Bill, is a good, constructive and popular initiative. The reason why the Opposition lost the general election is precisely that they had difficulty in listening to the public. Until they start listening to people, they will continue to make the same political mistakes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I thank you again, Mr. Gale, for giving us the opportunity comprehensively to air the issues. The clause goes to the heart of the Bill. Those, including the distribution bodies, who are genuinely concerned about the powers to be vested in the Secretary of State and the future conduct of the national lottery if the Bill achieves Royal Assent, will be grateful that the issues have been comprehensively aired. Undoubtedly, those issues will return to haunt the Government in due course, because they have not satisfactorily addressed them this morning.
<P>
I shall briefly make two or three points. I was rather amused that the Minister sought to criticise us for not having tabled sufficient amendments. If that is an invitation--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I was pointing out that that demonstrated that the Opposition do not have any objections to the Bill. They have made the objections that they do have forcefully and at considerable length this week, but there are not any aspects of the Bill to which they object. That shows great good sense on their part, because the Bill is thoroughly constructive and admirable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I fear that despite that explanation, the Minister is taking chances if he is inviting us to table more amendments. The point about our amendments is that we have sought to concentrate on the areas of most crucial importance--as we have been able to do today for which I thank you again, Mr. Gale. We will table only amendments that seek to clarify the Bill or to highlight its inadequacy.
<P>
The preposterous idea that the distribution bodies are in a state of lobotomised bliss about the Bill is nonsense. That would be as if turkeys were to vote for Chistmas, or as if some poor member of the canine fraternity were to be happy to be approached by the Minister for Sport--when in fact it would run to the nearest kennel in case a photographer from The Times were nearby.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Practising a wet kiss.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I feel sure, Mr. Gale, that you would not want me to comment further.
<P>
The idea that the distribution bodies have a ``seamless flow''--a warm and wonderful relationship--with the Secretary of State, is rather like the idea that he has such a relationship with his great friend the Minister without Portfolio. I, of course, am not suggesting a lack of personal good faith on the Minister's part. Far be it from anyone in the Committee to suggest that such a thing would cross his mind. However, the Bill gives power to the Secretary of State--a power that abuses the fundamental principle on which the national lottery was established and the basis on which public confidence in it grew. The clause opens the door to other Ministers in the future to abuse such powers. We have already heard references to pork barrels, and concerns about the dangers ahead, from members of the Committee.
<P>
The Minister is confused about the question of desirability. He says that we should support the NOF because the projects that it will fund are desirable. We could have a healthy debate about whether it is desirable to train teachers and librarians in information technology, promote preventive medicine through healthy living centres or encourage after-school activities, but I cannot understand why the Minister believes that that is the point. It is a matter not of whether such projects are desirable, but of whether such responsibilties should be funded out of core Government money, for which there are already clear precedents. The net effect will be to reduce the amount of money going to under-resourced areas, such as the arts, sport, heritage and caring charities. The relevant boards have already said why they are dissatisfied and concerned about clause 6.
<P>
I have listened carefully to the Minister and his hon. Friends, but he has not satisfactorily explained the Government`s thinking or given us comfort on the principles that we believe will undermine the credibility of the lottery in the long term. We shall therefore press the matter to a Division.

Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provisions supplemental to section 6</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 10, leave out lines 15 to 23.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to narrow the discretion that the Bill gives to the Secretary of State to specify Government initiatives that will be funded by the NOF. We discussed at some length the broad definitions and the areas that will be covered, which fall under the umbrella of education, training for teachers, healthy living centres and, ultimately, the environment. We believe that it is important to have a tighter definition of what is involved.
<P>
The Minister already knows that we are concerned about the political control that the Bill will give to the Government, and its impact on the good causes already funded by the lottery, so I shall not rehearse our arguments. Our amendment would delete clause 7(2), which amends the National Lottery etc. Act 1993. That subsection extends the scope of the areas on which money from the NOF can be spent. The notes on clauses are not particularly illuminating. They state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subsection (2) inserts one new subsection in section 44 of the 1993 Act (an interpretation section)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I apologise for being technical, but it is necessary to get the appropriate definition.
<P>
It is regrettable that areas covered by the NOF are so ill defined. I hope that the Government have not chosen to be deliberately vague, but the debate presents an opportunity for the Minister to narrow the definitions.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The White Paper mentions certain examples, such as healthy living centres and training in information technology for teachers and librarians. We also have some understanding of the Government's national child care strategy and we await the Green Paper to find out the lottery's role in that. We need a tighter definition to assure the public about the Government's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend can give me some guidance. Does he believe that in providing IT for teachers, recruitment of teachers might fall within the clause on the ground that it is necessary to recruit teachers to train them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is the difficulty. The thrust of the proposals are targeted not on new teachers, who receive IT training at teacher training colleges now, but on existing teachers. However, it is defined in such a broad-brush way that I can understand my hon. Friend's concern. It is regrettable that the Government have such considerable influence on how the definitions will be interpreted. NOF money will be provided for health, education and the environment, which are catch-all phrases that will further damage the arm's length and additionality principles, allowing the Secretary of State to direct money wherever he likes.
<P>
Accepting--as we must--that the Bill will receive Royal Assent and become enacted, the Minister must be more specific on those broad-brush areas. Clause 7 states that a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``project or arrangement shall be regarded for the purposes of this Part as concerned or connected with health, education or the environment notwithstanding that it contains incidental provision . . . which is not concerned or connected with any of those matters; but . . . which is necessary or expedient for the purposes of the project or arrangement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We need some clarification. It sounds a bit Sir Humphrey-like to me, so I hope that the Minister can explain it. It seems to be a Humpty Dumpty Through the Looking Glass definition. It means just what the Minister chooses it to mean; neither more nor less. Or, as the Prime Minister might put it, ``When I said that we do not believe that it would be right to use the lottery money to pay for things which are the Government's responsibilities, I meant except when I change my mind and think that it is right to do so.''. Of course, I paraphrase.
<P>
I have some questions for the Minister. Can he give us assurances about the scope of the projects to be funded by the NOF? Will there be any limits to the scope of initiatives that will be funded? Will the Government consider placing on the New Opportunities Fund the responsibility of ensuring that initiatives do not replace Government spending? The Minister has touched on that important point, which is at the heart of additionality. What areas, connected with health, or not connected with education and the environment could legitimately be funded, under the extremely broad-brush definition of the clause? The White Paper gives some guidance on the sort of areas that the Government have in mind, but we need further definition.

<B>Mr. Prior:</B> The notes on clause 7 gives the example of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``transport to or from a healthy living centre.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We seem to be straying into an area of provision already made by some local authorities. Is not there a risk of local authorities cutting some areas of spending so that they can later demonstrate that that is additional to what they would have done?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid and necessary point. I do not want to get into party political territory, but the reality is that revenue support grants have been low, and we are seeing the impact of that on services--whether transport, education or any other service that councils provide. That is a fact of life. We do not want situations to arise such as that described by my hon. Friend in regard to transportation to and from the healthy living centre, which is a service that goes beyond the essential funding remit of the Bill, whereby local authorities abuse--if that is not too strong a word as again, I do not wish to make a political point--the spirit of the Bill by claiming that a healthy living centre cannot successfully operate if transportation is not paid for in the same way as, for example, an ambulance service.
<P>
Clause 5(8) inserts an interpretation of the 1993 Act in regard to health, education and environment initiatives and states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```education' includes training and the provision of activities for children'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which for anyone who does not know, refers to state-funded playgroups or nursery services. We need to clarify such points, because we are dealing with a grey area. The Government will be able to finance their national child-care strategy from the lottery,--an initiative that would be the responsibility not of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, but of the Secretary of State for Social Security. The fact that overlapping Departments are involved makes it difficult, but lottery funding needs to be protected from rows between central and local Government or between Departments, in which such funding is used as a reason for not working out definitions in those areas. The National Opportunities Fund is being extended into much more broadly definable areas and it is crucial to make such definitions if we are to maintain public confidence in the lottery.
<P>
My own county council spends 70 per cent. of its budget on education. It is a hugely important element of local authorities' functions and they will naturally do anything to try and offload the costs of it onto someone else. We cannot have the new funding set-up being exploited through a lack of definition.
<P>
Clause 5(8) goes on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```the environment' includes the living and social environment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister explain what is meant by that? Such a statement is a broad interpretation of the environment. Environmental protection groups that thought that the Government were setting up a project to protect the environment will be sorely disappointed. One of the groups in my constituency that have been beneficiaries of the lottery was the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Other groups have asked me about the precise definition of the environment under the Bill and wanted to know whether they could acquire lottery funding beyond the present definition.
<P>
What is the living and social environment? Is it wildlife? Does it cover a particular amenity? Does it mean social life?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Is it in order for the Minister for Sport to be in Committee, staring admiringly at a picture of himself in the paper? He is not following the debate with the care that my hon. Friend deserves.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the Chair, although the custom and practice in the House is that it is not in order for hon. Members to read newspapers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I have read the story, and as we are talking about charities, I think that it is probably a case for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The debate is ranging wider than the amendment--as it was before that intervention. Perhaps we can now return to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> As if such definitions were not vague enough, clause 7(2) broadens the room for the Secretary of State to manoeuvre even further by allowing things to be paid for from the New Opportunities Fund even if they fall outside what can be interpreted as being covered under the definition of health, education and the environment.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would explain the type of project that might be excluded from the current definition. I am genuinely concerned about those grey areas that will cause all sorts of difficulties, not only between Departments, but between central and local government. The lottery will be the fall guy or the milch cow for such an approach. Given the new and enhanced role of the Secretary of State, it is in his interests that he should be protected. It would have been better if the Government had taken our advice. We have not given up hope on the New Opportunities Fund--but I dare say that that is a false hope.
<P>
I remind the Committee of what was said in the House of Lords concerning the unique position of the New Opportunities Fund vis-a-vis the Secretary of State. Lord McIntosh of Haringey said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Of course, the relationship between the Secretary of State and the new opportunities fund, as proposed in the Bill, is different from that which exists between the Secretary of State and other lottery distributors. There is no pretence otherwise.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 22 January 1998; Vol. 584, c. CWH 71.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have made our objections to the New Opportunties Fund clear in principle, although we accept that it will come into being. We also object to how it is being set up. I accept that it is difficult for the Minister to reply immediately to the points that I have raised, but I hope that he will work with his officials to ensure that clear definitions are found, because people must have confidence in such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I support my hon. Friend. If the clause were not amended, it would set the seal on the difficulties that could be caused by the New Opportunities Fund, which could be regarded as a political honeypot. An unamended clause 7 will compound the problems because it provides such a loose definition of what can be considered as a good cause under the New Opportunities Fund. That wide definition will excite further cynicism about Ministers' motives in setting up the fund. The amendment would improve clause 7 by tightening the definition.
<P>
The pass was sold by the notes on clauses, which are normally helpful. They stretch even the most elastic definition of good Whitehall prose; they state that subsection (2), which the amendment would delete, clarifies.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``what falls within a project for health, education and the environment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, subsection (2) states that a project can be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``connected with health, education or the environment notwithstanding that it contains incidental provision . . . which is not concerned or connected with any of those matters.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>12.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In fact, under subsection (2), almost anything could be defined as being connected with health, education or the environment--calling it ``clarification'' would have done Sir Humphrey proud. I am sure that the new permanent secretary at the Department--an excellent appointment, which will sharpen up the Department no end--will be grateful to know that officials in the Department can produce, with a straight face, notes on clauses containing such extraordinary use of the English language. The underlying point is that subsection (2) will give Ministers as free a hand as they could conceivably want to define anything as coming within the rubric of health, education or the environment.
<P>
The Committee should agree to the amendment for two reasons, the first of which is the lottery's politicisation, which is clearly undesirable. Without the amendment, the clause will allow politicisation of the lottery to take place across the entire field of public policy. The second reason is the added disrepute into which the clause might bring the lottery.
<P>
The Minister for Arts has graciously admitted that, by and large, the original lottery legislation was correct and that the lottery has done much good work. We all agree that the lottery has been broadly a good thing; it has done good work, and it will continue to do so. However, several of my hon. Friends and I are concerned to ensure that in agreeing to the Bill, the House does not lower the lottery's reputation.
<P>
The lottery's reputation has survived the scandals that attended GTech--it has not affected people's willingness to play the lottery. Public enthusiasm and support for the lottery would be reduced if it were increasingly to be seen as a pot into which Ministers could put their hands for their own purposes.
<P>
I urge the Government to do nothing that endangers the lottery's good reputation for providing, at arm's length, fairly and non-politically, money for good causes. One of the dangers of the clause is that a wide range of projects can be defined as coming under the aegis of the New Opportunities Fund. The application of a small amount of imagination would reveal how far it could range.
<P>
The first project will be the healthy living centres. Under clause 7, however, other projects can be proposed. If they have to prove only that they can improve health, one can imagine projects related to the food industry being eligible for money from the New Opportunities Fund. As Labour Members know, many academic studies show that housing problems contribute to ill health, so some housing projects may be eligible for New Opportunities Fund money. That would increase cynicism.
<P>
Each of the projects will be worth while and quite defensible--I am sure that Labour Members would want to defend them--but if the clause is not amended, it will allow a wide-ranging set of applications being made to the New Opportunities Fund. With that degree of flexibility, Ministers would find it difficult to resist the temptation to steer bids into areas that they found politically convenient. That would be wrong not only in itself, but bad for the long-term health of the lottery.

<P>

<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the matter is made worse because the distributing body will be allowed to solicit bids? It will be in order, under clause 7, for a local authority to be solicited to provide projects that replace activities that the authority can no longer back because of cuts in the revenue support grant. For example, in my constituency, a cut of about &#163;8,000 has been made to peripatetic music teaching.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is meant to be making an intervention not a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. It is essential to think through the implications of the Bill. He gives one vivid example of what could happen--what is likely to happen--if the Bill is not amended. I hope that the Minister recognises the sort of second-order effect of introducing the Bill in this form, which many people would find undesirable.
<P>
I was talkng about health matters and my hon. Friend spoke of education, but the biggest danger arises in terms of the environment. Someone with a reasonably flexible mind and five minutes to spare could jot down almost anything covered by the general terms of the environment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend makes a great point. We can all understand the physical environment, but when we get into the realms of the social environment, we open up a whole spectrum of definitions, which would be difficult to pin down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Indeed, we need look no further than the current expansionist tendencies of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to see that the word ``environment'' is extremely flexible. It is already used in public policy to cover ever-increasing areas of Government activity. That is not entirely due to the empire-building designs of the Deputy Prime Minister. There is some logic to each of the steps: if you care about the environment, you must care about transport, and must deal with matters that used to be dealt with by the Department of Transport; if you care about the environment, you must care about the countryside, so you try to steal some of the rural policies from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; and so on. If the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions can do that, it seems to me that the New Opportunities Fund will be able to do so.
<P>
If Ministers want the New Opportunities Fund to be completely open-ended, if they want a sixth good cause which can ``do such things as we shall in time define'', they should have the honesty to say so. Because of the wide-ranging definition in clause 7(2), they seem to be trying to achieve that by stealth. They are not providing a narrow list of good causes that the New Opportunities Fund could help; they have provided a fuzzily defined set of causes under which almost anything may fall.
<P>
The Minister, in an uncharacteristically tetchy way, said that he was disappointed that we were not accepting his assurances. There are two reasons for that, both of which are relevant to the amendment. First, as they have been expressed, the assurances are just flannel. The Minister says that they have ``no plans'' to do this, and that if they are to do that, they will consult first. Those are not hard assurances. Secondly, the whole tenor of the Bill inspires distrust in the motives of those promoting it. It is presented as expanding and improving what the lottery can do, but it increases the possibility for political control over the distribution of large amounts of lottery money. The looser the definitions, the more suspicion will rise.
<P>
I invite the Government to accept the amendment for their own good. I assume that they do not want to increase the level of cynicism with which many of us approach their motives for introducing the provisions. By accepting the amendment, they would decrease it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to the Opposition for having tabled the amendment, because it gives us the opportunity to clarify an important element of clause 7(2). It is clear from the debate that the Opposition have not fully grasped its intention. They are pressing the important point of how far the areas will stretch; it is absolutely right and proper for them to do so, and for us to respond.
<P>
The purpose of subsection (2) is to permit elements of an application to a fund, that do not relate specifically to its core purpose but are necessary for that purpose, to be realised. Some of the remarks of the hon. Members for Ashford and for West Suffolk have been slightly confused. They questioned whether the subsection would allow the definition of what we mean by health, education and the environment to be endlessly elastic. If they read the subsection, they will find that it does not widen the definition of health, education and the environment; it provides that those elements necessary for the purpose of a project should be allowed. If there are elements of an application without which the purpose agreed by the fund and the applicants could not be realised, it appears to us daft that such elements should not be funded and should fall. For example, an application for a door should also allow for hinges. Hinges are not part of a door, but without hinges, the door could not be funded. We intend by the subsection to provide for those elements necessary for the purpose, not to widen the purpose itself. I hope that the Committee will accept that.
