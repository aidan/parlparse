O'Connor:</strong>
                           </em> The main debate concerning the Bill is on
privatisation. We believe that consumers can get a fair deal whether
the Royal Mail is in public or private hands; we can also get a bad
deal in either the public sector or the private sector. The Government
have decided that the private sector is the best option. The challenge
as we see it is to ensure that consumers get a fair deal in that new
world. We are concerned that there are elements of the Bill, especially
on the regulatory regime, that could mean that consumer protection is
diminished. We ask Parliament to ensure that those provisions are
strengthened so that consumers do not lose
out.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
general, there is a lot in the Bill that we welcome. In particular we
recognise the benefits of separating the post office network from Royal
Mail. There are risks, especially for rural communities, at a time when
the post office network has had to go through quite significant changes
to its business model. Provided that there are adequate safeguards in
place, we believe that a separate Post Office Ltd will be better placed
to meet the challenges of what is a vital, but ailing, British
institution.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000023">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are glad to see support in the Bill for the universal service
obligation, which we regard as a fundamental concern for consumers. As
the body set up by Parliament to protect consumer rights in postal and
other markets, we have done a lot of research among consumers, and we
have found that the universal service is still highly relevant and much
valued.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000024">&#160;</a>

points. You mentioned that there are some provisions in the Bill that
you think would potentially reduce consumer protection. It would be
great if you could expand on that. Secondly, you welcomed the
separation of the Post Office and Royal Mail. Could you comment on how
important you think the inter-business agreement and getting longevity
on it would be in ensuring that post offices survive and that consumers
will therefore be protected by having facilities close at
hand?<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000025">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I shall deal with the last point before
handing over to my colleagues on how consumer protection may change in
the new world. The inter-business agreement constitutes one third of
the income of post offices, and it is clearly an essential part of
their business. Whatever happens going forward, even if this Bill did
not exist, we would have to do something to make the post office
network more viable and more valued by consumers, so it has to go
through a significant change. We are concerned that if the
inter-business agreement falls away it will be badly damaged, so we
would like to see the inter-business agreement survive as long as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000026">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly,
you cannot force a private sector company to always do business with
the post office network. I was glad to see that Moya Greene could not
envisage a situation in which they did not work with the post office
network. I can envisage such a situation in the future. Clearly, that
can only happen when Post Office Ltd is more able to stand on its own
feet, so we would like to see that arrangement last as long as
possible. We would also like to see provisions in the Bill that define
the

                           </div>number of access points—the distribution of access
points—with which Royal Mail must deal to support. We
don’t want to rig the market, but we want to see consumers
having security about access points, so we would like to see more in
the Bill about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are unclear, and we would value guidance and something in the public
domain, about how long you can impose such an agreement. We do not know
whether it is five years or 10 years. The longer the better from our
point of view, but we do not yet
know.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of the changes to consumer protection, there are many hard-won
elements of consumer protection in the current system, mainly in the
licence agreements. These will fall away, and many of the statements in
the Bill about what the regulator, Ofcom, can do are in terms of
“Ofcom may.” We would like to see instances of
“Ofcom must,” and my colleague, Robert, will enumerate
two or three areas in which it should be a
“must”.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000029">&#160;</a>

talk about the areas in which we see

Hammond:</strong>
                           </em> We are primarily concerned about the lack of
continuity. The idea is that, as the new regime beds down,
substantially the existing licence conditions roll over into the new
world. That is absolutely understandable and fine, but schedule 9,
paragraph 4 to the Bill actually allows for the exclusion of the
consumer protection provisions, which is very worrying indeed for us.
As Mike as mentioned, in various aspects of the current regime, either
Royal Mail or other postal operators have to do something but in the
new regime, that is entirely a discretionary matter for Ofcom to
decide. Some examples are in the areas of complaint handling and
redress, which we think are fundamental to consumers’ rights.
They are also enshrined at an EU level in the directive, and we have
some concerns about how that is viewed in the Bill as
drafted.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also, as Mike has alluded to, the provision of information. We are
entitled to receive, and do receive from Royal Mail, as part of their
licence condition, figures about mail integrity, which is basically the
security of the mail—mail that gets damaged, lost or stolen. It
is on a highly confidential basis, but it enables us to examine those
figures in quite a lot of detail, to have bilateral discussions with
Royal Mail and to sort out any areas in which we feel that a bit of a
problem may be
emerging.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000032">&#160;</a>

also get information regarding delivery and collection exceptions,
where either consumers do not wish to receive mail or Royal Mail is not
prepared to go and deliver. Particularly in remoter areas, that can be
quite an issue. We receive details on that, which we closely monitor.
We advocate on behalf of affected areas, and we try to liaise with
Royal Mail to find a suitable solution. Going to the regulator is the
very last option, and by and large we are successful in our bilateral
conversations with Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000033">&#160;</a>

Lyonette:</strong>
                           </em> Yes. That is primarily our purpose in
giving evidence today. We haven’t studied in detail all of the
Bill’s provisions, and we are not a source of expertise on
consumer protection per se, but we think this really is an opportunity
for the Post Office. We understand that the Bill requires the Post
Office to report on who they are serving, and at the moment we are
concerned that many of the financial services available through the
Post Office are actually very mainstream financial services;
it’s a partnership primarily with Bank of
Ireland.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
recognise that the Post Office is a vital institution. Many of the 22
million people who use the Post Office each week aren’t able to
access mainstream financial services, particularly unsecured personal
loans, through Bank of Ireland. We would like to see some
thinking—we know that the coalition is engaged with
this—on how the Post Office could be opened up, which would help
the credit union sector to gain the scale that many MPs, from all
parties, would like to see. That would also help the Post Office itself
by increasing transaction
revenue.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have evidence from Pollok in Glasgow, where a credit union and a post
office are already working closely together, that footfall for both
entities went up when they collocated and started to share staffing,
and so on. So we think that there is a great opportunity, although
perhaps there should not be an obligation, for the Post Office to
ensure that, with the public subsidy that it receives, it is able to
serve many of the people on the lowest incomes, who are not
particularly well served by the commercial
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000037">&#160;</a>

endorse. Our research shows very clearly that many consumers on low
incomes, and many unbanked people, strongly trust the Post Office and
would be interested in a wider range of banking products aimed at their
needs. That would, of course, deliver a step change for credit unions,
and the benefits for financial inclusion could be considerable
indeed.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000038">&#160;</a>

                        </em> Maybe I can pick up on that. I
should say that Post Office Ltd approached us about that, so it is not
a wild idea. Post Office came to us three years ago and said,
“We recognise our strengths—we have 11,500
counters—but we haven’t got the product set for people on
low income across the piece in terms of financial services.” The
Post Office card account has a very limited functionality, and it is
not really a good transactional product for people in the wider sense.
The Post Office recognised our strengths in terms of the product set,
and it was they who initiated the discussions about whether there was
an imaginative way in which people would be able to walk into a post
office and transact with their credit union, pretty much doing all they
could do if they had walked into the shop of the credit union. We have
worked on that ever since. I am delighted that the coalition has
engaged with that, and that Ministers and their officials are looking
at it and how it might
work.<p class="tabbed">

in place in perpetuity. Royal Mail may be a private company, and I
don’t think you could force them to do business with a
particular range of outlets. They have to have commercial freedom
eventually to go and do a deal with someone else, but that, we hope,
will be quite a long way in the future, because the change in the
business model that Post Office Ltd must go through in order to be
sustainable is really quite significant and they need as long a period
as possible when they have that significant income. So we are not
saying that it has to be there for ever, but we want as long a time
period as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000041">&#160;</a>

to ensure through the Bill that the universal service provider, Royal

that there must be <em>x</em> outlets and a certain distribution. Without
such requirements, there is a danger that Royal Mail could cut out Post
Office Ltd at some future stage and do a deal with someone who offered
a smaller and—as far as we are concerned—inadequate
number of outlets. We are very conscious that the majority of post
offices are in rural areas and perform such a vital function that we
would like to see some protections in the Bill to ensure that in
future, although Royal Mail will not have to do business with Post
Office Ltd, they have to do business with someone who offers the same
scope and distribution currently offered by Post Office

instance to look at introducing a measure that reflected

align closely to existing levels of post office provision. That would
mean that the Post Office would be very well placed to bid for that
work in future and would reflect the considerable importance of the
post office network’s being able to offer universal reach. When
we are talking about the mails contract, obviously in the first
instance we are talking about the importance of universal access to

                           </em> Consumer Focus recently completed a
significant piece of research in conjunction with Postcomm that looked
at consumer needs as opposed to their wants in terms of a universal
service obligation. Clearly we all want a gold-plated service at next
to nothing but in the real world that does not exist. So we have tried
to tease out what consumers would accept as a postal service that
reflects their needs and lifestyles today as opposed to the pre-digital
age of years gone by. Some very interesting figures have come out. For
example, in Scotland that percentage goes up to 99% of all businesses
using Royal Mail to communicate with their customers and with other
businesses. The picture is the same whatever part of the UK you look
at. Whether it is Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland or England, the
universality of the need for a USO is
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000060">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
seems to us that the Bill could be missing a trick inasmuch as at the
moment Royal Mail delivers letters Monday to Saturday and there seems
to be some sort of option whether you get a parcel on a Saturday, but
you will get it on a Monday to Friday. The problem is that most of our
lifestyles preclude us from being at home when Royal Mail delivers
during the week and more of us are turning to the internet now to buy
goods and we need those to be delivered. So if we are not at home that
inconvenience factor creeps in. To our way of thinking, if you are
looking for a Royal Mail that puts consumers at the heart of its
business and a Royal Mail that will seize the opportunities that are
available to it—it is the first one to complain about how much
business is being taken away through e-fulfilment—then to extend
the delivery of parcels to Saturday would be a common-sense approach
both for the consumer and Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000061">&#160;</a>

explored how people would feel about reducing the current level of the
USO from six days to five days. Generally speaking, there was a degree
of flexibility in how people felt about a five-day delivery. The one
thing there is no agreement on is which day you would lose. Businesses
are very keen to keep the weekdays. Domestic consumers, in particular,
are very keen to keep the Saturday. That brings me on to another point.
In any review of the USO, which obviously the Bill provides and that is
a very sensible provision to include, a great deal more work will need
to be done by Ofcom to tease out the differences and to weigh up and
make a decision on these competing interests. That is vital. The work
that we and Postcomm have done is the start; it is nowhere near the
end.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000063">&#160;</a>

to change. We are probably all at one on that. The service that exists
at the moment harks back to a time gone by, and it needs to be
considered in terms of the lifestyles that we all lead. We are
concerned about a knee-jerk reaction to change the USO that does not
capture what people need from the service. The Bill obviously provides
Ofcom with an 18-month period in which to carry out a review, and that
is a timely period in which to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000066">&#160;</a>

are about a sudden leap to curtailing the USO, without there being a
thorough analysis of what people want and need from the service, the
impact that it will have in terms of possible consumer detriment, and
the effect on the model of Royal Mail and the businesses of other
operators. It is no good our saying, for example, “Let’s
go from six days to five days,” only to find that logistically,
that does not make much commercial sense to Royal Mail. There must be a
big slice of realism on both sides, and it is important that the
consumer voice is at the heart of that. That is what will make Royal
Mail sustainable.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000067">&#160;</a>

network of 7,500 outlets and current network provision today, and
certainly it would be desirable to see additional safeguards to ensure
that the provision and the distribution of post office services were
much more closely aligned against existing provision. I think that
would also be very helpful to ensure that Post Office Ltd, actively on
the ground right now, are taking steps to ensure that where temporary
closures happen, for whatever business-as-usual circumstances may
arise, they would focus their minds to ensure that they are taking
every step possible to look to plug any gaps in service right

that there is an appetite for the possibility of more post offices and
we commonly come across consumers wanting a post office. So we think
that there is a scope for more, not less, and we welcome the
Government’s commitment to no programme of closures. But,
fundamentally, whether we have more post offices is going to come down
to whether they provide a service that people want enough to make them
economically viable. So the challenge is not just about numbers, but
about how they operate—whether they provide a good consumer
service, if we can find business models that consumers like, and if we
really do see more Government services provided through post offices. I
have to say that our experience over the last period is that people
talk about this, but that it is not really happening. In general, there
is a tendency for Government to go away from face-to-face contact and
do more and more online, so I really do want to see this Government
commitment, and local government commitment, to putting more services
through post offices. But the only way in which we are going to get
more post offices is not really ultimately by legislation; it is about
them being a viable model that people want. That is why a new business
model, and reform of the network and what they do, is central to the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000077">&#160;</a>

the flexibility of the customer experience—longer opening hours,
for example. Post offices need to offer a service that is convenient
and flexible, and meets the expectations of consumers. Obviously, there
are service problems right now, particularly in the high street
network, around queuing and quality of service, which actively deter
many people from using post office services. Clearly, with the growth
of the internet and other channels, that is a challenge and it is one
of the reasons why there has been a decline in business and in footfall
through the post office network. But certainly there is scope for the
post office to take issues around customer service far more seriously

more flexible and built around needs of consumers, than we have seen up

importance of face-to-face contact, especially for those populations

always be a significant number of people who don’t get

that we should invest in face-to-face and in that type of human help

                           </em> In relation to the research, we have found a
large slice of flexibility from consumers. Consumers value the service,
and the certainty that the service offers that they will get their mail
intact when it is supposed to arrive. We did a series of trade-offs,
asking people how they would feel if certain parameters were changed.
Those included quality of service, price, moving from six to five days
and abolishing the first and second class systems for a uniform price
that delivered within two days as opposed to the current aim of first
class being delivered within one day and second class within
three.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000085">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is
certainly a degree of willingness by consumers to pay more for their
mail to achieve those standards, although we found that once you
reached the magical 50p, interest in the mail began to drop off. We
heard announcements earlier this week that would allow Royal Mail, if
it so chose, to put up first class mail to 46p. We are now beginning to
nudge up towards that area where consumers are not going to be very
happy about the cost of mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The next-day
delivery is quite a burden for Royal Mail, because to achieve its 93.8%
target it has to use a lot of aircraft to get the mail from one end of
the country to the other. That is an expensive burden. It is our
view—consumers were fairly relaxed about this—that if you
were to move from a first and second class system to a uniform system
that got mail there in two days, that could well be acceptable to
consumers. Moreover, it would mean that Royal Mail could take out an
awful lot of its expensive costs relating to air traffic in particular.
That would have to be safeguarded by Royal Mail’s offering a
next-day product, which would have to be sensibly priced, so that if
people had something urgent that needed to get there it could do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000087">&#160;</a>

in Northern Ireland listening to the views of consumers and
organisations. A number of the local authorities told us that they do
not bother to send anything by first class mail any more. Everything
goes by second class, but if it has to get there the next day—a
rare occurrence—they would use special delivery, which enables
them to achieve that. Those are the sorts of areas that Royal Mail
should
explore.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000088">&#160;</a>

I have seen figures that show that people are worried about
privatisation. I think by and large people are fearful of change, but
if, for reasons of making the Royal Mail and the USO sustainable,
privatisation has to be the route—I hear what Royal Mail says
about access to capital being easier in the private sector, although as
a taxpayer I think it has had pretty good access to my capital over the
past few years—we have to try to reassure consumers that in the
new world they will get a better service; they will be as protected;
they will have as many rights to access information; and
they will have the same guarantees as they have
now.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000089">&#160;</a>

focus now is that if Royal Mail is going down the private road, we want
to make sure that consumer protection is as strong as—hopefully
stronger than—it is now. We are concerned that in the Bill, many
of the consumer protections may not be delivered because it is peppered
with things such as that Ofcom <em>may</em> require postal operators to
have access to alternative dispute resolution when there are rows with
Royal Mail. We think that those need to be converted to musts. If we
can reassure the public that in the private world, they will get the
same protection and a better quality of service, I think the public
will accept privatisation.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000090">&#160;</a>

network, which is something that is very close to their hearts. It is

                        <p class="tabbed">On the
question of capital to Royal Mail, it is not only public money. Again,
the increases that Postcomm has allowed Royal Mail to make earlier this
week will raise another £280 million, which it says it needs for
privatisation. It has had a lot of money—£2 billion
before from the public purse and another £280 million here. The
consumers are already, through the price control, paying some
£300 million to Royal Mail to help it with its pension deficit.
There is an awful lot of consumer and public money supporting Royal
Mail. However, in terms of its desire to raise capital for the future,
there has to be a sensible look at how much more modernisation Royal
Mail needs to do. I am not saying that it does not need to do it, but
it needs to be properly understood.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is also
right that Royal Mail is not allowed to use money that is raised
through its trading activities, particularly around the USO, for merger
and acquisitions activity in the markets. That was part of Richard
Hooper’s original report. It does not seem to have the same
prominence in his review, but it is our view that Royal Mail has
already, at the beginning of the decade, ventured into the merger and
acquisitions market and it made one or two good buys, but it made an
awful lot of very bad ones. There is nothing out there at the moment
that is desperately worth buying. It would be a great risk to the
public if moneys they were paying for postage were used on frivolous
activities.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000093">&#160;</a>

group of consumers will diverge slightly, so I just wanted to clarify
that. Returning to the post office network, it is estimated that about
7,000 branches are currently economically unprofitable. Do you believe
that if the Government, in addition to the provisions in the Bill,
looked rigorously at involving credit unions and other ways of making
the network profitable, all 7,000 could, one day, become profitable? Or
do you believe that a further contraction of the network is
inevitable?<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000098">&#160;</a>

vital social function, and we have to look at the value of the
institutions of post offices for their communities. We don’t
think that decisions can be purely driven by a simple profit and loss
account on that particular business. That said, we shouldn’t
write an open cheque to post offices. We have a duty to taxpayers to
ensure that if they don’t run at a profit, the loss they make is
as small as possible, and hopefully there will be some element of
cross-subsidisation, because there will be some post offices that it
may be impossible to get to make
money.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000099">&#160;</a>

interests of social cohesion, in the interests of providing public
service and in the interests of giving people access to essential
services, especially in rural areas and especially for those who
don’t have easy access to other forms of service. So we think
that we should maintain them, but we should seek business models that
keep the burden as light as possible. That’s why we are doing
research on the new Post Office Locals, which we feel are a very
important step forward in getting greater accessibility and more
viability.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000100">&#160;</a>

the post office network is the fact that it offers universal
reach—that it is out there in rural and remote locations. The
distribution of the network, not just the overall number of branches,
paints a convincing case in terms of why it should be the post office
network that should be delivering services of general economic and
social interest. Indeed, it is precisely on that basis—the
universal reach, being able to access the range of services—that
the Government currently provide subsidies, and it is entirely
appropriate that those subsidies should continue for as long as that
would be
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000101">&#160;</a>

which will be published shortly, on Post Office Locals, as Mike just
suggested, but as part of that research, one of the things that we have
tried to do is to determine which attributes consumers do value most
highly in terms of the post office network. The two strongest
attributes are very clearly convenience, first and foremost, and
opening hours. As you go down the list, issues of customer service and
of the in-branch experience also feature very strongly, but
unsurprisingly, convenience—actually having the local
neighbourhood post office close to you—is the thing that
consumers value most
strongly.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000103">&#160;</a>

country without bank accounts. The cost of not having a bank account is
more than £500, because you don’t get access to the best
deals with direct debits with energy companies. There is a
premium—if you don’t have a bank account, it costs you an
awful lot of money. I congratulate the British banks on bringing that
number down, but we still have a hard core of 1 million people. We
believe that one of the reasons why people do not take out bank
accounts is that they are frightened and they don’t trust the
big banks. They do trust the Post Office. So one of the great assets of
the Post Office, and one that we must maintain, is that intangible

in terms of network provision, with the access criteria as currently
applied. According to a strict interpretation of those criteria, the
network could fall to 7,500 branches. The positive thing about the way
in which those criteria are written is that they specify minimum
coverage levels by rural, urban and urban deprived areas, and also
provide a minimum requirement for postcode district areas. The way in
which those access criteria are written, in terms of requiring a
minimum distribution across the UK, is positive but this is about the
requirements that stem from that, which allow for an overall network
that could be smaller than it is

                           </em> Thank you. I wonder if it would be helpful,
Chairman, if I started briefly by giving some facts about the plan,
because it is quite complex. It is governed by a board of 11 trustees,
five of whom are nominated by the employer, including two independent
trustees, five nominated by the membership—three from the
Communication Workers Union, one from Unite CMA and one
pensioner-elected—and the independent chair, appointed by the
company but with the agreement of the unions. Sometimes it is helpful
just to see how the plan is
governed.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are number of questions, so may I start by explaining the purpose? The
trustees’ focus is entirely on protecting the benefits of our
members—that is 100% what the trustees do. They safeguard the
benefits that our members have been
promised.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are several reasons for the deficit. The main reasons—the
principal causes—are longevity, falling bond yields and, at the
time of our last formal valuation, specific investment market
conditions. Perhaps I can enlarge slightly on a couple of those issues.
Longevity is vital to the way that the pension fund is valued. I do not
know whether the Committee is aware that we all have been living much
longer, which is a good news/bad news story. One year on life
expectancy equals 3% to 4% on the liabilities. That is about £1
billion.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
1982 a man at 60 could expect to live another 16 years. In
2009, that had increased to 22 years. That is a huge difference and
illustrates how important that factor
is.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
factor is the markets on the day of the valuation. As I am sure
Committee members know, the valuation has to be done on one specific
day. Ours, unfortunately, fell on 31 March 2009. In March 2009 the FTSE
100 was about 3,500. It dropped by 45% between May 2008 and March 2009.
That made another huge difference. Those are basically the reasons for
the pensions deficit at this
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
question you asked was about the trustees’ investment
performance. The trustees have a very strong investment performance
record—very strong. The Secretary of State mentioned that in
passing in Parliament, in the heat of discussion, as one of the
reasons. I think probably what he meant to say was that one of the
reasons could be bad investment decisions—but in this case, it
most certainly was not. I wrote to the Secretary of State the next day
and pointed out that unfortunately that was an incorrect statement. He
very kindly and very courteously replied to me, to say that that would
be corrected as the Bill went through
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000128">&#160;</a>

Newell:</strong>
                           </em> Thank you. The trustees support the pensions
solution in the Postal Services Bill—there is absolutely no
doubt about that—on the basis of the undertakings given by the
Government on the face of the Bill and of the statements made to the
House during the passage of the Bill through Parliament. What we want
is to safeguard the benefits. The undertakings given are very
good—we are very satisfied. Provided that those undertakings
remain the same at the end of the legislative process, we will be
confident.<a class="bkMark" name="10111154000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Bill did not happen and there was no pensions solution, we are in a
very, very difficult situation. The plan is really unique—it is
important for the Committee and the House to understand the uniqueness
of the Royal Mail pension plan. We are by far the largest of funded
plans in the country, in terms of membership—437,000 members. If
you take all the dependants that those members would have, you are
probably talking about 1 million people who are affected by the plan.
We have a very large deficit—large because we are a very large
plan—and a weak employer. We have an employer whose business is
shrinking—it is in a shrinking market—and the size of the
business is dwarfed by the size of the deficit. And we have a sole

question, because if everything goes in accordance with the assumptions

huge risk. Many things can happen in 38 years that we cannot

covered was the consequences—if the solution goes ahead as we
see in the Bill. The liabilities of the plan as they are, up to a
cut-off point of a date that is not yet announced, transfer to the
Government. We are then left with only active employees. In other
words, all the pensioners, deferred pensioners and in fact the active
employees—the liability at that cut-off date—would
transfer to the Government as a consequence. We would be left with
liabilities for the employee members only, and with that aspect of
their liability that is in respect of their future, such as salary
increases, over and above the way it will be revalued by the
Government. On that basis, we would be left with assets to meet those
liabilities and the future accrual. Our fund will become much smaller,
