                           </strong> I delayed my response in its fullest form, Mr

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are all related to teacher registration, its current
operation by the General Teaching Council for England and the
regulatory system that we will be putting in its place. We began to
debate some of the issues, some of which I dealt with last
Thursday.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
effect of amendment 59 would be to retain a system of registration for
our teachers in England. I share hon. Members’ views that the
current GTC registration has elements useful for head teachers and
employers, but the process of registration is not necessary in order to
retain a supply of good teachers. Our arguments focused on my case that
the current system had had perverse effects, on occasions discouraging
reporting and, on others, encouraging reporting that had been taken no
further. I shall explain a little more in my further
remarks.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
provided evidence to the effect that the current duty on employers to
refer all cases had not been effective. Employers have indicated their
reluctance to refer a case when they feel that the potential outcome of
making a referral is too severe a response—namely, to bar a
teacher in perpetuity—clearly demonstrating that placing a duty
on employers to make referrals has not been as effective as it might
have been, in ensuring either that employers make referrals or
consistency in referrals throughout the country. I gave some examples,
which I will not repeat, of local authorities with very different
records. We need arrangements that are fit for purpose and the purpose
of the Bill is to effect those arrangements. We also need to have an
eye to value for money, which is a constant consideration for members
on both sides of the Committee. The new arrangements will, indeed, be
more
cost-effective.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that hon. Members would agree that not all instances of
misconduct warrant a bar from the profession. Since 2001, a total of
1,816 referrals for misconduct were made to the GTCE and yet,
revealingly, only 138 of the teachers were barred. By
requiring all cases to be referred, employers are placed under an
unnecessary bureaucratic burden, while the national regulator has the
burden and expense of considering every single case, only a small
proportion of which end up in a bar. We believe that to be a
disproportionate response to the issue of upholding the standards of
the profession—a sledgehammer to crack a nut—even though
the matter is important and those cases in which someone is barred are
serious and warrant the kind of attention that the Committee would want
them to be
given.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
argue, as we have in other parts of the Bill—articulated almost
poetically by the Minister of State, Department for Education, my hon.
Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton—that
teachers and head teachers are best placed to judge whether to refer to
a national regulator. Indeed, we argue throughout the Bill that what my
hon. Friend described yesterday on the Floor of the House as the
“balance of authority” in schools needs to
change—we might add the balance of responsibility, for
discipline and for
leadership.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
management responsibilities that we place in the hands of heads are
appropriate, measured and reasonable. We cannot continue with a system
in which employers 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 505<a class="bkMark" name="Column505">&#160;</a>
                           </div>are reluctant to tackle issues of conduct, because they are worried that
that will mean making a referral to the national regulator, when they
do not think that that is appropriate. David Smellie, the employment
lawyer who gave public evidence to us, has
said:<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Central
to the success of any plans to tackle teacher performance in schools is
the transfer of responsibility to the heads

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Unless
heads are given the freedom to tackle the issues they will never feel

                        </p>
                        <p>The
issue is about the balance of responsibility, as I have
said.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
trust head teachers and governing bodies to do what is right for
children and young people. School leaders know whether a case of
misconduct is serious enough to warrant a teacher being banned from the
profession. We made it clear in the policy statement that we provided
for the Committee that we will develop prohibition guidance that the
regulatory system will use to inform decisions on barring. Employers
will be able to use it to inform what they do, and it will allow them
to make important judgments on whether they refer cases of misconduct
to the regulator. It will also be the case, as it is now, that members
of public can make a referral, including when they are aware of a case
that they believe should have been
referred.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
73 deals with teachers barred by the Institute for Learning. It would
have the effect of prohibiting teachers who have been disqualified from
membership of the Institute for Learning for misconduct from teaching
in any of the settings covered by the Bill. The IFL is the independent
professional body for teachers and trainers in further education. It
confers the professional status of qualified teacher learning and
skills or associate teacher learning and skills, and can withdraw that
status as part of its regulatory function. I reassure my hon. Friend
the Member for Beverley and Holderness that under future arrangements
other regulators, including IFL, will share information with us about
teachers that they have barred for reasons of misconduct, and the new
agency, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, will then consider
whether to add that teacher to the list of prohibited
teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
likelihood is that we would usually uphold final decisions made by the
IFL and other regulators, in which a teacher has been barred on grounds
of misconduct, but we cannot presume that that will always be the case,
as decisions will be made through a different system and using
different criteria from those that the new agency will use. The agency
will therefore need to be able to consider the basis for
disqualification from IFL membership before making a decision. I meet
IFL regularly, as hon. Members would expect, and I confirm that it is
fully aware of our proposals and supports both our commitment to a
mutually effective sharing of information and our plans for handling
teachers that it has barred. The processes that the agency will use for
investigations at a hearing will be set out in regulations in due
course; our policy statement provides details about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am grateful to hon. Members for raising the issues in amendments 79 and
81, which are about how the new arrangements for teacher regulation
would link with the Independent Safeguarding Authority. I am mindful of
the contributions made at the Committee’s last sitting, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 506<a class="bkMark" name="Column506">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and I understand and share the appropriate and proper concerns raised
about ensuring that the new system is coherent and that co-ordination
is at the heart of providing proper protection for the very vulnerable
people—vulnerable adults as well as vulnerable children, given
the circumstances—who are involved in the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
79 would mean that our new list of prohibited teachers must include
information held by the Independent Safeguarding Authority. Following
our last sitting, I looked at that again and I am entirely
satisfied—indeed, I agree—that safeguarding is of
paramount importance. A barred teacher must be prevented from working
with children. It is essential that that teacher is on the list of
prohibited teachers. In other words, we need a belt-and-braces
approach. Following interventions made by hon. Members on all sides of
the Committee—particularly by Opposition Members—I went
back to my officials to ensure that that will be the case. I assure
hon. Members that we will put in place a robust reciprocal
information-sharing arrangement to ensure that that happens. We are
working closely with the ISA to ensure that its new vetting and barring
arrangements dovetail as seamlessly as possible with our new regulatory
arrangements—a point that was made with some force when we last
met.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 81
would effectively place a duty on employers to consider referring
relevant teachers to the ISA. Again, I understand the
Committee’s concerns about that and I have looked at it closely,
but I hope I can allay those concerns. There is already a duty under
the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which requires employers
to consider the circumstances in which they can refer a case that may
include a safeguarding concern to the ISA. There is already a legal
duty in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
can also confirm that when the ISA receives a referral and decides
there are no safeguarding concerns to address, it will pass the case to
the new agency to consider whether there needs to be a potential bar
from teaching on the basis of serious misconduct. That is an additional
protection, given the concerns that have been expressed here and
elsewhere. I hope that my reassurances about how the new arrangements
will dovetail with the ISA will allay those concerns. I also hope that
I have been able to reassure members of the Committee, my hon. Friend
the Member for Beverley and Holderness and others on the wide-ranging
issues raised in the amendments. Given those assurances, I
hope—<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000060">&#160;</a>

Minister’s reassurances. I also accept that this is not
necessarily the easiest place to set this out, so will the Minister
write to members of the Committee to set out the processes that will
take place and the relevant legislation that covers it? As he is aware,
the amendments were intended to probe that. I certainly accept that it
may not be necessary to have this written in such a way in the Bill,
but it would help us all to feel reassured if we had the processes set
out in a letter that we can consider at
leisure.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000063">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>That was a helpful intervention. The issues
are complex. There will be interaction between the new

                           </div>now—and the existing arrangements. To that end, I shall be happy
to write to the Committee to set the process out in detail. In the
course of our affairs, it is quite difficult to explain such things in
simple and comprehensible terms, despite my bold attempt to
do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000064">&#160;</a>

my appreciation. The Minister understands why there are concerns about
how the processes mesh together. In the letter that he is going to send
to the Committee, will he also clarify his response to
amendments 53 and 80, particularly how the relationship
between head teachers and the ISA and its responsibilities will work at
a local level? Many of us who have worked in the voluntary sector on
safeguarding issues are concerned about making sure that information is
passed on when appropriate. It would be helpful if the Minister could
set out clearly how the process will work from the other
end—locally—not just the dovetailing at a
national level.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000065">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I thank the
Minister for his reassuring comments. In summing up last Thursday, he
was right to say that the Department and various agencies collect a lot
of data on the school and teaching work force. He particularly
mentioned the access to data collected by other bodies. In doing so, he
cited the Training and Development Agency for Schools, which, of
course, he is abolishing. He somewhat worried me with the extraordinary
admission that he has decided to abolish the General Teaching Council
for England, but is now considering what to do about collection of
data. I worry that one half of the Department does not know what the
other is doing. Will he therefore reassure the Committee and me that
there was a comprehensive review before we started our deliberations?
What data will be collected? What might be duplicated within the
Department, given the centralisation of powers? What useful data might
not be collected at all—what might fall through the
gaps?<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has also made encouraging noises about the Government’s changing
thinking about a central repository of teachers who hold qualified
teacher status, for which I thank him. He has said that he wants to
consider the demand for such a service. We hope that the mechanics and
time scales of that will be provided to the Committee before
Report.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am not
convinced by the Minister’s comments on amendment 53. His
argument seems to be, “The current system does not work well, so
it does not make much difference if we make it any worse.” I
acknowledge that the current process is not well used, but I suggest to
the Minister that the provisions in the Bill will make it worse. We
might accept his logic that only the most serious cases would be
referred to the Secretary of State. It follows that whether the head
teacher considers the referral appropriate is, frankly, irrelevant.
Such cases should be referred due to their serious nature, regardless
of the head teacher’s conduct, professional judgment and
expertise. Last Thursday, the remarks by the Chair of the Education
Committee were particularly strong on this matter. He said that the
current position was somewhat odd. My hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow was right in stating that amendment 53 would provide
clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000076">&#160;</a>

and hawing about whether to press the amendment to a vote to test the
Committee’s opinion, but I want to make progress. I do not
follow the logic of the Minister’s comments, however, so I might
wish to return to the matter.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000077">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Part of the concern is about the process that the
new agency will adopt. Clearly, I was insufficiently persuasive before,
so I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the new agency will build on best
practice for data collection, where doing so serves a
purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000078">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
misconduct, the balance of responsibility about who makes the decision
to refer what is changing. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can think
of many examples where misconduct would not warrant a bar from a
profession. We are anxious to remove some of the perverse incentives,
which I have described, either to report or not to do so, both of which
might have outcomes that were neither sought nor
intended.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000079">&#160;</a>

but I do not think that it necessarily follows. If misconduct is so
serious that the Secretary of State has to be referred to in the
prohibition order, surely it follows that the head teacher’s
role is to protect themselves as opposed to anyone else. Amendment 53
would remove the requirement to consider whether it would be
appropriate. It follows the general logic of what the Minister has been
explaining. I have been humming and hawing about whether to press the
amendment to a Division, but I think on balance, I can understand his
sentiments, and I may return to the matter on

Walker. I will speak briefly to amendments 83 and 84, which relate to
consultation with stakeholders in the implementation of the new
arrangements. I would like to be clear that we are committed to consult
all the groups mentioned in the amendments, as well as wider
stakeholders with interest in the area. During the policy development
process, we already discussed the proposals with teacher and head
teacher unions and employer associations. That has included our regular
engagements through the Department’s bi-monthly education forum,
which includes the unions, employer organisations and wider stakeholder
organisations such as the National Governors’ Association, the
Independent Schools Council, local authority representatives and
representatives from the Churches. Both the Secretary of State and I
hold termly one-to-one meetings with the general secretaries of the
teacher and head teacher unions. We are committed to continue those
conversations and, from this month, I will also meet monthly with the
group of general secretaries from the teacher and head teacher unions.
The forums and bilateral meetings with officials will continue to
provide a range of opportunities to continue our discussions about the
detail of the new regulatory arrangements for the teaching
profession.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
83 would require the Secretary of State to consult with teacher and
head teacher unions and employer associations—as well as other
people as he sees fit—on the information to be included on the
list of prohibited teachers. It would also require him to consult on
mechanisms for people to challenge the accuracy or relevance of
information in the prohibited teachers list.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000092">&#160;</a>

that hon. Members may be rightly concerned about the types of
information that will be included on the list and how we will ensure
the accuracy of that information. As is currently the case under the
GTCE arrangements, we are committed to ensuring that employers and the
public have access to information about teachers who are barred from
the profession, so that employers can check that any potential
employees have not been barred and so that members of the public are
able to assure themselves that a person teaching their children has not
been barred. That is critical to ensuring that employers and the public
have confidence in the profession and that those who have been barred
from teaching are not re-employed as teachers. I want to provide
reassurance that we will carefully consider what information is to be
held on the list and what information should be available publicly, as
well as how we can ensure accuracy and appropriate routes for
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000093">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the last decade, much was done by the previous Government to raise the
quality of standards in the teaching profession. We made it clear that
the quality of the education system could never exceed the quality of
our teachers, and we were determined in government—and remain
so—to enhance the professional status of teachers. The present
Secretary of State has repeatedly said
that<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“there
is no profession more noble, no calling more vital, no role more
important than teaching. Far and away the best part of my job is
spending job with time with teachers—watching and admiring,
listening and learning, being uplifted and
inspired”.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We
can all agree with that but, as the NUT pointed out to us, it is
puzzling that the Bill, which in essence enacts much of the White Paper
entitled “The Importance of Teaching”, is lacking in
strategy to raise the status of the teaching of the profession. The
purpose of the amendment and the duty within it would allow the
Minister to outline more fully his vision of how he will raise the
status of
teaching.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
our deliberations on Thursday, the Minister of State outlined how Sally
Coates will be conducting a review of professional standards of
teachers. That was welcome, but we debated whether he and his team are
using a narrow view of stakeholders and leaders in the sector to carry
out policy making, and whether that could be extended. The amendment
would allow that to happen. It is important that teachers have a strong
voice in the Secretary of State’s actions to continue to raise
the professionalism for teachers. It is important to have a role for
the profession within the new system. Regulation by teachers themselves
should help to define the profession, as it does for, say, accountants,
doctors and lawyers.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 51
would also put on a duty on the Secretary of State to lay an annual
report to Parliament on the measures that he has taken to raise the
professionalism of teachers. Given the extra powers that the Secretary
of State has in such areas, it is important that he is held to account
in this House and the other place in respect of the use of those
powers. The duty would therefore help to secure public confidence in
the decisions that he makes. The whole Committee will agree that it is
important that we enhance, respect and reward the professional status
of teachers. Other relevant stakeholders have a key role to play in
such matters, and the amendment would help to produce such an outcome.
I therefore hope that the Minister will consider it
favourably.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000106">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment and the probing attempt to get the
Government to talk about the subject are welcome. I want to repeat much
of what we said on

                           </div>Thursday, and the professionalism and quality of teachers is the key. We
know from the Education Committee’s report on behaviour and
discipline that the most, important thing that would help improve
behaviour in schools is the quality of teaching. We then have the
consistence of policy behind that. The quality of teaching is
critical.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment has been put more together more with the aim of probing the
Government than being definitive statutory wording, but there is no
mention of governors and the strategic governance of schools to ensure
performance and effective management and the will, the drive and the
capacity to manage a school. To ensure that teachers deliver the
highest quality teaching at every opportunity within the school is the
fundamental responsibility of teachers so, were such matters taken
forward, governors would be critical. If governors did not realise how
critical they should be to raising the professionalism of teachers,
their inclusion on such a list—were it ever enacted—would
help to remind
them.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
welcome the amendment because, as the shadow Minister said, there is an
opportunity for the Government to lay out their vision of how they
raise the status of professionalism and standing of teachers not only
for the betterment of those currently in the teaching profession, but
to encourage others of the highest possible calibre to enter it. In
Finland, regardless of how its education system is organised, about 10
people apply for every job. The profession is not massively highly paid
in Finland and—as I have said earlier in Committee—it is
hard to draw too many lessons from that country for ours, but we must
set out collectively to raise the status and professionalism of
teachers so that we have more young people of the highest calibre
wanting to enter the profession. If we achieve that, we will see lots
of people applying for every post, and we will have greater ability to
select on the basis of not only the academic ability and knowledge of
those wishing to be a teacher, but their aptitude and possession of the
skills required to control a classroom and to enthuse and excite
learning in our young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000109">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 51 seeks to place a duty on the Secretary
of State to raise the professionalism of teachers, to do so in
consultation with a wide range of groups and to provide Parliament with
an annual report on the steps taken. However, as my hon. Friend so
rightly said, the list in the amendment omits governors, who are an
important stakeholder group when raising the standards of the
profession and school performance. We are in regular contact with the
National Governors’ Association when discussing such
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
reassure the Committee that the Government see the professionalism of
teachers as hugely important to the whole agenda of raising standards
in our schools. No education system, as the hon. Member for Hartlepool
said, can be better than the quality of its teachers. Nothing matters
more in improving education than giving every child the best possible
teaching and teachers. All the evidence from around the world points to
that direct
correlation.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
White Paper, “The Importance of Teaching”, published last
year, set out our plans to continue improving the quality of teaching
and the professionalism of our teachers, as well as ensuring that that
is system-led. We will continue to raise the quality of new entrants to
the teaching profession by raising the bar for Department

minimum of a 2:2 degree and by offering financial incentives to attract
into teaching more of the very best graduates in shortage subjects. We
are also expanding Teach First and enabling more talented professionals
to change career and to become
teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will reform initial teacher training to increase the proportion of time
that trainees spend in a classroom, focusing on the core teaching
skills, especially in teaching, reading and mathematics and in managing
behaviour. In the spring, we will publish details of further proposals
for reform of initial teacher training, for discussion with schools,
teacher training providers and the sector, before confirming plans in
the summer, in time for recruitment of teachers who start their
training in
September.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Hartlepool said that we are relying on a narrow range
of professionals, but that is not true—far from true. Although I
have only referred to Sally Coates, she heads up a committee containing
other people. I will not give the whole list, because the committee is
large—I attended one of its meetings last week—but it
includes highly professional people such as Richard Aird, the head
teacher of Barrs Court special school in Hereford, Professor Roy
Blatchford, the director of the National Education Trust, and Joan
Deslandes, the head teacher of Kingsford community school in Becton,
which I visited
recently.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Kingsford
community school is a Confucius school, so it teaches Mandarin, and I
sat in on one of the lessons, which was of a very high quality. The
standard of Mandarin reached by those pupils—in a year 9 class,
I think—is very high and, given the difficulty of learning the
language, I was impressed to see those young people reading and
speaking
it.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Other
examples of people on the committee are Leanne Simmonds, the subject
leader of modern foreign languages at Evelyn Grace academy—a
teacher, rather than a head teacher—Patricia Sowter, the
principal of Cuckoo Hall academy, which is one of the first primary
schools to become an academy, and Brett Wigdortz, the chief executive
of Teach First, as well as a number of others. It is, therefore, wrong
to say that we are relying on a narrow group of people to help us make
the
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will also develop a national network of teaching schools, on the model
of teaching hospitals, to lead the training and professional
development of teachers and head teachers. The new national network of
teaching schools will give schools and teachers access to high-quality
professional and leadership development, and to opportunities for
peer-to-peer training to improve the attainment of all pupils,
especially those at risk through
disadvantage.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we build the teaching school model, we will need to understand and
consider the profession’s concerns and issues. We will ensure
that the National College, which is leading that work, engages
positively and consults with schools and other stakeholders on matters
relating to implementation. The first stage of the consultation is
already under way. We will also increase the number of national and
local leaders of education—head teachers of excellent schools
who commit themselves to supporting other schools. I am sure that
Labour Members will support that development, as those roles were
developed by the last Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In pursuing
the reforms, we will continue to consult the Department’s
education forum, which consists of a wide range of stakeholders,
including the teaching unions, the National Governors’
Association, the Independent Schools Council, local authority
representatives, employer organisations and representatives of the
Churches. We will raise the status of teaching by transferring the
authority back to the teacher in the classroom, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Beverley and Holderness said. We know that undergraduates
who are considering teaching have concerns about poor behaviour and
violence in the classroom, and that that is a common reason for
choosing an alternative career. That is why the Bill includes measures
to boost the authority of teachers and head teachers—for
example, the new powers on detentions and
searching.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000119">&#160;</a>

people from around the world want to send their children—do not
face such a requirement. That does not mean to say that teachers in the
independent sector do not have qualified teacher status; many do, but
there is no requirement for them to do so. In any event, there is a
high quality of education in those
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000123">&#160;</a>

best measure whether the Government are successful in raising the

qualifications of those accepted? Does he think that there are any

starting to measure inputs, which was the mistake of previous
Administrations. This Administration will judge the success of their
education policy on outputs—on how well educated our young
people are when they leave the education system. It may be that trying
to raise the status of the teaching profession will not lead to higher
standards of children’s education, but that would be surprising.
Ultimately, we have to judge ourselves on the quality of the young
people leaving our education system. My hon. Friend might

does not satisfy me. It would be one thing if, in talking so well and
fluently on raising the status of teaching, he was focusing only on
outcomes. But he has not focused purely on outcomes; he has also set
out inputs as aims. We can have high-status teaching but more young
people ending up unemployed, and we would not think that to be a good
thing. That is an input itself. Even though the emphasis of the Bill is
more on outputs than inputs, he has stated, as every Government would,
that he wants to raise the status of teaching. How we measure that is

                           </strong> I am not dismissing my hon. Friend’s point,
which is an important one. The danger is, however, that if we go down
the route of targets, we may run the risk of having a system that
delivers targets instead of high-quality education for our young
people. That is always the danger of such things. We have the intention
and objective of raising the status of the teaching profession, and I
have listed a range of measures that we are taking to do that. However,
if we say, for example, that we want to see a certain proportion of
teacher trainees with a 2:1, the system would gear towards that when
that may not be the right approach. The right approach may be to have a
range of graduates with a 2:2 and 2:1 going through the PGCE system,
and what matters is their subject knowledge, empathy and ability to
teach. Therefore, focusing on one, two, several, or even hundreds of
targets is the wrong approach. Nevertheless, we intend to raise the
status of the teaching profession, and I am sure that my hon. Friend
and his Committee will find their own way to look at how successful we
are.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000128">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree totally with the hon. Gentleman, which is
why we have improved the sophistication of the floor targets so that
they no longer simply measure the proportion of young people at a
school achieving five or more GCSEs A* to C including English and
maths. We have added a progression measure, which is important. I
accept what the hon. Gentleman is saying—we need to measure not
just the raw attainment but the progress of young people. That is one
of the reasons why we will introduce a destination measure so that we
can try to see the destinations of young people when they leave
school—higher education, further education, training in a job
and apprenticeships—so that parents and the public can judge a
school not simply on academic attainment but where young people end up
when they are a bit older. I think that would be a useful indicator and
broaden the measures that we use to judge schools.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000130">&#160;</a>

welcome continued scrutiny of our plans through the standard
parliamentary mechanisms, not least the Education Committee chaired by
my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness, parliamentary
questions, as we had yesterday, and Opposition day debates. I hope that
those will provide a sufficient route to ensure that we are held to
account for our plans, rather than making any additional requirements
over and above the established methods. I know that hon. Members would
not want an amendment that would inadvertently limit parliamentary
scrutiny of the issue to an annual event. I do not think that having
annual reports is the right approach. Opposition Members and other

                           </strong> I shall be brief. Regarding the point about
governance that was raised by the Minister and the Chair of the
Education Committee, I fully accept that that was an omission. The
Minister and I had a valuable debate in Westminster Hall a couple of
weeks ago on the importance of school governance, and a governing body
can make a hugely important and positive contribution to the life of a
school and the wider
community.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister provides warm words, but I think he was floundering to explain
in precise terms how he would help to raise the professionalism and
status of teachers. The Chair of the Education Committee, in several
telling interventions, asked what success would look like. It was a
perfectly straightforward and reasonable question to ask. He said that
it was important that the Government were trying to raise the quality
of input on policies, in order to have a direct influence on the
quality of outputs. One of the ways that the Government can try to
address the quality of teaching is by improving the start of the
process. The Minister did not satisfactorily answer how he thinks that
will have a direct influence on raising
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000134">&#160;</a>

that he is raising, I am interested to know why the hon. Gentleman
feels that laying a duty on the Secretary of State to report back on
measures that the Secretary of State is taking is the crucial measure.
Should it not be the monitoring of how professionalism is increasing,
rather than the measures that the Secretary of State is taking? It is
almost saying that the only way that standards will rise is if the
Secretary of State does something every day to try to increase those
standards, rather than them rising through others working in the
profession.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000135">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I would point out that the Secretary of State is
responsible for education policy in England. He or she therefore has an
important role to play in ensuring that if they want to enhance and
increase the quality of teaching in this country—which previous
Labour Secretaries of State wanted, and the present Secretary of State
has mentioned that he wants as well—it is important that they
outline clearly the measures that they will take to encourage that, in
conjunction with important stakeholders

                           </div>and the teaching profession. Amendment 51 would ensure that that would
happen and that those measures would then be scrutinised by Parliament
to ensure that they are the right measures to take and that success can
be evaluated.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has rightly said that the Secretary of State and hon. Members have the
opportunity to scrutinise the Secretary of State and his ministerial
team on the policies implemented by the Department. I would point out
to the Minister that there are 500 unanswered parliamentary questions
for the Department for Education. Some 10% of named day questions have
not been answered. Some 20% of correspondence has not been answered. As
the Opposition, we are keen to hold the Government to account, but it
is not working, because the Minister is not answering the questions.
The Minister and his team are floundering on ensuring that we have a
possible and effective means to scrutinising the policies of the
Secretary of State. We need to think about this carefully. We will come
back to the Chair of the Education Committee’s telling point
about what success looks like time and time again. On that basis,
however, and given the sentiments that the Minister has expressed and

                           </strong> In brief, clause 8 makes new arrangements for the
regulation of the teaching profession following the abolition of the
GTCE. It provides the Secretary of State with the power to consider
cases of misconduct and, where necessary, to bar a teacher form the
profession. It includes a requirement for the Secretary of State to
keep a list of teachers barred from the profession. Clause 8 will help
to raise the status of the teaching profession and I urge the Committee
to approve
it.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000140">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is a very important clause, because it
embodies and epitomises much of what is in the Bill. It centralises a
lot of power in the hands of the Secretary of State. From the debates
on the various amendments that we tabled to the clause, we have teased
out that the Government have jumped to the abolition of the GTCE
without sufficient explanation or provision as to how the teaching
profession will advise the Secretary of State or how the Secretary of
State will be held to account. The clause transfers teaching misconduct
powers away from the profession, to the Secretary of State. The
question I have tried to ask before in our deliberations is: why is the
teaching profession being treated differently from other professions by
being denied a regulatory body independent of Government? In all his
responses, the Minister has failed to answer that. It goes to the heart
of the clause and whether it should stand part of the Bill, and I am
not sure whether he has sufficiently answered that. We all want the
prestige, status and professionalism of teachers to rise, but telling
them that they are not worthy of having their own regulatory body sends
out a powerful message that the Government do not trust the teaching
profession, despite the Minister’s rhetoric. Will the Minister
respond to
that?<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000141">&#160;</a>

                           </div>teachers. The problem is that it never won the support of the
profession. I can cite all kinds of quotes from all kinds of teaching
unions and teachers citing their unhappiness with the body. The
difference between the GTC and other professional bodies is that most
other professional bodies arose from within the profession itself as a
bottom-up body rather than a top-down attempt artificially to create
such a body. That is the key difference between teaching and other
professions.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000142">&#160;</a>

still think that the essential point of my argument stands, which is
that the rhetoric on trusting the teaching profession is laudable. We
would all agree that we want to enhance the professionalism and status
of the teaching profession, but the provisions in the clause do not do
that. In fact, they do precisely the opposite, taking trust away from
the teaching profession and sending out a negative message about the
teaching profession in this

up on day one and found myself teaching A-level economics, macro and
micro, in the upper and lower-sixth and A-level history, European and
British, in the lower-sixth. I think it was O-level then, or perhaps it
was GCSE by then. I taught economics and GCSE history in year 10 and
history in lower school. I taught about 300 different pupils every week
without a repeat lesson, so in terms of preparation it was a little
like being on the Education Bill Committee five days a week for the
entire
year.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
can be tough for new teachers coming in to the profession. It can be a
significant challenge, and I was not helped by the fact that my head of
department left after the first term, so I pretty much took over
responsibility for economics after one term as a probationary teacher.
I have some sympathy, therefore, with the desire to ensure sufficient
induction for teachers. Perhaps getting thrown in at the deep end did
not do me any harm, but it is important that we do not waste the
investment in teachers and that we ensure that there is a proper
induction period. Such an induction would provide teachers with the
opportunity to get a start in the profession without being put off
unnecessarily. It would also provide a chance for others to be clear
about whether those people were suitable individuals to go on and teach
our children.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000152">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
9 largely reproduces the previous legislation on teacher induction. As
with previous clauses, however, in England it transfers powers from the
GTCE to the Secretary of State. It allows regulations to make
provisions for teachers to have completed an induction period of not
less than three school terms, and it provides for a range of detail to
be set out in regulation regarding that induction process. I know that
the Minister has sent round a note in relation to the matter, but
notwithstanding that, I want to ask him some questions. Importantly,
the provision includes the Secretary of State’s termination of
the standards against which people are assessed to decide whether they
have satisfactorily completed an induction period.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000153">&#160;</a>

of the amendment is to clarify the Secretary of State’s power to
set standards for teacher induction and to probe whether he will be
able, unilaterally, to set standards against which people are to be
judged as having completed their induction period. Will the Minister
tell the Committee why he thinks that taking power out of the hands of
the professional body that the Bill abolishes and putting it into those
of the Secretary of State—a politician—will lead to the
appropriate setting of standards for induction? How will the Secretary
of State ensure that he has the appropriate resources and expertise to
help him set such standards? Will the Minister tell the Committee
whether the Secretary of State intends to undertake proper and
inclusive consultation in setting those standards? Will he consult
teachers and their representatives, academics, unions and head teacher
associations, and others as appropriate? Will the standards be informed
by the Department for Education’s review of teaching standards,
which was launched on 11 March?<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000154">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s professional teaching career. It seems a baptism of
fire to go into a school and be expected to take an upper sixth-form
economics lesson, particularly in macro-economics. I wonder what he was
teaching that class. I hope it was not that profligate public spending
is a good thing for a country. I hope it was not the virtues of
escalating public debt or of paying £120 million a day in
interest, which is enough to build 10 primary schools. Perhaps that was
what he was teaching those upper sixth-formers all those years
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000156">&#160;</a>

teacher at school in Wakefield, Brian Rogers, who I mentioned in a

reassure the Committee that we have clear plans to improve the

highly competent professionals who are committed to providing a good
education for our children. If teachers do not meet the standards
expected of the profession, it is important that head teachers have the
freedom necessary to tackle underperformance. No one is helped when
poor performance remains unaddressed, and underperforming teachers
place additional pressures on their colleagues, letting down

mentioned in the previous debate, the Secretary of State has appointed
a group of practitioners, made up of head teachers and teachers, to
review the existing standards for teachers, including the standards
that a teacher has to meet at the end of the induction period. As well
as Sally Coates, the committee includes a range of professionals from
throughout the school sector. We asked the review group to engage the
profession and its representatives as it develops the new standards. We

amendment would make the local authority the so-called
“appropriate body”, and it is intended to probe Ministers
about why they are not making the local authority the appropriate body
for induction. The induction role of the appropriate body is important.
The head teacher and the appropriate body must ensure that the duties
of a newly qualified teacher, his or her personal development and
supervision—I outlined my own experience of that, or the lack of
it, with supervision in those days consisting, basically, of perhaps
one or two visits during the course of one’s first year as a
teacher—and the conditions under which he or she works are such
as to enable a fair and effective assessment of the newly qualified
teacher’s conduct and efficiency against the core

role. The appropriate responsibilities include ensuring that the
qualified teacher status of the newly qualified teacher is confirmed,
registering the new qualified teacher and providing the newly qualified
teacher with a named contact within the appropriate body with whom the
newly qualified teacher may raise concerns about the induction
programme, when the institution does not resolve them. When the
institution appears not to be providing an appropriate programme of
support, the appropriate body can contact the institution to raise its

the appropriate body for schools should only be the local authority in
which area where the school is situated. The appropriate body would
decide whether a newly qualified teacher has passed his or her
induction period. Along with the head teacher or principal, it is
jointly responsible for the supervision and training of the newly
qualified teacher during the induction period. It has the main quality
assurance role. In fact, informal feedback from schools and
stakeholders suggests that, if anything, we should be developing
greater flexibility for schools in whom they can appoint their
appropriate body for induction
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000174">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to retain the discretion to award appropriate body status
to other organisations, which includes, for example, the ability of the
Secretary of State to appoint the Independent Schools Council as an
appropriate body for its member schools. That is likely to be an
important factor in ensuring that schools in the independent sector
feel able to continue to offer statutory induction to their newly
qualified teachers. Those newly qualified teachers employed in the
independent sector might be disadvantaged if statutory induction is no
longer offered to them, because appropriate body arrangements
independent of local authorities are no longer available to independent
schools or if their choice of local authority is removed. On the
grounds of wanting more flexibility not less flexibility and more
prescription, I urge the hon. Gentleman to rethink his argument and
withdraw the

informal feedback. It should be based much more on properly evaluated
evidence. As I pointed out earlier, the role of the appropriate body is
a bit broader than the Minister said. It includes giving an opportunity
for newly qualified teachers to have a named contact in the appropriate
body whom they can contact if they have concerns about the induction
programme and they feel that such matters are not being

                        <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members
might be interested to know that in a recent survey conducted by the
NUT, there were mixed views about the current performance of the
appropriate body in supporting teachers in their induction period. I
think 17.1% found the appropriate body very supportive and 34.1% found
it quite supportive, but 40% said that they did not know or had mixed
views. Only 5.6% said that it was quite unsupportive, and 3.2% very
unsupportive. I suppose that overall, if it does not have a great
impact on that 40% in the middle, it may not be such a terrible thing.
However, it has an important role, and we need to ensure that newly
qualified teachers have adequate support. I have noted that the
Minister said that he does not intend materially to change the role of
the appropriate body, but I ask him to continue to consider and not
underestimate its importance. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to

102 seeks clarification about whether the Secretary of State will take
responsibility for the award of qualified teacher status and whether a
registry of all qualified teachers, trainees and overseas-trained
teachers will continue to be maintained. As such, it refers back to
some of our previous discussions. While the Bill addresses the transfer
the GTCE’s regulatory functions, it does not appear to cover the
functions relating to the registration of teachers, as we have
discussed previously, set out in section 3 of the Teaching and Higher
Education Act 1998. The Minister has given some clarification on the
matter, but perhaps he could tell us whether he intends the Secretary
of State to have responsibility for the award of qualified teacher
status, and to continue to maintain the register of

point.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000183">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
creation of a register of all qualified teachers was a key function of
the GTCE when it was established in 2000. Before that there had been no
detailed statistics about the teacher work force available nationally.
However, if the Bill becomes an Act without any changes, the register
will cease to be maintained. I think the Minister said that he will
keep some kind of list of teachers in the future, but it would be
useful to have a few more details about that at this
point.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000184">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
the register contains information on more than half a million teachers
who have qualified teacher status. Employers must check the register to
ensure that teachers are registered and do not have any unresolved
disciplinary orders against them. There were a huge number of
registration inquiries just in the past year, mostly from local
authorities as employers. It is still unclear how the award of
qualified teacher status or the lapsing of a period of prohibition
might be confirmed without such a register, and I ask the Minister to
clarify
that.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000185">&#160;</a>

register also provides valuable information about the teaching
profession. Every year, the GTCE sends information on detailed patterns
in the teacher work force to local and national educational
organisations, which is helpful in supporting recruitment and
retention, monitoring the demographic profile and supply modelling. If
the Minister is not minded to accept the amendment—and, from our
previous discussions, I think he may not be—how does he intend
to confirm the award of qualified teacher status, confirm the elapse of
a period of prohibition and produce useful data on the teacher work
force to improve planning and recruitment?<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000186">&#160;</a>

assure hon. Members that the Secretary of State already has that
responsibility under the Education Act 2002, which he
exercises through regulations agreed in 2003. Currently, the Secretary
of State’s authority is delegated to the GTCE to perform that
function. Once the GTCE is abolished, the Secretary of State will
resume responsibility for issuing qualified teacher status certificates
and induction certificates, and for hearing appeals against failures to
complete induction successfully. In practice, the new executive agency
will perform those functions on behalf of the Secretary of State. There
is therefore no need for that new

last sitting, which is that we have agreed that we do not want to lose
the useful elements of the data and information developed by GTCE,
provided that the benefits of maintaining those data make that worth
while. The Department already collects a significant amount of data on
staff in schools, and it has access to a range of data collected from
other sources. Against that background, it is currently considering all
its work force data requirements, including those of the new executive
agency.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000190">&#160;</a>

recognise the potential benefits of providing head teachers and
employers with access to a central record of who holds qualified

that in more detail. The amendment helpfully links that with
consideration of teachers who have successfully completely a statutory
induction period, and I am happy to explore that in conjunction with
our consideration of having a central record on the award of QTS. I am
also happy to confirm that I will update the House on the issue in due

It would depend on the evidence of a case. We are talking about a
period of some two years perhaps being appropriate. For example, a
person’s health condition may have been a significant factor in
their misconduct, or there might be reason to believe that that could
improve during a period of two years.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000194">&#160;</a>

allow teachers to complete their induction period within an independent
nursery school where the school meets the conditions of induction, and
that allow a teacher to serve more than one induction period. This is

reproduces previous legislation on teachers’ induction periods,
but transfers the existing provisions on induction from the GTCE to the
Secretary of State to set standards against which a person is to be
assessed for the purpose of deciding whether they have completed their
induction period satisfactorily. We wanted to make sure that we could
express our concerns about certain issues. Interestingly, regulations
in the Bill will allow a teacher to serve more than one induction
period, and teachers will be allowed to complete their induction period
in an independent nursery school, which is a welcome addition to the
induction process.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000200">&#160;</a>

sought to clarify whether Ministers intend to keep a register, and they
have said that they want to keep a different type of list. We have
tried to clarify how the Minister would ensure consistency in the
conduct of the appropriate body. The clause also includes a right of
appeal to the Secretary of State by a person aggrieved by an induction
decision, but, as I understand it, with no further right of appeal
beyond that. What safeguards will be put in place to ensure that
decisions taken by the Secretary of State can be reviewed
independently, to make sure that all the proper principles of natural
justice are applied? I would be grateful if the Minister covered that

inherent in that is the suggestion that teachers should be allowed to

intend that teachers undertaking an induction period will have any
opportunity or requirement to have practical teacher training in
inclusive education? We have received representations in opposition
from organisations that are concerned about teacher training and the
importance of inclusive education, for example teaching children with
disabilities and special educational needs. How can he ensure that the

supply that experience in a mainstream setting of inclusive education?

questions asked by the shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Cardiff
West. First, on appeals to the Secretary of State, the position is the
same as the current position. If there is dissatisfaction with the
decision of the Secretary of State or the procedures used by the
Secretary of State, onward appeal to the High Court is available.
Independent nursery schools can, of course, be an option for induction.
That same principle applies to academies, I believe. Induction periods
can be served in academies, because they fulfil the definition of a
school. On appeals, I can clarify that there is no appeal to the High
Court on the issue of induction. When those appeals go to the High
Court, they are on the issue of barring, not on induction. The final
decision on that rests with the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000203">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not expect the Minister to give a definitive
answer now on this point, but I would be grateful if he thought about
it a little and wrote later. It may be that that is the current
position on appeals, but will he ask his officials and have a think
himself on whether it is ultimately satisfactory that someone wishing
to appeal against a decision on induction should have no right of
further consideration beyond the Secretary of State? It could have a
significant impact on that person’s career and opportunities for
employment. It may well be that there is a very good reason why that is
not available currently. As I have said, I do not expect the Minister
to give a definitive answer at this point, but perhaps he can go away
and have a think about it and let us know by one means or another his
further thoughts on this
subject.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000204">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I always continue to think about these things, but
there is a clear difference between appealing against being barred from
the profession and appealing against a decision on whether a young
person has successfully completed their induction period. There is
plenty of independent scrutiny of that decision by the appropriate
body, as we discussed before. For any maintained school, the
appropriate body is the local authority. There comes a point where the
head teacher of the school in which the induction period is being
conducted, together with the appropriate body, has to reach a decision.
There is already that appeal to the Secretary of State. That has to be
the end of it. The trainee can always go on and take the induction
period at another school at a subsequent time. With any awarding body,
or with a university awarding a degree, there comes a point at which
the induction process must be decided. I will, however, consider the
hon. Gentleman’s comments. I will write to him if I have any
further thoughts on that matter, or on inclusive education.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000205">&#160;</a>

amendment is relatively brief and straightforward. It is designed to
probe the Minister’s thoughts on the transitional period and
what happens to teachers within the disciplinary system when the GTCE
is abolished. I understand that the Government plan to abolish the GTCE
by 31 March 2012, until which time teachers must continue to register
with the organisation. Employers must continue to ensure that they do
so, and continue to refer disciplinary cases to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000210">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What are the
Minister’s intentions regarding teachers who have been referred
to the GTCE for disciplinary matters before its abolition? Will
teachers in such situations be able to finish those disciplinary
processes under the organisation’s existing disciplinary regime?
I understand that the Bill proposes that a prohibition order, or a
conditional registration order, made by the GTCE will remain in force
following the GTCE’s closure. By implication—although, as
currently drafted, the Bill is not entirely clear—the
arrangements for monitoring conditions will also continue to apply.
That means that any failure to comply may result in a further hearing
to consider that failure, which may result in the imposition of a
further sanction.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In those
circumstances, will the Minister make explicit whether monitoring
arrangements will continue to apply following the abolition of the
GTCE? In addition, it is not entirely clear what will happen with any
induction appeals that begin before the planned abolition date of 31
March 2012. Again, will the Minister clarify his intentions about what
will happen to such cases following the closure?<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have
heard this morning how the GTCE is working closely with the Independent
Safeguarding Authority. In Committee last Thursday, I referred to the
fact that more referrals are being made to the GTCE as a result of that
close partnership working. Employers have been expected to decide
whether to refer cases to the ISA or to the GTCE, so cases might often
have been wrongly referred. The National Union of Teachers told us that
close liaison is still needed to provide effective safeguarding of
children, which we would all agree with. Will the Minister confirm
whether he intends the ISA to continue working closely with the
Secretary of State as the GTCE’s functions transfer? Will he
confirm arrangements for liaison with the ISA during that transition
period? It would be helpful if he set out his plans for teachers who
are in the middle of disciplinary investigations and action when the
GTCE is abolished.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000213">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 57 would allow the Secretary of State to
take over investigations that are currently carried out by the GTCE,
but would require him to complete them under the existing arrangements
for regulation that operate under the GTCE. As drafted, it would not
require the Secretary of State to undertake any new cases that were
referred to him in accordance with the current GTCE system of
regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000214">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
understanding is that the current rules will remain in place until the
Secretary of State takes over regulation of the teaching profession on
1 April 2012. The Department is working closely with the GTCE to plan
and manage that transition. A joint transition board includes the
GTCE’s chief executive and members of its management team. It
has been working closely with officials at the

details for the transfer of case work. The board will continue to work
closely with the GTCE, to learn from its experience in the development
of the new arrangements. That is the procedure in dealing with the ISA,
monitoring and existing cases. I hope that that is enough to satisfy

the council is abolished, will that process be finished under the

                           </strong> Clause 10 makes transitional provisions for certain
functions currently undertaken by the GTCE. Any person who is barred
from the profession under the GTCE will continue to be so under the new
arrangements; any sanctions put in place by the GTCE will continue for
the specified period or until revoked. The clause provides that the
list of prohibited teachers held by the Secretary of State, as detailed
in clause 8, may include any person on whom the GTCE imposed a
conditional or suspension
order.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000221">&#160;</a>

is right to honour decisions made by the previous regulator, if
sanctions were put in place, based on the criteria at the time the case
was considered. The alternative would be a costly reconsideration of
all past cases against the new parameters, which would place additional
burdens on all concerned. A person with a sanction may still appeal
against the continuation of the sanction after the relevant time period
specified has elapsed. The appeal would then be considered under the
new regulatory
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000222">&#160;</a>

of professionals in helping to define their profession, putting
teachers at odds with other professionals such as accountants, doctors
and lawyers. Bearing in mind what is in the schedule, will the Minister
outline what appropriate bodies will be consulted during the
determination of content and standards of such courses? If he does not
have the information available to hand, it would be great to receive a
letter at

                        <p class="tabbed">As
with other amendments, this is a probing amendment on a relatively
narrow and straightforward part of the Bill. The purpose of the
amendment is to ask whether the Bill would enable GTCE property,
including intellectual property rights and the name
“GTCE”, to transfer to a charity. Clause 12 and schedule
3 provide for the winding up and transfer to the Secretary of State of
GTCE affairs to do with staff, property, rights and liabilities. I
understand that the GTCE is seeking a new home for its teacher
professional development model, the Teacher Learning Academy, and it
will be transferred through an open sale of its intellectual property
assets.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The GTCE has
developed and invested in the TLA over the past eight years. It is now
a highly valued system of support for continuing professional
development. Hundreds of schools have used the TLA as a school
improvement tool, and more than 17,000 teachers across England have
joined the TLA to improve their teaching and learning. Following the
Government’s announcement of their intention to close the GTCE,
the council hopes to transfer the TLA to a new owner by 1 September.
The schedule will allow that to happen to a variety of bodies, but it
omits the word “charity”. This is a probing amendment to
determine whether that is still an appropriate avenue for the GTCE to
explore.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000243">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think I can deal with this matter fairly briefly.
The hon. Gentleman has explained that the amendment would enable the
Secretary of State to transfer any of the GTCE’s properties,
rights and liabilities to a charity once the property transfer scheme
in schedule 3 comes into force. He made his case briefly but
effectively, and I understand his concerns. However, when the property
transfer scheme is in force, the Secretary of State will already have
the powers to enable him to transfer properties and rights to a charity
or any other appropriate organisation without specific need for an
amendment to the Bill. Perhaps I can make the point more clearly. There
is nothing to stop any appropriate organisations, such as charities,
which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, offering to take on aspects of the
GTCE’s non-statutory work once the GTCE is abolished. The

such a proposal about the practicalities of that, but we do not need to

                           </strong> I want to probe the Minister’s thinking on
this. Given the Government’s rhetoric, and especially that of
the Secretary of State for Education, about the value of a big society
in which voluntary groups and charitable organisations come together to
help run certain aspects of what could be the state’s business,
does the Minister think that such action is an appropriate use of funds
and powers? Does he think that the Secretary of State would look
favourably on, if not prefer, charities running that part of the
functions? Does he think that such action is something that charities,
social enterprise and community interest groups should be looking
at?<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000245">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The marriage of what the Government can do and what
the charitable and voluntary sector can do is an important part of
building the big society that the hon. Gentleman describes. As he knows
very well, I am a Burkean Conservative and believe in the little
platoons that can comprise civil society, so we would be happy to
engage with any organisation that was interested in dialogue about what
role it could play. However, I am not ideologically committed. I have
no dogma against the role of government; I think government is a
civilising force in society. I do not want to open up a gulf between
myself and my the Minister of State, Department for Education, my hon.
Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton—there is no
possibility of doing so, given the closeness of our professional
relationship—but there is a balance is to be struck between what
the Government do in such circumstances and what other organisations

prevent that. Indeed, given his reference to the broader narrative of

guidance, Mr Walker: does that mean that things are getting earlier, or
are they getting later and being left overnight? I am not entirely
sure. In many respects, it was helpful of the Schools Minister to
outline the points on which I probed him in respect of abolition
servings during our deliberations on clause 8. They are quite relevant
to our consideration of schedule 3.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000251">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In many
respects, the schedule does not tell us anything that we did not know
from our deliberation on clause 8. The Minister
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“As
we have set out in the Bill Impact Assessment, our current estimate is
that the annual cost of the activities that will be carried out in

£8m.”<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
was established in our deliberations last week. However, I want to talk
about the impact of staff, the ongoing cost pressures of staff, and any
liabilities arising from premises. We discussed staff last week. In the
letter that I received this morning, the Minister
said:<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“You
also asked me about the impact of closure on the GTCE’s staff
and whether this would lead to redundancies. As I explained in
Committee, these are extremely sensitive issues affecting
people’s careers and futures and we are currently engaged in
detailed discussions within the Department and with the GTCE on how our
proposals in the Bill, and the creation of the new executive agency,
will impact on GTCE
staff.”<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000327">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is not good enough. There will be 200 people who are concerned about
their job prospects and are uncertain about the future. Notwithstanding
the sensitive and often confidential nature of union dealings on staff
and personnel issues, will the Minister provide any more reassurance
that those 200 people, who are fulfilling a valuable job in the
regulation of the teaching profession, will have future employment in
the new executive agency? Given the good job that they have done, they
deserve nothing less. It would be helpful if the Minister intervened to
say whether he thinks that
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also the ongoing cost pressure of staff. I am unclear—this
again links into what was said in the debate on clause 8—on the
liabilities that the Department will incur as a result of the
short-sighted and misguided decision to abolish the GTCE. I have the
income and expenditure accounts of the GTCE in front of me. The
accounts state that the income of the GTCE totals some £19.6
million, of which teacher registration fees make up £19.2
million. A lot of that—some £33 of the £36
registration fee—comes directly from the Exchequer
anyway.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000255">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Expenditure
has three main categories: staff costs of £8.3 million,
depreciation of £661,000 and other expenditure of
£10.2 million. If the premise is that no activity will take
place, which I do not accept, and that the £10.2 million of
“other expenditure” will be reduced, the Department for
Education will still be exposed for some £8 million a year. In
negotiations with the Treasury, has the Minister been able to negotiate
anything with regard to safeguarding additional money to compensate for
that ongoing pressure? Alternatively, is this an exposure and a
departmental pressure that he has to take into account, which will mean
that other programmes within the Department will be lost, whether it is
Sure Start, the September guarantee or anything else? All those things
will be under further pressure. The budgetary situation in the
Department is extremely tight. Programmes are being lost. This is an
additional pressure that could put further programmes at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000256">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I just want to establish the basis on which the
hon. Gentleman’s case is predicated. We have made a convincing
argument that the current system is not as cost-effective as it might
be. The assumption that seems to underpin the charges that he makes is
that the system is cost-effective, represents good value for money and
can be tested against taxpayer interest. Given his professional
expertise in such matters, I do not think

                           </div>that he would want that to stand on the record. I do not assume for one

                           </strong> No, not at all. The Minister said
earlier—he also paid tribute to the Opposition, which was
welcome—that in the current financial climate, every individual
working in the public sector should be looking for efficiencies. I
absolutely agree with that. It is important that we secure value for
money for the public purse. There is not a sheet of paper between us on
that. Given that the Secretary of State has decided to abolish the
GTCE, and given the liabilities that the schedule gives the Secretary
of State, I am suggesting that there is an additional cost pressure of
£8 million that the Secretary of State will have to absorb in
his departmental budget, which will be to the expense of other valuable
programmes promoting children and education. If the Minister can
provide me with any help and assistance on that issue, I would be
grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000258">&#160;</a>

point, which is relatively minor, concerns premises. The annual report

by the hon. Gentleman. First, I do not want to conduct delicate and
sensitive negotiations about staff in Committee, but decisions on
staffing will be made by the GTCE, which will take advice, where
appropriate, from the Department. The GTCE will identify staff who are
eligible to transfer. The rule is that where someone spends more than
half their time working on a function that will be transferred to the
Department, the Cabinet Office statement of practice will invoke the
principles of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
Regulations 1981 and 2006, and those staff will have the right to
transfer. The GTCE will work within Cabinet Office protocols on
redundancy
schemes.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000262">&#160;</a>

many times, we see the Secretary of State make an announcement to look
decisive, tough, on the side of parents and teachers, or whatever, but
the financial consequences of the measure could be massive. As it is,
the GTCE is very well managed financially. It has a relatively healthy
balance sheet and a net asset position of around £9 million. I
feel confident, as I am sure the Minister does, that it can absorb any
liabilities that arise, but there is still a worrying trend of the
Secretary of State making announcements in order to look good and
positive, only for there to be enormous and potentially disastrous
financial consequences afterwards. I ask the Minister to appeal to the
Secretary of State to ensure due consultation with important
stakeholders before decisions are made, because if that does not
happen, ultimately, it could rebound badly on the Secretary of State

and(b) it is made by or on
behalf of a registered student aged 17 or under at the

allegation.(4) Any person may
make an application to an appropriate criminal court for an order
dispensing with the restrictions imposed by subsection
(3).(5) The court may make an
order dispensing with the restrictions, to the extent specified in the
order, if it is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do
so, having regard to the welfare of the person who is the subject of
the allegation.(6) The power
under subsection (5) of a magistrates’ court may be exercised by
a single justice.(7) In the
case of a decision of a magistrates’ court to make or refuse to
make an order under subsection (5), a person mentioned in subsection
(8) may, in accordance with Criminal Procedure
Rules—(a) appeal to the
Crown Court against the decision,
or(b) appear or be represented

appeal.(8) The persons
referred to in subsection (7)

was a party to the proceedings on the application for the
order;(b) any other person
with the leave of the Crown
Court.(9) On an appeal under
subsection (7), the Crown Court
may—(a) make such an
order as is necessary to give effect to its determination of the
appeal, and(b) make such
incidental or consequential orders as appear to it to be
just.(10) The restrictions in
subsection (3) cease to apply once there are proceedings in a court in
respect of the offence.

Government’s general approach and the new restrictions that they
propose to introduce on reporting alleged teaching misconduct, although
I am sure that my hon. Friends and I will have some very probing
questions on how that will work in practice. On restrictions and
anonymity, we want to ensure that we get the balance right and that the
safeguarding of children and child protection are also taken into
account. I know some of my hon. Friends will want to probe the Minister
further on that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000281">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That
is a positive statement of support from school leaders. However, it is
disappointing that the restrictions in clause 13 will apply only to
school teachers. The amendments probe why the Government have made that
provision applicable only to school teachers; they are intended to
ensure that anonymity applies equally to non-teaching staff, such as
support staff, and to teaching and non-teaching staff in sixth-form and
further education

ASCL said it strongly believed that the provisions should be extended
to cover teachers and support staff in colleges and support staff in
schools, who, after all, make up half of the school work force these
days, which some people might not realise. Anybody who has visited a
school in recent years will have noticed how many more people there are
working in our schools than there were many years ago. All those people
working in our schools are potentially vulnerable to having their
careers ruined by false and/or malicious allegations. Why, therefore,
are they explicitly excluded from the provisions by the
Government?<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000284">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
ASCL shared examples of schools’ accounts showing why school
support staff should also be given anonymity in the Bill. One of its
examples was a state boarding school in which sexual health clinics for
students were run with the aid of the local health service. That meant
NHS staff are alongside non-teaching staff, without any teachers being
present, engaged in the clinics. That is an area potentially fraught
with danger of allegations. What if a nurse, an adviser or a counsellor
employed by a school—who by definition deal one to one, often
with disturbed children—is the subject of such allegations? Why
have the Government explicitly omitted such staff from clause
13?<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000285">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Unison
told us that support staff of all descriptions, not only teachers, deal
with poor pupil behaviour and with vulnerable children, regularly
having allegations made against them. That is not surprising perhaps,
given that support staff often have to deal with issues in the school
yard, the corridors or, occasionally, in classrooms,

                           </div>in particular when lessons are not taking place. To paraphrase Unison,
support staff often have to intervene in bullying incidents in the
playground, for example. They might often be the first people
confronted by angry parents. They regularly have to deal one to one
with pupils with special educational needs statements, who are assessed
as vulnerable or who have other behavioural
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000286">&#160;</a>

ASCL also gave us examples of why anonymity is needed for staff in
further education and in sixth-form colleges. One example was of a
member of the college security staff who received a series of
inappropriate telephone calls and messages from a student.
Unfortunately, the messages were intercepted by his aggrieved wife, who
was completely unaware that the infatuation was one-sided and on the
part of the student. Misinterpreting the messages, she reported the
matter to the local press, and it was publicised in local newspapers,
including personal details of that member of staff. After a thorough
college investigation, the member of staff was found to have done
nothing wrong, and the student was disciplined internally for the
incident. However, the security officer concerned suffered serious
problems from the attitudes of other students, parents and staff as a
result.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000289">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Why
is the line being drawn where it is being drawn by the Government? What
is the justification, given the evidence from support staff, teaching
and school leader unions that the matter is of equal concern to, and
can cause equal problems for, others who are part of the family of
staff working in schools and
colleges?<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000290">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
group of amendments also seeks to extend anonymity to claims made by or
on behalf of former pupils. The Bill provides protection for teachers
only if a false allegation is made by a pupil currently attending the
school. Often, an allegation is made by pupils who have left an
institution, if they have a particular grudge about how they were
treated—perhaps they have been excluded from the institution as
a result of their behaviour. That might be a reason why an allegation
is made by a student against a member of staff at the school. The NUT,
for example,
said:<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000291">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Arguably
children who have been excluded from school or have transferred to

                           </span> It will not be a surprise
to the Committee to know that I have been involved many times in
advising head teachers whether a member of staff should be immediately
suspended when an allegation is made. It is always a difficult
balance—taking into account the severity of the allegation, in
some respects, the nature of the child, whether it has happened before
and whether a situation has arisen. It is always difficult, and in the
vast majority of cases, the allegations made are malicious and
subsequently found to be without foundation. Such allegations cause
massive distress to the member of staff, so I welcome the thrust of the
Government’s proposal. However, I would support my hon. Friend
the Member for Cardiff West in saying that the issue is not just about
teachers, and I do not understand why the clause is just about
teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000296">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I remember
an awful case—I was not personally involved with it—that
became notorious in the sector. In a special school in County Durham,
an allegation was made against the head teacher, who ended up being
suspended on full pay for 18 months. The child went on to make
allegations against other members of staff. The situation grew and got
a life of its own. Other children started to make allegations against
members of staff, and the whole thing seemed to grow almost in
proportion to the compensation that the families
felt that they might get; they were perhaps encouraged by the lawyers,
who were all on legal aid. The whole thing ended up taking 18 months.
There was no foundation in the allegations that were made
against the head teacher, teachers, support staff, or training staff.
It cost a fortune in public money to keep those staff on full pay and
replace them with other people. Much legal aid went into the case,
which became an industry. I welcome the direction that the Government
are taking, but the matter concerns not only teachers but other members
of
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000297">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
many cases, the young people who are most likely to make allegations of
this nature will spend more time with members of staff who are not
teachers, such as learning mentors and support staff. When I visit
classrooms, I am surprised that the most needy children, who have the
most difficulty with learning, are often spending time with the less
qualified member of staff. The highly qualified, professional member of
staff is often spending time with the children who are not going to
have any difficulties with learning. When I have pointed that out 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 542<a class="bkMark" name="Column542">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to teachers, they have found it equally surprising. The Government
should take it into account, therefore, that in many cases, allegations
are likely to be made against staff who do not have
QTS.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
young people now, from the age of 14, attend further education
colleges. I do not understand why teachers in such colleges should be
treated differently from teachers in schools. Support staff in FE
colleges often teach young people who have significant behavioural
difficulties, and complex and chaotic lives. We know from experience
that such children are the most likely to make allegations.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000299">&#160;</a>

children’s services are not part of the Minister’s
responsibility, but generally they rest within the Education
Department. The Select Committee on Education heard evidence in its
recent inquiry into behaviour, which looked at issues arising with
social workers. The Minister came along and told us that he wants to
raise the status of social workers, as he wants to do for teachers
today. I have been involved many times in pulling together files,
because allegations are made against social workers, who are doing
their best on this work.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000300">&#160;</a>

                           </span> It is always a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Walker. We all know horror stories of
people in schools who are accused of offences that they did not commit.
Accusations may be deliberately false and malicious, or may result from
a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of an event. In reality,
whatever the cause of an allegation, the member of staff is routinely
suspended before any investigation.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000303">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Suspension
is deemed to be a neutral act, but anyone who has experienced it will
say that it feels far from neutral. Usually, people are not told what
the allegation is, they are told to have no contact with other members
of staff, and are sent home to worry. The allegation can have a wider
impact, too. If the accused person is a guide, scout leader or sports
leader in their private time, they might not be able to continue with
that activity. If their friends are teachers or other workers in
school, they cannot have any contact with them. They are isolated and
often have no idea what they have been accused of, so their minds work
overtime to try to work out what it can be. We know many cases of
accused people becoming very ill and, in some tragic cases, taking
their own lives.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000304">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Whether or
not the allegation is false, the pupil who makes it immediately knows
that the worker is not in school, so the rumours start to spread.
Investigations may take up to two years, particularly if the police are
involved. Other pupils miss out because the teacher is not taking their
classes, especially if the allegation occurs during crucial periods,
such as exam time, or if the support worker is not working with them.
Often, even if the worker is found to be totally innocent, they can
never return, and are made to appear guilty because they are not in
school.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000305">&#160;</a>

destroyed and their life may be over, too. Opposition Members totally

why all workers should be treated the same. In reality, if an

whether that is a good thing or bad thing—for that person it is
a bad thing—and if there is truth in the allegation it will come
out, either in a court case or with the worker being disciplined in
some way or sacked. It is about protection at the moment of an
allegation. As my hon. Friend the Member for North West Durham said,
allegations can frequently be false or misleading in some
way.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000307">&#160;</a>

about the investigation process and what happens when an allegation is

the press. It is about saying that somebody’s life should be

people whose lives are destroyed by those allegations. I accept what
the Government are doing in including anonymity for teachers, but I
believe that it should go further and be applied to all staff. I will
go on to talk more about the roles that other people play in schools.

vulnerable to accusations than the teacher. They are often involved in
enforcing discipline and, as my hon. Friend the Member for North West

an investigation. During that investigation, the real
perpetrator—someone from the pupil’s home
life—would then be found out. All staff in schools, whether they
work wholly in that school or across a range of schools, deserve the
same level of support as teachers. The Bill should reflect the
diversity of institutions and protect all workers.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000312">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Staff are
still at risk when pupils leave school. My ex-colleague was asked to
give evidence in a case from over 25 years ago. Many people address
issues of abuse only once well into their adult lives. We know that
abuse is incredibly damaging and wrecks the lives of survivors, but we
also know that memory is not always accurate, and displacement can
occur. Anonymity is crucial. This is not about protecting perpetrators
of abuse, but about protecting the
innocent.<a class="bkMark" name="110322115000313">&#160;</a>
