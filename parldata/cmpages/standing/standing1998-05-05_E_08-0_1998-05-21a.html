<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For their convenience, Committee members may remove their jackets if they so wish.<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The individual savings account regulations, which were promised on Monday, on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, have failed to appear despite constant entreaties to the Paymaster General during the past three months. The Committee will need those regulations in order to debate future clauses. [Interruption.] I gather that individual hon. Members have received copies. However, copies are not available from the Vote Office for Members generally, despite the gist of the regulations having appeared in the press on Monday and Tuesday. Will the Financial Secretary explain how the press has discovered the document’s contents before Committee members?<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the provision of Government papers is a matter for the Government, not for the Chair. However, the Chair and Madam Speaker deprecate the provision of papers to the press before their distribution to Members of Parliament. I understand that the document in question was mailed to hon. Members last night. If the Financial Secretary wishes to respond, she may.<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I can confirm your point, Mr. Gale. If the hon. Gentleman checks his post, he may find that he has received a copy.<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. Can the Financial Secretary also confirm that the full consultation responses on the ISA exercise, which the Paymaster General assured us would accompany the document, are now available in the Library? They were not there this morning.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Again, that is a matter for the Government. If the Financial Secretary wishes to respond, she may. I shall now resume the business that we failed to conclude late on Tuesday night.<H4><center>Clause 42</center></H4>

<P>
Amendment proposed [19 May]: No. 129, in page 24, line 39, leave out<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘which gives a true and fair view’<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
and insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘drawn up according to generally accepted accounting principles,’.—[Mr. Gibb.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Good morning, Mr. Gale. We began to debate the amendment on Tuesday, when a number of questions were raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). He said that clause 42 would introduce the change from a cash basis for professionals. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands the difference between, say, a barrister and a small company, to which he repeatedly referred. However, he asked whether the clause would apply to companies, and I am happy to answer.<P>
I should remind the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) that they agreed that the phrase “a true and fair view” had a precise meaning that accountants understood. The Government are using that concept so that accounts must include debtors, creditors and work in process, rather than the more cuddly phrase “open to interpretation”, which would cause confusion and dispute, the very things that the right hon. Member for Wells and the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton want to avoid for the profession. They know that there is no clear meaning of the phrase, <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“according to generally accepted accounting procedures”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
So it is important that the legislation should make that clear. The first point was that the phrase “true and fair” had no technical meaning and would not achieve the Government’s objectives. That is not the Government’s opinion. The two hon. Gentlemans confirmed that the phrase had a definite meaning for accountants, and that it had always been the law that tax on profits was computed by applying accountancy principles. This phrase ensures that those principles are applied.<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked a specific question about clause 42(1), regarding the phrase,<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“subject to any adjustment required by law.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The clause sets out tax law, as it applies to any business, and its purpose is to ensure that it does not preserve the cash basis. There may be a strategy provision that any item is not deductible to tax even though it may be written off in the balance sheet, for example in relation to entertainment costs, but the purpose is clear.<P>
Next, the hon. Gentleman asked whether the phrase “true and fair view” meant that the Revenue would always accept accountancy treatment for tax purposes. The right hon. Member for Wells also raised that question. The answer is no. It does not mean that. The accountancy treatment remains subject to any adjustment required or authorised by law in computing profits for tax purposes.<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton then went on to ask about section 8(2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970 and about making a complete and correct return. As he knows, that refers to income tax payers. The accounts have nothing to do with it; it is the figure of profits that is required, not the account. The hon. Gentleman then went on to ask several questions on behalf of the Institute of Directors, including one about prudence and materiality. Indeed, that organisation raised the same question with the Government. The clause merely seeks to put professionals on the same basis as other traders. Everyone else follows this practice, but professionals do not, and the law now requires them to do so. Professionals will be able to take prudence and materiality into accountant in exactly the same way as other businesses already can. That cannot be beyond the wit of such talented and experienced members of a profession that is held in such high regard.<P>
The continuing discussions between all the professionals and the Revenue have been positive about ensuring that everyone is clear about the Revenue’s interpretation of the legislation and that everyone understands what is intended. To my knowledge, there have been no problems so far and the Revenue is always happy to discuss queries about tax returns.<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge):  Will the Financial Secretary give way?<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> May I deal with the legal points first? The hon. Gentleman did not speak in the debate—he can, but in courtesy to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I should deal with the specific legal points that he raised.<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is confused about the relevance of Pepper v. Hart. As he knows, it concerned benefits in kind and the court said, as a side issue, that when legislation was unambiguous, Hansard could be used in court. The Governments legislation is not unambiguous and I have no intention of being unambiguous on the record.<P>
The hon. Gentleman then referred to the Duple Motor Bodies v. Ostime case of 1951. The decision in that case was not quite what he suggested, but that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a basis of valuation which conforms with accountancy principles cannot be challenged by the Revenue unless it violates some rule of tax law”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The hon. Gentleman also knows that accountancy practice on the inclusion of overheads has changed substantially since that case.<P>
The main point made by the hon. Gentleman concerned Threlfall v Jones, in which the court decided that accountancy standards were acceptable for tax purposes. That is what the Government are doing.<P>
Does the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) wish to intervene on the legal points? I shall explain whether the clause changes the law for companies, which was the general thrust of the comments by the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Wells. The hon. Gentleman said that it was important that the record stated the position. How is this for being clear? No. Companies are not, in law, capable of carrying on a profession or vocation. Cash basis has never applied to companies, which are in the same position as any other non-professional business, there is no change in the law covering the basis on which they compute their profits.<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I am astonished by that speech from the hon. Lady. When the professions and outside bodies read it, they will realise the problems that arise when a Labour Government is elected and Ministers of the hon. Lady’s calibre are appointed to the Treasury. That was an appalling response to my speech. She has no understanding whatever of the issues I raised. I want to ask her one question. Does clause 42(1) apply to trades?<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I expect the hon. Gentleman to disagree with me. There would be something wrong if people with such diverse politics agreed, but our discussions with the professions were very clear and there is a precise understanding of what is going on. My answer is yes, that clause 42(1) does apply to trades, but it does not change the law. That is the issue and the theme to  which he kept returning. He is trying to imply that the change concerning professionals and cash basis changes the law in a wider context. I have explained that it does not.<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about audit, but then answered his own question. He knows that there is no link between “true and fair” and audit.<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked whether tax treatment would change as accountancy evolved. It may do, but the courts continually recognise that that is already happening. The courts have always wanted to tax profits based on accountancy principles as the evolve.<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to make a speech, he can.<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary for giving way, but I do not want to make a speech.<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have not given way.<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Then perhaps I may briefly ask the Financial Secretary a question. I am genuinely confused because she has referred several times in her speech to professions in relation to clause 42. My understanding is that the clause applies to all self-employed people taxed under schedule D. Is that the case or will it, as she implied in her speech, apply just to professionals.<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I should declare an interest. I am a senior partner in a law firm and I hope shortly to become a consultant, although that is not related to the introduction of the Bill. My firm is fully on the cash basis and, as with many law firms, no element of the earnings or accruals basis is included in its accounts.<P>
I hope that the Committee will allow me to take a short trip down memory lane. A change in the cash basis was flagged up by the Revenue in about 1984 in a paper entitled “The Preceding Year Basis of Assessment and the Cash Basis”. Nothing came of that; it did not have an impact on the cash basis of assessment. Last year, the Government announced proposals for the abolition of the cash basis on what were draconian and unfair terms. Setting the time limit at three years, tying outgoing partners into liability and the impact of self-assessment meant that there was to be a large charge to tax in the first year. Subsequent consultation has ensured that the Finance Bill contains a far fairer system of transitional arrangements.<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to flag up three main points that arise from clauses 42 to 46. The first is that I have written to the Financial Secretary for confirmation that a partner or proprietor’s time should not be included within a “true and fair view”—the words used in clause 42(1)—of the work in progress of a business. It never has in the past because it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the costs of a partner’s or proprietor’s time. I hope that the Financial Secretary will give the Committee that confirmation.<P>
Our discussions on Tuesday and earlier this morning raised one important point which is, I believe, a Pepper v Hart matter because we are dealing with issues that are not in the Bill. The words “true and fair view” are used in clause 42(1). Do the Government expect to import to numerous small businesses, not just professions, additional costs and burdens such as complying with standard accounting practice and other accounting procedures? I hope that the Financial Secretary will answer that question directly and put it on the record. Being conversant with Pepper v. Hart and the benefits in kind of the Malvern school master, I hope that we can rely on the Government’s statement.<P>
My second point relates to the problem of delaying payment, especially by Government Departments and, in particular, the Legal Aid Board. On Tuesday afternoon, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Lord Chancellor told the House that Ministers were considering including the Legal Aid Board in the legislation on late payment of debts. The problem arises from the anachronistic and protracted system of assessing lawyers’ costs, misleadingly referred to as taxation. But it has nothing to do with taxation. It takes a great deal of time to assess lawyers’ costs and to decide what they should be paid. Although the system is ripe for review and change, it is in use now. A lawyer who has completed a case has to wait a significant amount of time before his costs are quantified and agreed by the taxing master. After that it becomes a matter for the Legal Aid Board which is not swift in paying. What redress can be given to professionals and business men whose money is being held back by the Government, while that same Government are demanding tax on that unquantified unpaid money? That is grossly unfair by any measure of a yardstick.<P>
My third and last point is on clause 43. It is not a churlish point; I appreciate that early years at the Bar are extremely financially difficult. But the early years in other trades and professions are also difficult. The continuation of the cash basis in the first seven years, for which clause 43 provides, should be available to those other trades and professions.<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will address all three points in due course. I look forward to hearing her comments.<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I rise to put one point to the Financial Secretary.<P>
She and other Ministers have made it clear that they will consult with the professions in relation to the valuation of professional work in progress, which has been welcomed. Ministers have gone further in suggesting that contingency fee work—work in progress relating to contingency fee or conditional agreement work—will not be brought into account under standard accounting practice 9.<P>
We need to consider small practitioners, who are not fat-cat lawyers in any sense. As the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) said, big and medium-sized firms often operate on a cash or, indeed, hybrid basis—very few large significant firms operate on a cash basis. We are considering proposals that will relate to the typical small high-street law firm, with one or two partners, which is dependent on legal aid work. All hon. Members will accept that such work is hugely important. Given the great delay in payments to typical high-street solicitors for legal aid work, will the Financial Secretary consider making a statement to the effect that overdue payments will not come into account for the purposes of the “true and fair view” procedure until they have been taxed and received by the small practitioner?<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I join my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton in saying that the Financial Secretary’s reply was well below par and has further confused the issue. She said that tax assessments were worked out on the same accountancy principles that applied to company accounts under company law. That is simply untrue, and we gave some examples of that when we last debated the issue. Farm accounts, for tax purposes, are not required to include overheads in work in progress. But the phrase “true and fair” implies that there will be adherence to standard accounting practice 9—my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), who has more recent experience, is nodding to confirm that—which stipulates how work in progress is to be calculated. Under the clause, therefore, tax computations will have to be made on a new basis, the effects of which could extend beyond the professions to trades, farming and so on. The Financial Secretary did not address that issue or appear to understand our points.<P>
The phrase “true and fair” has, put simply, a specific meaning for accountants, and it would be a new departure if it were to read over to tax computation. If standard accounting practice guidance notes were to change, tax assessments would change as well. I wish that she had showed some understanding of the matter—she cannot be receiving dud advice, so there must be some confusion in her mind.<P>
Incidentally—and I say this with a genuine wish to be helpful—the Financial Secretary made a slip when she discussed Pepper v. Hart. She said that the case was relevant only when legislation was unambiguous, but I am sure that she meant that it was relevant when it was ambiguous, and she should correct her statement.<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo indicated assent</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It would be ironic if her interpretation of the case’s relevance to legislation created more ambiguities, because the case was designed to clear up ambiguity.<P>
The Financial Secretary tried to clarify some issues, but frankly, she does not currently show any understanding of the distinction between accounting and tax computations or of the clause’s implications, some of which are very damaging. Will she try, at this very late stage, to answer as clearly as she can some of the very good points that my hon. Friends raised?<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked whether the clause would apply to all self-employed people. Yes it will, but it will only change the law for professionals.<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon raised several points about two clauses, and he asked about the extension to other professions. During the consultation period, many respondents—including many who are not barristers—stressed the unique nature of the barrister’s profession. Unlike other professionals, barristers who wish to practice have to be self-employed sole practitioners from the outset. That is why we shall not extend the seven-year provisions, to which the hon. Gentleman referred.<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the costs of partner’s and principal’s time, and he said that principal’s time should not be included in work in progress. I confirm that that is the case—partner’s time need not be included in work in progress. There will be no additional burdens for business other than those relating to professionals who move from the cash basis.<P>
The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds discussed legal aid. The fact that most legal aid work is paid within 12 months is reasonable and we believe that the rules should apply.<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds also discussed conditional fees and work in progress. Discussions are currently under way. He also asked whether overdue payments under legal aid could be left out. No, they cannot. The clause requires practitioners to estimate what they are confident of receiving, and we do not consider that to be unreasonable.<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The point that I stressed involves the time that the Legal Aid Board takes to pay but it also involves an earlier hurdle that has to be jumped, namely, what is misleadingly called taxation, which involves an assessment of the amount of costs. Two hurdles have to be jumped before payment is made. That is why it is so unfair of the Government to demand tax on money that is being withheld.<P>
The second point that I want the Financial Secretary to clarify is fairly straightforward. Does she believe that the words “true and fair view” import on numerous small businesses the additional costs and burdens of complying, for example, with standard accounting practices, and in particular with SAP 9?<P>

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> For the third time of answering, and as I said just now, the proposals will apply only to professionals.<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I did not understand the Financial Secretary’s earlier comment.<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sorry, but the matter should be clear by now because I have explained it three times. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon was not the only Committee member to ask that question after my earlier explanation.<P>
There have never been special tax rules for money that has not been paid on time. The Government do not condone late payments, and the hon. Gentleman will be aware of the steps that the Department of Trade and Industry is taking to deal with the problem. I understand his point about taxation, but when identifying work those affected should declare what they are confident of receiving payment for.<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked about farm accounts. I am not knowledgeable about the matter, although the right hon. Gentleman may be, both professionally and personally. The regulations relating to stock valuation were agreed for convenience to correct many invalid practices, and they do not represent a precedent for all businesses. However, the right hon. Gentleman may know more about that matter than I do, and I bow to his greater professional and personal experience.<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It is clear that we are not going to get an answer out of the Financial Secretary. Either she does not understand the matter or the Treasury and the Inland Revenue genuinely do not have answers.<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked fairly clearly whether SAP 9, which deals with the assessment of work in progress, will apply. One assumes that it will, because the phrase “true and fair” seems to import such standard accounting practices, but if it does import SAP9, that would have major implications. We were hoping to get a straight answer from the Financial Secretary, but if she would prefer to write to us about the matter, we should generously accept that.<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I very much want a response to that clear question. There is a difference between cash basis and accruals basis. The Financial Secretary said that the proposal would apply only to professionals and that there would be no change in the law relating to traders, but she confused the matter with the meaning of the phrase “true and fair”. The clause, as she has at last acknowledged, will apply to sole traders—to ordinary traders—up and down the country, and not simply to professionals.<P>
Do the clause and the phrase “true and fair” mean that standard accounting practices will have to apply to all businesses, which they do not currently do? Will she say yes or no, clearly and for the record, so that Pepper V. Hart can apply? That would put at rest the minds of accountants up and down the country, who would otherwise be required by the clause to redo the accounts of small businesses. Will she please say whether the clause means that SAPs will apply to small businesses?<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. We are now in some difficulty. It is clear that the Financial Secretary does not know the answer, and we shall have to return to the matter. Mr. Gale, you generously allowed a fairly wide debate on the amendment, but will you allow us to return to the matter in our debates on subsequent amendments to the clause?<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Chair’s position is plain. I am about to put the Question unless the hon. Gentleman intends to withdraw the amendment. There will be a further opportunity for the Committee to debate this issue on clause stand part. The right hon. Gentleman may take comfort from that. I am getting no signals that the amendment will be withdrawn, so I shall put the Question.<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘where the profits for that period of account exceed £350,000’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 46 in clause 43, page 25, line 14, after ‘practice’, insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘which in any year of account do not exceed £350,000 or’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
No. 128, in page 25, line 13, at end add—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(6) This section shall not apply to the profits of a trade, profession or vocation in any year of account where such profits are less than £300,000 (computed on a basis consistent with any profit or loss for the previous year)’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The committee should realise that the changes introduced by the clause will impose a huge unannounced tax increase on small legal or accountancy businesses, which employ many people. They face a tax hike. The Inland Revenues press release on the day of the Budget made it clear that over the 10-year transitional period—payments are scheduled to begin 31 January 2001—£40 million a year extra taxation will be generated as a result of the timing changes. That is £400 million over the 10-year transitional period.<P>
Opposition Members believe that that is an unannounced tax increase of some magnitude. As with so many of the proposals in this Budget and last July’s Budget, the Government said that they had no plans to raise taxation. We know how that promise has been betrayed. Many of our constituencies, including my own, the market town of Bury St. Edmunds, have small high-street accountancy firms and law firms. Those firms, which are numerous in rural areas and market towns, are feeling the pinch. We know from some of the comment at the time that they are anticipating the tax hit.<P>
The Financial Times of 19 March quoted Coopers and Lybrand as saying that the change represented<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“a significant rise in taxation”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
on small businesses. Earlier in the year on 18 January, The Mail on Sunday ran a faintly amusing headline.<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Primarolo dawn raid on professional tax”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Solicitors’ Journal on 20 February reported that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Lawyers fear tax move could put them out of business”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
We are referring to small firms—not large or medium firms such as many of us have in our constituencies.<P>
The £40 million a year over a 10-year period does not represent the true nature of the tax increase that the Government are imposing on small professional businesses. In addition, as Coopers and Lybrand made clear, the change from an accruals basis, which the clause and the schedule covering the catching-up charge implements, means that work in progress will be taxed on a different bases. In addition to the £40 million a year, the clause introduces an additional tax on profits for businesses.<P>
Small businesses are already under pressure. One or two-partner firms which rely on legal aid work will be hit. A Law Society survey at the end of 1994 demonstrated that some 40 per cent. of firms that relied substantially on legal aid work operated on a cash basis. For those businesses, the change in taxation will be a grievous blow on top of rising indemnity insurance costs, the change brought about by self-assessment under which the preceding year basis has been replaced by a current year basis, and the other legal aid changes that the Lord Chancellor is seeking to introduce. this is a time of considerable uncertainty for professional partners in small accountancy and law firms.<P>
The vice-chairman of the Legal Aid Practitioners Group, Mr Richard Miller, said that this could be the final nail in the coffin for some firms. The chairman of the Law Society’s revenue law committee said of the proposals that firms involved in legal aid work would suffer as a result of the long delays in payment for legal aid work. Many practitioners will be staggered by the Financial Secretary’s reference during an earlier debate to the effect that most legal aid was paid within 12 months. That is not the experience of the practitioners whom I know in small firms. <P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate the argument that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make and I fully understand his need to use examples, but this must not be turned into a debate about legal aid. We are discussing the computation of profits from a trade, profession or vocation and the specific amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Indeed, Mr Gale. I was using examples to show the pressure under which firms, particularly those concerned with legal aid work, will operate as a result of the clause. That brings me to the need for the amendment.<P>
My argument demonstrates the need for change, which is the purpose of amendment No. 47. The amendment suggests that businesses with profits of less than £350,000 should be allowed to continue on a cash basis if they have been doing so, with the Revenue’s consent, until now. This has a good provenance. By analogy, I refer to the cash accounting scheme, introduced by the Finance Act 1987. That scheme enabled businesses with turnovers of less than £350,000 to take advantage of the new regime for cash accounting, which meant that they were accountable only for payments that they had actually received. That was aimed particularly at those businesses that experienced difficulties with payments, late payments in particular. The scheme gave automatic bad debt relief which was an important benefit.<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We know that it was a good measure for small businesses because, at the time, the Prime Minister, when he was merely the hon. Member for Sedgefield, argued in favour of the VAT cash accounting regime. That is a direct analogy with the proposal that we are debating. In 1985, in a precursor to the Finance Bill 1987, the then hon. Member for Sedgefield argued:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“businesses are liable for VAT when they have issued an invoice, even though they have not received payment from the customer.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
He then went on to give a homely example of builders who were in that position. History does not record whether he was having maintenance work done on a bijoux suburban villa twixt Highbury and Islington, but he said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“A small builder may do work costing £15,000 or £20,000 and the VAT liability could be quite large. Cash flow problems are fairly common when traders are involved in such transactions.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The then hon. Member for Sedgefield got it right in relation to that provision. He got many things wrong in the 1980s, including unilateral disarmament and strong trade union powers, but he got this right. I believe that the Prime Minister, and indeed the Labour party, deserves credit for that. In one of his perorations, he said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Many traders find it hard to see why they should have to pay money, which they are supposed to pass on from their customers, when they have not received that money.”—[Official Report, 9 July 1985; Vol. 82, c. 1006.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is on all fours with the case that we are arguing about those small businesses that are not, in the case of legal aid work, receiving payment promptly. [Interruption.] Does the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) want to intervene?<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I am just curious a to know whether the hon. Gentleman is a solicitor.<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I was indeed a practitioner for a firm that did no legal aid work whatsoever. I am putting the case of the small, high street, solicitor. I have had no cash nexus with any legal firm of any description since March 1991 and certainly nave no interest to declare. We are talking about the small legal aid practitioner who relies on legal aid payments and does not always receive prompt payment. Such practitioners will be in serious financial difficulty as a result of the changes implemented by clause 42.<P>
The regime supported at that time by the right hon. Member for Sedgefield, by analogy, should be supported now. Businesses with profits of less than £350,000 should continue to be able to take advantage of the cash basis.<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman tell me why he believes that accountants and solicitors have tax privileges that are denied to other small businesses?<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am delighted to answer the hon. Lady’s question. It is because of the way in which they are paid. As I am sure she understands, most other manufacturers and traders receive payment much more promptly than solicitors. As the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon has said, there is a big time lag between completion of the work and the quantification of sums due to that practitioner as a result of taxation, and indeed of the late payment policy, which seems a deliberate policy on the part of the Lord Chancellor’s Department.<P>
<B>Mr. Douglas Alexander </B>(Paisley, South): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> In a minute.<P>
I cannot stress enough that Opposition Members have received correspondence on the matter, especially from small practitioners,<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that professions other than accountancy and law can also keep accounts on a cash basis? For example, actuaries, architects and surveyors can do so.<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. I am focusing my remarks on small practitioners of legal aid because they constitute an important sector of the criminal and civil justice system. They are also small businesses.<P>
I shall conclude by adverting to correspondence that I have received from a solicitor in Preston, which sums up the argument in favour of the amendment. He argues that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Many solicitors’ practices, particularly those engaged in social welfare law and relying upon legal aid, operate on extremely tight margins.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clearly, the timing change will prove a huge cash flow disbenefit to such businesses. He also said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“I employ 18 people who would lose their jobs.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
This is a small business argument—nothing more, nothing less.<P>
<B>Mr. Alexander:</B> As I am an associate in a firm of Scottish solicitors, I should begin by declaring an interest.<P>
In my experience of the legal profession, many of those described as the sole practitioners who undertake legal aid work are the very solicitors who would benefit most from the efficiencies referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper). Often, the accounting practices of such solicitors do not allow them to bill clients timeously. The issue is therefore not one of tax law but one of internal auditing and the billing of clients. Does the hon. Gentleman concede that that is a problem, and that current changes to the legal aid system will ensure that payments are more timeous, notwithstanding the more onerous responsibilities associated with ensuring that solicitors bill clients at the correct time?<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I wonder whether I should regard his intervention as evidence of a Government policy that payment of legal aid will be more timely. I am unaware that the Lord Chancellor has made such a proposal; if he has, I am sure that it will be widely welcomed by those small businesses and practitioners whom the amendment would benefit. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman has made an interesting concession that a problem exists.<P>
In fairness to the Government, since the proposal was announced on 22 December, they have consulted. They have made a special concession to barristers during their first seven years’ practice. They have also responded to widespread criticism of the initial proposal, and have deferred the operation of the scheme for one year. In that spirit of listening, the amendment should be given serious consideration.<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I rise to support the amendment, which is tabled in my name, too.<P>
Government Members have made some slip-ups, such as getting clauses out of place. They may well say that we ought to have referred in amendment No. 47 to the gross receipts of a business rather than to the profits, as the Law Society proposed.<P>
As with all Opposition amendments to this Bill, we seek to make a substantial point, which in this case is that the previous Government recognised the problems that small businesses of this type have in keeping the sophisticated records that are required and in knowing exactly what their receipts will be. Often the clients of such businesses will quibble over their bill—even some hon. Members might have to plead guilty to this—so the businesses do not receive the money for which they had hoped. The hon. Member for Paisley, South suggested that companies should bill more promptly, but billing less promptly is sometimes a marketing ploy to try to soften the blow to their clients, who are often equally short of cash.<P>
If the Government think that businesses can cope with the kind of change proposed, they are not living in the real world. That is why the Law Society supports the idea of a similar provision based on gross receipts to that which applies to cash accounting for VAT for this type of firm. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds said, the Prime Minister, who was then simply the hon. Member for Sedgefield, spoke in praise of that just a few years ago.<P>
Who are the professionals that will be affected? I am not a former bean counter, which was the phrase used by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies)—we know his attitude towards this group—nor have I ever been a lawyer or solicitor. But I am proud to represent a constituency that not only contains one of the country’s colleges of law but over 70 solicitors’ practices. As the hon. Member for Torridge and North Devon pointed out, surveyors, land agents—<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> It is Torridge and West Devon.<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I did not want to ally any of the parliamentary seats that the Liberal Democrats enjoy—<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> We have rather more seats than the hon. Gentleman’s party in Devon and Cornwall.<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Some strange things have happened in Devon and Cornwall—we have even had beasts on Bodmin Moor—but none are so strange as the number of Liberal Democrat Members representing the people there.<P>
Surveyors, land agents and architects will all be affected, but we should give special consideration to the people for whom solicitors are practising. They are the sort of people that hon. Members meet in their surgeries, who do not have the big problems dealt with by the big bracket firms, but everyday problems for which we often suggest that they go to the Citizens Advice Bureau. We rely on the voluntary work of solicitors who give help at those bureaux—often, as in my own town, they are members of the Citizens Advice Bureau free advice scheme, whereby local solicitors will give a free consultation to local people with local problems. Those are the professionals being mocked by Labour Members for the lack of sophistication in their accounting and billing procedures, but it is because of that lack of sophistication that they have the hard grip on reality that helps them to deal with the problems of the man and woman on the street. Labour Members are refusing to acknowledge the problems that will be experienced as a result of this clause.<P>
Of course we welcome the fact that these proposals will at lease be phased in over 10 years. Of course we welcome the fact that those affected have been given another year to invest in expensive equipment that will allow them to get up to speed. But because the cost of changing accounting systems will have to be incurred now, they will have to pay the extra taxation immediately.<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman making the same argument for accountants? Is he claiming that they are too unsophisticated to introduce proper billing systems for their clients?<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sure the hon. Lady heard me say that I was talking about solicitors who offer free advice to local people.<P>
<B>Mr. Alexander:</B> Surely those who are interested in ensuring that the public purse is dealt with prudently also have an interest in ensuring that those solicitors who use the legal aid budget have accounting systems that operate efficiently and effectively.<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sure that we would all acknowledge that the role of solicitors in small practices is to serve the people in our constituencies. Their role is not to invest in expensive software. The Law Society said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“many professional practices operate in the form of very small businesses and lack the sophisticated software and administrative procedures to cope with a fundamental change of this kind in a relatively short space of time”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is the authoritative voice of the Law Society. I am not a lawyer, but I believe the Law Society when it says that. Many of my constituents who work in small practices or who study at one of the colleges of law in Guildford will be affected by the changes.<P>
I believe that we can rest our case, especially if the right hon. Member for Sedgefield agrees with us about gross receipts. The Financial Secretary should hesitate before she knocks us down.<P>

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am grateful that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds was so generous in his comments about the fairness with which the Government have approached the proposal, which will be delayed for a year, spread over 10 years and capped. The measure is entirely fair. Some people may even criticise us for being a little over-fair to barristers.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Financial Secretary will find that the next group of amendments refers to barristers. We are discussing solicitors and other small businesses.<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amendments would provide for all of them, including barristers. There is no principle behind the three amendments. I shall deal with amendment No. 47 and amendment No. 128 first because they relate to clause 42. Amendment No. 46, however, is tabled to clause 43, so I shall deal with that in a moment.<P>
Amendment No. 47 would allow small practices to have profits of up to £350,000 before moving from a cash basis. Few barristers will be affected by the change—would move, whatever the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) said, because the position on profits and the difference with regard to VAT is clear. Clauses 42 to 46 will allow the professions not to move from a cash basis. Amendment No. 47 would let them have profits of £350,000 before moving to a cash basis. A point of principle is obviously not involved, because amendment No. 128 implies that if £350,000 is not available, £300,000 would do instead. My answer to both those questions is no. The proposal would not be fair—it would give exceptionally generous and unjustifiable support to a group. That matter was discussed during the consultation process, when we gave our reasons for rejecting the proposal—it is too generous, it is not necessary and it would undermine the clause’s basic principle, which is to move from a cash basis.<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Perhaps I should apologise to the Committee. In amendment No. 128, the £300,000 figure is the profit threshold at which small businesses pay the small business corporation tax rate. The figure therefore has a principle behind it, although the fact that no Opposition Member mentioned it suggests that it is not strongly advocated by us. There is also a principle behind the £350,000 figure, namely the growth receipts principle on VAT.<P>
I apologise for the fact that the two matters may have been confused, although the Financial Secretary was wrong to say that there is no principle behind our figures. There is a clear principle, and I look forward to discussing it.<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> VAT is a tax on supplies, not on profits, and there is a big difference between the two. To set the tax on supplies and to suggest replacing supplies with profits in order to create an exception is—how should I put this—an interesting suggestion. We are not prepared to accept the amendments. There was extensive consultation on the clauses. Despite the comments of Opposition Members, the Government’s intentions about the profession are clear.<P>
Amendment No. 46 would amend clause 43. I assume that it was grouped with amendments Nos. 47 and 128, which would amend clause 42, because they raise similar issues. I shall respond to amendment No. 46 now, but I assume that it will be moved formally later. It would withdraw the exemption for any year in which profits exceed £350,000, which would restrict the rights of barristers whose profits do not exceed £350,000. They could remain on a cash basis as long as their profits are £350,000—imagine—which clearly undermines the purpose of clauses 42 and 43. We therefore oppose the amendments. We have been generous in time, in the spread and in relation to the cap, which will assist business. We need consider this over-generous provision no further.<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I do not think that we need spend any more time on this matter. The Financial Secretary’s response contained only one sentence that was of any use—she said that the clause was about profits and that the VAT rules were about receipts. However, the explanatory notes say of clause 42:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The main practical difference between the new basis and the old is that debtors, creditors and work-in-progress must now be taken into account.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The VATable debtors of a business will have the biggest impact on profit calculation. That is why there is an absolute congruence between the thrust of our argument and the system that was accepted by the previous Government—and, indeed, by the Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Sedgefield, before he came to power.<P>
I am sorry that the Financial Secretary does not want to benefit those barristers, including the Prime Minister’s wife, who have earnings up to £350,000. The principle behind these probing amendments is that there should be a threshold. This morning, the Government rejected the idea of any threshold. That is wrong and it will be much regretted by the many small firms that will be affected by this irritating and time-consuming measure at a time when they have so many clients, whom they would rather be serving. I beg to ask leave to withdrawn the amendment.<P>

<H4><center>Barristers and advocates in early years of practice</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 25, line 17, after ‘(2)’, insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘Subject to subsection (2A) below.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 119, in page 25, line 19, at end insert—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(2A) In addition, barristers and advocates are deemed for this purpose to commence in actual practice when, having ceased for not less than three years to hold themselves out as available for free-earning work, they once again hold themselves out as so available.’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The amendments deal with a possible anomaly. The Government have conceded that barristers and advocates entering practice would suffer a severe cash flow disadvantage in that they would be assessed and required to pay tax on earnings that they had not received. As we have heard, that category of professional people must often wait many years for payment for their work. In the light of a number of representations that have been strongly made to them, the Government have agreed in clause 43 that the profits of barristers and advocates who enter the profession will be assessed on a different basis. Tax will be paid either on a cash basis, or by reference to fees earned when the amount has beenagreed or a fee note has been delivered. Barristers and advocates can choose which option to take.<P>
An allied category of people is those who have taken time out and later re-enter their profession. They suffer the same problems as if they were at the start of their career. I am thinking of women who take time out to start a family and, after a year or two, return to their profession. The start-up phenomenon will recur. The amendments would get over that by allowing people who have taken time away to avail themselves of the provisions in the clause in the same way as if they were starting in practice from scratch.<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Clause 43 provides barristers entering the profession with the three options described by the right hon. Member for Wells during the first seven years of practice. They have the option not to be taxed on a cash basis. The Government recognise the unique structure facing barristers, especially newly qualified barristers, when establishing themselves in the profession. The amendments would apply to any barrister or advocate who took a break from the profession for any reason. For example, a Member of Parliament who loses his or her seat at an election and returns to the Bar would start the seven years again, despite the fact that he or she would earn very generously while in Parliament, and would not be at the same disadvantage as someone starting a career.<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alexander:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that a clear distinction can be drawn between a Member of Parliament returning to practise at the Bar and someone who has just qualified at the Bar, who, as a devil, during his or her training at the Scottish Bar, is unable to earn during that year of training for qualification? The right hon. Gentleman did not make that distinction in his earlier speech.<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> My hon. Friend is quite right about the difficulties of newly qualified barristers—advocates in Scotland, as well as those in Northern Ireland and those at the English and Welsh Bar. The Bar councils are not renowned for their support and campaigning zeal in supporting women barristers who return to work. I recognise the point made by the right hon. Member for Wells about women returning to work after having children, but that applies to all women; it is not unique to women returning to the Bar. The Government were not persuaded to grant a general exemption, on the basis that it would be good for women, which would benefit anyone, for whatever reason a person left the Bar, whether or not that person had an income and whether or not it was substantial. Such a person could then return to the Bar and, for seven years, have an advantageous tax position. that is what the amendment would provide and it would undermine the principle.<P>
The Government have set out the principle that they wish to achieve—a move from taxation on a cash basis—and we are prepared to recognise particular circumstances, which we have done in the delay by one year, spreading over 10 years and the introduction of the cap. However, we are not prepared to accept amendments that wreck the purpose of the clause. So I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that we will not accept his amendment. We would not accept it if it tried to split the seven years and we certainly will not allow the seven years constantly to be renewed, so I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I have just one question for the Financial Secretary about the words “in actual practice” in clause 43(1). Does she regard earnings from pupillage as pre-commencement or post-commencement of actual practice? It is not clear from the wording whether taxation of earnings accrued during pupillage will be on a cash basis or some other basis.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> To allow a little refuelling to take place, I shall respond to a remark made by the hon. Lady. She seems to be in some confusion  about the purpose of the clause, which is to deal with the start-up situation. If that was good enough to require a whole new clause—clause 43—why is it not good enough for people who are restarting, where exactly the same arguments apply? Such people will not receive any cash on which to pay tax.<P>
I mention the specific example of a returning wife or mother, who, almost by definition, has no earnings of a schedule E nature on which to rely. Yet again, that illustrates that the Government are all talk when they speak about helping working women, mothers and all the people who are usually considered to be disadvantaged professionally, because, when it comes to thinking of a practical way to help such people return to work, they raise all sorts of difficulties and objections. Opposition Members try to limit their accusations of hypocrisy to genuine cases: this is one such case, in which the professed concern for women at work has not been translated into any sympathy at all for an amendment designed to help that category.<P>
We remain extraordinarily unimpressed by the Government’s defence of their stance on this group of amendments. An element of confusion has occasionally crept in, and an inability to grapple with the principles at stake has become evident. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds has just asked a rather technical question, and if he receives a reply we may not press the amendment to a Division.<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The Government have undertaken a considerable amount of work and have introduced policies that will assist women who are in paid employment and who have child care responsibilities. Further policies, which will be announced to the House this afternoon, are outlined in the “Fairness at Work” publication.<P>
The right hon. Gentleman claims that he is moving an amendment to assist women, but he is moving an amendment that undermines the purpose of the clauses and gives a general exemption to everybody who has a break, thereby allowing them to start the seven years’ exclusion again. As for his insults, he can say whatever he likes. In answer to the point made by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds about pupillage, practice starts when a pupil is allowed to accept briefs, which is accepted by the profession. The Government have been reasonable in saying, “This is the principle that we wish to achieve; we shall do so in collaboration with the professions.” I ask the Committee to reject the amendment; the fact that the right hon. Gentleman may not want to press it speaks volumes about hypocrisy.<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It would be unkind to force the Financial Secretary to consider the arguments any further. She persistently shows an inability to understand the points that she tries to make.<P>
This is not a wrecking amendment in any sense; it uses the same principles that she used to defend the clause. It reapplies those principles to a separate category of people who are returning to work and facing exactly the same penalties. It does not benefit only women wishing to return to the workplace, but it certainly includes them. I would have expected a glimmer of sympathy from—of all parties—the Labour party, which professes to defend such people.<P>
<B>Mr. Alexander:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has bandied words such as “hypocrisy” and “unimpressed” in relation to the Government’s argument. If he is serious about increasing access to the Bar in Scotland and England, he must recognise that it is incumbent on the Bar to review the method of funding available to devils and pupils, which obliges devils and pupils to incur significant debts before starting out in practice. It is on that basis that the Government have listened and acted.<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Oh, I see. The Labour party’s answer now is to say, “Don’t expect any help from the Government for women; it is the fault of the profession.” I suppose that passing the buck is now something of a habit for the Government, who will persist with a tax regime that is most unhelpful for those trying to return to work. I know that we will hear much more of that point of view from the Labour party, but when it was in opposition it used to say that the Government should play their part, and we heard a lot about partnerships. The hon. Member for Paisley, South will remember talk about partnership between the private sector and the public sector but, judging by his intervention, that partnership is one-sided. He said that the Government must not give any help and that the private sector should. He made a telling intervention.<P>
We shall not press the amendment to a Division simply so that we can make progress. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
Clauses 43 and 44 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<H4><center>Schedule 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Adjustment on change of accounting basis</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, that this schedule be the Sixth schedule to the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have one question about the schedule. Paragraph 3 contains what I take to be an example of sloppy drafting, which raises problems about the schedule’s meaning. Under the subtitle “Third step”, the paragraph states.<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“In the case of a profession or vocation adopting a new accounting basis”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
It should say: In the case of a person conducting a profession or vocation,” and so on.<P>
One of the practitioners' bodies asked me whether the paragraph as it is drafted refers to an individual person conducting a profession or vocation, or whether it implies that there is a mechanism by which a whole profession or vocation—the legal profession, for example—might adopt an accounting basis to comply with clause 42. Is this an example of sloppy drafting, and will it be corrected on report or when the Bill is reprinted?<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not think that the schedule contains sloppy drafting. I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and I shall check on the situation and ensure that his specific point is answered. As Opposition Members have urged previously, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and to other Committee members.<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I have a technical point for the Financial Secretary. Paragraph 4(1) of the schedule refers to a “profession or vocation” but it does not mention trade. Is that a deliberate act of policy? If so, it is radically inconsistent with clause 42. If not, is this another example of sloppy drafting?<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, Mr. Gale, that is not an example of sloppy drafting. The hon. Gentleman makes a specific point, and I shall respond to it in the letter that contains my response to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. As I understand the situation, the catching-up charge applies only to the professions, but I must check.<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The title of clause 42 appears to be at variance with paragraph 4 of the schedule. The clause is entitled:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Computation of profits of trade, profession or vocation.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds pointed out, paragraph 4 of the schedule  refers merely to “profession or vocation”. One wonders why the two are at variance and whether there is indeed a drafting error.<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have answered that point.There is not a contradiction. The point that was made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge deserves an answer. Opposition Members can continueto pick at the Bill’s wording, but I cannot help them further.<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Financial Secretary is on her feet.<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> There appear to be differences in the Government’s policy. The hon. Lady seems to be saying that spread relief is not available for trade. I would be happy with an assurance that we will receive an answer in writing.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Financial Secretary has indicated that she intends to write the hon. Gentleman.<P>
Question put and agreed to.<P>
Schedule 6 agreed to.<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I wonder if you would assist the Committee on the matter of Government amendments. Government amendments appeared last night and were circulated to Committee members, for which we are grateful to the Financial Secretary. However, the amendment paper contains two Government amendments to schedule 9 that are neither starred nor selected by you. Does that indicate that those amendments have been as sloppily drafted as the Bill?<P>
<B>The Chariman:</B> It may be that the Chair owes the committee an apology. The selection of amendments was prepared at an earlier hour than the depositing of Government amendments Nos. 166 and 167, to which I believe the hon. Gentleman is referring. There is an amendment to this morning’s amendment paper, which indicates that those amendments have now been selected. They will appear on the future selection list. However, we are unlikely to consider those amendments this morning, and for the moment the matter is therefore academic.<P>
Clauses 45 and 46 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<P>
Schedule 7 agreed to.<H4><center>Clause 47</center></H4>
<H4><center>Gifts in kind for relief in poor countries</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 126 in page 26, line 26, after ‘educational’, insert ‘or medical’.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 131, in clause 48, page 28, line 7, after ‘education’, insert ‘or health care’.<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The purpose of the amendment is to extend slightly the scope of what appears to be a good Government proposal that will allow companies to make donations from their stock-in-trade for the benefit of third world countries. In principle, we welcome that proposal. However, I cannot understand why the Government have limited such donations to products for use in an educational establishment.<P>
By way of contrast, clause 48, which refers to the relief of poverty and the advancement of education, is more widely drafted. To avoid doubt, our amendment to that clause would insert the words “or health care” after the words “the advancement of education” in subsection 2 paragraph (b). However, I accept that the use of the words “the relief of poverty” in paragraph (a) might allow for the inclusion of health care products or support. The terminology used in clause 47 is by comparison extremely explicit. The clause requires<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“that the gift is made for the purpose of enabling the article used to be used by an educational establishment”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Some years ago I was involved in the medical equipment industry. That industry made, and continues to make, extremely generous donations of stock and equipment to help elleviate crises throughout the world. When the situation in Romania was first brought to the attention of the United Kingdom, many companies with which I dealt made substantial donations of medical equipment and supplies. Many also met the cost of transporting those materials to Romania. I remember very well, because I was directly involved, that when the Bhopal disaster occurred in India some 15 or 16 years ago, many companies with which I was dealing cancelled and diverted orders for equipment because that equipment was urgently needed in India to deal with the aftermath of the crisis. The industry responded generously.<P>
I cannot understand why the medical equipment and supplies industry has been excluded from the provisions of the clause. The work that is being done in many third world countries by many charities to improve the quality of health care delivery and the generous donations made in support of that work by many companies in the health care and medical equipment and supplies industries are not recognised in the clause. That is a slap in the face for an industry that has been generous with its equipment and stock in trade in the past. I urge the Economic Secretary to accept the amendment and extend the scope of the clause to include medical equipment and items destined for the improvement of health care in designated countries as well as for educational purposes.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We have a number of more general points to make, especially about the clause should you be kind enough to allow a stand part debate, Mr. Gale, but I want to make a couple of points in support of the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. It is a very good amendment and the Economic Secretary, whom I welcome to our proceedings, may be able to accept it.<P>
We welcome the spirit and letter of clauses 47 and 48. They are a valuable addition to the work that the previous Government started, but there are some difficulties. First, there is no proper definition of “educational establishment”, unless the Economic Secretary can help by telling us that the words are defined elsewhere in tax law. Secondly, some forms of aid and some educational establishments may fall into both categories—educational and medical. For example, a medical teaching facility could be classified as a purely educational establishment but with a strong medical element.<P>
My hon. Friend has drawn attention to the discrepancy between clauses 47 and 48. The Chancellor’s view is clear. He stated in his press release in December 1997 that he would consult on<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“how a reduction in the gift aid limit for giving to education and anti-poverty projects in poor countries might work”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
It is curious to restrict the aid to educational establishments pure and simple in clause 47 when clause 48 has a more general application. There may be a simple explanation, or perhaps the Economic Secretary will consider whether the definition could be drawn more widely. We look forward to hearing from her.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman referred to a stand part debate. The Chair believes that the material substance of any clause should be thoroughly debated. This Chairman takes the relaxed view that it is acceptable if hon. Members wish to have a wide-ranging debate on amendments because that facilitates the rest of the debate, but we cannot then have a stand part debate. It is for hon. Members to choose whether to exercise all their thoughts at the beginning of a debate or at the end, but they cannot do both.<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I shall bear your comments in mind, Mr. Gale.<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who joined me in tabling the amendment, I am involved in a joinery business that has twice sent one of its delivery lorries to Romania to provide humanitarian aid and has given its second-hand plant for the purposes of education in the third world. I should be grateful for clarification from the Economic Secretary that education includes training. On that basis, I must declare an interest in the clause. The amendment would expand the meaning to include the medical sector. Those on the Government Benches should have no difficulty in appreciating the thinking behind that.<P>
My second and more contentious point is that the provisions in the clauses, which we welcome, should have some limitation. We believe that they should include a reference to human rights. There is a concern that money which is coming from people in this country who are enjoying the benefit of tax relief, may inadvertently end up in the wrong hands in countries where human rights are not respected. I do not mean to impugn anyone who might be intending to make such a gift, but some groups in this country might be able to take advantage of the provisions and intentionally aid and abet a particular faction in a country whose objectives we do not share.<P>
We will deal with that issue more thoroughly when we discuss the next group of amendments. I rest my case on this amendment which is eminently sensible.<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> I thank Opposition Members for recognising that the Government have made a good proposal. It was borne out of a meeting that the Chancellor had on 17 December to discuss his Mauritius mandate. Over the past three months, Members of Parliament have received representations, and often money, from many of our constituents who reflect the desire of the people of this country to give aid to those who are less fortunate than ourselves. We recognise that there is a commonality of interest. Anyone who has seen the horrifying pictures of Sudan on television over the past couple of weeks cannot have failed to be deeply moved by the poverty and distress suffered by people there.<P>
I accept that Opposition Members have tabled the amendments in good faith. Perhaps I can clarify some points and put their minds at rest. To avoid creating a fankle between the subjects covered by clauses 47 and 48, I shall deal first with the important and valid point on gifts in kind from the medical sector. The Chancellor’s meeting on 17 December with the aid agencies dealt with new tax reliefs and the structure of assistance in a general way. During that discussion, no one asked about gifts in kind that are related to medical research. I am happy to reconsider the definition to ensure that it covers gifts in kind in relation to medical research and medical equipment.<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about definitions of educational establishments. We have deliberately left that definition very broad because it allows an interpretation that takes into account different kinds of educational establishments. It also covers training, which is critically important. <P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for the positive and constructive way in which she responded to the amendment. She explained the position with medical research, but will she extend the provisions to include gifts of medical equipment and of medical supplies or drugs, which are used not in research but for relief? The people in Sudan, for example, need not medical research but medical supplies.<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We will consider any assistance that might bring relief to those countries. We shall do so in relation to the clause, but it is also part of the Government’s overall policy to give as much assistance as possible.<P>
It is difficult to list all the different kinds of educational establishments in the listed countries. That is another reason to keep the definition as broad as possible.<P>
Relief of poverty involves a very wide remit because many different measure can be made for the relief of poverty in the short term and in the long term. I believe that all Members of Parliament believe that we should relieve poverty overall and remove the pre-conditions that allow poverty to become endemic in a country, which brings many conflicts.<P>
We are, in effect, discussing clauses 47 and 48 together. Overall, the Committee should deal with the associated practicalities, which is our aim in the clauses. The hon. Member for Guildford made an important point about human rights. The list that we use in defining the countries is internationally respected—it is based on the World bank’s definition of areas of specific need. There are concerns about human rights in Rwanda and Sudan, for example, but it is the poor in all such countries who are subjected to appaling human rights abuses, and we want to target aid on the poor of those countries.<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I apologise for leading the Economic Secretary astray. We should have this debate in relation to amendments Nos. 127 and 130, and it was my mistake to have raised it earlier.<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying that. We shall return to this important matter.<P>
In essence, I hope that I have given the Committee members the reassurances that they want. We deliberately wanted aid to be short term because we wanted to give the generous people of this country an opportunity to focus their giving in response to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Committee members know that a widespread review of charities taxation is under way, but the Bill’s proposals do not flag up what it might contain. The clause gives the British people an opportunity to give full rein to their generosity, and we shall assist them in that. I hope that I have allayed some of the fears of the Committee members, and I welcome the positive spirit in which we have had this debate.<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Economic Secretary has been more than helpful and reassuring—she gave very good answers, and I advise my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge not to press his amendment to a vote.<P>
The Economic Secretary made it clear that it was never the Government’s intention to construct a watertight definition of educational establishments, about which people could argue. She also significantly reassured us by saying that she is prepared to reconsider the wording. Perhaps adding the words “or humanitarian” would help. We greatly welcome what she said this morning, and I advise my hon. Friend not to press the matter further.<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): This is an important amendment, and I welcome the Economic Secretary’s comments. But I would like to emphasise the importance of extending the Bill’s provision for medical assistance, which has a role that goes beyond that of education. I argue this not because I have any special interest in this field—although I do have a number of commitments to British domestic charities—but because I have recently been very impressed by the work of Médecins sans Frontières. I have had conversations with representatives of that organisation, and they are anxious that the Government should recognise the importance of medicine within the context of this Bill, not least because it is crucial to highlight the importance of medical work in the reduction and alleviation of poverty.<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has said, the definition of education is somewhat loose in this Bill. There are advantages in that, as the Economic Secretary has said, but it is important to recognise the role that education can play in medicine. I shall give some examples to illustrate that.<P>
Médecins sans Frontières was set up in 1971 to provide medical and health-related assistance to victims of war and disasters. Its work is curative on the one hand and preventive on the other. Education plays an extremely strong part in the organisation’s preventive work, alongside providing for mass immunisation, treatment, effective surveillance systems and various treatment protocols. Médecins sans Frontières trains people and plays an important educational role by development people’s skills. I would like to touch briefly on the impact of some of the biggest killer diseases in these countries, and on the relevance of the amendment to those situations.<P>
If one considers the AIDS epidemic in Africa, which is now also prevalent in other countries such as the former Soviet Union, the interconnection between AIDS and tuberculosis has become established. Tuberculosis is now the biggest killer in the world, and is firmly linked to AIDS and HIV as an associated illness. Médecins sans Frontières provides educational and medical training for people in that regard; curative programmes work alongside preventive programmes.<P>
AIDS is a dreadful illness throughout the world, and MSF does extensive work to tackle it in Africa. It is involved in training people and—this is one of the most important things—in getting patients out of hospitals and back into home environments. That is crucial in Africa, where every single hospital bed is important.<P>
Sudan has been mentioned this morning, and I would like to praise the way in which MSF has dealt with a devastating epidemic there called Kala Azar. The epidemic, which is spread by a sand fly, kills 90 per cent. of those who get it. The death toll in south Sudan has been more than 100,000 since the mid-1980s. MSF has run a programme in Sudan on its own, as a result of which the illness has been contained, controlled and now reduced.<P>
I shall not detain the Committee any longer on this matter. This is an important amendment—as the Economic Secretary said, this is an extremely important area and the Government are continuing to build on the work of the previous Conservative Government. If I do not press the amendment, I hope that the Government will be fully conscious of the points made by Opposition Members and the reasons why it might be appropriate to develop the definition of education further in this clause.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her remarks in response to the amendment and take on board her commitment to review the matter. I fully accept that the Government are not trying to exclude medical gifts, but the issue needs further consideration. However, I urge the hon. Lady not to rely on the suggestion that there will be a loose and liberal interpretation of the phrasing in the Bill. Companies that make donations of stock-in-trade or capital equipment will need to know with certainty, when they make such donations, that they will enjoy the benefits of clause 47. It will not be possible for them simply to rely on the assurance that there will be a rather liberal interpretation of the words “educational establishment” and to hope that the gift of a piece of medical equipment will be included in that.<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will bear that in mind and come back on Report with a rewording of the clause to make it clear that gifts of medical equipment are included. Given her positive response to the spirit of our amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford and I will ask for leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I want to clarify the situation for the record, so that there is no doubt about the Government’s position. I want to make it clear that, in view of the fact that the initial concept of the new tax reliefs grew out of the Chancellor’s meeting on 17 December, when no mention was made of gifts for medical research, we will now reconsider the position to ensure that medical research can be included. The hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) mentioned Médecins sans Frontières. All hon. Members are very impressed by the work carried out by that organisation. Its work has been brought into our living rooms nightly in the appalling situations that have happened in poor countries. To repeat what I said earlier, health care work will be covered by the relief of poverty definition, as Opposition Front-Bench Members have recognised. We are deliberately seeking an opportunity to introduce flexibility, so that there can be a rapid response, and recognition of requirements in those countries and of the generosity of those companies and individuals who are prepared to make resources available.<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for that clarification, but, once again, she referred to gifts for medical research. I urge her to consider the position regarding medical equipment, drugs and medical supplies that are given not for research but for the direct relief of suffering.<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> For the purposes of clarity, I acknowledge that that is my intention.<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 27, line 28, after ‘Treasury’, insert <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘and is certified by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs as being a country or territory in which significant human rights abuses are not evident to him’. <P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 130 in clause 48, page 29, line 21, after ‘Treasury’, insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘and is certified by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs as being a country or territory in which significant human rights abuses are not evident to him’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I started down this path earlier, so I hope that that will not jeopardise the stand part debate to which I know that my right hon. and hon. Friends are looking forward.<P>
We all welcome these clauses and the benefits that they may bring, but there is concern about the unintended consequences of some of the gifts that may be prompted by the proposals. Like many hon. Members, I receive letters from the Jubilee 2000 campaign. I am told that extra staff have been taken on at the Treasury to cope with the number of £1 coins that have been received from those pressing for the relief of debt in the third world. That campaign has been effective in putting the issue into the minds of the Treasury—I see some rueful smiles on faces in the Committee Room.<P>
We should be cautious about how such debt relief may proceed. I presume that this wide definition of relief of poverty includes debt relief and gifts to any campaign to relieve debt in the third world. The argument, which in general is a good one, is that it would allow those countries to start enriching themselves again. But we must be mindful that in promoting such debt relief schemes we do not inadvertently let off the hook regimes of which none of us would approve and thus make it easier for them to perpetuate abuse of human rights in their countries.<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Economic Secretary referred to the Board of Inland Revenues list of eligible countries in the notes on clauses. One has only to look at that list to see that, although it includes many worthwhile and needy cases, some give rise to serious worries about how money would be applied.<P>
The hon. Lady referred to Rwanda. Only yesterday I was talking to some colleagues who said that there was concern that people who support one faction or the other in Rwanda might be able to take advantage of the clause to gain tax relief on payments that are aimed at oppressing another tribe in that country. I do not profess to have a detailed knowledge of Rwanda, but it would be helpful if the Government reserved the power to exclude a country if they believed that human rights abuse was taking place.<P>
Another example is that of Sri Lanka. There is concern that Tamils who want to support their faction in Sri Lanka might use the clause to obtain a tax advantage in funnelling money to one group that seeks to oppress another group.<P>
There are many good intentions behind the clause and we applaud those good intentions. It is not the intention of the amendment to get in the way of humanitarian aid, not to put a stop to aid where it is needed because the human rights situation is less than perfect. I hope that the amendment had been well enough drafted to provide discretion for the Foreign Secretary to amend the list of eligible countries. That reserve power could prevent the channelling of money in directions in which none of us want it to go.<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I reiterate the words of my hon. Friend that we do not wish to impede the good work done through charitable giving to various countries by aid agencies. My problem is the arbitrariness of the list in the notes on clauses. I appreciate the comment of the Economy Secretary that it is based on the World bank’s approved list, but its criteria are based on finance and poverty and bear no relation to the political and democratic situation in those countries.<P>
With reference to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford, it is possible that we could tacitly support the abuse of human rights in some of those countries. The list includes countries such as Myanmar where, as is well documented, the Leader of the Opposition has been under house arrest for many years. It also includes Kenya where there were dire electoral irregularities. The violence against the Kenyan Government’s political opponents was such that the previous Government in this country and the then Minister for Overseas Development withdrew official aid until Kenya got its act together, which it has not yet done. Many countries on that list are catalogued by Amnesty International as tolerating dire abuses of human rights, dreadful examples of torture, arbitrary imprisonment, mass executions and dubious state education practices verging on indoctrination. China is a specific example of a country that highlights the problem of the list. I speak as a long-standing member of various Tibetan support groups in this country.<P>
Until last year, the EU supported annual calls for the Chinese Government to get their act together on human rights abuses. For reasons not a million miles away from trade and business interests, France, followed by Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain, decided not to renew their annual support for the United Nations resolution against China. EU Foreign Ministers do not now back any resolution condemning China’s human rights abuses at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Although that is disgraceful, it was the steadfastness of the UK Government over many years in pursuing the annual litany of abuses in China that kept the problem on the world map.<P>
China, through its best devices, managed every year to get the resolutions kicked out of touch at the UN, but each year the number of countries supporting the resolutions against human rights abuses in China grew. Respect for human rights is at the heart of the EU principles and EU agreements with third countries must incorporate clauses defining human rights. The launch of the first human rights annual report on 21 April by the Foreign Secretary curiously hailed the resumption of dialogue with China as one of the most significant achievements of the past year. But the EU, of which we hold the presidency, is undermining the UN Human Rights Commission and its work to put pressure on China. <P>
As for the educational aspect of the list, Chinese legislation, which the Chinese Government would have us believe has improved, still allowed 200,000 people or more to be detained in China in 1997 without charge or trial. Those people have been subjected to re-education through labour. Since the invasion of Tibet by the Peoples Liberation Army in 1950, more than 1.2 million Tibetans have been killed, despite China’s attempts to ratify various conventions on torture and racial discrimination.  Those attempts have been exposed as nothing but a sham. Worse still, Chinese migration into Tibet has brought about a form of ethnic cleansing in which 5.5 million Chinese have swamped the fewer than 4.5 million Tibetans who live in the Tibetan autonomous region.<P>
It is of particular concern that Chinese has replaced Tibetan as the official language in Tibet. Tibetans are being systematically re-educated on their cultural past. Restrictions have been placed on monks and nuns. The position of the Dalai Lama has been and is being undermined. The child recently recognised as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama has been abducted. He and his family have disappeared, and the Chinese Government have installed their own candidate.<P>
There are also terrible examples of human rights abuses. The Tibetan nun, Ngawang Sangdrol, was first imprisoned at the age of 13 simply for demonstrating with other nuns. She was placed in—<P>

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman’s efforts to stay within the bounds of order are ingenious. However, I must ask him to relate his remarks directly to the amendment, and not to dwell too long on the specifics of human rights in one country.<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gale. I shall conclude my remarks shortly, but I want first to mention a case that reinforces my argument.<P>
We support the principle of preferential charitable giving. However, in giving gifts to an arbitrary list of countries—including those such as China, which flagrantly abuse human rights—the Government are undermining their policy. We risk doing the Chinese Government’s dirty work. We have no guarantee that gifts even to support educational projects, even through agencies, will be used independently. Given the re-education farrago that we have witnessed there, it is likely that the Government rulings in China on the teaching of language and culture will have to be adhered to.<P>
The same can no doubt be said of many other countries. We have witnessed ethnic cleansing and associated cultural problems in Rwanda, for example. In effect the clause will subsidise the state indoctrination of certain peoples.<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman taking full account of the clause’s purpose, which is to give aid to charities, not to Governments of countries in which Charities work? The amendment would rule out much of the good work done by non-governmental organisations and charities such as Oxfam in countries with Governments who have dubious human rights records.<P>
Oxfam works to improve public health in Rwanda by training health volunteers and providing access to clean water. If the amendment were accepted, Oxfam would be unable to continue to fund its Kibungo development programme in Rwanda because the amendment would exclude such countries.<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I hear what the hon. Lady says. However, as has been noted, the amendment allows for a degree of discretion. I cited the example of China because aid agencies and charitable agencies that work there are susceptible to becoming involved in educational projects prescribed by undemocratic Governments who abuse human rights.<P>
The hon. Lady’s comments are applicable to many of the countries in the World bank’s list, but to many others they are not. The list is arbitrary, and has regard only to financial considerations and the World bank’s definition of poverty-stricken countries. It makes a mockery of the Government’s supposedly ethical foreign policy, which has been abused on many occasions during the past 12 months. More important, the list sends the wrong signals to those countries in receipt of aid that have made great strides towards democratic good practice, and which are fully open to the best endeavours of overseas aid agencies and charities. For that reason, I fully support the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall be brief as my hon. Friends have made most of the points that need to be made.<P>
The thinking behind the amendment is that the clause gives no guidance on the criteria that the Treasury will use to make such an order. As has been noted, the list included in the Bill’s explanatory notes was compiled by the World bank. Although I accept much of what the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford has said, it is clear that the poverty and suffering of individual populations is not the sole criteria on which the list was compiled. For example, Iraq and Iran are both absent from the list, which perhaps comes as no surprise.<P>
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) has raised on the Floor of the House many times the moral dilemma that any Government faces when dealing with regimes such as that in Iraq. When imposing sanctions to indicate moral disapprobation, it is inevitable that people who are already suffering are doubly disbenefited. They suffer the effects of an oppressive regime and the inability of well meaning western Governments to deliver aid to relieve them because of the need to maintain pressure on a regime that inflicts gross abuses on human rights.<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have sought to introduce a test that is moderately objective and brings Government policy, as expressed in clauses 47 and 48, into line with their stated foreign policy that there must be an ethical dimension in the United Kingdom’s stance. We want the Foreign Secretary to be consulted before the list is drawn up to ensure that the Government do not send conflicting signals. Some abusive regimes might be denounced as abusers of human rights under the ethical foreign policy while the Treasury is sending them another signal that they are on the approved list.<P>
We accept the counter argument that people at the bottom of the pile suffer if a country is not on the list, but we cannot accept that there is no inconsistency in putting that argument forward and then presenting a list that excludes countries where suffering is clearly being endured by the population but where it is politically incorrect or unfashionable to support them.<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I did not intend to speak on the amendment, but I have done much work with charities in my role as vice-chairman of the Charities Property Association and a former chairman of the all-party group on population development and reproductive health. I have taken the trouble to go to some of the poorer areas of the world to see the misery in which people under some of the regimes that have been mentioned must live. I totally support the principle of my hon. Friend’s aim. The issue of substitution, whereby if companies donate money to charities, oppressive regimes may be able to divert the money into arms is ever-present and it is an issue with which the Department for International Development wrestles day in, day out.<P>
I urge the Committee to act with caution against abandoning all charitable work in some of those countries and will illustrate my reasons with some examples. The issue of human rights in China has been mentioned many times during our debate. I have never been to China but I have been close by. In my capacity as chairman of the all-party population group, I am aware of the work of Marie Stopes International and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities—UNFPA. Their work relates to the coercive abortion and oppressive family planning regime in China. It has often been argued that those charitable bodies should not be involved in China. Fortunately, the British Government have rejected that view because those organisations are beginning to have an effect in persuading the Chinese Government that their policy is totally repugnant and unacceptable. If those charities were not working in China, there would have been no change in the Chinese Government’s attitude.<P>
The charities working in countries with oppressive regimes are often the only quasi democratic organisations in those countries. Without the work of charities and the intelligence that they feed back, we would have no idea of what is going on. Rwanda was a typical example. It was the charities that first pointed out the huge migration of refugees because of hunger, starvation and other problems.<P>
I shall give the Committee a second example. I went to Myanmar-Thailand border to visit a family planning clinic where I met a lady who that morning had walked 30 km in bare feet with a child on her back. When I asked her, through the interpreter, why she did that, she said, “Because I am so poor I cannot afford to have any more children. My husband would kill me if he knew I was here. That is the position, and I have to do what I can.”<P>
The committee should be most cautious about trying to restrict the work of charities in some of those countries. Of course we do not want money to be diverted and spent on arms or used to support oppressive political practices. Much valuable work has been done and is continuing to be done.<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> Does that mean that the hon. Gentleman agrees with me that the amendment would mistakenly cut aid and help to charities, which are doing important work in, for example, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, and China?<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I understand what the hon. Lady says. I urge the Government to be cautious about restricting charities' work and the operation of gift aid. The situation can be carefully controlled—DFID does so day in and day out. When money is diverted in a way that it should not be, the Government should take action because human rights abuses may be involved.<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the amendment would not cut off charitable aid to those countries, as the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford suggested it would? It would merely stop those countries from receiving the seal of approval that millennium gift aid would otherwise give them.<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. No one wants charitable money to go to a country where it is diverted, either directly or indirectly, and spent on arms or used to support oppressive political regimes. I do not believe that any Labour or Opposition Member wants that to happen. I sympathise with the political principle that lies behind the amendment, but I want the Government to act when charitable aid is abused and diverted in the way that I described.<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall be specific about the amendments effects. It would impose a further requirement on countries that will benefit from the clauses. I understand and share the views that were expressed about the human rights records of some of these countries. However, the Government—and, I believe, most people—want aid to go directly and quickly to the inhabitants of those countries, especially to the children, and we do not want to do anything that might delay the help they so desperately need.<P>
In essence, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford said that the proposal is a relief to encourage charity; it is not in any way intended to endorse regimes. We want to use charities that have expertise in those countries to maximise benefit and to prevent abuse.<P>
I seldom agree with the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), but on this occasion I do. We can use the experience of charities in those countries to direct aid to those who need quick and effective assistance. He also made an important point about DFID. We consulted DFID when these clauses were being drafted because it is in the front line in the provision of such aid. Adding another subjective judgment to the process of determining what constitutes a significant human rights abuse would lead to disputes. That would lead to a delay in the process of getting aid to the people who really want it and whose life depends on our not wasting time in debates and on our getting help to them quickly.<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I listened carefully to the Economic Secretary. Does she agree that it is subjective to exclude Iraq from the list. We all understand why it has been excluded, but—following the logic of her argument—what is the moral basis for doing so?<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I make the point that I made earlier. The list has been constructed by the World bank as a result of international agreement. Frankly, we wanted to choose the simplest, most transparent way of getting aid quickly to those who most require it. The purpose of the amendment is to allow people to donate money to the causes that they want to support, so that they can be specific about answering their consciences by helping people who most require assistance.<P>
The charities operating in those countries have been consulted, and they have given the greatest advice on how best to proceed. We believe that their advice should be listened to. By choosing a universally acknowledged list, we are trying to foreshorten the system and deliver aid quickly. I am sure that Opposition Members do not want there to be  delays, but I ask them to recognise that the purpose of the clause is to ensure that effective, focused aid is rapidly provided by existing charities with expertise. It is not aid that in any way supports specific regimes. The clause is focused and I regret that the amendments lead to subjective judgments that—for the best possible purposes that I do not dispute—could delay the effect of the clauses.<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have listened with care to the Economic Secretary, but the fact is that there are countries on the list that are partly mired in debt because rulers in those countries have money in offshore bank accounts, money that was intended to help those countries and which has been siphoned off. We should ask ourselves whether we should be helping the rulers of such countries to perpetuate their regimes at the expense of the people whom we are intending to help. There is growing concern that some non-governmental organisations involved in the field are not on the same wavelength as the rest of us. Members of the Committee may be aware of the revealing book “The Lords of Poverty” by Graham Hancock. Many people involved in what has become the aid industry do not have the pure, humanitarian aims that are shared by members of the Committee.<P>
The Government have promised—although they are having difficulty delivering on their promise—an ethical foreign policy. In this context, we need an ethical taxation policy and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has said, if it is recognised that we are to deny aid to the needy people of Iraq in order not to give succour to the tyrant of Baghdad, we should also apply that principle elsewhere. We have lived through the most brutal century in the history of mankind, a century that has seen people butchered to death and more human rights abused than at any other time in recorded history. It is entirely appropriate that, at the dawn of a new century and at the dawn of a new millennium, millennium aid should recognise that we want the new century to be one in which democracy, freedom and respect for human life are paramount. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that a millennium aid programme, aided and abetted by these clauses, should have an ethical basis. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I owe the Committee an apology. When I spoke briefly to the first amendment, I should have declared an interest. I am an unremunerated director of a charity, International Care and Relief, which will specifically benefit from and welcomes the clause. You have allowed discussion of two specific aspects of the clause, Mr. Gale—the definition of “educational establishment” and the extent to which it should apply to human rights. However, I wish to raise several general points with the Economic Secretary. I fully welcome the clause and initiative, and applaud the spirit in which the hon. Lady picked up our earlier point—<P>
