warm welcome to you, Mrs. Dean? I am sure that our deliberations will
not be too controversial, as the Bill has general support. I also
welcome all members of the Committee. As I explained on Second Reading,
the purpose of the Bill is to provide powers that will enable the
National Assembly for Wales to establish an independent champion for
older people. The post will be the first of its kind in the
UK&#151;possibly in the world&#151;and follows in the footsteps of
the post of Children&#146;s Commissioner, which was another
successful first for
Wales.</div><a name="0606298000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea of
having such a commissioner was among the recommendations made by the
advisory group on a strategy for older people in Wales in its report
entitled, &#147;When I&#146;m 64...and More&#148;. The idea
was then translated into the firm commitment to establish a
commissioner which was made in the Welsh local manifesto in the 2003
assembly elections.</div>

enjoy your chairmanship and in wishing you well. We hope that you go
from strength to strength, and we shall try not to give you too much

<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div><a name="0606298000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is right that the
Opposition have no problem with the resolution of the Programming
Sub-Committee. I should like, however, to offer the apologies of my
hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb), who is a
member of the Committee and who cannot attend today. He has been chosen
for a debate on police authority mergers in Westminster Hall, which
coincides with our sitting. I am sure that all of us in the Committee
would have liked the opportunity to speak on that subject and I am sad
that the timing of the Bill&#146;s examination in Committee has
caused a problem for an Opposition Member, and possibly for others. I
wanted to put that on record so that anyone who reads the transcript of
our sitting will be able to note that, no matter how assiduous one is
as a parliamentarian&#151;as is the case with my hon.
Friend&#151;it is impossible to be in two places at
once.</div><a name="0606298000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that,
and bearing in mind your admonition, Mrs. Dean, to keep introductory
remarks on the Bill to stand part debate on clause 1, I have great
pleasure in acceding to the programme motion.</div>

resolution in connection with the Bill, of which copies are available

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
1</h4><a name="0606298000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">The
Commissioner for Older People in
Wales</div><a name="0606298000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i><i class="I"> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</i></div><a name="0606298000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000369"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I move on to a general introduction to the Bill.
Clause 1 is the establishment clause that sets up the office of
Commissioner for Older People in Wales. The post will be established
once the Bill passes through Parliament. I commend the Government on
the amount of work that has already gone into bringing the Bill to this
stage and into establishing the position of
commissioner.</div><a name="0606298000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all
appreciate that the Bill has taken some time to reach consideration in
Committee. It started in another place many months ago and underwent
considerable scrutiny there, and we are grateful to all those who
participated in the debate. The consultation process on the Bill was
particularly interesting. I believe that the Government sent the draft
Bill to some 1,700 organisations, and that there were 98 responses, of
which 94 per cent. were in favour of establishing the Commissioner for
Older People in Wales. There was support for the proposals, although,
as with everything, the devil has been in the detail. If I am correct,
the Bill contains 11 powers, one duty to make subordinate legislation,
and two powers to issue directions&#151;powers which will fall to the
Assembly.</div>
<a name="0606298000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
general questions for the Minister on clause 1. Has any thought been
given to where the offices for the commissioner will be located, and
how 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div>many offices there will be? Will they be only in south Wales&#151;in
Cardiff&#151;or will there be offices in north or west Wales or
elsewhere in the country? Also, as the legislation contains a Welsh
translation of the commissioner&#146;s title, and given the very
nature of the constituents with whom the commissioner will be dealing,
what arrangements will be made for Braille, audio tapes and signing, so
that those skills will be available either through the commissioner
himself, or herself, or through members of staff? It would be helpful
if the Minister could set out the surrounding facts and figures,
particularly on how the office intends to communicate with its
constituents and on where it may be
located.</div><a name="0606298000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000370"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The location of offices will be a matter for the
commissioner. Common practice, as with the public service ombudsman for
Wales, is that the office be based not in Cardiff&#151;in that case
the HQ is in Bridgend. The Children&#146;s Commissioner has regional
offices, however, so it would be possible to have a north Wales and
perhaps a west Wales regional office if the main office were based in
Cardiff.</div>
<a name="0606298000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
raised an interesting point that the commissioner will be dealing with
people who may have disabilities, particularly sight and hearing
problems. All of the reports can be formatted, for example, in
Braille&#151;that can be specified in the regulations&#151;and I am
sure that the current practice of the Assembly would also be taken on
board in the regulations. I hope that that answers the hon.
Lady&#146;s
points.</div><a name="0606298000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
worth explaining why the advisory committee believed that there was a
need for a commissioner in Wales to speak on people&#146;s behalf and
to act as their champion. Twenty two per cent. of people in Wales are
aged 60 or over, compared with only 20 per cent. in England. In 20
years that will increase to 28 per cent. in Wales, compared with 25 per
cent. in England. Over the same period, the number of people in Wales
aged 85 or over will increase by more than a third, to more than
85,000. The establishment of the office of commissioner will be a
significant step forward in ensuring that older people in Wales are
heard and understood, that they are safe from harm and abuse, that they
receive the opportunities and services that they need and deserve, and
that they can play a full part in decisions that affect them. The role,
remit and powers of the commissioner will closely mirror those of the
Children&#146;s Commissioner, an office which is a successful, tried
and tested model. Although the legislation is adapted to take account
of a different situation and of the complex needs of older people, it
has been based on that
model.</div><a name="0606298000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Lady
said, the establishment of the office of Commissioner for Older People
has been widely supported in Wales. The commissioner will have powers
to promote and safeguard the interests of older people in Wales. That
will provide the impetus for increased awareness of the needs of older
people and for raising standards in public services and support. I
commend the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="0606298000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000373"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I want to reassure the Minister that I do not
intend to make any lengthy speeches during examination of the Bill.
Rather, I shall use certain of my amendments to probe for details.
Those remarks apply directly to this group of amendments&#151;I shall
use them as a vehicle, rather than pressing them to a
vote.</div><a name="0606298000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 2
allows the Assembly to make regulations setting out
arrangements</div> <a name="0606298000046"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as to the
appointment of the
Commissioner&#148;</div><a name="0606298000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">and on the

paragraph and from subsequent points that are made in the
schedule.</div><a name="0606298000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The First
Minister will be responsible for appointing the commissioner, and my
first question is why the Minister arrived at that decision. Is there a
role for the Assembly to play a part in the commissioner&#146;s
recruitment and appointment? Indeed, what process will be used to allow
the Assembly itself to participate in the selection process, and who
will be on the appointment panel? Is it envisaged that only members of
the Welsh Assembly Government will be involved in appointment, or will
members of the Opposition parties be able to play a part? How will the
Minister ensure that the selection process is conducted by a balanced
set of individuals? For example, will there be representatives of older
people on the selection panel and will there be representatives on the
panel of those who work with older
people?</div><a name="0606298000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div> <a name="0606298000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was
discussion at several stages during the progress of the Bill on the
commissioner&#146;s term of office of four years, renewable for a
further four years. Why has that term been left to regulations and why
has it not instead been included in the Bill? Hon. Members will correct
me if I am wrong, but I believe that there was a meeting of minds on
the term of office during the consultation process, so it seems to me
that it is an admirable candidate for inclusion in the Bill. Perhaps
the Minister can enlighten us on the thinkingabout
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div><a name="0606298000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to know who can
remove the commissioner from office. Can only the First Minister do
that, and what is the process for removing a commissioner who has not
fulfilled the expected standards? I understand that there are proposals
for removing the commissioner if the commissioner is deemed to have
misbehaved, and I am hoping that the Minister will take the opportunity
to define
&#147;misbehaviour&#148;.</div><a name="0606298000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would next like to probe a little further on the way in which the
commissioner will operate, and to ask how the commissioner will be able
to operate independently. If, as it would appear, the First Minister
appoints and also removes the commissioner, there should be due
process, including an appeal process for the commissioner, whereby the
commissioner can disagree with his dismissal. Will the Minister expand
on that?</div><a name="0606298000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
4 probes the ex gratia payments that are allowed under schedule 1.
Paragraph 3(3) of that schedule
says:</div><a name="0606298000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If a
person ceases to be the commissioner and it appears to the Assembly
that there are special circumstances that make it right that the person
should receive compensation, the Assembly may pay to that person a sum
of such amount as it thinks
appropriate.&#148;</div><a name="0606298000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister enlighten us as to how that sum would be arrived at and
who would decide upon it? Does the provision really mean that the
Assembly would decide, or would it in effect be the First Minister who
would agree the sum? If there is wherewithal within the legislation for
an ex gratia payment of an unspecified amount to be made effectively on
a whim, or in &#147;special circumstances&#148;&#151;I would like
the Minister to define that term&#151;how can the commissioner
operate independently of the Government of the day in the Assembly?
Should there perhaps be a ceiling to the amount, and, if not, will the
Minister explain what would happen in the event of an employment
dispute between the commissioner and the Welsh Assembly
Government?</div><a name="0606298000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 7
of schedule 1 refers to &#147;Payments by the Assembly.&#148; Will
the Minister set out exactly what the paragraph means? The words
&#147;as it thinks appropriate&#148; are, again, very general.
Surely there is a need for safeguards in relation to an open-ended
financial opportunity whereby the commissioner and his office receive
unlimited sums for unspecified
purposes.</div><a name="0606298000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group of
amendments is large, but the questions are fairly straightforward and I
hope that the Minister will be able to
respond.</div><a name="0606298000056"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000374"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The hon. Lady asked me a number of questions based
on the amendments to schedule 1 that she has tabled. The first question
was why it is the First Minister who appoints the Commissioner. As I
indicated in my opening remarks on clause 1, the Bill follows the
Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales Act 2001 and the process
followed by the Assembly for the appointment of a Children&#146;s
Commissioner. The selection method was unique and very inclusive, with
children and not only Government Members of the Assembly but also
Opposition Members involved in the process. The Assembly has given a
commitment that it will be actively involving older people in the
appointment and intends to consult the National 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div>Partnership Forum for Older People about the selection process. I hope
that that responds to the point raised about the
appointment.</div><a name="0606298000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady also asked about the Assembly&#146;s indication in the statement
of policy intentions that it would bring forward regulations for the
term of office to be for four years, renewable once. If so, she asked,
why not put it in the Bill. First, that is a matter for the Assembly, a
devolved matter. Also, bear in mind that, were any changes to that term
of office needed in the future, amendment would require us to respond
with primary legislation. It would be better to leave that to the
Assembly, for their purposes, and to let them bring forward their
regulations once the Bill has been enacted. The period seems
reasonable. That has been accepted generally. The current
Children&#146;s Commissioner, again by regulation, has a term of
office of seven years; a period of around that time seems sensible, as
does plus four
years.</div><a name="0606298000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked about what constitutes good behaviour or misbehaviour. Holding
office during good behaviour and termination of office for misbehaviour
are common concepts in the appointment of public office holders and are
supported by a body of case law. According to the case law,
misbehaviour would mean improper exercise of the functions of the
office, non-attendance or neglect of or refusal to perform the duties
of the office. In certain circumstances, it could include behaviour
more broadly&#151;for example, being found guilty of a serious
offence such as
fraud.</div><a name="0606298000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked about the removal of the commissioner from office, which will
also be dealt with by regulation in the Assembly. I will make regular
reference to the statement of policy intentions, so a copy is on the
Table for the Committee to refer to directly. Paragraph 66 says that
the regulations will specify circumstances for removal, and those
grounds will be tightly
drawn.</div><a name="0606298000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to the
amendments themselves&#151; [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Did the hon. Lady
want to
intervene?</div><a name="0606298000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000375"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I am reading the statement of policy intentions
and my paragraph 66 says something completely different, on estimates.
Perhaps I do not have the latest
version.</div><a name="0606298000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000376"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The version that I have is definitely paragraph
66:</div><a name="0606298000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Regulations will specify the circumstances in which the First Minister
may relieve the Commissioner of
office&#148;.</div><a name="0606298000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the copy
on the Table, so we will use it for reference
purposes.</div><a name="0606298000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
6 would remove the Assembly&#146;s discretion to decide the
commissioner&#146;s term of office by specifying it in the Bill. We
do not agree with that. The discretion reflects the devolution
settlement, and in our view it is entirely proper that the Assembly
should be able to appoint the commissioner and determine his or her
term of office in
regulations.</div><a name="0606298000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 2 and 3 also seek to remove the Assembly&#146;s discretion in a
devolved matter. Amendment No. 3, taken with amendment No. 2, would
oblige the Assembly to make payments to the commissioner of such
amounts at such times and on such conditions as the Secretary of State
thinks 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 9</div>appropriate. But it will be the Assembly&#146;s money; it is their
budget. The Bill will attract no new money from this place. It is
therefore entirely appropriate that the Assembly should determine what
payments should be made, under what circumstances and on what
conditions.</div><a name="0606298000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 7 and 4 concern the commissioner&#146;s operational independence
from the Assembly. Amendment No. 7 seeks to ensure that regulations
made by the Assembly about the circumstances in which the commissioner
may cease to hold office will not compromise the commissioner&#146;s
independence. Amendment No. 4 seeks to remove the Assembly&#146;s
ability to pay compensation to a person who has ceased to be the
commissioner where they feel that special circumstances make it
appropriate to do so.</div>
<a name="0606298000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the
Committee that the provision about the circumstances in which a
commissioner may cease to hold office is standard in commissioner and
ombudsman legislation. The Assembly Government have said in their
statement of policy intentions that they intend to make
regulations&#151;I remind the Committee that those regulations will
be subject to the Assembly&#146;s rigorous subordinate legislation
procedure&#151;to allow the First Minister to remove the commissioner
from office on the grounds of misbehaviour or mental or physical
incapacity, as I explained
earlier.</div><a name="0606298000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000377"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Can the Minister explain exactly what the special
circumstances might include, giving us some
examples?</div><a name="0606298000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000378"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> No, I cannot. Each case would have to be judged on
its merits, and it would be wrong to list circumstances in which the
commissioner could be removed. As I said, it is quite clear what
constitutes misbehaviour, but it is general. There might be a specific
incident concerning the commissioner&#146;s credibility. He might not
have committed an offence or been found guilty of a serious crime, but
he might well find himself in circumstances that challenge his
credibility. Those would be the sort of special circumstances in
question.</div><a name="0606298000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000379"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. May I lay my cards
on the table concerning one of my fears? The commissioner will be paid
a salary by the Assembly and appointed by the First Minister, and a
clause in the enabling legislation will enable any sum to be handed out
to him in special circumstances. If a commissioner filed a critical
report about the Government or any of their operations, it would not be
outwith the realm of possibility for somebody to say, &#147;Tone down
the report and don&#146;t make it too strong, because we have the
power to give you a nice pay-off at the end of your contractual
year.&#148;</div> <a name="0606298000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sure that nothing like that should or would happen, but it is a fear in
the back of my mind when I see in the draft legislation the ability to
make an ex gratia payment in woolly circumstances. Somebody in office
who was perhaps not the most scrupulous person could make a point of
promising a payment, using the legislation as a vehicle to water down
or even suppress criticism. Will the Minister set my mind at rest that
the Bill contains safeguards? At the moment, I cannot see
them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000380"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s point, but she
could also make it about the Children&#146;s Commissioner, because
exactly the same regulations apply. The Welsh people&#146;s
experience of the Children&#146;s Commissioner is that he has not
been afraid to raise difficult and awkward issues or to criticise
organisations, including the Assembly, when necessary. He has been a
forthright and true champion of children in Wales. As I said earlier,
the conditions relating to any special payment are already established
for other public office
holders.</div><a name="0606298000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="0606298000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606298000381"></a><b class="B">David
T.C. Davies</b> (Monmouth) (Con): The Minister is right in his
comments about the Children&#146;s Commissioner. The point is that
that is because he is the sort of individual who is not cowed by
Government or by any sort of threat. The point being made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) is that the
guidelines do not categorically ensure that pressure could not be
exerted on an individual to obtain compliance with Government
wishes.</div><a name="0606298000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000382"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> As I said earlier, all public office holders have
that arrangement, and I have yet to hear of any of them being
criticised because they have not taken on the challenge of a difficult
issue concerning the Government or whoever is paying them. All that I
can say to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham is that although,
theoretically, that could happen to anyone, the facts are that so far
it has not, to my knowledge. I am sure that she would quote me an
example if she had one.</div>
<a name="0606298000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the hon. Lady&#146;s point, but I want to reassure her and the
Committee that in relation to the special payments, for example,
paragraph 3(3) of schedule 1 provides that the Assembly may pay
compensation to a person who ceases to be the commissioner only if it
considers that there are special circumstances making that appropriate.
Such circumstances might be the termination of the term of office
because of ill health, or a decision by the Assembly to abolish the
office or amalgamate it with another, which happened in the case of
ombudsmen in Wales.</div>
<a name="0606298000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">There would be direct
accountability to the National Assembly, which would scrutinise the
decision and the sum paid. That would go before the Audit Committee,
for example, if there were any question about its validity. I hope that
those comments will enable the hon. Lady to accept that there is no
real problem, bearing in mind all the various checks and balances that
would be set up to ensure thorough scrutiny of any such
payment.</div> <a name="0606298000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
I have covered all the issues relevant to the amendments and the points
raised by the hon. Lady, and I ask her to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000383"></a>Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000384"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in schedule 1, page
18, line 33, leave out &#145;must' and insert
&#145;may'.</div><a name="0606298000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000385"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to
discuss amendment No. 16, in schedule 1, page 19,
line 8, leave out from &#145;appoint' to end of line 9 and
insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;up to 30 other staff to

Commissioner may appoint staff in excess of the limit in sub-paragraph
(5) only with the approval of the
Assembly.'.</div><a name="0606298000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000386"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> The amendments are, again, vehicles for probing
the Minister&#146;s intentions. Paragraph 4 of the schedule
states:</div><a name="0606298000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commissioner must appoint a deputy
Commissioner.&#148;</div><a name="0606298000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
ask why there must be a deputy at all, and why there is an imperative
to appoint one. The role that the commissioner will take on is one that
might, ordinarily, have been expected to be taken by Ministers. When I
was a junior Minister in the Department for Education and Employment I
was the Minister for older workers, and responsibility for getting
employers and recruitment companies to consider older candidates
favourably rested with me, as the Minister. To all intents and
purposes, the commissioner&#146;s role could have been played by a
Minister.</div> <a name="0606298000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
appointment of a deputy commissioner will ensure that there is another
person to take responsibility if the commissioner is not available to
do so, but why is that an imperative and why should there be only one
deputy? In this age of equality, when we try to ensure that both sexes
are fairly represented, it would have been more equitable had the
commissioner had the discretion not only to appoint a deputy, but
perhaps to appoint one or two, including one man and one
woman.</div> <a name="0606298000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
suggests that we want to micro-manage what the commissioner does in his
or her office. Whenever we try to introduce more detail into
legislation, there is always the fall-back position that we will leave
it to regulation or to the Assembly. If we can use the principle of
devolving power to the Assembly in other cases, we should surely
devolve power to the commissioner in this case to allow him or her to
make up their own mind as to how the office is constituted.</div>
<a name="0606298000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
16 suggests that the Bill limit to 30 the number of staff who can be
appointed to the commissioner&#146;s office. Indeed, in most of the
documentation on the Bill, up to 30 staff are expected to work in the
commissioner&#146;s office, and again I assume that that is based
partially on the experience of the Children&#146;s Commissioner.
However, the geographical spread and communication problems that we
shall be looking at, although present when one deals with a younger,
junior audience, are often aggravated when one deals with senior
citizens, as was mentioned earlier during scrutiny of the
Bill.</div> <a name="0606298000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a worry
that the costs could grow like Topsy. The financial provisions for the
Bill envisage the set-up costs to be approximately &#163;500,000 and
the annual running cost to be &#163;1.5 million. If we are looking at
a payroll of 30-plus and a multiplicity of offices, it is easy to see
how the budget could start to come under pressure. If we decide that 30
is the optimum size to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div>carry out the commissioner&#146;s function, based on the experience of
the Children&#146;s Commissioner, we should say so in the Bill, or at
least give the matter some consideration. In Wales, we have had the
bonfire of the quangos&#151;I believe that that is the
terminology&#151;but we are creating another quango, on which there
are no limitations and which has the potential to get carried away with
itself.</div> <a name="0606298000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
therefore be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the
staffing levels and the positions in the commissioner&#146;s
office.</div><a name="0606298000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000387"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The hon. Lady makes some probing points about the
appointment of the deputy and asks why the issue is dealt with in the
Bill, rather than being left to the discretion of the Assembly or being
dealt with in secondary legislation.</div>
<a name="0606298000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 5 would remove the
requirement in schedule 1 that the commissioner appoint a deputy and it
would replace that requirement with a discretionary power. Schedule 1
follows the successful model of the Children&#146;s Commissioner for
Wales, guaranteeing that there is a deputy who can undertake the full
range of the commissioner&#146;s functions and act on his or her
behalf. The deputy will be able to take charge during any vacancy in
the office, or when the commissioner is absent or unable to act for any
reason. That will provide clarity, avoid confusion and guarantee
continuity of service to the public. The hon. Lady asks whether in
these days of equality, the deputy should be a
woman.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000389"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Vice versa, all women or whatever.</div>
<a name="0606298000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the legislation to establish
the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales, it was a requirement that
a deputy be appointed. A deputy, Maria Battle, has been appointed, but
in addition to her, other assistants have been appointed to a similar
level of responsibility. In effect, there are a number of deputies
within the office of the Children&#146;s Commissioner, while only one
is designated deputy Children&#146;s Commissioner. The legislation
before us follows closely the legislation that established the
Children&#146;s Commissioner. It seems to be working well, and I see
no reason why we should accept amendment No. 5.</div>
<a name="0606298000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady suggested that the
Government are trying to micro-manage the issue. With respect, that is
exactly what amendment No. 16 would do by limiting the number of staff
that the commissioner for older people can appoint. It would prevent
the commissioner appointing more than 30 staff unless he sought the
approval of the Assembly. That would be unreasonable. The
Children&#146;s Commissioner employs about 30 staff; the Assembly
thinks that the commissioner for older people will need a similar
number, given that the size of the relevant client groups is similar.
The commissioner may need more or less staff, and they should be free
to decide in light of their work objectives.</div>
<a name="0606298000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any event, the commissioner
will be able to employ only such staff as are affordable within the
commissioner&#146;s overall budget, which will itself be agreed
annually with the Welsh Assembly Government. For each financial year,
the commissioner will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div>required to prepare an estimate of the income and expense of his office,
and that will be laid before the Assembly. The commissioner will also
be required to submit accounts to the Auditor General for Wales, who
may examine the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the
commissioner has used their resources to discharge their
functions.</div> <a name="0606298000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
measures will provide sufficient scrutiny of the commissioner&#146;s
use of resources, including staffing costs, and they will ensure that
resources are not wasted on unnecessary staff at the expense of older
people in Wales. I therefore ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="0606298000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000390"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks. I
still feel that the Bill&#146;s compulsion to appoint just one deputy
commissioner is unnecessary; it should have been permissive. If there
were any danger signals that the quango was becoming overblown, which
has been one criticism of other quangos, a limit on the number of staff
and a report to the Assembly would have provided for a check and a
balance. Having listened to the Minister&#146;s explanation, however,
I should once again explain that the amendments were probing amendments
to enable us to ask questions and probe deeper into the
Government&#146;s mind on this piece of legislation.</div>
<a name="0606298000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to ask leave to withdraw

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000391"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Will the Minister set out the anticipated time
frame for the appointment? When does he expect the commissioner to be
in place? When will the selection process and the advertising of the
post according to the public appointment rules in Wales take place? In
particular, has any preliminary work been carried out on the location
of offices for the commissioner and his or her staff, and has
consideration been given to the possibility of taking advantage of the
network of offices already set up by the operation of the
Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales? It seems to me that there
would be a great deal of synergy between the operations of the two
commissioners: indeed, the Minister, and all others who have examined
the future role of the commissioner, have suggested such a synergy. So
I hope that some consideration has already been given to using the same
offices and perhaps some of the same systems, thereby saving the
taxpayer money. Before we agree to schedule 1, I should be interested
to hear the Minister&#146;s comments on
that.</div>
<a name="0606298000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000392"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> As to when the commissioner will be appointed, the
Bill must of course first be passed, and then the regulations must be
taken through the Assembly. We hope that it will be in 2007 that the
Assembly will appoint the commissioner; I cannot give any more detail
than that.</div>
<a name="0606298000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000393"></a>Mrs.

the hon. Lady&#146;s point about the location of offices and the
synergy with the work of the Children&#146;s Commissioner, but that
will be an operational issue. The commissioner will first need to
establish whether there is any room in any of the regional offices of
the Children&#146;s Commissioner. No decision has been taken, and
given that no detailed work has been carried out on the best location
for the offices, it would be rather unfair for the Committee to try to
impose anything on a future commissioner. I can give the hon. Lady no
assurances, except to tell her that if there is synergy between the
work of the Children&#146;s Commissioner and the older
people&#146;s commissioner, the possibility that she raises will be
seriously examined, and any opportunities for collocation of regional
offices will be taken on
board.</div><a name="0606298000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000397"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> We now move on to clause 2, which sets out the
general functions of the commissioner. Although this aspect of the
matter has been scrutinised to an enormous extent, for me the question
remains whether the commissioner has enough power to get to the heart
of the matter in relation to the issues and problems that face older
people.</div>
<a name="0606298000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The functions
of the commissioner set out in clause 2 are constricted,

would remove subsection (2). I appreciate that that would be nonsense,
but the amendment is merely a vehicle to probe how the Minister
envisages the commissioner gaining some real say and representational
opportunities over, for example, pensions. Amendment No. 11 would set
in statute a duty on the commissioner to consider the adequacy of
retirement provision and pension arrangements for older
people.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 15</div><a name="0606298000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commissioner does not have
any locus in the Department for Work and Pensions or with regard to
benefits, including housing and council tax benefits. That is a lacuna.
In that area, the Department, as opposed to the Assembly, will
adversely affect pensioner poverty. I hope that the amendments provide
the Minister with an opportunity to set out how he envisages the job
succeeding, given that the commissioner is effectively cut off from the
parts of political and governmental life that cause some of the
greatest problems for the older community in

and we want it to very much, the tools exist for it to do the job. We
heard about some of the practical tools that the commissioner will have
to do the job, but the amendments&#151;specifically amendment No.
12&#151;are concerned with the breadth of the commissioner&#146;s
reach and the extent of his remit. That debate endured many hours in
another place and was mentioned on Second Reading, so&#151;like the
hon. Lady&#151;I shall not discuss it for long.</div>
<a name="0606298000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking about issues that
have a profound effect on older people in Wales. Many range beyond the
remit of the National Assembly for Wales, and responsibility rests
here. Our concern is that subsection (2), which limits the
commissioner&#146;s general functions, will seriously handicap him in
his attempts to fulfil his role as fully as possible. In particular,
subsection (1)(d) stipulates that the commissioner may</div>
<a name="0606298000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;keep under review the adequacy and
effectiveness of law affecting the interests of older people in
Wales.&#148;</div><a name="0606298000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Laws
relating to pensions and tax credits have an enormous effect on the
interests of older people in Wales, but as the Bill stands, the
commissioner&#146;s role in such issues is limited. I do not hold out
much hope that the Minister will be positive towards the amendment, but
if it were agreed to, it would significantly broaden the
commissioner&#146;s role. We strongly welcome the Bill, and we
strongly endorse its proposals; however, we must go forward if it is to
be meaningful.</div>
<a name="0606298000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham said that it seemed
strange that the Government were introducing the position as a
Wales-only role, given that the UK Government have an enormous role to
play and an enormous influence over the welfare of Welsh older people.
Perhaps it would have been wiser to have a UK-wide commissioner, or at
least to grant the Welsh commissioner more influence over non-devolved
matters, as the amendments would provide.</div>
<a name="0606298000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
18 stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik). We would include in the Bill as
one of the commissioner&#146;s core functions, a responsibility to
work towards the elimination of elder abuse. The inaugural world elder
abuse awareness day is on 15 June. Help the Aged Wales is prominent in
that campaign, and I am sure that members of the Committee will praise
it and its awareness-raising agenda.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div><a name="0606298000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2004, the Health Committee
filed a report on elder abuse in which it acknowledged that it was
notoriously hard to estimate the scale and prevalence of elder abuse,
primarily
because</div><a name="0606298000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Much
abuse is not reported because many older people are unable, frightened
or embarrassed to report its
presence.&#148;</div><a name="0606298000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the extent
of such abuse is difficult to quantify, but there is indeed a
problem.</div><a name="0606298000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Abuse can take many
forms&#151;sexual, financial, medical, physical or
psychological&#151;and ruins the lives of many innocent and
vulnerable people.</div> <a name="0606298000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Health Committee went on to
say:</div><a name="0606298000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Often care
staff take no action because they lack training in identifying abuse or
are ignorant of the reporting procedures... The lack of training
in issues relating to elder abuse...is encountered in all the
settings in which abuse
occurs.&#148;</div><a name="0606298000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crucially, it
concluded:</div> <a name="0606298000128"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we strongly
endorse any measures that make available advocacy services for older
people.&#148;</div> <a name="0606298000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
strongly congratulate the Government on the establishment of an older
people&#146;s commissioner. The commissioner will be in a unique
position to combat elder abuse. As an independent advocate for older
people, he will be able to provide excellent counsel for those in need
and guidance to service providers on how to recognise and deal with the
problem, and to issue strong recommendations to the Assembly on how to
tackle elder abuse at policy
level.</div><a name="0606298000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
many Members here agree with me that making the eradication of elder
abuse in Wales one of the commissioner&#146;s core tasks would send a
clear message that our political leaders are alive to the severity of
the problem and are determined to stamp it out. On that basis, in
pursuing the amendment, I hope to see this important provision put into
the
Bill.</div><a name="0606298000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606298000399"></a><b class="B">Adam
Price</b> (Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr) (PC): I rise not just
to give the two principal Front-Bench speakers some well-earned rest
but because I think that the amendment and some of those that follow it
go to the heart of the difficulty with the Bill. We all agree with the
principles behind it, but the crux of the disagreement among us is
devolution and how the Bill deals with it.</div>
<a name="0606298000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a fundamental
inconsistency in the way in which the Bill assigns powers to the
commissioner. Devolution was meant to make democratic accountability
easier, simpler and clearer. However, those of us who are proponents of
devolution and good governance generally should be alive to the danger.
Because of the at times complex nature of the settlement in Wales,
devolution can lead to greater confusion. Confusion leads to
frustration, and frustration leads to a sense of exasperation with
politics in general, although we shall not mention Blaenau Gwent in
these proceedings.</div><a name="0606298000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commissioner will be able to make representations on anything relevant
to older people in Wales. I was corrected on the record by the
Minister, who said that the commissioner will have the power to
commission research in non-devolved matters, but they will not have the
power to produce a formal report. There lies the lacuna: the
commissioner will have the power to make representations but not the
power to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div>conduct a formal review or lay a formal report before the Assembly or
directly before
Westminster.</div><a name="0606298000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
a number of problems, one of which is that there will no longer be any
practical formal mechanism for taking up representations on
non-devolved matters. During the passage of the Government of Wales Act
1998, there was a lot of talk about joint ministerial councils&#151;a
kind of summit of the islands involving Ministers from the far-flung
reaches of the United Kingdom. Ministers for education, health and
devolved services from Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and even the
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man would be invited to ministerial
jamborees to share best practice and so
on.</div><a name="0606298000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="0606298000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that such joint ministerial councils have ceased to exist.
I am not aware that they meet now on a regular basis. Therefore, there
is no formal mechanism for such representations. Perhaps that is
because in Wales, Scotland and Westminster the same party is at the
helm&#151;just lift the telephone and there are informal
representations&#151;but without the formal mechanism, there is no
guarantee that those representations will be carried across. That is
one of the
problems.</div><a name="0606298000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
problem is that the Bill flies in the face of what everyone in Wales is
saying. Where is the democratic devolution in the Bill? All the major
statements made have strongly supported the principle of giving the
commissioner the right to direct access to Westminster, or at
least the right to have representations passed on
automatically.</div><a name="0606298000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
were two major consultations on the proposal. One consultation was on
the advisory group&#146;s report, and the second on the draft Bill.
In both instances the vast majority of consultees came out strongly in
favour of strengthening the commissioner&#146;s role in non-devolved
areas. All the major stakeholder organisations in Wales came out in
favour of giving the older people&#146;s commissioner those
strengthened powers: Help the Aged, Age Concern, Swansea Network
50-plus and, the Minister will be interested to hear, the
Carmarthenshire Pensioners Forum; I am sure that he took due note of
the constituency
interest.</div><a name="0606298000138"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000401"></a>Adam

well&#151;Professor John Williams, I noted&#151; and the
Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society. I could go on, because there were
dozens of consultees that supported the advisory group&#146;s own
recommendations. The Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s own
advisory group recommended that the commissioner should be given a
stronger locus in non-devolved areas, as indeed&#151;as I pointed out
on a previous occasion&#151;did the Health and Social Services
Committee of the National Assembly for Wales, where there is a Labour
majority. It is puzzling, to say the least, that the Westminster
Government would seek to frustrate the declared
will&#151;</div><a name="0606298000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000402"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We seem to be drifting into the next
group of amendments. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to combine
the two groups in one debate?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div><a name="0606298000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000403"></a>Adam
Price:</b> I happily stand corrected. I am referring to
amendment No. 12, which would remove the
constraints.</div><a name="0606298000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000404"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I accept that the hon. Gentleman is speaking to
the amendment referred to, but much of the debate goes on to the next
group, so it may be as well to combine the debate on both and take the
votes
separately.</div><a name="0606298000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000405"></a>Adam
Price:</b> I am prepared to accept that. I have no intention
or desire to repeat the comments that I am making
now.</div><a name="0606298000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000406"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> On a point of order, Mrs. Dean, would you clarify
for me what your ruling was from the Chair? I think we are discussing
amendments Nos. 11, 18 and 12, but amendments Nos. 20, 29, 25 and 27
are in a group on which the hon. Liberal Democrat spokesman will leads.
Are we now moving into a phase where we are discussing all of those
amendments together, in which case the Opposition may need to make some
more remarks, or are we going to stay with amendments Nos. 11, 18 and
12, and allow a debate to follow on the next group of amendments? I was
unclear and unsighted as to what you
meant.</div><a name="0606298000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000407"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We should combine the groups. If those who have
already spoken, including the Liberal Front-Bench spokesman and the
hon. Lady, would like to come back and speak to the group as a whole,
we will take the vote separately. So with this group it will be
convenient also to discuss the following amendments: No. 20, in clause
2, page 1, line 18, after &#145;Assembly',
insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;and to Her Majesty's
Ministers'.</div><a name="0606298000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.
29, in clause 2, page 1, line 18, after &#145;Assembly',
insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;and to the Secretary of
State'.</div><a name="0606298000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.
25, in clause 8, page 5, line 33, after &#145;Assembly',
insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;or to the United Kingdom
Government'.</div><a name="0606298000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.
27, in clause 12, page 8, line 4, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(d) the United
Kingdom
Government.'.</div><a name="0606298000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000408"></a>Adam
Price:</b> Amendment No.12 speaks to the generality of the
subject of the way in which non-devolved matters should be dealt with.
In the Assembly, John Griffiths, the Deputy Minister for Health and
Social Services, has argued that the nature of the devolution
settlement imposes on the commissioner the need to go through the
Assembly as an intermediary&#151;in his words&#151;rather than
being able to engage directly in non-devolved matters.</div>
<a name="0606298000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would argue strongly that that
is not the devolution settlement. Section 30 of the Government of Wales
Act 1998 gives the Assembly the power to have a view on anything,
including non-devolved matters. Why should the older people&#146;s
commissioner, who has statutory power, be dealt with any differently in
terms of their ability to deal with non-devolved matters?</div>
<a name="0606298000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The danger is that we are
creating a hierarchy of commissioners. If there is subsequently a
commissioner for older people in England or the UK, as we have seen 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div>with the example of the Children&#146;s Commissioner, there could be
confusion as to where the principle locus resides for older people. Is
it territorial or functional? We need clarity, not least for older
people in Wales.</div>
<a name="0606298000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
the Government&#146;s own social exclusion unit report, &#147;A
Sure Start to later life&#148;, which looked at the problems of older
people, concluded that one problem that older people experienced in
dealing with public agencies was that they did not know who to contact.
They had to go all over the shop to get information and services. That
was speaking at the local level. There is a danger that we could be
replicating that confusion by creating that arbitrary distinction
between devolved and non-devolved matters.</div>
<a name="0606298000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Older people
want a one-stop shop for advocacy, complaints&#146; procedure and
review of policy. We should give them that single port of
call&#151;that single point of contact&#151;in the form of an older
people&#146;s commissioner who would have an unfettered right to
review policy, conduct formal reviews and present reports on devolved
or non-devolved matters to promote good governance for the older people
of
Wales.</div><a name="0606298000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000409"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Thank you for clarifying my earlier point of
order, Mrs. Dean. Amendment No.29 falls into that second group that we
are considering. Subject to any comments made by the Liberal Democrat
spokesman on his amendments, I may want to intervene
quickly.</div><a name="0606298000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
No.29, after the word &#147;Assembly&#148;
adds</div><a name="0606298000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and to the Secretary
of State&#148;.</div> <a name="0606298000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">That makes the
commissioner competent to make representations to the UK Government,
through the medium of the Secretary of State. I was not sure how to
express it otherwise.</div>
<a name="0606298000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I was reading, &#147;When
I&#146;m 64 and more: A report from the Advisory Group on a Strategy
for Older People in Wales to the National Assembly of Wales&#148;,
which was part of the thinking behind the older people&#146;s
commissioner, it was obvious that we are setting up someone
to fail here&#151;at least as regards 50 per cent. of the job that
needs to be done.</div><a name="0606298000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
has only to look at that document and its recommendations. I want to
draw the Minister&#146;s attention to some of the recommendations in
the document &#147;When I&#146;m 64&#148;, because they
illustrate how the commissioner has been given the capability to do
half a job, in the light of the restrictions that have been placed on
his or her
competence.</div><a name="0606298000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
recommendations,</div> <a name="0606298000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the UK
Government should ensure that consumer protection measures are in place
for older people&#148;,</div>
<a name="0606298000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">including advice, guidance and support. If
that is a UK Government responsibility, and if the commissioner may not
make representations about it at UK Government level, only half a job
will be done, in the context of the recommendations that are going only
to the Welsh Assembly Government. Similarly, in the context of age
discrimination in employment, the spread of good practice and the
concept of the age of entitlement as opposed to the age of retirement
are in the sole gift of the UK Government. They are not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div>devolved matters for the Welsh Assembly. The commissioner does not have
a voice at that table, according to clause 2.</div>
<a name="0606298000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The document makes
recommendations about pensions and benefits. What is wanted is that the
Government should place less reliance on means-testing in benefit
policy and practice, and make</div>
<a name="0606298000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;higher provision of a more
adequate level of state pensions to sustain decent standards of
living.&#148;</div><a name="0606298000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is no
mechanism or conduit by which the commissioner can make representations
on those fronts, once again, half a job will be done.</div>
<a name="0606298000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">A mechanism is also needed
whereby the commissioner can make representations to the UK Government
on current strategies, such as on tackling crime. That has an effect on
older people. More and more problems arise for people of the older
generation because of criminal activity; ASBOs are relevant to that. I
am pleased to welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli
Pembrokeshire back here, hot-foot from his timely debate on the merger
of police forces in Wales, which the Opposition very much oppose; when
it comes to making representations to the Home Office about crime, the
Bill provides for no mechanism or platform to enable the commissioner
to do so.</div> <a name="0606298000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) more or less said,
&#147;Things are okay while we have a Labour Government in Wales,
Scotland and Westminster, but it may not always be like that.&#148;
It is certainly not okay in my book. Things will change, and the
informal nod and wink or the opportunity to sidle up at a champagne
reception thrown by some wealthy donor at the Labour party conference
will no longer be available for people to make their representations. A
formal mechanism will be necessary for the functioning of the
office&#151;an office that we all welcome, look forward to seeing in
operation and hope will be as successful as that of the
Children&#146;s Commissioner.</div>
<a name="0606298000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the commissioner cannot make
the necessary representations at Westminster level, we shall not get
Wales and Westminster working together in harmony. We shall have a huge
gap in the functions of the commissioner on what are probably some of
the most important subjects affecting older people. They affect
everyone, but the older generation in particular. In speaking to
amendment No. 29, I am attempting to seduce the Minister down the road
of allowing the commissioner a formalised platform, set in statute, for
making representations to
Westminster.</div>
<a name="0606298000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="0606298000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000410"></a>Mark
Williams:</b> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 20, 25 and 27.
The issue is, again, the breadth of the commissioner&#146;s role. We
have tabled the amendments because we want that role to succeed and we
want the commissioner to carry fulfil his functions as well as
possible. The Government&#146;s enormous influence on the interests
of older people in Wales means that we must ensure that the working
relationship between the commissioner and the Government is adequate
and appropriate and, critically, that it will stand the test of
time.</div><a name="0606298000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 20
would allow the commissioner to make direct representation to the
Government. I have read the proposals in detail and it seems that there

<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>are two gatekeepers, which will discourage people from seeking redress
for their concerns and grievances. A more direct approach necessitates
people&#146;s complaints going directly to UK Ministers. The
commissioner&#146;s words must follow a convoluted path via the Welsh
Assembly and the Wales Office before reaching the relevant
Minister.</div>
<a name="0606298000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The public
need to have confidence. We are told that we are trail-blazing. We are;
the objective is laudable, but the crunch will come when people come to
constituency surgeries expecting issues to be pursued by the
commissioner. There will be bewilderment and scepticism about whether
recommendations on UK-wide issues will be taken seriously. We are still
convinced that the commissioner should have the formal right to make
representations direct to UK
Ministers.</div><a name="0606298000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
our amendment to clause 8 would allow the commissioner to offer
guidance and assistance to someone making a complaint or representation
to the Government or one of their agencies. Amendment No. 27 would
allow the commissioner to issue guidance to the Government and their
agencies. I commend the amendments to the
Committee.</div><a name="0606298000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000411"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Because of the way in which we have decided to
proceed, I shall talk to the earlier amendments, which do not refer to
the non-devolved issue, and move on to the relationship between the
commissioner and his or her representation on non-devolved
matters.</div><a name="0606298000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
11 seeks to provide the commissioner with a general power to keep under
review the adequacy of retirement provision for older people in Wales.
The term &#147;retirement provision&#148; is rather broad and could
encompass a wide range of issues from financial planning, including
occupational, private and state pension financial provision, to health
promotion and housing.</div>
<a name="0606298000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 2 and 9 provide an
appropriate and balanced remit for the commissioner on those issues.
For example, the commissioner could&#151;this is important and the
hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr discussed it on Second
Reading&#151;undertake research and make representation on the
adequacy of state pension provision for older people in Wales or on the
steps taken to encourage personal financial provision for retirement
and the regulation of the private pension sector, including concerns
about pension mis-selling. There is nothing to stop the commissioner
doing that research and making representation on those non-devolved
issues.</div><a name="0606298000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
must not forget that the commissioner&#146;s primary role is to
protect those who receive or are in need of services as older people in
Wales. Matters arising from the private provision of goods and services
remain the responsibility of the Office of Fair Trading. It would
simply not be appropriate for the commissioner to take action on
individual private financial queries, nor would his or her other powers
in the Bill support such action. Nevertheless, the commissioner will be
able to direct older people to the most appropriate body to deal such
inquiries&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Does the hon. Member for
Chesham and Amersham want to intervene?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div><a name="0606298000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000412"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I thought the Minister said that under clause 9
the commissioner can carry out research. In fact, I can see that he can
undertake and commission any research and/or educational activities.
However, surely subsection (2) acts as a brake so that the commissioner
can use his or her powers to review, to encourage best practice and to
promote awareness of interests only in relation to matters in which the
Welsh Assembly has functions, so he has no route to Westminster, even
with the research that he has carried out. Perhaps the Minister can
enlighten me on
that.</div><a name="0606298000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000413"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The hon. Lady said that the commissioner had no
powers to go direct to Westminster, and that is accepted. His powers of
representation are to the Assembly, and I will come on to that later.
It might be helpful if hon. Members looked at the exchange of letters,
which I have laid on the Table for the Committee&#146;s use, about
how representations from the commissioner to the Assembly would
work.</div> <a name="0606298000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 18
would give the commissioner a general power to work towards the
elimination of elder abuse among older people in Wales, but it is not
necessary because the Bill already provides for the commissioner to
work towards that aim. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 2(1) allow the
commissioner to promote awareness of elder abuse, as well as measures
to eliminate such abuse, and they will support and enable his work in
that area. The commissioner will also have extensive powers to review
the discharge of functions by key bodies and whistleblowing
arrangements. The Bill therefore already makes strong provision for
dealing with the elder abuse, and it is difficult to see what the
amendment would add to the commissioner&#146;s existing
powers.</div> <a name="0606298000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
12 relates to the non-devolved functions, and hon. Members can take it
as read that my response applies also to amendments Nos. 20, 29, 25 and
27, which also relate to those functions. The amendment would remove
the restriction that the commissioner can exercise his general function
in clause 2(1) only in relation to devolved matters.</div>
<a name="0606298000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2(1) provides for the

awareness of the interests of older people in Wales and of the need to
safeguard those interests...promote the provision of opportunities

to matters in which the Assembly has
functions.</div><a name="0606298000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Secretary of State and I explained on Second Reading, we have
proposed the arrangements in the Bill because the commissioner is being
established as a Wales-only commissioner, and he or she will act in the
interests of older people in Wales. It would not be appropriate for a
commissioner established by the Assembly and for Wales to exercise his
general powers directly in relation to non-devolved matters.
Non-devolved functions are properly the responsibility of the UK
Government, not the Assembly. Under the existing Government of Wales
Act, specific provision exists for the making of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div>representations by the Assembly about any matter affecting Wales. The
commissioner legislation has been drafted to have close regard to the
devolution settlement. The proper constitutional route for
representations under that settlement would be via the Assembly, as the
elected body with democratic responsibility for the people of
Wales.</div><a name="0606298000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, the Secretary of State also referred to the exchange of
letters between myself and Assembly Ministers, copies of which have
been placed in the Library and on the Table. Those letters show our
commitment to ensuring that the process of dealing with the
commissioner&#146;s representations is
effective.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000414"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Can the Minister tell me when those letters were
made available in the Library?</div>
<a name="0606298000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000415"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I cannot, but I would have assumed that it was
when they were discussed in the Grand Committee in the other place. I
understand that that is the position.</div>
<a name="0606298000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000416"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I did not have the advantage of seeing the letters
before, although they are very helpful. Our current thinking is set out
in an attached note, but it does not appear to be with the letter from
Brian Gibbons, so we are slightly
unsighted.</div><a name="0606298000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000417"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I shall make arrangements&#151;I hope by this
afternoon&#151;for that note to be made available. I am grateful to
the hon. Lady for her thanks. I wanted to make as much information
available to the Committee as possible, and I am sorry that that note
is not available.</div>
<a name="0606298000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
helpful if we move on to the note. During the Grand Committee in the
other place, we made public an exchange of letters between me and
Assembly Ministers on how the procedure for representations about
non-devolved matters would work in practice. In brief, the Assembly
Ministers explained that they intend to put in place a system, such as
a memorandum of understanding or concordat between the Assembly
Government and the commissioner, to set out both parties&#146;
expectations about the way in which the commissioner&#146;s
representations will be handled between them. It is intended that the
system will set out service standards, such as time taken to respond or
publication of representations and responses, as opposed to its
guaranteeing a favourable outcome for individual
representations.</div> <a name="0606298000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
reply, I reiterated my willingness and that of the Secretary of the
State to meet the commissioner to discuss any problematic non-devolved
issues. I also undertook to ensure that any representations made by the
commissioner via Assembly Ministers are raised with or passed on to the
relevant UK Department and given serious consideration.</div>
<a name="0606298000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
interesting that the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire has just
returned from a debate on policing in Wales. It shows that, when
matters affect the people of Wales, the Assembly is not backward in
coming forward to make representations and enter discussions with the
relevant UK Department about the views of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div>the people of Wales. That is just one example, but there are many others
in which the Assembly, a Committee of the Assembly, or Welsh Assembly
Ministers make regular representations to the UK Government on a range
of issues. Given that track record, I see no problem at all with
representations being forcefully made and proper responses from the
relevant Department being received.</div>
<a name="0606298000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000418"></a>David
T.C. Davies:</b> Does the Minister not agree, however, that on
a technicality the Welsh Assembly has a direct responsibility for
social justice and for setting the police precept? It is not the least
bit surprising that it would comment on police mergers. It has a direct
responsibility for them.</div>
<a name="0606298000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000419"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The Assembly has a direct responsibility, but when
one considers the full aspect of the police authorities&#146;
responsibilities and operational activities in Wales, it is relatively
small. I just use it as an illustration. The Assembly, its Committees
and its Ministers make regular representations, which UK Departments
take seriously. I do not see a problem with the proposal before us,
particularly as, following the exchange of letters, it is for a clearly
set out protocol and concordat between the Assembly and the
commissioner about how such non-devolved issues, and any representation
he may make will be taken forward.</div>
<a name="0606298000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The procedure that the Bill puts
in place will safeguard the devolution settlement and provide the
commissioner with clarity about his responsibilities. I and the
Assembly Government are committed to making the process work in the
interests of older people in Wales.</div>
<a name="0606298000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Either the hon. Member for
Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr or the hon. Member for Chesham and
Amersham&#151;I cannot remember which&#151;asked what would happen
if one of the Governments were to change. Any Government will remain
accountable to the public in Wales or the UK for their decisions, as I
have outlined. The Government&#146;s approach is sensible. It is in
line with the constitutional arrangements that exist in the Government
of Wales Act and in this Bill.</div>
<a name="0606298000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Carmarthen,
East and Dinefwr also raised a point that others in the consultation
raised. It was about a one-stop shop, so that people are not confused
about the person to whom they should make complaints or
representations. I understand his point. Individual older people will
not need to judge who they would have to go to if they had an issue to
raise. If someone comes to the commissioner with a problem, the
presumption will be that the commissioner will do whatever he can to
help. In effect, he is a one-stop shop using whichever of his powers is
appropriate and calling on the assistance of other agencies and
expertise as
required.</div><a name="0606298000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="0606298000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
suggestion that older people will require an account of which power the
commissioner is using on which occasion. If we talk about more devolved
issues, we have established, for example, that he can carry out
research into the state pension provision. He can make representations
to the Assembly on those matters. We have set out how those
representations would then be carried forward to the relevant UK
Government Department.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div><a name="0606298000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a fundamental issue, as the
hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams) both
said, concerning the nature of the legislation. However, we have to
remain within the current constitutional settlement. Accountability is
clear. The important matters which hon. Members raised about the
representations that the commissioner can make on non-devolved matters
are clear.</div> <a name="0606298000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
exchange of letters confirms that both the Assembly and we in the Wales
Office take this issue seriously. We want it to work. We do not want to
fetter the commissioner. He can make those representations and they
will be taken seriously by the
UK&#151;</div><a name="0606298000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000420"></a>Adam
Price:</b> My question is genuine. I cannot understand the
Government&#146;s difficulty with amendment No. 12 or any of the
other amendments that go in the same direction. If the Government are
happy for the commission to initiate research by a third party or to
make representations on a non-devolved matter, why not allow the
commissioner to make a formal report on that? What is the
problem?</div><a name="0606298000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000421"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that it should be
a formal report to the Assembly or a formal report to the UK
Government?</div><a name="0606298000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000422"></a>Adam
Price:</b> Either and
both.</div><a name="0606298000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000423"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> In making his representations, the commissioner
may not be making a formal report with conclusions at the end of it.
However, he will be making his views clearly known on a matter;
otherwise, why make the representation in the first place?</div>
<a name="0606298000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case that
the commissioner would make on behalf of an individual or all older
people in Wales would be made in the same way that a report would be
made. However, there would be no conclusions at the end of that
process. The representation&#151;the argument&#151;would be made.
It would be for the Assembly to look at and formally pass that on
through the process that I described. Although it is not a report, the
argument and the representation on the matter will be clear.</div>
<a name="0606298000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">We return to
the matter of accountability and to the fact that we have devolution
and the legislation has to conform to that devolution settlement. We
understand that there will be matters that the commissioner will want
to take up on behalf of the people of Wales that will not be devolved
to the Assembly. We have a way for him to do that within the current
constitutional settlement so that the older people in Wales are
properly represented by the commissioner in non-devolved issues. With
those remarks, I ask the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham and the
hon. Member for Ceredigion not to press their
amendments.</div><a name="0606298000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000424"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I have listened carefully to the
Minister. I am not convinced and, with your
permission, Mrs. Dean, I would like to ask for a vote on
amendment No. 12.</div>
<a name="0606298000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am slightly
more concerned by what the Minister said in response on the two groups
of amendments; I do not know what my colleagues further down the Bench
think. We are producing what I believe was described in one Welsh paper
as a toothless wonder. We are in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 26</div>danger of allowing something to go through that is only half-baked.
Relying on a track record, which is what the Minister said of
communications between the commissioner, Westminster and the Welsh
Assembly Government, is not satisfactory. That track record is limited;
it has existed only during the lifetime of a Labour-dominated Assembly
Government and a Labour Westminster Government. We need to look beyond
the current political make-up of all institutions towards a time when
there may be a difference in the political complexion of those
institutions or, indeed, when they could be dominated by Conservative
Members in both places. I can see the looks down the Bench&#151;other
hon. Members also welcome that
prospect.</div><a name="0606298000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
interesting that the Minister has introduced&#151;I have to say
this&#151;two letters that I have not had the advantage of seeing
before. I would like to ask whether he will place on record exactly
when they were made available to hon. Members. I have checked with
other Opposition colleagues and they have not had the advantage of
seeing the letters. I would like to see the &#147;current
thinking&#148; set out in the &#147;attached note&#148;, which is
referred to in the letter of 12 October, from Brian Gibbons to the
Minister.</div><a name="0606298000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The exchange
of letters illustrates the case exactly. The letters are between Brian
Gibbons, a Labour Minister in the Welsh Assembly, to the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Wales, who is a Labour Government
Minister. One letter
says:</div><a name="0606298000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I thought
it might be helpful both to you and to Lord
Evans&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0606298000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">who I
believe is a Labour peer who speaks in the other
House&#151;</div><a name="0606298000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at this
stage to let you have an outline of how we envisage that the
commissioner might use this power in practice&#148;.</div>
<a name="0606298000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The exchange of letters is
entirely between three people who represent the interests of Wales in
Labour Governments. The return letter of 17 October, from the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State to Brian Gibbons, carries the
immortal
words:</div><a name="0606298000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I have
also given a commitment that I will ensure that any representations
made by the commissioner, via you, are raised with, or passed on to,
the relevant UK Government Department as appropriate and are given
serious consideration by them. That process should, of course, conclude
with you and the commissioner receiving a clear and timely answer to
your representation, with an account of the action to be taken or a
justification for not taking action in response to the issues
raised.&#148;</div><a name="0606298000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">How can
we guarantee that? The exchange of letters is between
friends&#151;&#147;Dear Nick&#148;, &#147;Dear Brian&#148;
and &#147;Dear Brian&#148;, &#147;Dear Nick&#148;. The document
is saying that a commitment has been given, but it is a personal
commitment on behalf of the Minister. I am sure he will discharge the
duty excellently, as he always does. He is an honourable man who will
discharge the duty with alacrity, but the letter appears to be part of
a cosy exchange. That is just the sort of cosy exchange between friends
that Conservative Members would like to remove from the realms of
possibility and put as a definite function and role in the
Bill.</div><a name="0606298000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever the
commissioner is seen to be saying, reporting or making representations
on, it is important that there is a requirement for the UK Government
to respond to issues that are raised by the commissioner, particularly
when the Assembly does not have specific 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 27</div>functions. As the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr said,
those points were made by Age Concern, the Monmouthshire local health
board, the county council, the older people&#146;s strategy group,
the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society, the RNIB and many others who
were simply echoing fears that have arisen after long examination of
the intentions of the Government at Westminster and the
Assembly.</div> <a name="0606298000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">If anything,
there have been over-consultation on the Bill; however, the Government
have not taken advantage of some of the signposting from the
consultees. They must have a jolly good reason for ignoring it, and I
believe that they are doing so so that the commissioner&#146;s powers
will be clipped, and the commissioner will be able to do only half a
job.</div>
<a name="0606298000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to
have a commissioner for older people, let us give that person the tools
of the trade to do the job properly. Let us say that devolution is only
partial and that we recognise that there are matters retained in
Westminster. Let us say that this is a grown-up devolution settlement
and that the commissioner should therefore be able to make
representations to the UK Government about the matters that concern
them. Let us expect, require and set in statute the
commissioner&#146;s ability to have a response from the UK
Government. Otherwise, people will say, &#147;The commissioner does
not have teeth. How can we trust the commissioner to champion older
people&#146;s needs in
Wales?&#148;</div><a name="0606298000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that I had asked on Second Reading why we had made
provision for Wales, but not for England and Wales or, indeed, the
whole United Kingdom. We have all identified a need, and I think that
the Government have the best of intentions as regards meeting that
need, but I cannot understand why we are spoiling the ship for a
ha&#145;p&#146;orth of tar.</div>
<a name="0606298000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has already
responded, so he does not have an opportunity to do so again. However,
I leave him with the fact that I should like details concerning when
and where the exchange of letters was made public, and why, as far as I
can establish, no Opposition member of the Committee was
notified&#151;although I am sure that that was an oversight and was
not done with guilty intention. I should also like the note referred to
in the letter of 12 October to be made available to the
Committee.</div>

and did not expect letters suddenly to be produced in the House of

have gone down every day to ask whether another set of letters had come

this amendment we shall briefly be revisiting some of the ground just

the preceding discussion, the current draft of the Bill imposes no such
duty&#151;particularly in relation to clause 2(3) on non-devolved
areas. I should be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s comments,
but as far as devolved functions are concerned the procedure for
response will presumably be similar to that which pertains to the
Children&#146;s Commissioner. That is, the Assembly&#151;like any
other public body&#151;will have a prescribed duty to respond within
a certain period. My amendment seeks to impose a guaranteed duty to
respond in relation to non-devolved areas. We need to know that, when
the commissioner avails himself of the right to make representations in
non-devolved areas, those representations will be passed on to the
relevant UK Minister or Government
body.</div><a name="0606298000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, too, just
received a set of letters. The note that is attached to them is being
helpfully dangled in front of me by the hon. Member for Ceredigion. It
goes into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 29</div>some detail on the memorandum of understanding and on the precise issue
of what will happen when the commissioner makes a representation on a
non-devolved area. As I recall, it discusses a range of options that
would be prescribed in an explicit Assembly response, including, I note
with interest, doing nothing at all. That is quite often the response
of the Assembly
Government.</div><a name="0606298000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
essential problem is that a memorandum of understanding, a commitment
and a friendly, courteous exchange of letters between Brian and the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary&#151;it is all first name terms in the
Assembly&#151;is all well and good, but it is no substitute for a
statutory duty to respond. Ministers and Governments come and go, but
people want transparency, automaticity and a guarantee of a
constitutional duty on the Assembly Government to pass on
comments&#151;even if the Assembly Government do not agree with those
comments&#151;in order to make sure that the UK Government have an
opportunity to consider them in due
course.</div><a name="0606298000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society, Age Concern Cymru, Mind Cymru and a
host of consultees agreed with the proposal that non-devolved matters
should have some automaticity.</div>
<a name="0606298000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The previous
Parliamentary Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig),
spoke in the Welsh Affairs Committee about the scenario of the older
people&#146;s commissioner passing on representations in non-devolved
matters:</div><a name="0606298000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;He or
she would make representations to the Assembly and the Assembly would
make a judgment whether it felt that it needed to take these matters up
with the respective department here in
London.&#148;</div><a name="0606298000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is simply
not good enough. It is not up to the Assembly to consider whether the
statutory commissioner&#146;s views should be passed on. If the
commissioner has statutory powers, he should at least have the
automatic right to convey his representations to the relevant
Minister.</div><a name="0606298000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000443"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Amendment No. 36 seeks to ensure that the Assembly
considers and responds to the commissioner&#146;s representations.
The Assembly would also have to consult the commissioner before taking
any action as a consequence of one of his representations.</div>
<a name="0606298000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government do not believe
that the amendment is necessary. Paragraph 69 of the Assembly
Government&#146;s statement of policy intentions&#151;I hope that
we have the right version, which is relevant to my point&#151;sets
out their intention to require by regulation that the
commissioner&#146;s periodic reports shall contain a summary of any
representations that he might have made to the Assembly during the
reporting year. That will be the commissioner&#146;s opportunity to
place on the public record his views on any perceived deficiencies in
the Assembly Government&#146;s handling of those
representations.</div> <a name="0606298000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the case of the Children&#146;s Commissioner, an annual Assembly
debate takes place on both his annual report and the Assembly
Government&#146;s response. It is intended that the same procedure
will be followed for the older people&#146;s commissioner. That will
be the opportunity for Assembly Members to hold the Assembly Government
accountable for their handling of any representations made.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div><a name="0606298000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr referred to the need for
clarity on how the Assembly will respond to the commissioner&#146;s
representations and said that concerns had been expressed by a number
of interested bodies. The Assembly Government intend that operational
arrangements between them and the commissioner for older people in
Wales will be governed by a memorandum of understanding. The memorandum
will cover matters such as the submission of the commissioner&#146;s
estimate for the next financial year, the frequency and method of
Assembly payments and so on.</div>
<a name="0606298000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">As part of the process of
establishing that memorandum of understanding, the Assembly Government
intend to agree with the commissioner a procedure for making and
considering his or her formal representations. The procedure will
respect the commissioner&#146;s independence and powers to examine
relevant matters, including instances in which such representations
deal with matters that are of concern to older people in Wales but for
which responsibility has not been devolved to the National Assembly and
remains with the UK Government.</div>
<a name="0606298000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of the procedure will be
to guarantee that the commissioner&#146;s views and findings are
considered carefully and openly by the Assembly and the Assembly
Government. It is envisaged that it will include specified options for
actions that the Assembly Government would consider taking in response
to a representation from the commissioner. Such options might include
referring the matter to a Cabinet sub-committee on older people based
here in London, asking the national partnership forum for older people
for advice or recommendations or raising the matter formally with Wales
Office Ministers in accordance with section 33 of the Government of
Wales Act 1998. The Assembly Government will also have the option to
determine that it will not take any further action in response to a
particular
representation.</div><a name="0606298000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
procedure will include specified time limits for the Assembly
Government to consider a representation and make a response to the
commissioner. Unless the nature of the content of a representation
dictates otherwise, we expect the process to be as open as possible to
public scrutiny. With those comments I have set out how the Assembly
Government intend to deal with representations on both devolved and
non-devolved issues.</div>
<a name="0606298000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said earlier, if the
commissioner remains dissatisfied with the response, or perhaps the
lack of it, from the Assembly Government to a representation that he
has made, he will be able to draw particular attention to it in his
annual report, which will be debated in the Assembly. Again, there are
substantial checks and balances to ensure that representations are
taken seriously and that action is taken if required. On that basis, I
ask the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606298000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606298000444"></a><b class="B">Huw
Irranca-Davies</b> (Ogmore) (Lab): On a point of order, Mrs.

Dean. While we are discussing the documentation that accompanies the
Bill, I add that I have been examining the document entitled
&#147;Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Bill: Statement of Policy
Intentions for Subordinate Legislation&#148;, which was laid out in
the room today for Committee members. Another document of exactly the
same name was made available to me and my office through the Vote
Office. They are not entirely different but they are different
documents, they are undated and there is no identification. The
pagination and the paragraphs are different. As the document is a
substantial part of the way in which we can scrutinise the Bill, I
should like to inquire through you, Mrs. Dean, why we have not been
given just one, dated document that can be identified clearly. I am

copy of the note on the Government&#146;s intentions. The road to
hell is paved with notes on good intentions, but the note sets out
clearly the Government&#146;s thinking as of October last year. Will
the Minister inform us outside the Committee whether there has been any
development of that thinking in the
Assembly?</div><a name="0606298000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
entirely satisfied by the Minister&#146;s argument. I have scanned
the note and I see that one of the options is to raise the matter
formally with Wales Office Ministers. Presumably that would not
preclude the Assembly from raising it with Ministers in other
Departments and the Wales Office is simply a conduit for subsequent
conversations.</div><a name="0606298000260"></a>

Griffith</b> (Llanelli) (Lab): I very much welcome the
proactive role that the clause sets out for the commissioner. It is
easy for us to acknowledge the needs and concerns of older people in
Wales, but the clause specifies that the commissioner&#146;s role
will go further and that he will promote and safeguard their interests.
Matters such as prejudice and discrimination can be complex, and while
it can be easy to recognise direct discrimination there can always be
indirect discrimination through factors that make it more difficult for
an older person to participate in activities or benefit from
opportunities than it is for a younger person. The commissioner will
have the role of actively promoting opportunities for older people and
of driving forward the elimination of discrimination in a wide range of
areas such as leisure, health and social
services.</div>

that that proactive role is recognised. The commissioner must not be

encouraging best practice in public bodies and services in
Wales.</div> <a name="0606298000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know
that life expectancy is increasing. Today, and not for the first time
since I was elected, I had the pleasure of sending 100th birthday
greetings to one of my constituents&#151;this time to Mrs. Phillips
from Golwg y Mynydd. We know that needs will increase with life
expectancy and encouraging best practice will involve planning for
that. That is important because we all know that when services are
under pressure best practice is sometimes forgotten. That is why it is
important to have a commissioner looking at services from the point of
the view of older
people.</div><a name="0606298000268"></a>

issues.</div><a name="0606298000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
I remind the Committee that the clause clearly reflects the Welsh

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000453"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b><b class="B"> </b>Clause 2 confers the general functions on
the commissioner and therefore it seemed apposite to return to the
proceedings in the House of Lords and to look at a document sent by
Lord Evans on 21 June 2005 which followed Second Reading on 14 June
2005. That document
reads:</div><a name="0606298000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The UK
Government has made it clear that it does not want to establish a UK
commissioner for elderly people at the present time. There will be a
new powerful UK Cabinet Sub-Committee on Ageing Policy which will be
Chaired by the Secretary of State for the Department of Work and
Pensions. Its remit will be to drive forward the UK ageing strategy as
described in &#147;Opportunity
Age&#148;&#148;.</div><a name="0606298000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the auspices of the general functions, how will the commissioner liaise
with that new powerful UK Cabinet Sub-Committee on Ageing Policy? Who
is on that Sub-Committee? Indeed, is there a Minister for Wales? Who
will chair it? How many times has it met? How is it envisaged that the
commissioner will liaise with it? Obviously, given that such a fuss was
made of it by Lord Evans in the note sent out and in the briefing on
Second Reading in the other place, it must be very important and the
Committee should hear about
it.</div><a name="0606298000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000454"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Clause 2 provides for the commissioner&#146;s
general functions, as hon. Members have said, and will ensure that he
or she has a broad remit to promote and safeguard the interests of
older people in Wales. The general functions will support the
commissioner&#146;s other specific functions set out in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div>Bill. He or she will be able to promote awareness of
the interests of older people in Wales and the need to safeguard those
interests. The commissioner will also be able to promote the provision
of opportunities for, and the elimination of discrimination against,
older people, encourage best practice in the treatment of older people,
and review the adequacy and effectiveness of the laws affecting their
interests. In undertaking those powers, the commissioner may act only
in fields in which the Assembly has functions.</div>
<a name="0606298000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful for the support of
my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) for the Bill,
particularly clause 2. Clearly, as I have indicated, the proportion of
older people in Wales is higher than in England and is set to grow. We
need a commissioner to champion older people, to take forward their
issues&#151;those that concern and directly affect them&#151;to
make representations on their behalf and, where necessary, to carry out
investigations.</div><a name="0606298000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady asked about the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Ageing Policy, which
is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, rather than the Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions. I cannot tell her how many times it has
met, but I will come back to her on that.</div>
<a name="0606298000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000455"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I am very glad to know that an ageing member of
the Cabinet is now chairing its Sub-Committee on Ageing Policy, but I
should like a few more details about it. It was described by the
Minister&#146;s colleague in another place as a new and powerful
Sub-Committee. I would like some evidence of that and to say how the
commissioner will interact with it, because it must be envisaged that
there will be an interface between it and the commissioner. If the
Minister cannot do that now, I should be grateful if he could let me
have the further particulars that I have requested of him in the form
of a letter circulated to all the members of the
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000459"></a>Adam
Price:</b> This amendment and those standing in the name of
the hon. Member for Ceredigion approach the devolution problem from a
different direction. One would not get very far in my party without a
vast reservoir of optimism, so we will try to have the debate once
again. The amendment tries to address the problem in a slightly
different way. Rather than giving the commissioner unconstrained power
to conduct the same kind of review in relation to non-devolved areas,
the amendment and the others in the group name specific bodies that we
want to add to the list of bodies that the commissioner should have a
statutory power to review.</div>
<a name="0606298000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment focuses on the
economic context for many older people. I am not sure how many Marxists
are left in the Labour party, but the economic base is still important.
What can be more important to the welfare of older people than the tax
and benefits system? We can debate the age definition, which is
addressed in a subsequent set of amendments, but there are still some
issues relating to the labour market which affect older
people.</div> <a name="0606298000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
strong argument for affording the commissioner the right to conduct a
formal review of benefits, because such matters will be very much to
the fore for individual older people and their representative
organisations. The issue is addressed in the Welsh Assembly&#146;s
older people&#146;s strategy, which I have commended&#151;I can be
very gracious. It is fantastic to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div>see that Wales has innovated socially, through its comprehensive older
people&#146;s strategy. We might disagree about its implementation,
but we agree with many of the aims that it sets out, one of which is to
combat poverty among older people and to promote a greater uptake of
benefits. The Assembly has made that part of its strategy, but has not
distinguished between devolved and non-devolved
matters.</div><a name="0606298000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commissioner must be able to conduct formal reviews of the way in which
Jobcentre Plus and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs operate in
Wales. We may be able to distinguish issues of policy, but the way in
which their operations are conducted needs to be part of the
commissioner&#146;s purview. That is what the amendment seeks to do,
otherwise the commissioner will have to send a letter or pick up the
telephone every week to make representations because he or she will be
unable to conduct a formal review in relation to any of the matters
that our constituents will want to raise with the commissioner simply
because they are non-devolved. I suggest that for non-devolved agencies
it would be sensible to come up with a different formula that allows
the commissioner to become involved in reviewing their
activities.</div><a name="0606298000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000460"></a>Mark
Williams:</b> There is obviously a great deal of overlap
between amendment No. 22, what the hon. Gentleman said, and amendment
No. 21, which would add the air ambulance in Wales, the ambulance
services and voluntary organisations to the health and social care
organisations that are covered by schedule
2.</div><a name="0606298000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both amendments
would expand the list of bodies and agencies that the commissioner can
review. Amendment No. 21 would add health agencies which are, as the
hon. Gentleman said, topical in light of the review that is being
unexpectedly undertaken. It would also add voluntary organisations,
many of which undertake wonderful work in Wales to provide care and
services for the elderly. Many of the organisations have a hands-on
role&#151;for example, the Women&#146;s Royal Voluntary Service and
the country cars scheme&#151;and it is fitting that they should
receive appropriate scrutiny by the
commissioner.</div><a name="0606298000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 22 revisits ground that we have talked about at length. It would
allow the commissioner to review UK-wide agencies that provide vital
services in Wales and covers pensions, benefits, justice and job
services, which are not currently listed in schedule 2. Broadening the
schedule would give the commissioner an important voice in an important
area.</div><a name="0606298000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
to remember the practicalities. We want to have a real effect on the
lives of people in Wales. It will be confusing for many vulnerable
constituents to draw the dividing line between devolved and
non-devolved matters and those that are reserved. A line in the sand
that dictates the commissioner&#146;s role and remit will not matter
a great deal to the average older person in Wales who has legitimate
concerns and grievances. They want a strong advocate and representative
who can help them with all the major issues they face. If the Bill is
enacted without such amendments, many people will be concerned that
although they have been given someone to champion their causes, he or
she can achieve very little. That is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 36</div>why things as fundamental as pensions and tax credits should be part of
an expanded role for the commissioner beyond the sadly narrow confines
of the existing devolution
settlement.</div><a name="0606298000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000461"></a>Nick

and Dinefwr is always optimistic, but sadly I am going to disappoint
him yet again.</div>
<a name="0606298000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
38 would enable the commissioner to use his clause 3 powers to review
the discharge of functions of bodies operating in non-devolved matters,
including Jobcentre Plus and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs.
The amendment also seeks to enable the commissioner to make a report on
his findings arising from any such review. It is another way of trying
to extend the commissioner&#146;s remit in non-devolved
matters.</div> <a name="0606298000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I stated
when discussing clause 2, non-devolved functions are properly the
responsibility of the UK Government and not of the Assembly. There is
an appropriate route for the commissioner to make representations on
non-devolved issues, and that is via the Assembly. We have discussed it
at length. If the commissioner felt that the activities of Jobcentre
Plus and its administration of welfare benefits, for example, merited
his consideration, he could undertake research and make representations
to the Assembly, as discussed. He could consider those issues. I
appreciate the point that older people are part of the work force. I am
grateful to a number of employers who recognise that positively, and it
is essential that those who can help older people into employment
follow policies to encourage them to stay in or re-enter the work
force.</div>
<a name="0606298000362"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="0606298000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are going
back over ground that we have covered. All I can do is reiterate that
when the commissioner considers certain things to be important, he can
carry out the necessary research and make representations, and they
will go to the relevant department.</div>
<a name="0606298000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
21 would add certain bodies to the list in schedule 2, thereby enabling
the commissioner to review the discharge of their functions. I assure
the hon. Member for Ceredigion that air ambulance services, ambulance
services and trusts in Wales are already covered by the inclusion in
schedules 2 and 3 of:</div>
<a name="0606298000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An NHS trust managing a
hospital or other establishment or facility in
Wales.&#148;</div><a name="0606298000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Operational
control of air ambulance services and the air ambulance service itself
rests with the Welsh Ambulances Service NHS Trust, so that aspect of
the amendment is unnecessary.</div>
<a name="0606298000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that voluntary
organisations are important and particularly relevant to older people.
However, to add voluntary organisations in general to schedule 2 would
significantly alter the scope of the Bill. It would also be at odds
with other commissioner or ombudsman models that focus on the
accountability of bodies and persons who provide statutory services.
The Bill will cover several voluntary organisations that provide
services directly to older people. When a voluntary organisation
provides services such as residential or domiciliary care, it will be
registered under the Care Standards Act 2000. The Bill will capture
those organisations under the definition in clause 26 of a person
providing &#147;Regulated services in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div>Wales&#148;. Consequently, they will be subject to the
commissioner&#146;s powers to review arrangements and issue best
practice guidance. The commissioner might also assist an older person
in making a complaint about or a representation to such
bodies.</div> <a name="0606298000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Voluntary
organisations that provide services on behalf of, or under arrangements
with, a schedule 3 body will also be subject to the
commissioner&#146;s powers to review arrangements and provide
assistance with making a complaint or representation. The
commissioner will also be able to make representations or issue
guidance to the Assembly if he has concerns about the role of voluntary
organisations in respect of older people. The Assembly Government take
the view, which we share, that for the commissioner it is an
appropriate level of involvement with a voluntary sector organisation.
As the amendment suggests, the problem is that introducing that level
of accountability for, and scrutiny of, all voluntary sector services
might discourage the provision of some voluntary services, which is not
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention or that of the Government or the
Assembly.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000465"></a>Mark
Williams:</b><b class="B"> </b>We discussed the issues at length earlier
and I do not want to detain the Committee longer than necessary. We are
revisiting the subject of non-devolved matters and the
commissioner&#146;s capacity to consider those. Under the clause, the
Assembly could amend schedule 2 by adding to the relevant list. I want
to reiterate what I said about the reality on the ground. Research by
my colleagues who spoke on the matter in another place revealed that 80
per cent. of complaints received by Citizens Advice, to cite one of the
relevant organisations, related to pensions and benefits. I fully
anticipate what the Minister will say, but there is one other issue
that I want to touch
on.</div><a name="0606298000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am interested in
what the Minister said about the roles involved, and he has made things
very clear. However, how does he envisage the work of the commissioner
being promoted to the general public, given the limitations of the
commissioner&#146;s role as we see it? How will those limitations be
conveyed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 38</div>practically to the public, to avoid disappointment for a good many
constituents wanting redress on various matters? That is a huge
publicity task for the Minister and the
commissioner.</div><a name="0606298000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000466"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite right: I shall
disappoint him, but at least I am consistent. On his final point, which
did not relate to the amendment, I do not accept that the commissioner
is subject to the limitations that he implies. As I explained in
response to several amendments and clause stand part debates, the
commissioner will be able to take up issues on behalf of people in
Wales, undertake research and make representations. I recognise that
Opposition Members are not satisfied with the process, but he will
still be able to carry out that task effectively. I am certain that the
commissioner will be able to do just what has been done by, for
example, the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales, in establishing
a prominent role in Welsh public life. The hon. Gentleman referred to
Citizens Advice, and I am sure that if people go to citizens advice
bureaux with relevant matters those will be passed on to the
commissioner for investigation, further research or whatever is
appropriate.</div>
<a name="0606298000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
23 provides that the Assembly may add to schedule 2, by order, any body
that has functions in a field that is directly related to Wales. That
could include, potentially, a number of UK-wide bodies operating in
non-devolved fields. We have debated that question and we cannot accept
the amendment. Where the Assembly adds a person to schedule 2, the Bill
requires the Assembly to specify which of the person&#146;s functions
will be &#147;relevant functions&#148; and thus subject to the
commissioner&#146;s remit. Currently, a function can be specified as
a &#147;relevant function&#148; only if it is in a field in which
the Assembly has functions&#151;that is, if it is devolved. The same
applies to amendment No. 24. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0606298000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000467"></a>Mark
Williams:</b> I thank the Minister for his response to the
amendment and to my slightly devious attempt to raise another issue on
the back of it. There is a fault line between some of the Opposition
and the Minister, and there is little that we can do breach that
divide. However, the subject has been fully aired, both in the other
place and here. It is important that it was. On that basis, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000468"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Clause 5 sets out what the commission may do in
determining whether arrangements for advocacy, complaints and
whistleblowing are effective in safeguarding and promoting the
interests of relevant older people in Wales. Subsection (3) provides
that</div> <a name="0606298000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commissioner may also assess the effect on relevant older people in
Wales of a person&#146;s failure to make any such
arrangements.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 39</div><a name="0606298000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to probe the
Minister&#146;s thinking about whether a timeline is envisaged for
the commissioner in assessing the effect of a person&#146;s failure
to make such arrangements. If there are severe failures in advocacy,
complaints or whistleblowing arrangements, the timeliness of an
investigation, report and assessment is critical. I wonder whether the
Minister has anything in his great book of words that would enlighten
us on that, or if it is something that he would prefer to come back to
me on.</div>
<a name="0606298000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000469"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> The hon. Lady makes a good point about
whistleblowing and complaints procedures. Those people who have made a
formal complaint and concluded a complaints procedure but remain
dissatisfied may well go to the commissioner. However, I accept that
there may be occasions when they are going through a complaints or a
whistleblowing process and realise that something is wrong with the
process&#151;for example, because it discriminates against an older
person. I appreciate that the commissioner would want to respond
quickly on that to the relevant authority. I will seek further advice
on that and write to the hon.
Lady.</div><a name="0606298000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000470"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I was looking at
clause 5(7)(c), which refers to where</div>
<a name="0606298000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the health or safety of a person
has been endangered;&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 40</div><a name="0606298000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the Minister is familiar with
the provision. I hope that he can come back to me on that because the
timeliness of a response and of what is carried out is relevant in that
case.</div><a name="0606298000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000471"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> If that was brought to the attention of the
commissioner under clause 7(a), (b), (c), (d), and possibly even (e),
he would immediately alert the relevant authority. If people are at
risk, he would not sit back and carry out research. If it is brought to
his attention that any individual is at risk, he would immediately
alert the relevant authorities, whether it be the police or the local
social services department. In those circumstances, he would react
quickly. However, when we are talking about whistleblowing and the
complaints procedure, there may not be that
urgency.</div><a name="0606298000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606298000472"></a>Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I appreciate that, but there may be an urgency in
a whistleblowing procedure. As far as I can see, there is no statutory
obligation for the commissioner to react in a timely manner. I would
like that to be considered. It is not something that immediately
springs out of the Bill. It should not be left to good judgment
because, sadly, we know that sometimes judgment is not always good. I
shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say after he has
consulted on the time
limits.</div><a name="0606298000322"></a>
