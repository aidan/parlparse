</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The amendments are small but important. Amendment No. 188 deals with the first review of the conclusive maps to be issued under clause. 10. The Bill provides that that review should take place not more than 10 years after the issuing of those maps, and it then provides for a 10-year cycle of reviews. Given the degree of latitude allowed under the Bill, which we have already explored and which will inevitably give rise to uncertainties and ambiguities, and given the opportunity for errors to be made or for the Bill not to work as we had hoped, it would be of great benefit to landowners, those seeking access, the countryside agencies and the Government if the first review were to be rather earlier than 10 years. I suggest that it should be within five years.

<P>
The Bill does not stipulate that the first review should take place after 10 years, but that it should take place after not more than 10 years. When does the Minister expect the first review to take place? If the amendment were to be accepted, it would be after no more than five years. Not only would that give time for the Bill's provisions to be implemented, it would provide an earlier opportunity to check that it was working effectively.

<P>
Amendment No. 189 may be defective in that it refers only to English Nature. I confess that I was stil in devolutionist mode when I drated it; I seem to have disapplied that provision in Wales. Howver, considerations in England are different from those in Wales in that consultation between the various parts of the countryside and conservation interests in Wales is automatic, which is not necessarily the case in England. It should be considered good practice for the Countryside Agency to consult with the conservancy council for England and English Nature, and it would be appropriate to provide for consultation in the Bill. That would make it plain that it is a co-operative venture, and that not only access, recreational and countryside issues need to be considered but that environmental issues, too, must be weighed in the balance. Other legislation is littered with requirements to consult, so there is nothing extraordinary about such provisions. For some reason, however, the Bill fails to identify the bodies that it is appropriate to consult before mapes are drawn up, reviewed and so on. The amendment seeks to fill that lacuna.

<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I should like to speak briefly in favour of amendment No. 188. During a previous sitting, the Committee discussed the difference between the new statutory maps and Ordnance Survey maps, which walkers are most likely to use. It is clearly important that the maps are reviewed and altered regularly to keep pace with changes in land use. The statutory maps will be used by the Ordnance Survey and other bodies in reviewing their published maps, so the more up to date they are, the more practical help they can provide to walkers. It is unlikely that Ordnance Survey maps will be revised on the same time scale as maps of access land, so more rapid review of official maps of access land will increase the opportunity for Ordnance Survey maps to take account of the most up-to-date information on the extent of access land. I am sure that Ministers will agree that such arrangements would have a useful purpose for those who want to take advantage of the access land, which is why the Opposition support the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> The amendments, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), relate to the provision requiring countryside bodies to review maps at least every 10 years. Amendment No. 188 suggests that the first review should occur within five years. I accept that there are some arguments in favour of an initial review of the statutory maps after five years and then 10 years, as proposed in the Bill, and we have given the matter careful consideration. On balance, however, we consider that 10 years is appropriate as we want to promote a period of stability after the access right has taken effect. We do not envisage enough changes in land use to warrant the undertaking of a review within five years.

<P>
We are confident that the careful work that will be put into the initial set of maps will ensure that they provide a solid foundation to the new right for a number of years. If the countryside bodies were required to review the maps after five years, they would be at risk of having to start on the next lot of maps soon after they had finished the first batch. That would produce undesirable uncertainty for users and landowners.

<P>
Clause 10(2) imposes an obligation on the countryside bodies to undertake a review at least every 10 years. However, subsection (1) requires them to conduct a review ``from time to time'', so there is nothing to stop them undertaking a review before 10 years have elapsed if they think that there are good reasons for doing so. Subsection (3) allows the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to initiate an earlier review by making regulations to amend the periods specified in subsection (2). Some of the hon. Gentleman's aims are therefore already catered for.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also proposes that the Countryside Agency should consult English Nature when it carries out the reviews. For clarity, and in response to a point on which the hon. Gentleman touched briefly. I should explain that the Countryside Council for Wales fulfils the functions both of the Countryside Agency and for English Nature in Wales, so the issue does not arise in respect of Wales. With regard to England, the purpose of consultation with English Nature will be to establish whether land should be subject to long-term closures or restrictions. On that basis, I have no doubt that the Countryside Agency will not only consult, but work closely with English Nature in conducting reviews. Clauses 24 and 25 make clear the requirement to have regard to English Nature's view. There is no need for the requirement to be included in clause 10.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): What, if any, procedure will there be if, after the definitive map has been issued by the Countryside Agency, errors are found before the 10-year period is up? Will there be a method of notifying those who are interested of modifications to the plan?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Maps can be objected to when published if there are errors in them. However, as I have made clear, if errors are found after publication, there is nothing to stop a review starting within 10 years. Significant errors in a map would be a good reason for suggesting an earlier review. We should not compel everybody to have a review. We are the party of deregulation; I increasingly think that, in this case at least, the Opposition are the party of over-regulation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am making a serious point. Although an alteration might be minor in terms of the national map, it could be significant to an individual landowner. Will there be a mechanism whereby a modification regarding, for example, the diversion of footpaths, can be lodged with the Countryside Agency so that anyone who is interested can know that the plan is incorrect?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall take advice about that. I repeat again that there is nothing to prevent a review from taking place before 10 years. I understand that there are provisions for the correction of minor errors in the regulations under clause 11. I hope that that meets the hon. Gentleman's point.

<P>
Clauses 24 and 25 make clear the requirement to have regard to English Nature's views. There is no need for such a provision to be included in clause 10. Although the conservation merits of land are not directly relevant to the duties of the countryside bodies to map open country and registered common land under clause 4, English Nature may be able to supply information about the qualities of the land, such as vegetation cover, that will assist the Countryside Agency in classifying land as mountain, moor, heath or down. We would certainly expect the agency to liaise closely with English Nature to ensure that such data are considered in the drawing up of draft maps.

<P>
The amendments are unnecessary and I ask the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome to withdraw them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for at least giving me credit for the arguments under amendment No. 188 which proposes a shorter period. He has rejected those arguments in favour of the flexibility made by other provisions. A review might occur within 10 years if the countryside body so chooses, or if the Government change their mind and introduce different regulations under clause 11. However, that does not add up to a definitive view and I maintain that there is an argument for an earlier review.

<P>
The Under-Secretary talks about stability; however, I find it perverse to consider stability in error. I would not applaud stability in error-there is a thin line between that and obstinacy. Although there are arguments for an earlier review, I do not intend to press the matter today. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reflect on the debate.

<P>
With regard to amendment No. 189 which deals with consultation, I accept that it is very likely that there will be close colaboration between the countryside bodies, the Countryside Agency and English Nature. It is not a matter of regulation but of stating a clear intent. The Bill is deficient in that its wording does not make transparent the consultaiton process. Although I accept that, in practice, there is probably little difference between the Minister's position and my own, I would prefer the wording of the Bill to be more transparent so that everyone may be clear about what is intended and how the process will work. having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 365, in page 6, line 34, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Before making any regulations under this section the Secretary of State or as the case may be the National Asssembly for Wales shall consult with such bodies as appear to them to be respresentative of person who will be affected by sections 4 to 10'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment attempts to make transparent the processes that will apply under clause 11, which allows for regulations to be made to modify, modulate or interpret clauses 4 to 10. We have already discussed the fact that the Bill is light on primary legislaiton and heavy on secondary legislation. Under the clause, virtually all the parameters of the provisions in clauses 4 to 10 could be changed by regulation without anyone being any the wiser until after the event. It is essential that if Ministers, either in the House of Commons or in the National Assembly for Wales, use powers under clause 11 to make supplementary provisions that amend the clauses that we have discussed in detail during the past few sittings, they must have proper, effective and transparent discussions with the people who will be affected by them, whether they are landowners or people with other agricultural, recreational or conservation interests. That is clear common sense, yet it is not provided for in the Bill.

<P>
I suspect that the Minister will say that the amendment is unnecessary because he would always consult before proposing regulations under the clause. I am sure that that is his intention, but there have been so many instances of insufficient consultation on important matters and so many cases in which it has been thought appropriate to include in primary legislation a duty to consult that I do not see why that duty is absent from the clause. It is a simple amendment and simple argument that there should be a duty to consult.

<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): I support the amendment. As I am sure the Minister will appreciate, there is a glaring omission in clause 11, which does not include the minimum safeguards, because there will be no opportunity for debate in the House of Commons or in the other place. The amendment would ensure proper consultation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Once again, we return to the argument about the delicate balance between flexibility and over-prescription. I share the aim of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that, in drawing up any regulations relating to the production of maps, there should be consultation with relevant interests. In particular, we would expect the National Access Forum to be closely involved in such matters. However, to require full consultation with all interested bodies before making any regulations could lead to unnecessary delay. A minor one-off amendment might not require the full consultation that a major set of regulations would merit. It is necessary to retain some flexility. Although we recognise the value and importance of consultation, which we fully expect to take place, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> That was a short contribution. I am not sure that it added to the argument. The Under-Secretary said that it would not be necessary to consult all representatives. Of course it would not. It might not be appropriate. For instance, the Secretary of State would not have to consult every body, irrespective of its interest in the land, in the case of a minor error. However, the principle is clear. There should be consultation before introducing regulations that have the same effect in law as other proposals that we have discussed. I am disappointed with the Under-Secretary's response. He has not taken the issue seriously. The clause is similar to a Henry VIII clause. It allows regulations to amend provisions in clauses 4 to 10 without a duty to consult.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman's amendment would require full consultation on every regulation. That would be going over the top.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> That is the Under-Secretary's interpretation. If the amendment is defective, I look forward to him tabling an alternative on Report to ensure that there is appropriate consultation. If he agrees to do that, I shall happily withdraw the amendment. Perhaps his advice indicates that that would be appropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The advice is that it would be appropriate for the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> No. I intend to press the amendment to a Division.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 366, in page 6, line 40, after ``persons'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, including persons with an interest in the land,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> In the light of the previous abbreviated debate, it may be necessary to explain subsequent amendments in rather greater detail than I had intended.

<P>
Amendment No. 190 would simply lead to the use of the terms that the Government have helpfully provided in the Bill already. They have defined local highway authorities and national park authorities as access authorities, so it seems odd to forgo that term in clause 11. I simply commend it as a tidying up measure, saving at least a few words.

<P>
Amendment No. 366 concerns the more substantive issue of specifying that the consultation that could be provided for by regulations under the clause would include consultation with persons with an interest in the land. Clearly, the unqualified word ``persons'' includes those with an interest in the land, if the Minister or the National Assembly for Wales so determine. However, it should be clear in the Bill so that no one has doubts about it. The people with the most intimate interest in what happens on the land, and who should without a shadow of doubt be consulted, are those who farm or own it. This is an appropriate point at which to state that, reinforcing the Opposition argument, the various interests that are concerned in the process being set up under the Bill are of equal importance, that they should be consulted and that the Minister and the National Assembly for Wales would fail in their duty if they did not carry out such consultation properly and effectively. The amendment would establish a safeguard and improve the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> In case the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is feeling a little unloved after our previous exchange, I shall tell him at the outset that I accept amendment No. 190, which would indeed improve the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 366 would amend the power to make regulations under clause 11. It is intended to enable persons with an interest in the land to be consulted before draft maps are issued. It would not make any substantive change to the power. However, in principle we do not think that a requirement for consultation with all persons with any interest in any land shown on a map will be possible. It would be impracticable as it would impose an unacceptable burden on the mapping authorities and lead to delays. However, everyone, including persons with an interest, will be able to make representations on the draft maps. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> It is nice to have an amendment accepted, even if it is only a drafting amendment. It would be churlish not to recognise that and I thank the Minister.

<P>
As for consultation, I am still not satisfied and will not be until clarity is introduced into the Bill. It is pointless to repeat arguments. I accept that it would be unreasonable to impose a duty on the authority to consult each and every interest. Neverthless, the intention to consult those people who have an interest in the land should be made clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin indicated assent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary confirms that that would be the intention. It is helpful to have that recorded.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Ms Chris McCafferty </B>(Calder Valley): I beg to move amendment No. 363, in page 7, line 11, leave out ``and''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 364, in page 7, line 13, at the end insert `and

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(m) requirements for supply of maps in conclusive form to the Ordnance Survey and to other publishers of maps on which it will be practicable to show access land and the means of access thereto (with the intention that such land and means of access be depicted on maps published by them).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> One of the most frequently made comments made about the manner in which the Bill will be implemented is that the public will have difficulty identifying access land. Indeed, it has been said many times in Committee. The amendment is practical. It seek to rectify that potential problem by placing an obligation on the countryside agencies to supply information that is relevant to Ordnance Survey and commercial map publishers to ensure that conclusive maps are widely available.

<P>
I understand that the Countryside Agency expects to do that as a matter of course. A specific requirement to do so would strengthen the Bill, and it is in the interests of landowners and the public that it should be so. To alleviate the frustration of walkers and landowners, it is important to eliminate confusion from the outset. The Bill's success will depend on its smooth implementation, and I believe that a specific requirement to supply relevant information to map publishers would help to ensure that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I understand and agree with the purpose of my hon. Friend's amendments, but I believe that her aims will be satisfied under the Bill as it stands. We want to ensure that the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales make readily available the statutory maps of open country and registered common land. Clause 9 makes clear that they will have a duty to issue maps of access land in conclusive form, and clause 11(2)(e) provides for regulations to be made specifically governing the manner in which maps, in conclusive form as well as in draft and provisional form, are published and made available for inspection. We expect that Ordnance Survey, and perhaps other publishers, will use the information provided by the Countryside Agency to produce maps showing open country and the access points for the benefit of walkers. My hon. Friend's aims are already met by the Bill, and I therefore ask her to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> With the Under-Secretary's assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 367, in page 7, line 12, leave out ``minor''.

<P>
This is another simple amendment. It is based on the simple argument that errors or omissions should be corrected, irrespective of whether they are minor or major. Some would say that it is even more important for a major error or omission to be corrected by regulation. The removal of the word ``minor'' would quieten those concerned that the provision is merely about drafting errors. If regulations are to be made and the arrangements are not to be set out in primary legislation, the Bill should at least deal with any eventually rather than one that is ill-defined as minor. If the Under-Secretary has found an alternative way of dealing with major omissions or errors that have slipped through the mapping process, I hope that he will draw it to my attention. If he cannot propose such an alternative, will he ensure that regulations will be capable of application to any errors or omissions and make appropriate provision to ensure that the countryside bodies do the job properly?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The amendment would change the power to make regulations under the clause and would allow the countryside bodies to correct not only minor errors or omissions but any errors or omissions.

<P>
However, we intend the statutory maps to have a considerable measure of reliability and stability. Once a map has been issued as a conclusive map, having first been published in draft form and confirmed in provisional form, it should provide a definitive statement of people's rights and obligations for a given period. It should be a document upon which both landowners and walkers can rely. The amendment would allow for the correction of any errors or omissions, however wide ranging and regardless of the impact on third parties. It could also allow a substantial area of land to be added to the map of open country, although that may not be the intention of the hon. member for Somerton and Frome.

<P>
We do not think that it would be appropriate to vest such considerable powers in the countryside bodies without proper procedures being followed. If a serious mistake has been made and a conclusive map has been issued, it will be open to the countryside bodies to review the map according to procedures set out in clause 10. It will also be open to those affected to seek judicial review of the map in the courts. Other than those remedies, we think it right that only minor errors should be dealt with between reviews, according to procedures set out in regulation. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to reconsider the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am sure that I am not the only Committee member not to have been persuaded by the argument that if an error is big enough, one should ignore it, or by the assertion that the infallibility of the process must be protected at all costs, irrespective of whether it has perverse consequences. Those arguments sit ill with the Under-Secretary's assurances that the regulations will be subject to extensive consultation with affected parties, irrespective of whether that is required in the clause.

<P>
If an area of open country should have been mapped but has not been, surely it is right for the error to be corrected. Equally, if an area has been mapped incorrectly, it is surely in everyone's interest for it to be corrected. We should not have to wait for a 10-year review or for the countryside body in question to assess whether the error or omission is minor. Indeed, the clause does not set the word ``minor'' in any context, so we do not know how it will be interpreted. What constitutes a minor error for one person may require a major amendment in the eyes of somebody whose lands or rights have been affected.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> With great respect, opportunities exist to correct mistakes when a map is published, first, in draft form and, secondly, in provisional form. We cannot have continuous argument about what should or should not be on a map. There comes a moment when one must draw a line. That would only be for a period of up to 10 years. The matter can be re-opened if a major error is discovered, as I said. There must be stability in the process and not continuous niggling.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I accept the point in terms of contention but we are considering error. If something is wrong, it should not receive the imprimatur of the official map for 10 years. I accept that the process that leads to the definitive map is extensive and that there are safeguards and checks and balances on the way. I am sure that the chances that an error or omission might get through the process and not be challenged by somebody are minimal. The situation will not happen often but it must be right that there is provision to deal with it if it does arise.

<P>
We have had definitive map processes before. We are not yet considering the rights of way section of the Bill. I am sure that, when we reach it, we will study the history of the production of definitive maps and the pitfalls of that process. There cannot be a more exhaustive or exhausting process than the creation of a rights of way map. Errors and omissions result and are effectively fossilised in law. A right of way near where I live stops at a parish boundary and starts again on the other side of the parish because the parish did not take the steps necessary for the path to be added to definitive maps. Errors occur, even in the most exhaustive process. It seems appropriate that there should be a way of correcting what is an error as opposed to an argument during the process and within the 10-year period.

<P>
The Under-Secretary will not move on the matter-he will retain the word ``minor''-so I should be grateful if he would attempt to interpret the word ``minor'' in the context. He may have examples of what he considers to be a minor error or omission and of what would require a re-opening of the mapping process and a full-scale review. Will the Under-Secretary assist me in any way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome giving way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is soliciting advice.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whether the Under-Secretary wishes to extend advice to a member of the Committee is a matter entirely for him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am always happy to oblige. We like to keep hon. Members happy.

<P>
If land is wrongly mapped and, for example, gardens, parks or even cultivated land appear on a map, it will still be excluded from the right of access. Come a revision, the error will be corrected. If a mistake is sufficiently significant, the revision will be made within 10 years. An element of common sense would be involved. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome should not assume an absolute ill will on the part of those concerned. I do not think that he does assume that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I see no ill-will on the part of anybody; I simply seek clarity. That a map that is wrong and agreed to be wrong might persist is astonishing. To whose benefit is it that an error should be maintained on the map simply because the Under-Secretary does not wish to remove the word ``minor'' from the subsection? The Under-Secretary might wish to ponder the point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 230, in page 7, line 26, after ``omitted'', insert ``to be done''.

<P>
There are three groups of amendments to the clause, and each attempts to obtain clarification and increase fairness. Clauses 12 and 13 were widely welcomed. There was genuine concern about the liabilities of owners and occupiers and some people remain worried about the Bill's practical consequences. Many close observers believe that it does not provide enough clarity or protection for owners and occupiers.

<P>
However, amendment No. 230 is a small technical amendment. It has been tabled in pursuit of clarity and would ensure that the text matches the parallel wording in the Occupiers' Liability Acts. Owners and occupiers are used to dealing with the provisions of those Acts and the parallel wording would reassure them. It would enable them to know the outline of the regime under which they are expected to operate. There is no great issue of principle at stake. The amendment attempts to clarify the Bill so that people know where they stand in relation to their liabilities in the Occupiers' Liability Acts.

<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) explained that the amendment is technical. Its intention is to clarify the effect of clause 12 in relation to liability for things not just done but omitted to be done on land. The last words of subsection (1)-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>things done or omitted on the land-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
have the same purpose as the amendment. However, if there is a scintilla of doubt, we should make our intention absolutely clear. At the onerous cost of lengthening the Bill by three words, and as a gesture of good will, the Government accept the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Government's spirit of generosity is overwhelming. We are only 48 minutes into the sitting and two amendments have been accepted. I am grateful to the Minister. He is right that the amendment will remove an area of doubt. It makes a small but significant improvement.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 388, in page 7, line 36, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) For the purpose of any enactment or rule of law as to the circumstances in which land becomes a ``town or village green'', the use by the public or by any person of a way across land in the exercise of the right conferred by section 2(1) is to be disregarded.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We are on a roll now, Mr. Stevenson. The amendment is in the same mould as the amendment that my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford successfully moved. [
Interruption.] We always pay testament to my hon. Friend's eloquence, not to mention the briefing that he receives, of which we are both short this morning.

<P>
I have no desire to extend the Bill and to pursue the Minister's earlier comment, but amendment No. 388 would clarify the position of village greens. The Country Landowners Association supports the amendment, which would make it clear that the new right of access is not intended to result in further public rights being acquired over access land. It strikes me as odd that the subsection (3) refers only to highways. The amendment uses almost the same wording as subsection (3), but it refers to a town or village green. It seems that, if the rights conferred by clause 2 (1) are to be disregarded in relation to highways, the same should apply to town and village greens.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The sense of euphoria sweeping the Committee should not be taken too far and the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) should not push his luck, but I will do my best for him. Clasue 12(3) already contains a provision to the effect that use of any path in exercise of the right of access cannot support a subsequent claim for the existence of a right of way. Amendment No. 388 would achieve something similar and prevent claims in relation to village greens on access land arising from the exercise of the statutory right.

<P>
Under section 22(1) of the Commons Registration Act 1965, lengthy use of land by the inhabitants of a locality for the purposes of sports and pastimes-generally amounting to at least 20 years-can give rise to a claim that a village green has been established. It is quite possible that the exercise of the statutory right would not be sufficient for that purpose, but it would be sensible to put the matter beyond doubt. Therefore, we intend to consider what more is required and to table an appropriate amendment on Report. There is no difference of view on the matter; we simply want to make it clear beyond peradventure that that is the case.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I could not wish for much more. I have never claimed that every scintilla of every phrase used in my amendments is correct. I am more concerned with the issues, to which the Minister has responded. I look forward with gratitude to the Government tabling an amendemnt on Report. In the meantime, I beg to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No 389, in page 7, line 36, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) Where an owner or occupier of premises suffers financial loss as a result of works undertaken in order to meet obligations imposed on him by the provisions of this Act the access authority in whose area the premises are situated shall pay to that person compensation equal to the financial loss.'.<P>

</UL></FONT>
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I rise with slightly less optimism on this rather more substantive group of amendments, which goes to the heart of one of the principal worries about the Bill-the matter of compensation. To put the amendments in context, I remind the Minister that the measure is retrospective. A set of obligations is being imposed on a group of people, which will cost them money, simply because of their ownership of land-something that began before the measure was thought of. Those people could not have anticipated those obligations when they undertook ownership of the land. I am sure that outside the Committee Room the Minister would agree that such effectively retrospective legislation is almost always bad.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): I raised the point on Second Reading that the head deboners were put out of business without compensation by the previous Government. They could not have anticipated the BSE crisis. Is there a parallel?

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The situation is not parallel. There could have been undesirable public health results from that situation, but our amendments are intended to find a way out of one group's problem fairly and without great public expense.

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> To put it simply, why was it not possible for the previous Government to compensate the head deboners?

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> If we are going to swap parallels, the Government put owners of gun shops out of business in a similar way. They agreed to compensation, but that was dealt with incompetently and was a long time coming. For all I know it may not have arrived in some places. The Government have accepted the principle of the amendments in another area, so I invite them to be consistent.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Another good example is provided by the Government proposal to put fur farmers out of business.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is in order for hon. Members to make points to back up arguments, but I remind the Committee that we are considering an amendment to this Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) and to my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) for allowing me to establish the principle, which is directly relevant to the amendments, that the Government accept that in some circumstances compensation after quasi-retrospective legislation is reasonable. I invite Ministers to accept their principle by accepting the amendments.

<P>
Looking forwards only a few months, the Minister will be aware that the intergovernmental conference will discuss the charter on fundamental human rights, the current draft of which includes a proposal that would eliminate such retrospective legislation without compensation. To the best of my knowledge-the Minister will know better than I-the Government look favourably on the charter. That is another reason why, to be consistent, they should accept the amendments.

<P>
An important general principle that is at stake is whether countryside bodies will financially assist owners of land in making access land safe. That is clearly important both for owners and walkers. All members of the Committee want land that is to be made open under the Bill to be as safe as possible. I therefore invite Ministers to consider how best to achieve that.

<P>
Amendment No. 389 concerns financial loss arising from
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>works undertaken in order to meet obligations<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under the Bill. Significant works will be needed if access is allowed. Even under the reduced form of occupiers' liability, prudent and sensible landowners will try to make access land as safe as possible. That is likely to need work. Labour Members seem to believe that people associated with the land are opulent fat cats, but such works may be beyond the financial capability of some owners or occupiers and compensation from the access authority could be essential to ensure that access is safe. I cannot believe that the Minister thinks that that is unimportant.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 390 deals with the potential depreciation in the value of land as a result of its being designated access land. Does the Minister think that such depreciation is likely? If so, does he believe that landowners should be compensated for it? He may argue that such depreciation is unlikely, in which case we shall have to wait and see. However, I should be interested to hear his views on such depreciation.

<P>
Amendment No. 397 is a consequential amendment. It deals with financial loss resulting from works undertaken. The arguments that I made for amendment No. 389 are relevant. The Minister should accept that the Bill will place new burdens on a group of people-burdens that the vast majority will willingly accept. No one wants accidents to happen on access land, but that burden will cause genuinely onerous problems for some landowners and for a few it may be financially impossible. I look forward to hearing the Minister's views about the extra burden that he is imposing on that group of people, and how best they should be compensated.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I can add a practical example to what my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford said about amendment No. 389 and the cost of works undertaken by landowners to avoid liability under the Bill. The Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, which covers an extensive area in Wiltshire, brought to my notice the Marlborough downs, a large part of which belongs to the trust. That land is open to walkers, and it offers a fine series of walks-probably some of the finest walks in Wiltshire. However, parts of the area are hazardous.

<P>
The downs are high and quite difficult to walk, not least because of the depredations caused to the land by four-wheel-drive vehicles, which are used illegally for much of the year. The trust, being reasonably well off-it may argue that it is not, but it does what it can-tries to ensure that the land is safe. However, large parts of the land that are open to walkers are relatively hazardous. For instance, the trust said that if someone falls off one of the many white horses to be seen in Wiltshire, it is a personal matter, although it goes to great lengths to try to ensure that it does not happen.

<P>
Under the Bill, the trust will be required to do one of two things on that access land. It will have to spend large sums to repair all the tracks, stiles and gates on that very large acreage, or it will have to sell the land. The trust said also-we shall discuss this under clause 13-that it might be advisable to remove things like the duckboards that are laid across bogs, because it may be liable should someone be injured when walking on them. The Wiltshire Wildlife Trust and, doubtless, many like it, could face substantial costs in bringing the land to a standard that walkers could reasonably expect.

<P>
I am confident that the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, which, like the National Trust and similar organisations, has many members, would spend the necessary money. That is not a practical problem. Those bodies will of course do what they can to provide proper access and avoid liability. However, with particular reference to the Marlborough downs, I am concerned about the many small landowners, many of whom are farmers, with land directly adjacent to that of the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust. Walks currently lead off the wildlife trust land onto the small farmers' land. Those people are going bankrupt. They are largely livestock farmers and have no money. They will have exactly the same problem as wildlife trusts, but will be able to do nothing about it. If those farmers are told to repair a track that has been damaged by the illegal depredations of four-wheel-drive vehicles, to repair a slightly rickety gate, or to put a wall back up-not to keep in livestock, but because someone climbing over it could damage himself and make the farmer liable-they will reply that they cannot. They will say that they are going bankrupt and that their only option is to sell the land, which has been devalued by the Bill.

<P>
It seems reasonable that if those people are to be required to make the land available to access by walkers, the funds necessary to do so should be provided. Large sums would not be needed. Perhaps they could be targeted at those who otherwise would not be able to do the work. Perhaps only smaller farmers, and not the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, would benefit. Nevertheless, the Bill will become bad law if it is passed without taking some account of the danger affecting currently well-walked land such as the Marlborough downs, or of the cost of repair. I hope that the Government will consider the amendments closely.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I support the amendments. The clause is an important one and many people, including supporters of access, are concerned about it.

<P>
There is already some precedent for providing assistance in making access safe, and for taking account of depreciation that arises from less intensive farming, with greater access and lower stock numbers. I refer the Minister to the countryside stewardship scheme and the Tir Cymen scheme in Wales, which involve access on the uplands, less intensive farming and assistance to landowners to provide stiles, dry stone walling and limited fencing.

<P>
As to safety, we all know of thousands of farms in the United Kingdom on which there are disused quarries or mines or other hazardous works that fell into disuse a century or more ago. They are dangerous. Locals know about them and avoid them, but people visiting different parts of the country may not. They need to be protected. It would be impracticable-impossible-to fence in those areas. As the hon. Member for North Wiltshire said, smaller farmers are now in extreme financial difficulty, but no farmer would be able to do that because there would be no earthly point in it. The Under-Secretary should take into account the fact that fencing is extremely expensive. We want farmers to be able to comply with the Bill, which should attempt to avoid litigation, fatalities or injuries. Indeed, no hon. Members want people to fall down crumbling tracks or into disused mines. People who live locally know of such dangers and avoid them, but not all visitors to access land will have such knowledge, so I ask the Under-Secretary to think carefully about the matter. Funding should be available for investment that is proven to be necessary to ensure compliance with the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 390 is based on an argument that is recognised in the stewardship and Tir Cymen schemes. I believe that it is a basic human right that devaluation of land by another person without a right of compensation is challengeable at law. Will the Minister consider that point? There are tens of thousands of farmers whose existence is marginal and whose deeds are in the bank. If the Bill devalues their land, there will be wholesale bankruptcies. I hope that I am wrong about that, but even if I am, devaluation of the property of another without compensation must be contrary to the Human Rights Act 1998.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I have some concerns about this matter, and I think that I can fairly anticipate the Under-Secretary's reply. We are indebted to the hon. Member for Pendle for asking him an appropriate question in the House. I refer hon. Members to the Hansard of 17 March 1999, column 670. The Under-Secretary gave a comprehensive reply to the hon. Member for Pendle. He said that there was no contradiction between the clause and the Human Rights Act 1998 and told the House that he did not believe that there was a sufficiently pressing case to suggest that there would be depreciation in value or other associated costs.

<P>
Even if I have correctly anticipated the Under-Secretary's reply, other questions must be addressed. I do not entirely buy the depreciation argument. It would be hard to substantiate the suggestion that access arrangements could cause depreciation in land value. I am much more concerned about the actions that will be required to bring land into conformity with the Bill but which might incur costs for landowners. It is essential that the original statements of Ministers and others that the provisions would not impose costs on landowners are borne out in practice. Such costs may be minimal, although they will sometimes be substantive. As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) said, in the light of the parlous state of the agricultural industry, almost any cost is a significant cost because of the difficulties faced by so many people. We need to ensure that the Bill makes proper provision to deal with such cost. If nothing is changed, I feel that the matter will be headed for the courts whatever we do. It would be far better for the legislature to address it here rather than for it to be decided in a court subsequently and for law to be made by judges rather than by Parliament.

<P>
Will the Minister explain why he has taken a different view in the Bill from that which was taken in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949? That Act provides a perfectly workable way of compensating landowners for genuine loss. That is the crucial point. I do not want to open the door to spurious claims of loss from everybody who fancies getting a handout from central or local government. That is not the experience from the operation of the 1949 Act, where genuine loss must be proved. It is then compensated for in the light of experience. That seems a perfectly sound precedent that could have been followed.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I turn to a supplementary matter regarding amendment No. 389. The amendment puts the onus for providing compensation on access authorities-the highways authorities and national parks authorities. I must make it clear that I am an officer of the Local Government Association. I cannot remember my title but I think that I am a vice-president.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> We all are.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I expect that that is so-the distinction is hardly unique. Those of us who have had any interest in local government tend to be vice-presidents of the association.

<P>
I am concerned that the amendment would put an additional cost on local government. I would like assistance from the Government in properly assessing the cost to local authorities of the Bill as presently drafted, irrespective of the extra compensation. What measures do the Government intend to ensure that local authorities have the wherewithal to make the provision required under the access sections? We will return to the matter in considering other requirements.

<P>
I am genuinely concerned that there is a substantial under-estimate of the resource implications. The Government estimate the costs for central, local government and statutory agencies to be about 2.2 million a year, with one-off costs of 6.4 million. The Country Landowners Association has a very different assessment in the region of 6.5 million to 8 million a year. Clearly, the estimates cannot both be right. They are presumably both based on reasonable premises. It is therefore important that we identify where costs lie and the way in which local government is intended to meet the costs within the current restrictions on available finance.

<P>
Amendment No. 389 would substantially increase the potential payments that would have to be made from local authority budgets. That is not to say that I do not support the amendment-it is important that we tease out from Ministers whether there is any circumstance in which compensation might be paid and, if so, by what mechanism that would be done. We are far from understanding the position. I do not accept, that large sums must be disbursed to make the Bill work, but nor do I accept the argument that the provisions imply no costs to landowners.

<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy has made an important point. He referred to the country stewardship schemes and other assorted schemes that, I hope, will be increasingly available as we change the basic arrangements of the common agriculture policy. He mentioned the ways in which the schemes could enhance the Bill. I ask the Under-Secretary to consider the point. There is a potential mechanism for getting money into farmers' and landowners' hands in return for doing what we would want them to do to make the Bill work better.

<P>
The sooner we act and move away from simple commodity support to providing an environmental, recreational and societal framework the better. This is not the place for a long argument about the CAP, and you would be right, Mr. Stevenson, to pull me up if I discussed it. The mechanism is relevant to the current part and would allow the Government to put right the deficiencies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman sits down, will he make it clear that the Government might prefer to table amendments that allow compensation to be provided through schemes that are the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions? That would be an alternative to using the access authorities which are, as the hon. Gentleman said, local authorities. We would welcome that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> That was a helpful intervention. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ashford for making that clear. A variety of mechanisms could be put in place. The Government are not restricted to one. The Bill is deficient because there is no opportunity to address the problem. There is no merit in blankly saying that the problem, which could be acute, does not exist. It needs to be dealt with in the Bill. The amendments provide one avenue, if not for solving the problem, at least for considering the alternatives.

<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I was minded to table an amendment, but I did not want to appear to be in competition with my hon. Friends on the Front Bench. However, I am delighted to support the excellent amendments and I shall repeat the points that I made on Second Reading.

<P>
North Yorkshire has similar problems to those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire. Landowners are increasingly put upon to use their own resources to make good damage that has been caused. Mrs Blair-no relation to the Prime Minister-has 13 stiles on her property. She has to repair, through her husband's good offices, any damage that is caused over that right of way. All hon. Members, including the Minister, must accept that greater access will increase the amount of damage.

<P>
The money resolution has a glaring omission. It states that compensation will be paid for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any increase attributable to the Act in the sums required by the Secretary of State for making grants to the Countryside Agency or the Nature Conservancy Council for England  any administrative expenses of a Minister of the Crown which are attributable to the Act  any other expenditure of a Minister of the Crown or government department which is attributable to the Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It fails to mention landowners, but their responsibility to provide access will increase their expenditure. Is the Minister minded to support the amendments or will he table an amendment on Report that offers compensation to landowners? We are not talking about a small amount. If a landowner or small farmer cannot afford to pay for repairs, he or she might whip out the fence or stone wall, and that would be regrettable. Does the Minister agree with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that the provisions for writing in the European convention on human rights, which, from the autumn, will allow people to go to a British court instead of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, will increase the number of cases?

<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy spoke eloquently about the countryside stewardship schemes. There is another omission, on which I have consulted the Clerk and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Reading the heads of claim that can be made against the rural development grant, it would seem to be an appropriate fund on which to draw. The bottom line is that provision for compensation must be included in the Bill if we are to avoid conflict between the parties involved.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I was waiting to hear what other hon. Members said about the amendments before deciding whether it was necessary for me to speak. The problem has not been properly encapsulated, although I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford.

<P>
The amendments seem to fall into two categories, one of which is the direct diminution in the value of the property dealt with in amendment No. 390. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that no properties will be devalued as a result of the Bill; some almost certainly will be devalued. Having dealt with properties all my life, one has found that even the existence of footpaths on a property can cause devaluation. If footpaths can cause devaluation, I am absolutely certain that the Bill's provisions can.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In a moment. I know what the hon. Member for Pendle wants to say.

<P>
If the Minister will not accede to amendment No. 390, how will he deal with the problem that property rights will, effectively, have been confiscated, because that will be the position if no compensation is paid? I am sure that eminent lawyers in another place will spend considerable time discussing that aspect of the Bill because it is almost certain that the matter will end up at the European Court of Human Rights. Compensation has been paid under numerous other Acts, for example in relation to statutory undertakers and the purchase of roads that run through properties. If no compensation is to be paid under the Bill for the direct consequences of the diminution of value of property, the legislation will undoubtedly be referred to the European Court of Human Rights.

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Has there been any devaluation of the land in the Tir Cymen or in environmentally sensitive areas where the countryside stewardship scheme applies?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As my hon Friend pointed out, those schemes are entirely voluntary and have a definite end. The landowner receive compensation for entering those schemes, but there is an end date and the landowner can enter other schemes or not, as he likes. Under the Bill, he will have no choice once his property is included on the map, but the value of his property will be diminished and no compensation will be paid. That is a recipe for cases ending up in the European Court of Human Rights.

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Some schemes run for about 20 years. Will the hon. Gentleman answer my question? Is there any evidence that land in the Tir Cymen in Wales has been devalued as a consequence of public access?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As my hon. Friends are whispering all the time, there is a difference between voluntary and compulsory schemes. However, in direct answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, if a property were acquired with such a scheme in place, it is very likely that there would be a diminution in its value. However, the previous landowner would have entered the scheme voluntarily, so the diminution in value would be entirely a matter for him or her.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I do not claim to be an expert in these matters, but I am open to persuasion that there would be some depreciation in value. However, does the hon. Gentleman not agree that there is an element of relativity in land prices? Clearly, in some cases there would be depreciation. If there were two adjoining pieces of land, one of which had a footpath across it and the other did not, one would be relatively less valuable that the other. However, given that we are talking about the generality of land-one cannot buy a mountain that will not fall under the provisions-there is likely to be less depreciation. That is my simple proposition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The hon. Gentleman may well be right, but there will be examples of two similar properties, one of which will fall within the Bill's provisions and the other will not, for any number of reasons-perhaps because it is a hill above 600 m. There is no question that some of those who will be subject to the Bill's provisions will find their properties diminished in value. If no compensation is paid, it will amount to confiscation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Tir Cymen is a voluntary scheme under which farmers of occupiers can put aside parts of their farms-perhaps the non-productive parts-for a given period. That can be distinguished from the scheme proposed in the Bill, which will grant access to the bulk of the farm. As a result, landowners will not be able to keep bulls or rams on that land. The outcome will be considerable change in the nature of the use of that land: ergo, there will be claims for compensation.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> the matter has been dealt with; we have said what we wanted to about amendment
No. 390 and the direct diminution of the value of property.

<P>
Amendment Nos. 389 and 397 cover the indirect and consequential reductions in value that will result from the provisions that will need to be made for people walking across land. As a member of the Environment Select Committee, I visited the Peak District national park. I was delighted to see so many people enjoying the beautiful countryside in the Peak District, just as they enjoy the Cotswolds and elsewhare, but I saw one right of way so eroded by the huge number of walkers that huge stones had to be flown in by helicopter to reinforce it.

<P>
It seems that no compensation will be paid to landowners and other public bodies. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire mentioned the possible cost to the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust. Many landowners, be they public bodies or private individuals, will have to provide substantial facilities for walkers and others. If they are not to be compensated, I believe that the Bill will not work so well. More important-I have echoed this theme throughout our debates-is the greater scope for conflict between walkers and landowners.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will at least say something about those indirect or consequential losses. If facilities have to be provided for walkers, including stiles and gates, it would be better it they were paid for. I do not believe that the Bill deals with that, and I look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I knew that our luck during the Committee's early sittings would not last; we are now back in contention.

<P>
The amendments are important. They are the first to raise the important matter of compensation for landowners. First, however, I shall amplify what I said on Second Reading, and outline some of the thinking behind the Government's position.

<P>
I want to lay to rest some of the misconceptions that still exist about our proposals. Some of those who believe that we should, as a matter of course, provide compensation may not yet understand just how much we have done in the Bill to meet the genuine needs of those who own or manage the land. The Committee has considered in great detail a host of features that were designed to minimise the Bill's impact on landowners and managers. They include the modest nature of the right itself, and the comprehensive restrictions placed upon it. We need to retain a sense of proportion and remember that we are talking only about walking across uncultivated alnd.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I may help the right hon. gentleman by suggesting that, rather than constantly dismissin our arguments because of the right of access applies only to uncultivated land, he uses the example of the Marlborough downs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I knew that I was wrong to give way. I intend to address precisely that point. I listened to the hon. Gentleman carefully, but I am sure that he would wish me to speak about that at the appropriate point.

<P>
We have repeatedly made it clear that that modest right will not interfere with landowners' ability to use and develop land in whatever way they wish. If public access creates land management difficulties, landowners will be able to close their land either as of right for up to 28 days or by applying to the countryside bodies or the national park authorities. The hon. Member for Ashford said that the legislation was retrospective, but I found that puzzling, as the Bill deals exclusively with obligations for the future and not for the past; it is not retrospective legislation.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 389 and 397 would require the relevant access authority-the local highway authority or the national park authority-to pay any owner or occupier the costs of meeting obligations imposed on him by the Bill. That prompts an obvious question: what obligations does the Bill place on owners and occupiers? I hope that I will not cause too much shock by pointing out that, in strictly legal terms, the answer is none. The Bill places not one additional legal obligation on owners or occupiers. Yes, occupiers are required not to do particular things such as putting up misleading notices or blocking specified means of access, but I do not think that anyone would suggest that those requirements are especially onerous burdens. I am not arguing that there are no extra costs, but, in strictly legal terms, the Bill contains no provision specifically to impose such costs.

<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire made a fair point about the land on Malborough down that is owned by the Wildlife Trust. It is unlikely that the access authority will require farmers to carry out extensive construction, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, or to pay building costs to bring the land into compliance with the Bill. However, in some cases farmers may have to pay such costs. As I made clear on Second Reading, we-that is, central Government or local government-will provide extra resources in such cases for the facilitation and management of access. In due course, we will produce our best estimate of what we believe is required.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am pleased to hear the Minister's remarks. Will the Government introduce provision to enable a small farmer who has mine shafts on his or her land and is unable to meet the cost of fencing to comply with the Bill?

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is another issue that I was going to deal with later, but, as the hon. Gentleman has raised it, I shall deal with it now. Obligations apply not under the Bill, but under the Mines and Quarries Acts. We discussed the problem of disused mine shafts during earlier sittings. It is not this Bill that imposes the burden. If landowners have disused mines on their land, they will have a duty to erect a fence or to cap the shaft, principally under the Mines and Quarries Act 1954. I hope that hon. Members will not think it a bad thing if the Bill prompts some landowners to carry out responsibilities that they should already have fulfilled.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Will the Minister comment on another common scenario in north Wales? An open slate quarry could be a half a mile wide and of considerable depth. I know for a fact that existing mines legislation does not cover such sites. What does the Minister have to say about that? Does it mean that the farmer is meant to spend thousands of pounds on fencing whose length might amount to a couple of miles?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The immediate response is to say that slate quarries are not open country. We are concerned with open country. If a slate quarry were sited in what was otherwise open country, and that is unlikely, there is a requirement under existing legislation-although not the Bill-for it to be adequately fenced off to ensure safety. The alternative would be for it to be filled in, but that is hardly practicable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I want to move on from that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I wanted to ask the Minister to clarify one matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I was about to revert from the point made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy to the one about North Wiltshire, which is not too far a geographical hop.

<P>
Several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh), raised the question of resources. We would certainly expect there to be some adjustment to local authority standard spending assessments to take account of the provision. As has been said, there are alternative sources that might have relevance, such as countryside stewardship, increasing agri-environmental measures, the new rural development regulation and the increasing use of modulation in future years. Schemes such as Tir Cymen are also relevant.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way and am pleased by what he says. I am interested to hear him say that there will be an adjustment to the standard spending assessment. I hope that he is right in that, but we also need an adjustment to the total standard spend to enable local authorities to do the job. If he is right to say that there will be a change to the SSA, does that mean that there will be a shift or resource from urban areas to rural areas, which some hon. Members would greatly welcome.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am not saying that specifically. I am saying, as we have always said, that there are costs involved in erecting stiles, providing car parks and way marking. Such relatively small items of expenditure may be involved to ensure that access can be managed properly. We recognise that it is not fair on landowners to expect them to meet these costs. One way or another, the Government will ensure that the costs are met out of the public purse. The costs will be modest but I repeat that this is very different from the question of compensation for access for walkers. I have much left to say and would like to move on quickly to that matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am encouraged by what the Minister says, but I am concerned about the mistake that he seems to be making. He has talked about modest costs and obligations under the Bill. Under clauses 12 and 13, we are not considering obligations such as erecting signposts and so on. We are considering the avoidance of liabilities, which is a different matter. My point about North Wiltshire, which applies across the nation and is not a geographical point, is that owners might be required to take action to avoid liabilities under the Bill. That is different from making car parks, setting up signposts and the other matters that we have discussed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Perhaps I should praise the hon. Gentleman again for anticipating what I was about to say or perhaps I was foolish to have allowed him to intervene.

<P>
The Bill does not add to occupiers' legal obligations. In relation to their liability to those on the land, we would argue that, in some senses, it reduces obligations. I will spell out the reasons in a moment. I have sympathy for the argument that the new right will result in more people being on the land and that occupiers might have to take further steps to ensure the safety of those people. That is exactly the hon. Gentleman's point. Existing legislation requires owners to do that. For example, under the Health and Safety at Work Acts, employers of all descriptions have duties not only towards their employees, but to third parties including members of the general public, to undertake their business in such a way as to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that people are not exposed to health and safety risks.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
In the context of open countryside, I can quote two possible examples of activities in relation to which occupiers might need to take such precautions: one is shooting and the other is bracken spraying, although I am sure that there are others. However, in this case, occupiers need only to notify the countryside bodies or national park authorities that they will use some of their 28 days to close or otherwise restrict access and post notices at any principle access points.

<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman disagreeing with what Lord Whitty said in the House of Lords in March last year when he accepted that there would be an increase in public liabilty premium insurance? Lord Whitty admitted that there would be an increase, although the size of that increase is debatable. Will the Minister also say who will reimburse wildlife trusts, a point raised by Yorkshire Wildlife Trust? I did not raise it earlier because my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire mentioned it, but we have not heard the Minister's response. On the SSA, I am concerned that the local taxpayer will have to pay.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that I responded to the point about wildlife trusts by saying that any extra costs that are strictly required to facilitate and manage access will be met. That applies to wildlife trusts and to private landowners. I repeat that that is our intention, and it would involve relatively small sums of money, but that is not compensation, to which the amendments relate.

<P>
I shall try again to deal with the issue of depreciation, which is important. I refer specifically to amendments Nos. 397 and 390. Amendment No. 397 would require the relevant access authority to pay compensation for depreciation in the value of the land as a result of it being as access land. Compensation would also be payable under the amendment to anyone whose interest in the land was adversely affected. Presumably, that is intended to cover those with separate sporting rights as well as owners and occupiers. The impact of a statutory right of access on land values has been the subject of considerable discussion, argument and study. The use of the word ``confiscation'' by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) is inappropriate, given that the land will remain in private hands to be used or developed in any way that the owner wishes, can be closed and will be subject to the restrictions that have already been mentioned.

<P>
The CLA and other argue that the imposition of the right will result in significant reduction in land values. The Government do not share that view. The capital value of land is determined by a wide variety of factors, including its income-earning potential, the supply and demand for such land and the personal preference of the buyer. The fact that the Bill includes a whole host of measures to safeguard the interests of land management makes it difficult to see why earning potential would be significantly affected. Indeed, there may well be opportunities for increasing income, for example through charging for any facilities that are provided, subject to there being substantial demand for access. That is exactly what the National Trust does, and I see no reason why other landowners should not follow that lead.

<P>
On supply and demand, a study for the CLA assumed that the capital value of land is differentiated in favour of land to which there is no or less public access. I am not sure that I accept such an assumption. One reason for scepticism appears to result from the recent sale of part of Snowdon. The value seems to have been well above market value, in part because of its public access. Leaving such examples aside, the fact that the right will apply to all land of a particular type means that there will be no such differentiation.

<P>
The remaining issue is the personal amenity value of land. Given the limited nature of the right and the provision for closures at the discretion of the landowner, it is difficult to see how an owner's or occupier's active enjoyment of the land could be seriously impaired. I accept that disbenefits to passive enjoyment are harder to quantify, although, unless an area becomes subject to access pressure, they are not expected to be significant. In the few areas that are subject to pressure, the potential for generating income might be expected to offset any such disbenefits.

<P>
It is understandable and predictable that the hon. Gentleman who tabled the amendment should focus on the perceived cost of the new right. Nowever, it is important not to overlook the potential benefits, not just in generation of income, but for some owners, in cost reduction. More enlightened landowners who have tolerated public access on a de facto basis will have a lower level of liabilty to walkers under the new right. For owners of land subject to substantial use, the provision of wardens would be expected to help reduce costs.

<P>

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> About three years ago the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs did some work on Forestry Commission land in Wales. The Committee asked Forest Enterprise if it would allow greater public access, but it said that it could not afford the insurance premiums.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is one opinion. The issue raised by the hon. Member for Vale of York about the likelihood of an increase in premiums is a matter of opinion. I noted what she said about my noble Friend Lord Whitty. She also raised the issue of compatability with the European convention on human rights. In accordance with the normal practice of the past year or two, the front page of the Bill bears the statement that it is compatible with convention rights.

<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I am not accusing the Government of not doing their job in seeing that the Bill is compatible with the human rights provisions. I wanted to know whether the right hon. Gentleman agreed that there would be a flood of claims from landowners because their rights had been infringed. They would be entitled to make such claims. They would not need to go to Strasbourg, but would just bring a simple action before a United Kingdom court.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I entirely accept that. In a free society, everyone should have access to the courts. Landowners are free to pursue what they believe to be their entitlement in legal proceedings. My argument is that the Government have examined the matter in depth and for the reasons that I have exhaustively given and will not repeat ad nauseum, we do not believe-given the limited nature of and constraints upon the right in question, and the continuing opportunities for landowners to develop and use land as they wish, or to close it-that there is a right to general compensation. If others disagree, they are entitled to act accordingly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): It is obviously true that any citizen has the right to take a matter to court, but against which body might such a claim be made?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is for those who bring the case to determine, but I imagine that landowners would take the Government to court on the grounds that they were owed compensation that the Government had refused to provide. The Government would not lightly put themselves in such a position. Our clear legal view is that we are not liable.

<P>
The argument was made about precedent. That is important. We would partly rely on precedent if the matter came to court. It has been suggested that introducing a right of access without compensation is without precedent. That is not correct. The Law of Property Act 1925 contained no provision for compensation when it introduced a much wider and less fettered right of access, including access on horseback. The Bill contains nothing like those restrictions or provision for closures. More recently, the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985 did not provide for compensation and, importantly, did not give rise to arguments about compensation.

<P>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome referred to the 1949 Act, which provides for landowners to make voluntary access agreements and orders over open country, but fewer than 50,000 hectares have been affected. That is one reason why we need the Bill. The compensation in the 1949 Act is for landowners who voluntarily open their land to access. It is different from what is being proposed on an undifferentiated basis across the country.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister relies on the fact that he has received legal advice that no land will diminish in value. We will subsequently discover the truth of that. However, if people are able to lodge a claim for diminution in the value of their property, would not landowners have a good case under the European convention on human rights?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall not be drawn into discussing a hypothetical case that a landowner may bring. I am simply giving the Government's view. We have considered the matter carefully and I shall go no further. If people want to exercise their legal rights, that is a matter for them. I am trying to give a clear and comprehensive idea of why our position is proper, fair and balanced and why there is no right to a generalised form of compensation.

<P>
Finally, we should not lose sight of the wider fiscal context. Many landowners whose land will be subject to the new right of access are in receipt of substantial public subsidies. I shall not give a comprehensive list, but the subsidies include the woodland grant scheme, agricultural property relief, conditional exemption from inheritance tax and agricultural exemption from rating, to the value of 500 million to 750 million a year.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> No, I shall give way in a moment, but I intend to pre-empt the hon. Gentleman's question.

<P>
In addition, there are minor but not unimportant extra benefits in the form of low-duty fuel, road tax exemption and looser planning controls. I am not for one moment suggesting that those compensate for access. I believe that the public support the case for such subsidies, although the benefits are not always-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is perfectly legitimate to refer to precedents for the payment or non-payment of compensation, but I am worried about widening the debate to cover matters such as fuel duty.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am grateful for those remarks, Mr. Stevenson. It is entirely right and proper for us not to stray from the provisions being debated. I did not want to pursue the matter.

<P>
I am not disputing the argument for the provision of relief according to the nature of the case and the form of help that can be provided. I am merely saying that the benefits to the public are not as clear as they could be. Giving people a right to walk over uncultivated land may be seen as a pretty modest benefit in return for a large taxpayers' investment. That general background issue should not be neglected.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> the right hon. Gentleman referred to woodland grants, which are a valuable form of landowners' compensation. Am I right in thinking that such grants are payable only in relation to woodland areas, which are not available for access?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Perhaps uncharacteristically, the hon. Gentleman has failed to understand my point. As I said, tax reliefs are paid specifically for the scheme that they are intended to subsidise. I am not disputing that and I recognise that all such matters are relevant to rural areas. We should be aware, however, that the money is paid by taxpayers in general, 80 per cent. of whom are urban, so it is not unreasonable that they should gain something in return. One such opportunity is the right to walk over uncultivated land. I am talking not about a right to disturb livelihoods or to interfere with the legitmate rights of those who live in the countryside, but about a right to use land in the restrained and controlled way set out in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I have praised the right hon. Gentleman both in the Committee and outside for the way in which our proceedings have been conducted. However, he has now lifted the veil on the Government's true intentions and way of thinking and I am most disappointed by what he has said. Members of Opposition parties can easily cite the millions of pounds' worth of over-regulation being imposed on farmers. The right hon. Gentleman suggested that farmers are paid out of the public purse, but they did not want to be paid. It is a historical fact that they have been tied into receiving subsidies. They would prefer to raise their stock and to sell at an open-market price without subsidy, but they are hemmed in through no fault of their own.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. I must again remind the Committee that we are straying from the matters under discussion. As Chairman, I must be neutral, but I shall be tempted to participate in the debate if we start to discuss the common agricultural policy. Of course, the Committee does not want that, so I ask hon. Members to return to the amendments under consideration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall do so, and resist the temptation to stray into issues raised by the remarks of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy.

<P>
the argument comes down to the balance to be struck between the public interest and private rights. We accept that the Bill interferes with the private property rights of some landowners, albeit in a minimal way. However, that limited interference must be weighed in the balance with the right of millions of people to enjoy extensive areas of open countryside without doing any harm or damage. We believe that a fair balance has been struck in accordance with our obligations under the European convention on human rights without any requirement for compensation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): Will the right hon. Gentleman assure the Committee that his Department will continue to keep an alert watch on reports of damage after the Bill takes effect? Will it also keep in mind liability and liability payments, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York referred? There is no doubt that substantial damage will be caused in many places. The right hon. Gentleman may not dismiss that in a cavalier way, but to dismiss it as if it will not happen would be to put the wrong construction on what may happen.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I was not suggesting that there may not be some damage. We shall have to wait to discover how extensive it might be. However, if eexcessive damager were to occur as a result of overuse, temporary or permanent closure to preserve particular sites would be an obvious option. Again. we have made provision for that. If the damage is the result of criminal activity, the Committee will be united in wishing that those responsible are caught and that they receive an appropriate penalty, which will discourage them and others.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I shall need to read Hansard carefully, but the Minister's statement at the Bill interferes with private property rights will give rise to claims for diminution in the value of property under the European Convention on human rights.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> What I said was was that it interferes with private property rights in a minimal way. It is an extremely modest right. The hon. Gentelman invites me, yet again, to go over that oft-trodden territory. We are talking about the right to walk over open, uncultivated ountryside. It does not prevent he landowner from closing the land for 28 days, or for longer periods if he has the agreement of the relevant countryside body. It enables the landowner to develop and use the land in ways that may be incompatible with access should he chose to do so. All of those rights remain with him. we are talking about a minimalist interference with that right. To deny that right is to go back on the facts. I do not suggest that, but to construe it as a basis for a generalised compensation scheme is to make an unusjustified leap.

<P>
Most reasonable people would agree that the Governement have gone out of their way to avoid placing additional burdens on land managers. Indeed, given the number of restruction splaced on the users of the right, some people may feel that we have gone too far. It is a difficult balance to strike, but we have it about right. Given all the safeguards, restrictions and other measures, including the reduction in occupiers' liability, which we are about to debate, and the provision of wardens, the Government's firm conclusion is that compensation cannot be justified.

<P>
I repeat to the hon. Member for North Wiltshire and other hon. Gentelemen that we shall find the resources to help facilitate and mage access responsibly. We do not believe that landowners should unreasonably be expected to incur those costs. However, it is not right to offer compensation over and above that. For all those reasons, compensation is not needed or warranted, and I ask the hon. Member for Ashford to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his exhaustive analysis. It is an important clause and worthy of our time. He was generous in allowing so many interventions. However, his argument varied between reasonable matters on which reasonable people can disagree and pure Alice in Wonderland. His contentions boiled down to the fact that few obligations are placed on landowners, that the extra obligations will be minimally expensive and that it does not matter because those people already receive loads of subsidy.

<P>
Each of those stages in the Minister's argument was contentious. The third, however, was indefensible. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire said, the Minister mentioned subsidies for woodland, which have nothing to do with the Bill, yet he seemed to ignore all the disadvantages suffered by those who live in rural areas. That was rather like saying that landowners who have children will receive child benefit and that that should somehow compensate for the extra expense. That was not the strongest argument ever used by the Minister, and I hope for his sake that he will not use it again.

<P>
It is clear, not just from what Lord Whitty said, and from what the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy reported Forest Enterprise as saying, that extra expenses will rise. The issue is genuine, not hypothetical. Landowners will have to fulfil a list of obligations. The costs will include undertaking risk assessments, warning of hazards, providing extra fencing, making hazards safe and obtaining additional insurance. Those add up to quantifiable extra expense purely as a result of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Minister skirted round this point, but does my hon. Friend agree that the relevant question is not about obligations, but about what landlowners will need to do to avoid liabilities under the Bill? Land currently open to walkers may be hazardous. For landowners to safeguard themselves against criminal or civil liability, they will be required to make all kinds of alterations to the land and those could be extremely expensive.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I did not want to anticipate debate on clause 13, but he makes a valid point and what he describes would add to expenses, which is relevant to debate on compensation.

<P>
The Minister dismisses too airily the expenses that will be incurred. His argument boils down to saying that, because they would not be great and because the Bill provides for access authorities to meet restricted elements of expense, it is not necessary to care about the rest. He is wrong about that.

<P>
I was fascinated by the Minister's argument that there were only a limited number of extra problems, which could be dealt with by notices at major access points. He is right. Why then, I wonder, did the Government so strongly resist our attempts to encourage better use of access points? Last week he told us that that would be unnecessary, but this week he prays in aid the use of notices at popular access points. We wanted to make that approach an integral part of the Bill, and everything that the Minister said this morning persuaded me that we were right.

<P>
I was also fascinated by the Minister's remarks about mines and quarries. He may correct me, but as I understand it, while there is certainly an obligation to fence off mine shafts, that is no the case with quarries. Previous discussions about eliminating small parcels of land from the mapped open access land seem relevant to this issue. If a de minimis criterion were employed, the vast majority of quarries would be eliminated from the maps of access land. Any possibility of danger would thus be eliminated. I have no desire to reopen the debate about the likelihood of a rash of court cases under the European convention on human rights. I suspect that the Minister has his own legal opinions. I have seen legal opinions that suggest that there will be such cases. The Minister admitted this morning that the Bill in some way infringes proprety rights and I suspect, therefore, that he is laying the Government open to court cases in futre.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): What clause imposes extra legal liabilities on landowners, over and above present statute and common law?

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Clause 13, which we are shortly to debate. I shall not pursue that matter, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will want to contribute to the debate on clause 13 if he disagrees with me.

<P>
We have given the issues surrounding the amendments a good airing. Nothing that I have heard from the Government convinces me in the slightest that the issue of compensation has been properly addressed. I am sure that we will wish to return to the matter at a later stage. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order Nos 68 and 89, that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> You have decided, Mr. Stevenson, that the amendments should be considered together. As has been intimated, the large group follows on clearly from the debate that we have just had on clause 12. I recognise that the Government have sought to respond to the concerns expressed primarily by landowners but also by others about the measure's public liability impact for the owners of land that will be classified as open country and access land.

<P>
I accept that the Minister has, as he has said, reduced in technical terms the potential liability. I have studied carefully what he said on Second Reading. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have ensured that occupiers of access land will benefit from a reduction in liability. Their liability towards walkers will be removed in relation to the natural features of the landscape-in other words, if a walker sprains an ankle or breaks a leg, it will be his responsibility, not the landowner's.-[Official Report, 20 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 724.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I intend to demonstrate that, I am afraid, the Minister took a significant quantum leap in logic. As the Bill is drafted, someone regrettably breaking a leg or spraining an ankle will be the responsibility of the landowner. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have made it abundantly clear that the landowner will not be liable for accidents.-[Official Report, 20 March 2000: Vol. 346,<P>
</UL></FONT>
c. 726-27.]

<P>
The Minister might be right to say that the Government have reduced landowners' liability in a technical legal sense, but in terms of the scale of the issues and the way in which the Bill opens up the potential liability for a greater number of cases, the reverse is true. The Bill's purpose is to encourage far more people to walk not only on linear paths but anywhere in open country. The potential for cases of liability will be massively increased, although the risk of liability might be reduced in law. That is the point that the group of amendments is set to address.

<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> Might hon. Members assume, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman disagrees with the statement made no more than a couple of minutes ago by his colleague, the hon. Member for Ashford, that clause 13 did not seek to reduce liability, as he suggests? According to his colleague, it would increase liability. That cannot be right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I do not know what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Both my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford and I have made the same point. Although, as the Minister has said, the Bill will technically reduce liability, it will expand it in fact.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> But how does clause 13 increase liability?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> If the hon. Gentleman contains himself, I shall come to that. This is a major issue. What constitutes a natural feature is one aspect of it.

<P>
We assume and, indeed, hope that the Bill will increase the number of people who go on to open country, but the risks are much enhanced. People will be able to wander at will instead of using linear paths. Unlike linear paths, a right of access could take people near areas of risk. For example, if people exercise their right of access, there is nothing to stop them climbing over dry stone walls. Although they are not allowed to damage those walls, the landowner risks a claim for liability if they fall off and hurt themselves.

<P>
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors does not speak directly for landowners or anyone else on this issue and has fewer axes to grind than any other organisation. It does, however, have a professional knowledge of what is happening. Page 11 of its document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the public are given a new statutory ``right of access'' to open country, they must accept that the countryside contains hazards and they might cause themselves injury. People who damage themselves while trespassing are less likely to try and sue the estate than people who have a right of access. Suing is increasingly a problem because of the rise of the no win-no fee solicitors who advertise their services widely.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that that risk has not previously been considered.

<P>
The RICS also refers to disease. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the recent award of damages in the Dowling case, where a young boy contracted E. Coli on a farm visit has led to concern over the other diseases such as listeria and toxicplasmosis which causes sheep to abort.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is there an enhanced risk to pregnant women who walk through farmland or on mountains where infected sheep might graze? I believe that there is a real risk. That view is enhanced by the Moorland Association, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Such a limited restriction on liability is inadequate-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that refers to the fact that it becomes an issue of trespass-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>when as a result of the Act access is opened to man made features such as ancient monuments, disused buildings, mineshaft entrances, fences, stiles, walls etc. Any owner will be obliged to insure against risk of injury to walkers involving these so that there will be a significant cost to the owner, and in the case of mineshafts and other items on common land, no ability for the owner to protect himself from such risk.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The other point that the RICS made was about insurance. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There seems to be a perception that insurance costs will not rise but this is based on current use and no insurance company will advise in advance that it will put up its premiums. There is wide concern that the increasingly litigious nature of the public will push up these costs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was behind what the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said about Forest Enterprise.

<P>
The Minister quoted the two examples of shooting and bracken spraying and said that owners would only have to tell the access authority that they wished to close the land for part of their 28-day entitlement. The point is that, under the Bill, more people will be on the land and no one will know where they are. Therefore, there will be a much greater risk of accident as a result of shooting or bracken spraying.

<P>
Amendment No. 391 would remove the common law protection of trespassers for damage to their property while on access land. That common law right has always been regarded by lawyers as an anomaly and should have been repealed, but on most land, damage to property is not generally regarded as a problem. However, it might be a problem on access land in relation to livestock.

<P>
Amendment No. 392 would confer similar protection on landlords and occupiers in respect of damage to ramblers' property.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 394 and 393 would remove liability by removing ramblers from the ambit of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984. The Law Commission removed highways from that Act on the same basis. Rights of way pass over many different types of terrain, and it would place an intolerable burden on owners to require them to allow the passage over their land of anyone who chooses to exercise that right and also to place owners under a duty to keep walkers safe. People who exercise those rights do so not with the permission of the owner of the solum but in the exercise of a right. That was the judgment of Lord Keith in the case of Mcgeown v. Northern Ireland Housing Executive.

<P>
Amendment No. 395 and subsequent amendments address the question of natural features and structures. The term ``natural feature'' used in the Bill is, to the best of my knowledge, novel. Nowhere else in law does the term occur, certainly not in the context of liability. The CLA has made the identical point.

<P>
Amendment No. 395 refers to structures or buildings that were built before 1948, which is before the Town and Country Planning Acts. Amendment No. 396 refers to items on or under the land. I am not advocating that everyone of the amendments should be accepted because they are something of a pick and mix. The issue is how to deal with the very real probability of an increased risk of landlords being sued. Whether there is a technical legal reduction in their liability is somewhat irrelevant; the risk of them being sued is significantly enhanced as a result of the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 232 would remove the word ``natural'', which brings us to the heart of the issue. On Second Reading, several hon. Members asked about the meaning of the term ``natural feature''. The Under-Secretary did not mention it in his winding-up speech, so we have not heard what the Government mean by that phrase.

<P>
Amendment No. 322 attempts to define, precisely although not exclusively, what might be included in the term ``natural features''. What is natural, and how far back in time does something become natural? Is an iron-age fort a natural feature? It is unreal to expect a present-day landowner to be liable for someone who falls off an iron-age fort.
