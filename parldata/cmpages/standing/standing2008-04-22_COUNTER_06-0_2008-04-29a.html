						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000358"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr.
O&#146;Hara. We had a good sitting this morning. We made good
progress in a state of almost complete cordiality. Let us hope we
continue in that
vein.</div>
					<a name="08043011000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with the power to take fingerprints and samples. The
Minister has already made it plain that he considers that the fact that
this was not a power open to officers in respect of control orders was
an omission in the earlier legislation. I accept that. Although I have
serious criticisms of the control order regime I understand why he
would want to be able to take fingerprints and samples of those who are
within it. Where I have a difficulty, and that is expressed in
amendment No. 7 in respect of England and Wales and amendment No. 10 in
respect of Northern Ireland, is in the retention of those samples,
particularly their retention for purposes other than that for which
they were originally
taken.</div>
					<a name="08043011000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two principles
are in play in English law at the moment. Fingerprints are not retained
after the event in the case of people who are not accused of any
offence, but DNA samples are. Many people have been critical of the
fact that, irrespective of whether they have been released without
charge or acquitted in a court, a group of people have had samples
taken that are retained in the database. The rest of us, who have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>happily never been arrested, charged or put before a
court, are not subject to that requirement. We do not have to give
samples. The database therefore is made up of a skewed sample. If it
were skewed simply towards those who had been found guilty of a crime,
I could understand it. I could understand the logic of having a
universal database. What I cannot understand is a database of those who
have been found guilty of a crime and those who have expressly not been
found guilty of a crime but who have their samples
retained.</div>
					<a name="08043011000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08043011000359"></a>
							<b class="B">David
T.C. Davies</b> (Monmouth) (Con): The hon. Gentleman makes a
well-known case that has been explored. While it is possible to get
quite emotional about this and the apparent lack of logic, in reality
the vast majority of people who are arrested are arrested for a good
reason. They may not be convicted of a crime afterwards, but many of
them will have committed crimes and most of them will have associated
in some way with other
criminals.</div>
					<a name="08043011000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000360"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am very worried by that intervention, not least
because I believe the hon. Gentleman holds the office of constable. If
that is the case, he has a profound misunderstanding of the principle
of innocence until found guilty. Consorting with criminals is a rather
archaic offence, but even if one is not found guilty of that before a
court, it is not something that I would immediately use in support of
an argument. Anyway, I shall set that aside as I do not think that it
is typical of the views of the Conservative party on this; it is the
view of the hon. Gentleman to which he is perfectly
entitled.</div>
					<a name="08043011000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
subsections that I suggest could be removed are those that deal with
retention. The clause
states:</div>
					<a name="08043011000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
fingerprints or samples are taken from a person who is subject to a
control order the fingerprints or samples may be retained after they
have fulfilled the purposes for which they were
taken&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08043011000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">and it
goes on to
say&#151;</div>
					<a name="08043011000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but shall
not be used by any person except as described in subsection
(1AB).&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08043011000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that. However, the measure is still a matter of some concern,
because control orders, whether or not they are a good way of dealing
with a particular problem, are exceptional as a class of punishment.
They are a punishment without findings of guilt; punishment on
suspicion, effectively. They are a way of ensuring that people are not
a danger as a pre-emptive measure rather than post-charge and
post-finding of guilt.</div>
					<a name="08043011000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, to retain
fingerprints and samples from such a person, against whom no charges
have been put and against whom no case has been proven, seems to be at
the very least dubious, and to do so after these samples have fulfilled
the purposes for which they were taken is dubious in the extreme. So, I
suggest that we need to take great care to examine whether this measure
is proportionate and appropriate, and also to examine the value that it
will have. It may be that the Minister can persuade me that there are
circumstances in which this measure will be of enormous value and that
it is right for these subsections to be included in the Bill, but I am
not yet convinced of that case.</div>
					<a name="08043011000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08043011000361"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): Both this set of
amendments and the next set, which stands in my name, touch on exactly
the same issue, which has been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>rightly highlighted by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. Although
they both suggest a slightly different way of approaching the matter,
and I shall come on to my amendments at the right time, nevertheless
their main thrust is essentially
identical.</div>
					<a name="08043011000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is no
secret that, on a number of occasions, I have expressed my growing
concern at the departure from the normal rule, which used to prevail
until the middle of the 1990s, that only the DNA and fingerprints of a
convicted person were retained and placed on the national
database.</div>
					<a name="08043011000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000362"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I think that the amendments of the hon. and learned
Gentleman are grouped in the same group, unless I am reading from a
completely wrong selection paper. So he is perfectly in order to speak
to his own
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08043011000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000363"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I apologise and I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman, because I was looking one grouping further down and I
thought that the groupings were separate. I am grateful to him for
bringing that to my attention. Indeed, it makes absolute logical sense
that they should be so grouped, because they are, as I said a moment
ago, very similar.</div>
					<a name="08043011000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just to go
back to where I was starting, I am on record as having previously
expressed my concern about the departure from the principle of
retaining DNA evidence only from convicted prisoners. In fairness, the
first departure from that principle happened under a Conservative
Government, when the decision was taken that the DNA&#151;in so far
as knowledge of DNA existed at that time, because such knowledge was
just beginning to emerge&#151;and fingerprints of individuals who had
been acquitted of a crime should be retained. The present Government
then expanded that to the retention of DNA and fingerprints taken from
those people who were arrested.</div>
					<a name="08043011000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I simply make
the point to the Minister that I receive a regular stream of letters
from individual constituents complaining about such retention of DNA
and asking me to make representations to chief constables. In one case,
it was a septuagenarian carer who had never been in trouble with the
law before. She found that, as a result of a completely misplaced
accusation from the woman she was caring for who had almost certainly
gone senile, she was arrested, her DNA and fingerprints were taken and
it was only about 10 days later that she was entirely exonerated of
having allegedly taken money from the bank account of the woman she was
caring for. She felt very badly about the retention of her DNA and
fingerprints on a national
database.</div>
					<a name="08043011000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there has
been a growing chorus of disapproval. At some point, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, because I do not want to go down a byway in this debate,
this issue will have to be revisited by Parliament, because it is
deeply and profoundly
unsatisfactory.</div>
					<a name="08043011000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must consider today the much narrower, but clearly linked, issues of
whether we should have the right to take DNA fingerprints from
individuals who are subject to a control order and whether we should
subsequently be able to retain them. Although the first of those
worries me as a development, I have no doubt that taking DNA and
fingerprints from a person subject to a control order is justified. I
say that with a certain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>amount of hesitation, but it seems to me that it should be done for
compelling reasons of proportionality. The principal one is that the
enforcement of a control order may require the taking of DNA and
fingerprints, particularly if an order is breached. That in
itself  justifies doing it.</div>
					<a name="08043011000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">More worrying from my point of
view is the question whether the making of a control order is simply
being used as an excuse to obtain DNA and fingerprints for wider
investigative purposes. It would be useful if the Minister told the
Committee whether there has been a single instance of a control order
being made on a person who has never been arrested. Something suggests
to me that that is rather unlikely to arise, and it would be useful for
the Committee to know whether it has ever happened. I can see that it
is perfectly possible, at least in theory, for a control order to be
made on a person who has never been subjected to arrest, and for the
entire control order procedure to take place without DNA and
fingerprints having first been obtained by the
police.</div>
					<a name="08043011000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question is whether that material should be retained on the national
database. The Government have chosen to expand the category of people
from whom they can obtain DNA and fingerprints, and I have the gravest
reservations about such retention in the case of a person who has never
been arrested, charged or even acquitted of an offence, and certainly
never convicted. If the Government wish to obtain DNA and fingerprints,
the only possible rational justification must be that it is required
directly for the enforcement of a control order. I might add
incidentally that taking such material will inevitably give the
Government and the police the opportunity to check whether the person
concerned has been involved in any criminal activity that they wish to
impute to them. It is inherently unlikely in most cases that the
individual concerned will not have been arrested for something before
the control order was made. That is why that is an important piece of
information for the Committee to
have.</div>
					<a name="08043011000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 60 and 61 are intended not to delete proposed new subsection (1AA)
entirely but to provide for a six-month period from the date when the
control order comes to an end, after which the material would have to
be destroyed and removed from the records. The Scottish system, which I
think now operates a two-year period of retention when individuals have
been arrested but not charged, seems to have considerable sense. I
think that it applies also to individuals who have been acquitted. It
provides for a period of retention in case something turns up that
means that the material needs to be used, but gives a sense of
reassurance that there will come a point when the material is
removed.</div>
					<a name="08043011000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is something of a philosophical issue. I feel strongly, and it is my
party&#146;s position, as the shadow Home Secretary has repeated on a
number of occasions, that the system that we are creating, of finding
opportunities to take DNA and fingerprints from individuals who have
not been convicted of offences, is untenable. The clause might even be
overturned if the decision of the European Court of Human Rights goes
against the Government on that point. It might be possible to sustain
it along the lines suggested in the amendments, but it would certainly
not be possible to sustain it along the lines of the
Government&#146;s proposals to keep the material in question
indefinitely.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>
					<a name="08043011000321"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08043011000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, I find myself extremely troubled by the proposal, and the
Minister will have to provide some compelling arguments to explain why
we have to add to the already long list of groups that have to supply
DNA and fingerprints. As the Minister knows, the alternative route that
is floated from time to time is that all of us in this country should
provide our DNA and fingerprints to the authorities. Perhaps it could
be some form of civic celebration that takes place at the age of
11&#151;the age of criminal responsibility. Or, as Lord Justice
Sedley suggested, every single visitor to this country&#151;even from
the European Union&#151;should be welcomed on their arrival at
Heathrow airport with a visitor&#146;s visa and a requirement to
provide DNA and fingerprints. That proposal at least has intellectually
more sense than what we are doing at the moment. While I am not against
the idea that we should make an exception for obtaining this material
for the sake of enforcing control orders, I am deeply troubled by the
suggestion that we should retain it for long-term purposes, having
obtained it under another sleight of hand, which is being introduced
for that purpose. I hope that the Minister can provide some rational
justifications because at the moment I fail to see
them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000364"></a>The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Tony McNulty):
						</b> Welcome back to our
deliberations, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I understand the thrust of
what has been said, but I think that much of it is misplaced and,
rather like the last set of amendments, belongs to the wider national
debate. For better or worse, the national DNA database is controlled
and governed under regulation by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984. The points that the hon. Gentlemen make about the retention of
DNA samples on that database more properly belong in a debate about the
existence of the national DNA database in the first place. When he
appeared before the Home Affairs Committee, the right hon. Member for
Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)
said:</div>
					<a name="08043011000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am
comfortable with the terrorism issue but I do think we need to review
our whole approach to DNA retention, particularly of people who are
exonerated, who are not charged, and certainly not convicted. So I am
comfortable with using it in this context and having proper transfer
arrangements in this context, but I think we have got to come back to
the whole DNA issue on criminal law anyway at some
point.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043011000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concur with
that although I might not agree with the outcome. I agree with Chief
Constable Tony Lake&#151;until recently, he was the Association of
Chief Police Officers&#146; lead on forensics including
DNA&#151;that there needs to be a thorough review of the statutory
architecture, including PACE, that governs the retention of DNA
samples. I am very happy to have that
debate.</div>
					<a name="08043011000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I chuckled a
wee bit when the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield referred to
Lord Justice Sedley because I rather foolishly said on the
&#147;Today&#148; programme&#151;I thought that I was having a
proper conversation rather than a Punch and Judy show with John
Humphrys&#151;that I had some sympathy with the logic of the case.
Five days later, that was written up as, &#147;The Government have
sympathy with a universal database.&#148; I never said that; I said
that I had sympathy with the logic of the case. Given its intellectual
logic, one would be a fool not to. Having looked at the matter 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>in the wider criminal sense&#151;I will return to
the amendments in a moment&#151;I am comfortable that we have it
about right, if we start from the philosophical assumption that the DNA
database is not a rogues gallery, a list of the guilty and
convicted&#151;it patently is not that&#151;or a list of those who,
but for a bit of luck, are probably criminals anyway, which is along
the lines of the point made by the hon. Member for Monmouth. Again,
that is a perfectly fair point, but not one with which I would
necessarily agree.</div>
					<a name="08043011000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been consultation and
a proposal to extend the existing criteria for the national DNA
database to non-recordable offences. At the moment it covers only
recordable offences, whether the person is finally convicted or not. We
shall probably resist that, not least for the reasons suggested by
others, and we believe that it is about right now. This is not the
place to go through the litany&#151;it is a huge list&#151;of cold
cases and serious cases that were cracked in the first instance because
a DNA sample was on the national database, often for entirely erroneous
reasons. I am talking about serious murders, serious assaults, serious
robberies, rape and a range of other
cases.</div>

to stray too far from the point, but it is clear that Stephen Wright in
Ipswich would not have been caught bang to rights were it not for a DNA
sample on the database. It was not the only evidence against him, but
it pointed to his guilt, and it arose either because of a minor theft
of a car or a minor assault or affray&#151;I cannot remember which,
because I confuse it with the Croydon

Minister, because I was a member of the Home Affairs Committee when the

convicted as a result of DNA collected following his arrest for a bar
fight. However, does the Minister accept that Liberty&#151;I am sure
that it will be prayed in aid when we discuss other matters relating to
the Bill&#151;has argued that DNA should be collected only from
convicted sex offenders? In that case, Steve Wright would not have been

that the national DNA database, including the elements that we are
considering in the clause and amendments, is an investigatory and
inquisitorial tool. It is not about a criminal record. It is not about
a list of criminals. For the sake of public safety, given the
police&#146;s 14,000-plus hits annually&#151;I cannot remember the
exact number&#151;and the 35,000-plus crimes that have been solved
because someone is on that database, on that precautionary principle

that that debate is serious, but it is a debate for the wider PACE

with reservations agrees&#151;I do not want to put words into his
mouth save for those lifted from the Select Committee&#151;with what
we are trying to do in relation to controlees, but recognises that

							<a name="08043011000373"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I do not disagree with my right hon. Friend the
Member for Haltemprice and Howden. I made it clear to the Minister that
the logic of being able to take DNA and fingerprint material from
somebody subject to a control order, for the purposes of its
enforcement, seemed to be overwhelming. I do not believe that that
would be successfully challenged in the European Court of Human Rights
anyway. That said, the question, which cannot be divorced from the
wider issue, about the accretional way in which we are building up the
national database in which that will be an additional element, should
be of concern to the Committee, because we do not have a strategy for
that. Therefore the answer to the question of how many people that
would cover at present is rather important. I worry that the way in
which we are building up that database is undermining civil liberties.
There can be no doubt about that. If it were not, the arguments that
Mr. Lake put forward about how unfair it might be to those
of 11 and 12 would be invalid. So we cannot escape the fact that there
is an ethical
issue.</div>

							<a name="08043011000374"></a>Mr.

						</b> With the greatest respect, nor am I trying to. I
am just saying that the substantive parliamentary debate about those
ethical issues belongs elsewhere. I was going to say that I would
continue on the amendments, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>but perhaps, following your admonishments, Mr. O&#146;Hara,
I should start on the amendments, because that is an important point.
At the moment&#151;I will not go into details for obvious
reasons&#151;the number is about 13 or 14. That is relatively low; at
its peak it has only ever been about 18. If the ethics are wrong, one
is too much, so I am not suggesting at all that because 13 or 14 are so
few it does not matter terribly
much.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000375"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> But how many of those 13 or 14 have never been
arrested? I suspect&#151;from reading the newspapers, but the
Minister will be able to correct me&#151;that the overwhelming
majority of those have been arrested at some point in the course of
police investigations, prior to a control order being sought against
them.</div>
					<a name="08043011000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000376"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> With respect, I do not think that that is right,
but I am sure that people who do not exist in the room will tell me in
a moment. This note is probably not the answer, because it never works
like that in my experience in Committee. I will come back to that. I do
not think that that is right because, by definition, many of the
controlees will be people about whom we have significant intelligence
but on whom we have insufficient evidence, even in the first instance.
So it does not absolutely follow that they would have been of interest
to the police and arrested at previous stages. We will see if the
information is available, and if I stand corrected I shall tell the
Committee so.</div>
					<a name="08043011000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hesitated over 13 or 14 because there are a range of factors&#151;let
me say no more than that&#151;that may mean that that number
fluctuates. Hopefully the Committee will indulge me and appreciate that
I cannot say any more than that. Either way, globally at any given
time, that will impact on say 10 to 20 people. I do not say that to
diminish the ethical or civil liberties dimensions but just as a matter
of fact. The purpose of the clauses is to put the power routinely to
take fingerprints and non-intimate samples of controlled individuals on
an equivalent basis to existing police powers in relation to
fingerprints and non-intimate samples taken after arrest in the
relevant jurisdictions. Rather like our debate on the previous set of
amendments, that simply reflects the existing jurisdictions that we are
trying to match in those instances, and no more than that. Current
procedures in England, Wales and Northern Ireland allow the retention,
with defined exceptions, of fingerprints and non-intimate samples after
they have fulfilled the purposes for which they were taken, when
individuals are arrested under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act or
the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order. The
corresponding provisions in schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000, which
apply in all home countries&#146; jurisdictions, also allow for the
retention of fingerprints and non-intimate samples after they have
fulfilled the purposes for which they were
taken.</div>
				
					<a name="08043011000322"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08043011000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is germane
to add that the term &#147;fingerprints&#148; is clearly
self-defining, although it also includes palm prints. Furthermore,
&#147;non-intimate sample&#148; means a sample of hair, other
than&#151;clearly&#151;pubic hair; a sample taken from, or from
under, a nail; a swab taken from any part of a person&#146;s body,
including the mouth, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>but not any other bodily orifice; saliva, or a footprint or similar
impression of any part of a person&#146;s body other than a part or
the whole of a hand. To make it very clear what we are discussing,
those are the definitions of fingerprints and non-intimate samples
under
PACE.</div>
					<a name="08043011000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not believe that fingerprints or non-intimate samples taken from
controlled individuals should be subject to different rules for
retention, whether by deleting subsections relating to their retention
or by specifying the destruction of the fingerprints or samples six
months after the control order for the individual concerned has ceased
to have effect, which, broadly speaking, is what the amendments would
do. We oppose the amendments&#151;I have saved that until now. Rather
than tease the Committee, my speaking note says right upfront,
&#147;The Government are not in favour of the amendments.&#148;
However, I like to work up to that point, rather than introduce our
position at the
beginning.</div>
					<a name="08043011000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
we consider it appropriate that fingerprints and samples of controlled
individuals be retained on the same basis as samples taken from other
individuals under PACE, PACE (Northern Ireland) or the Terrorism Act,
because controlled persons are, by definition, suspected terrorists. I
understand the point about definition that the hon. and learned
Gentleman made about charge or no charge. It was a reasonable point,
but I do not necessarily agree with how he built on it.</div>
					<a name="08043011000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, and relatedly, the
same safeguards and provisions apply as for other fingerprints or
samples taken under PACE, PACE (Northern Ireland) or the 2000 Act. For
example, samples may be used for specific purposes only. Thirdly, and
again on a related point, we do not think it appropriate to debate the
wider issue of the retention of fingerprints or samples under PACE or
the 2000 Act in the narrow context of controlees.</div>
					<a name="08043011000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly, and
on a practical level, the retention of fingerprints or samples might
help the police and agencies with future criminal or terrorist
activities and investigations. By retaining controlled
individuals&#146; biometrics, we strengthen the ability of the police
to prevent, detect and investigate such crime and terrorism and to
increase the chance of the individuals responsible being prosecuted.
The powers might also help to get suspected terrorists off control
orders and down the Government&#146;s, and everybody else&#146;s,
preferred route towards prosecution. Finally, to demand the destruction
of fingerprints or samples of controlled individuals could also cause
unnecessary practical difficulties and confusion because it will run
counter to all existing procedures. I argue that the Committee should
not accept the amendment for those
reasons.</div>
					<a name="08043011000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000377"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I confess that my mind started to boggle slightly
when the Minister said that it would cause difficulty because it is
contrary to all current procedures. At the moment, I am making
successful representations, in a number of cases, to my chief
constable, asking her to do just that. He has made some good points,
but that perhaps is not the best
one.</div>
					<a name="08043011000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000378"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> My mind also boggled a little when I read it out.
I, too, think that it was the weakest of the points. Under existing
PACE laws, chief constables 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>have the discretion to which the hon. and learned
Gentleman alluded. Pending the European Court of Human Rights judgment
that we are appealing, that is the only significant means of removing
samples from the database, and that is perfectly in order.</div>
					<a name="08043011000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">My argument is that the
amendments would run counter to current procedures for the specific set
of individuals being debated. I contend very strongly that those
individuals, on all balance and proportionality, should be on, and stay
on, the DNA database once we have obtained those samples. I have made
my reasons for that clear: national security and the ability to assist
in subsequent terrorist cases. We must strike that
balance&#151;although I concede that that wording is a bit flabby.
The PACE review is looking, as part of that wider national debate,
precisely at what sort of discretion the chief constable should have
and what criteria should be utilised, but I do not want to address that
point again now.</div>
					<a name="08043011000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having agreed
on balance that it is perfectly justified and proportionate to take the
samples in the first place, given the nature of the individuals
concerned, it would be illogical to apply a different set of rules to
the retention of those samples for the purposes of the Bill, rather
than look at the issue and others, whatever the philosophy, in the
wider context of a debate about
PACE.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000379"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> If we still had the old system that was used in
the early 1990s, whereby all DNA and fingerprints were destroyed if a
person was acquitted, and if the Government came to the Committee and
asked for a single exception to be made in the case of control orders,
I would not necessarily be unsympathetic to such a request. I remain
concerned, however, as I think the Minister understands, at the way in
which we are increasing how we capture DNA, without having a rational
debate about
it.</div>
					<a name="08043011000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000380"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I have partly indicated that I broadly concur
with that, but in the context of the Bill and for the purposes outlined
in these clauses, my balanced judgment perhaps goes the other way to
that of the hon. and learned Gentleman, although I am not even sure in
which direction he would go, given his contributions. I do not think
that there is much between us. During the John Humphrys interview to
which I have referred, I did say&#151;when I could get a word in
edgeways&#151;that it was perfectly reasonable to have a substantive
debate on issues relating to retention and on all the other matters
that Tony Lake and others have referred to in the PACE review, but that
is for another time.</div>
					<a name="08043011000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are where we are, by
accretion or otherwise. I am saying that controlled individuals are
such a particular group that, in the interests of our fight against
terrorism, we should not only take samples, but retain them. We should
certainly retain them on the basis of the existing laws that prevail
for everyone else with regard to the DNA database. Whether that should
change is a matter for another national debate. When we have that
debate, I will argue strongly, in relation to the retention of samples
from people who are not convicted, that samples should not only be
taken from those individuals, but be retained for as long as utterly
possible in the interests of national security. That is why I ask, on
balance, that both groups of amendments be
resisted.</div>

ways&#151;he objected when I called him
&#147;learned&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08043011000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful for the contributions, but a few points need to be made
about the debate in which we have just enjoined. I accept from the
Minister that it is consistent with the control order regime for this
power to exist. I do not accept the control order regime as it is
constructed, and he knows that I do not think that it is working well
and see it very much as an exceptional circumstance. However, while the
present regime is there, the power to take samples from those
individuals is consistent with
it.</div>
					<a name="08043011000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is
right to say that retention is a wider issue than can be addressed by
the narrow confines of the amendments and, indeed, the clause before us
today. I sympathise with his problems with the &#147;Today&#148;
programme and with having to explain the logic of a universal database:
I have used exactly the same words before and been shot down in flames
by those who have misunderstood me and thought that I was advocating a
universal database when all that I had said was that it is more logical
than the current situation. It has an internal logic that the present
situation does not.</div>
					<a name="08043011000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not quite so happy with the view that the partial
database&#151;including, as we have debated this afternoon, not only
those who have been found guilty of a range of offences, but those who
have been arrested but freed without charge or those who have been
charged and found not guilty&#151;is entirely the innocent
investigatory tool that it has been suggested it is. It is a
wonderfully powerful investigatory tool and I would not want to deny
the police the opportunity of using it to investigate crimes
properly.</div>
					<a name="08043011000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
remember if certain Members were on the Bill Committee when we
introduced the DNA sample regime a few years ago; I am pretty sure that
I was, because I seem always to be on such Committees. We Liberal
Democrats did not argue against the principle of a DNA database. We
said that, to make it effective, either people who are innocent of any
crime should not be on it or everybody should be on it. The problem
with a partial database is that, even with the increased sophistication
of DNA testing and comparing, there are false positives. People are
more likely to come circumstantially under suspicion as a result of
being on the database than if they are not on it. Whereas it can be
argued that that is a price that someone has to pay for having been
convicted of a crime, it is hard to sustain the view&#151;other than
by the hon. Member for Monmouth, who feels that someone who looks
shifty ought to be on the database&#151;that somebody who is innocent
of a crime ought to have that risk attached, in addition to the fact
that for every set of DNA characteristics there are probably six, seven
or eight people in this country who are sufficiently close to provide a
false match. Many Members have always been concerned about
that.</div>
					<a name="08043011000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
says that this is not the time or place to have this argument and I
agree. He is right to say that. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>But the trouble is that this is our only opportunity to stop that
accretion&#151;as the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield called
it&#151;of further DNA samples on to the database of people who have
not been charged with, and have certainly not been found guilty of, any
crime. This is our only opportunity to argue the case and suggest that
this fundamental issue needs to be
addressed.</div>
					<a name="08043011000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could be
argued that there is likely to be&#151;we cannot say that there will
definitely or even probably will be&#151;a higher level of
culpability in respect of someone against whom sufficient intelligence
evidence has been put together to ensure that a control order has been
secured. In such a case, there is likely, perhaps, to be a higher level
of culpability than in respect of someone against whom no charge has
been preferred and who has simply been picked up by the police and
released without charge. That is a proper inference to draw from the
circumstances. If any group is the first to be removed from the
database, it should not be the controlees, but should be those who are
released without charge because they have not committed any crime and
against whom the police have no evidence on which to charge
them.</div>
					<a name="08043011000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to use
opportunities such as this in Committee to rehearse these arguments,
even if they will return time and again. I welcome what the Minister
said about the need for a wider review of this matter. It is essential
that we do that. However, I do not share his phlegmatic assertion that
the present situation, with the inclusion of these samples, is where we
ought to be. I have deep concerns about that. However, we are right to
raise the
issue.</div>

							<a name="08043011000384"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I just want to take the opportunity to tease from
the Minister the different regime that will apply in Scotland. As I
understand it, while it would be possible for a retained DNA sample
taken in such circumstances to be used for the purposes of terrorist 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>investigation or in the interests of national security, a different
limit will apply there from that which applies in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm
that. I simply make the point that the fact that the Minister has had
to accept a different regime in Scotland highlights differences, which
it is not suggested are about to bring the world to an end,
notwithstanding the fact that the Minister has to accept different
Scottish legal principles.</div>

							<a name="08043011000385"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> In filling the omission in relation to the
control order regime, the thrust of clause 11 is to get matters on a
par with the jurisdiction within which they sit. An important point has
been overlooked, certainly in the amendments to clause 10, some of
which were also relevant to clause 12, but not to  clause 11.
Samples secured in Scotland under the Terrorism Act 2000 are not
destroyed, as someone suggested earlier&#151;in the normal context,
under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, they are. We simply
seek to reflect that dimension in terms of Scottish jurisprudence,
which, as everyone knows, long outdates any notion of devolution. The
system has been significantly different for a considerable period of
time, and it is right and proper that we reflect
that.</div>
					<a name="08043011000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Committee
will know, terrorism and security matters are not devolved. Routine
criminal law has clearly been long devolved in Scotland and we simply
seek to reflect that position. That is not to say that the Scottish
Executive cannot see the potential merits of the wider powers set out
in clauses 10 and 12 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but it is
quite properly for them to examine whether and how best to incorporate
the devolved elements of those provisions into existing Scottish
law.</div>
					<a name="08043011000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
might know that the Scottish Executive has undertaken a review of other
aspects of DNA and fingerprint powers. Scottish police powers on the
use, storage and retention of fingerprints and non-intimate samples for
individuals subject to control orders could be brought into line with
those for the rest of the UK at the same time as any other legislative
changes resulting from that review. I cannot remember whether it is
confirmed, but some time in the immediate future I shall meet the
Scottish Justice Minister to discuss that and a range of other matters.
In seeking to fill the omission in clauses 10 and 12, clause 11
perfectly properly reflects the jurisprudence that prevails in
Scotland. In that context, I commend it to the Committee.</div>

one stands around for long enough.</div>
					<a name="08043011000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">By amending PACE and its

be checked against samples that

of the Security Service or the Secret Intelligence

					<a name="08043011000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">To facilitate
this cross-checking, the clauses change the purposes for which PACE
samples can be used, adding simply &#147;national
security&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08043011000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
if the police take a sample from an individual as part of an ordinary
criminal investigation, that sample will be retained on the national
DNA database, as we have just been discussing, where the uses to which
it can be put are regulated by PACE. If a sample is subsequently taken
covertly by the security services during a terrorism investigation, but
they are unable to identify to whom the sample belongs, the current law
would not permit the security services to check the national DNA
database. Whatever one&#146;s view of the DNA database, with regard
to retention of data 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>and all the other issues that we have discussed, clearly that is a
position that should not prevail.</div>
					<a name="08043011000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clauses
will rectify that situation and allow the security services to
undertake a cross-check to obtain the necessary personal information
that will enable them to continue their investigations. In terrorist
investigations, where it is vital to construct the network to those
involved with terrorist organisations, the ability to make such a
cross-check routinely will be invaluable.</div>
					<a name="08043011000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two amendments would amend
the two clauses by removing reference to &#147;samples&#148; in
PACE and its Northern Ireland equivalent. That would mean that there
will be no provision for checking of DNA samples obtained under PACE
against police records or databases, as is the case at present. It
would also mean that the checking of DNA samples obtained under PACE
against records held by the security agencies, which is the entire
purpose of the clauses, would not be provided for.</div>
					<a name="08043011000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, it
would not be in the interests of effective investigations to remove
provision for the police to check DNA samples against their databases
or against the records held by the security services. That situation
would be particularly peculiar because the amendments would not remove
the provision for the police to cross-check fingerprints and footprints
against records held by the security agencies, but, because of the use
of the word &#147;samples&#148;, they would remove the ability of
the police to cross-check DNA
samples.</div>

						</b> In a desperate attempt to stop the
Minister&#146;s flow, I am intervening. Actually, I have a serious
question&#151;well, I do not know if it is a serious question, but I
shall put it. Does the act of the police checking the evidence base
held by the security services against the police evidence database,
incorporate the evidence held by the security services into the body of
evidence that is subject to PACE? Does PACE apply to the evidence held
by the security
services?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000395"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I do not think so because the security services
hold such evidence for entirely different reasons. PACE is very clearly
outlined in the regulatory framework within which an individual is
taken through the charge and subsequent process. It relates to the
level and quality of evidence in the evidential chain and other
elements. Unless somebody tells me otherwise, I struggle to see why
PACE should apply to that interchange in use from the security
services&#146; database, unless it is subsequently used in the courts
by the police. That would be unusual, but under such circumstances,
PACE would cover it. Perhaps the hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield has an
answer.</div>

be when we come to material not subject to existing statutory

Frome is whether material held by the security services may be adduced
in evidence in a criminal trial. That raises a host of interesting
issues, such as the possible disclosure of how such material was
obtained. We can deal with those issues in a moment, but I think that I
have understood his point, which is an important one. However, the
appropriate time at which to raise it is during our discussion of
clause 18.</div>

responded to his point, not least by saying that the utilisation of the

coverage by the rules of evidence and PACE. That is why it is more
likely than not that such evidence would not be used, except in
exceptional cases and there have been such
cases.</div>

previous discussions, the clause does nothing to add to the ability to
take samples. The measure is about sharing that data and information

everybody. Clearly, it will be greeted with acclamation and the

						</b> We now come to the issue of national security,
which features in more than one of the subsequent clauses. As the
Minister is aware, I have sought to delete the words &#147;national
security&#148; from a number of places. I emphasise that this is a
probing amendment. It is, nevertheless, a rather important one for
reasons that I will explain
briefly.</div>
					<a name="08043011000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
about counter-terrorism, so it is ultimately about the prevention or
detection of crime, which, as the Minister will see when he looks at
clause 14, features clearly in the words in proposed new subsection
(1AB), which refers to</div>
					<a name="08043011000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;purposes related to the
prevention or detection of crime, the investigation of an offence or
the conduct of a prosecution&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>
					<a name="08043011000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">That covers not just the investigation of

before it is
committed.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08043011000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe the
Minister will have little difficulty agreeing that, in the scope of
counter-terrorism work, it is not immediately obvious what difference
there might be between the interests of national security and the
prevention of crime, because one would have thought that the sort of
activity that takes place in the interests of national security is the
prevention of crime, quite apart from its detection afterwards. I do
not think that the Committee can simply gloss over the question of what
other than the prevention or detection of crime, or, for that matter,
the identification of a deceased person, is covered by the ambit of
national security.</div>
					<a name="08043011000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
term &#147;national security&#148; has a legal definition. It
covers the scope of the activities of the security services and the
Secret Intelligence Service. The Committee is entitled to ask the
question, because I suspect that activities that previously have been
conducted&#151;I am mixing my metaphors&#151;on the wrong side of
the blanket, if one talks about conception, are now being brought to
the right side of the blanket, and things that previously simply did
not have a statutory framework at all are now being given one. If they
are to be given a statutory framework, the Committee must ask exactly
what it will be.</div>
					<a name="08043011000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, is it being suggested that fingerprints, impressions of
footwear or samples, however they may be treated in the different
clauses&#151;the amendments do not apply only to clause 14&#151;can
be used to protect the economic interests of the United Kingdom? What
is the scope to which national security will apply for those purposes?
That is the nub of the question that I wanted to ask the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08043011000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider some of the later clauses to which the amendments would make
deletions. Amendment No. 65 would amend clause 18, which deals with
material not subject to existing statutory restrictions. The clause
states:</div>
					<a name="08043011000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
section applies to...DNA samples or profiles,
or...fingerprints, that are not held subject to existing statutory
restrictions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043011000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must
assume that, in essence, that is security services and SIS material
collated by from time to time taking DNA samples from possible suspects
whom they have under surveillance in one form or
another.</div>
					<a name="08043011000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
goes on to
state:</div>
					<a name="08043011000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Material
to which this section applies that is held by a law enforcement
authority in England and Wales...may be retained by that authority
and used&#151;</div>
					<a name="08043011000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
in the interests of national
security&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08043011000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">That appears
simply to be putting on a statutory footing what I suspect has already
been happening, but perhaps the Minister would like to confirm that
that is indeed the case.</div>
					<a name="08043011000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will leave until
consideration of the detailed amendments to clause 18 itself the
discussion of the counter-relationship, which is using material from
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>SIS and the security services to bring a prosecution. We touched on
that, but the proper place to consider it will come
later.</div>
					<a name="08043011000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have made my main point clear to the Minister. The amendments centre
around the definition of national security. An understanding of that as
we start our consideration of the clauses would help the Committee to
understand what we are in fact making legal for the future that was not
previously covered by any legal framework
whatever.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000403"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> The provisions on the retention and use of
fingerprints and samples have three broad objectives: first, putting a
counter-terrorism DNA database on a firmer legal footing; secondly,
allowing fingerprints or samples taken under PACE or its Northern
Ireland equivalent to be used for national security, as the hon. and
learned Member for Beaconsfield implies; and thirdly, making it easier
to allow fingerprints or samples taken under the Terrorism Act 2000 to
be placed on the national DNA
database.</div>
					<a name="08043011000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments concern the second of those objectives. As the hon. and
learned Gentleman said, they propose the removal of the provisions in
these clauses to add national security to the permitted uses of samples
obtained under PACE or PACE (Northern Ireland) and those covered by
clause 18. As he said, amendments Nos. 85, 87 and 88 propose an
alternative to including national security, which is to
include</div>
					<a name="08043011000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;preventing an
offence with a terrorist
connection.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043011000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As he
rightly said, &#147;national security&#148; is broadly defined in
section 1(2) of the Security Service Act 1989. When Lord Carlile was
before us last week, he
said:</div>
					<a name="08043011000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
very difficult to define exactly the concept of national security. The
security services certainly have a need to share information, as do
other control authorities, which is the generic term that I use for the
police, the security services, Revenue and Customs and so on...I
believe that any information that is potentially useful in the
prevention and detection of terrorism should be shared by appropriate
bodies. If that requires placing it on a statutory footing, again, I
have no possible objection. I would support
it.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Counter-Terrorism
Public Bill Committee, </i>24 April 2008; c. 118,
Q313.]</div>
					<a name="08043011000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what the
reference to national security in these clauses does.</div>
					<a name="08043011000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. and learned
Gentleman said, the definition of national security is clear in the
1989 Act. It
includes</div>
					<a name="08043011000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;threats from
espionage, terrorism and sabotage, from the activities of agents of
foreign powers and from actions intended to overthrow or undermine
parliamentary democracy by political, industrial or violent
means.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043011000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the broad
definition of national security. We want an interplay between
information, data, samples and so on held by the security services and
those held by the police, and this and subsequent clauses are the best
way of achieving that outcome. A more narrowly drawn definition, as
given in amendments Nos. 85, 87 and 88, does not capture the statutory
reasons that afford the security services the right to collect their
databases in the first place, which are widely drawn in that definition
of national
security.</div>
					<a name="08043011000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
not all the activities in that definition are included in the current
purposes for which samples obtained in criminal or counter-terrorism
investigations can be used. Section 64(1A) of PACE currently allows 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>DNA to be used for the prevention or detection of crime, the
investigation of an offence, the conduct of a prosecution or the
identification of dead people. The same is true of PACE (Northern
Ireland). Clauses 15, 17 and 18, which are the targets of the
amendments, insert national security into the uses to which samples
obtained under those Acts or clause 18 can be
put.</div>
					<a name="08043011000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman said that the references to national security would
be expunged entirely by the amendments, and that is why we must resist
them. For example, if the security services took a sample covertly
during a terrorism investigation but were unable to identify to whom it
belonged, the law as it currently stands, and would remain if the
amendments were accepted, would not permit them to check the national
DNA database unless they considered the investigation to be related to
one of the purposes for which PACE allows DNA to be used. Intuitively,
that cannot be right. The law must afford our &#147;control
agencies&#148;, to use Lord Carlile&#146;s term, the ability to
talk and interact with each other about the data and information that
they hold. However, in some terrorist investigations, perhaps
undertaken at an early stage, no crime has been committed and no
specific crime is envisaged. Samples may be obtained covertly to gather
intelligence on a group of individuals about whom there are concerns
but who are yet to commit a criminal act. It may then be difficult to
say that the investigation relates to the prevention of crime when the
focus, for example, is more on establishing links between the persons.
The establishment of networks in counter-terrorism is hugely
important.</div>
					<a name="08043011000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses
14, 15 and 18 will rectify the situation by allowing the use of PACE
samples for national security purposes and allowing the security
services to undertake a cross-check to obtain the necessary personal
information, which will enable them to carry on their investigations. I
repeat that, in terrorist investigations, where it is vital to disrupt
the networks of those involved in terrorist organisations, the ability
to make that cross-check will be invaluable. If the police obtain a
sample covertly as part of a terrorism investigation, it is more of a
national security matter, as defined by the principal Act, than a
simple focus on a particular crime. The sample will be checked against
an ordinary PACE sample, with the same benefits that apply when the
security services cross-check samples with PACE. For those reasons, we
resist the amendment. The hon. and learned Gentleman quite properly did
not refer to amendments Nos. 85, 87 and 88, but we can return to them
if the Committee wishes. Again, for the reasons that I have mentioned,
it is appropriate for the Committee to resist the
amendment.</div>

clause 18, page 32, line 27, leave
out paragraph
(c).</div>
					<a name="08043011000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 18 is
about material that is not subject to existing statutory restrictions.
I said earlier&#151;the Minister will doubtless confirm
it&#151;that the material will be held by a law enforcement
authority. However, will he first explain what is the material not
subject to existing statutory restrictions? That would be helpful for
the purposes of our debate. The clause provides that the material can
be used</div>

interests of national
security,&#148;</div>

					<a name="08043011000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">which must mean
that there is a possibility of it being taken into court.</div>
					<a name="08043011000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3) states that one

in subsection (2).&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043011000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
does that provision in fact cover? That is the first question that I

							<a name="08043011000406"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Clause 18 puts DNA and fingerprint material that
is not currently subject to statutory restriction on a statutory
footing to permit law enforcement use for certain purposes. That
material includes&#151;I need to determine whether this is the
definitive list, because I am not sure whether it is&#151;samples
obtained covertly under part 3 of the Police Act 1997 or part 2 of the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. For example, under the
1997 Act, a warrant may give the police power to enter someone&#146;s
home and take away property to obtain a sample. RIPA authorises both
covert surveillance and the use of covert human intelligence sources. A
good example is when a person under surveillance discards a cigarette
or drinks container, which can then be collected covertly and a sample
taken. It also includes material supplied by another law enforcement
authority, which by virtue of clause 18(5) includes both domestic and
foreign law enforcement authorities&#151;for example, the French
police, but I do not know
why.</div>
					<a name="08043011000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it
applies to samples otherwise lawfully obtained in the interest of
national security for the prevention or detection of crime, the
investigation of an offence, the conduct of a prosecution or for
purposes related to the identification of a deceased. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>Such material might include material obtained during a criminal
investigation other than through the exercise of covert
powers&#151;for example, material lawfully provided by a body other
than another law enforcement authority, such as the intelligence
services of another
state.</div>
					<a name="08043011000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my
introduction has been useful and I shall make one last point before the
hon. and learned Gentleman replies to the substantive debate on the
amendments. We are putting this into statute to clarify that the
retention and use of such material is in accordance with our
obligations under article 8 of the European convention on human rights,
which stipulates that any interference with an individual&#146;s
privacy must be</div>
					<a name="08043011000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
accordance with the
law.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043011000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
covertly-acquired material particularly, the law should set out how and
when such material should be used. In the same way that we have
standardised the purposes for which PACE, PACE (NI) and Terrorism Act
2000 samples can be used, that is what we have sought to do here. I
hope that that is a useful introduction before we come to the substance
of the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08043011000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000407"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The Minister has been helpful in setting out the
scope of the clause, and the example of the French police was extremely
useful. I wonder at what point the adverb &#147;lawfully&#148;
applies in qualification of &#147;obtained or acquired&#148; in
section (3)(c). Clearly, it is lawful for the British security service
or police lawfully to obtain or acquire information that has unlawfully
been obtained or acquired by a law enforcement agency under another
jurisdiction. Does &#147;lawfully&#148; apply to the source or
simply to the point of acquisition by the British law enforcement
authority?</div>
					<a name="08043011000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000408"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I think, in all seriousness, that it would be the
former rather than the latter because we are signatories to all sorts
of conventions and treaties, including against torture and so on. The
Government&#146;s position starts from that broadest concept when
defining
&#147;lawful&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08043011000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
small point that is probably part of the confusion is that PACE and
PACE-generated data and samples relate to the police station and the
process post-arrest. The provision is about standardising some of the
data and other matters secured outside the police station and outwith
the PACE process.</div>
					<a name="08043011000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Gentleman was right, and I hope that my explanation
was useful in exploring some of the finer details of the amendments,
which I shall
resist.</div>
					<a name="08043011000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000409"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I am sorry if my presentation placed the Minister
in difficulty. That was not my intention and I wanted to obtain
clarification. As I explained, many of these amendments are probing
amendments to enable the Committee to understand what we are being
asked to nod through.</div>
					<a name="08043011000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I take the matter a stage
further by going back to something that was raised earlier? The
Minister will see that in subsection (2)(b) one reason for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>retention of material is the conduct of a prosecution. That raises some
practical issues. Normally, DNA or fingerprint material that is used in
a prosecution will have been obtained in a statutory standard form
through the PACE rules in a police station. I can see that there may be
cases in which DNA has also been lifted from the scene of a crime, and
a police officer or one of the forensic officers can give evidence in
court to say that that is what he did so that there is the
match.</div>
					<a name="08043011000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I
understand what the Government seek to do in this sharing of data, it
is at least to provide for the possibility henceforth that material
that has been acquired by the security and intelligence services could
also potentially be used for that purpose. I do not think that it needs
me to tell the Minister that that raises some potentially rather
complicated issues in relation to public interest immunity, and
presentation of evidence in court. Is the Minister in a position to
comment&#151;or does he wish to comment during the course of the
Committee&#151;whether it is likely that material that comes into
this category could realistically be used without disclosing how or
where it has been obtained because that might cause difficulty in the
presentation of the prosecution case? It also raises another
issue.</div>
					<a name="08043011000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may have
this wrong, but by virtue of being placed in clause 18 in this fashion,
it also comes squarely into the category of unused material. We dealt
with that when we discussed intercept evidence, which hitherto has been
excluded from any consideration in the court process. What will the
consequences be if unused material comes into this category? It may
also be subject to the public interest immunity and therefore excluded.
I just wondered whether that had been thought through by the Government
and the various agencies when they drew up the measure. It may be that
it provides a very powerful tool for widening the scope of the sort of
evidence that may be available to prosecutors. I am not against that. I
wonder, however, whether it might have the unintended consequence of
creating complications in relation to this material because the
material might not readily be usable in court as unused material,
thereby creating difficulties. I just wondered whether the Minister
could help us on that point. That is the real issue behind the probing
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08043011000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000410"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield has
very clearly set out the concerns that I touched on earlier. I have two
issues with this clause, and neither of them are to do with the
effective sharing of information and the making of better investigatory
powers. The first point has just been touched on, which is the extent
to which the embodiment of information from the security and
intelligence services into police evidence, which may then be relied on
in court or may have admissibility, causes some of the complications
with which we are very familiar because of what we have been told about
intercept evidence. It seems to me that that is a real possibility and
one that we should be aware of before we perhaps cause an unintended
consequence to the security and intelligence
services.</div>
					<a name="08043011000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the Minister allayed my principal concerns in his reply to my earlier
intervention. My second concern is that the process could be used, in
effect, to launder inappropriate material to a point at which it
becomes lawful and admissible, but when its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>provenance is rather more dubious because it has been unlawfully gained
from sources outwith the British law enforcement community. It would
worry me if such material became admissible in a court of law and was
used for evidential purposes, and if, as a result of the procedure in
clause 18, it became the property of the British police service. I
think that the Minister has reassured me on that. Perhaps the hon. and
learned Gentleman is about to un-reassure
me.</div>
					<a name="08043011000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000411"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> It seems to me that it is most unlikely that such
material would be improperly used in court, because court procedure
would ferret around to unearth whether its provenance made it unusable.
However, that might well cause the very difficulties on which I
commented earlier to the Minister and on which I sought
clarification.</div>
					<a name="08043011000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000412"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The two issues are linked&#151;they are two sides
of the same coin. Those concerns, which have been clearly expressed
from the Liberal Democrat Benches, are not destructive, but
constructive. We are trying to make the clause work and questions
remain to be
answered.</div>
					<a name="08043011000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000413"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I accept that. If the only thrust of the clause
was to get security service data into shape to make it presentable in
court&#151;that might happen, but I shall come to that in a
moment&#151;I would share many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns. In actuality, however, it is t&#146;other way around. This
is more about affording the security services the opportunity to
utilise the national DNA database and other databases alongside their
own, for investigative, disruptive and other purposes. For reasons to
which I alluded earlier, I would find it very
surprising&#151;although this would not be impossible&#151;if
security service data and information were to be used in court. That
would do nothing to change the evidential trail, or to challenge or
change disclosure rules or the investigation or provenance of evidence
before the court; both hon. Members quite properly talked about the
latter. I am almost arguing the point from the other way around. The
clause is about permitting the security services to do far more with
police and other data for their purposes&#151;principally
intelligence and disruption&#151;rather than the other way round, as
the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome mentioned. None the less, that
is important. As I suggested, it would present the security services
with huge possibilities&#151;I gave examples earlier&#151;that
currently the law does not afford
them.</div>
					<a name="08043011000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been in
my ministerial role for nearly two years, so I understand that,
increasingly, operationally the security services and the police are
working closer together. From talking to those concerned, it is evident
that there is an interesting cultural clash. Happily, for the country,
that is changing rapidly. However, up until very recently, the
police&#146;s role has been to secure the evidence and evidential
trail, with a view to presenting it in court, to be clear about what
can be disclosed to the other side in court, to prepare their case,
secure a prosecution by the prosecuting authorities and allow and
afford the accused their day in court. The role of the security
services, which is blurred by life-and-death considerations, is to
watch individuals, to get networks together, to see what people are up
to and to disrupt 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>them&#151;job done, bomb or explosion avoided. Of old, on that side of
the equation, there was less concern about the evidential trial and
what a judge might say. Equally, for the police there was less concern
about what the arrest and subsequent activities would do to the
intelligence and information gathering activities carried out by the
service. They are going very much in that
direction.</div>
					<a name="08043011000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
advance of counter-terrorism units and collocation of service and
police round the country, the police are learning very sharply and
quickly about the needs and desires of the intelligence services in
doing their job and the intelligence services are learning more about
what the police need in terms of an evidential chain to do their part
of the job. This measure simply draws those two elements closer
together so that the service can utilise DNA databases and other things
to do its job far more readily. Were any of the information and
intelligence that it receives to end up as part of an evidential chain
in court, all the rules of evidence, including disclosure and
provenance, would come into play. This measure will not change that in
any way, shape or
form.</div>
					<a name="08043011000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the
concerns of hon. Members, but do not think that they are germane or
relevant to the clause. Under clause 18, I think it is more likely that
the service will utilise police databases, than that service
information will be used in the courts. If it is, the normal safeguards
and frameworks set down in law to protect the individual before the
judge will remain. The clause will change not a jot of that side of the
equation.</div>

						</b> I am reassured to hear that. I assume from that
explanation that the Minister does not see the potential problem, from
the insertion of the words &#147;conduct of a prosecution&#148;, of
fishing expeditions directed at the material in the databases of the
security and intelligence services. I simply flag that up. I can see
that there would be ways of protecting those services from such
intrusion by invoking public interest immunity. However, on the face of
it, the juxtaposition of the words &#147;conduct of a
prosecution&#148; with subsection (3)(c) seems to at least raise the
possibility that that could happen. Perhaps I am worrying about
nothing.</div>

slightly further? Are there any statutory bodies to which the Minister

Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs come within &#147;any

clearly does not refer to anyone in subsection (2) who may need the

argument about the scope of the words &#147;interests of national
security&#148;. Clearly, if it were confined to the prevention or
detection of crime, the investigation of an offence, the conduct of a
prosecution or the identification of a deceased, a whole series of
limiting factors is already provided which make it pretty clear who
that person is likely to be. But the interests of national security is
a very wide concept, as the Minister has accepted. This seems to place
on a statutory footing the right of the Secret Intelligence Service to
give to anyone, anywhere in the world, material relating to DNA
samples, profiles or fingerprints if it is thought the interest of
national security would be served by
it.</div>

concerned, to answer the hon. Member for
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, come under clause 18(5) where we talk about
what constitutes a law enforcement authority and the rather broad
definition of a police force. Sharper members of the Committee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>will note that the one set of bodies that is not there is the Security
Service and the Secret Intelligence Service.
</div>
					<a name="08043011000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand it,
the main import of the word &#147;anyone&#148; is to go beyond the
notion of police and law enforcement agencies as identified there
precisely to include the Security Service. We arrive at that point in
this rather convoluted but entirely proper legalistic fashion, by
referring back to clause 2(a), (b) and (c) and, by definition, once we
have exhausted ourselves working through who might be the relevant
agency for those subsections, we arrive at all the law enforcement
agencies, all the police forces as suitably defined and everything but
the Security Service and the SIS.</div>
					<a name="08043011000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
convoluted explanation why, as I understand it in my humble, unlearned
fashion, it says &#147;anyone&#148; there. If, God forbid, I have
misled the Committee in any way, I will stand corrected. But I get no
immediate sign of that from the people on my left who are not in the
room, although one of them is now scribbling away. But that is what I
presume is the configuration and interaction between the various
aspects of the architecture. <i class="I">[</i>

							<a name="08043011000424"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> This has been very helpful. The Minister is right.
As the Secret Intelligence Service and the Security Service do not come
within the definition of a law enforcement authority&#151;the point
that I made to the Minister was a bad one: it may arise in the context
of clause 19, but it does not arise in the context of clause
18&#151;it must therefore follow that they could not make a
disclosure to any person, although, oddly enough, the police could do
so in the interests of national security, which is a much wider concept
than the prevention of
crime.</div>
					<a name="08043011000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I
should not get too worried about that subject, but on the face of it
the police and all the other enforcement authorities, including the
Serious Organised Crime Agencies and commissioners for Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs could disclose to any body in the
globe if they thought it was in the interests of national security to
do
so.</div>

to clause 19, which I hope we will shortly, we will be able to tease
that out. Clause 19 is in no way identical to clause 18, because the
former is partly concerned with giving people necessary immunity to
talk to the security services in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>circumstances that might otherwise be in breach of current laws on data

later.</div>

has provided me with the reassurance that this provision is about the
law enforcement agencies&#151;I have got that&#151;although, as I
say, it is curious that there should be such a blanket right of
disclosure in the interests of national security to any person anywhere
in the world. However, that may be inevitable because any other attempt
at definition would leave out of the loop people who have a legitimate
right to receive such information. The Minister will understand why I
sought to substitute the words &#147;law enforcement agencies&#148;
for the current wording&#151;perhaps one could even say
&#147;individuals involved in law enforcement&#148;&#151;because
I assume that such people are being specifically aimed at. He may wish
to reflect on that or may conclude that my anxieties, or the points
that I have raised, are misplaced. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): Amendment No. 11
has been grouped with amendment No. 89 and I would like to refer
briefly to that. Amendment No. 11 is the embodiment of the concerns
expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth),
who is not a member of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>the Committee but has a passing academic interest. Although clause 19(1)
is clearly permissive&#151;it says that a person &#147;may disclose
information&#148;&#151;this probing amendment is to seek
confirmation that there are no circumstances in which, perhaps in
interaction with other legislation, that permissive &#147;may
disclose information&#148; might turn into a requirement to disclose
information, and might be used in a more aggressive way to seek
information, resulting in the person from whom the information is being
sought feeling that it is not being extracted in a permissive manner.
It is a probing amendment to reassure us that disclosure is entirely
permissive, and that there is no possibility that it may be used in a
more aggressive
manner.</div>
					<a name="08043011000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000433"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> If I may, I will start with amendment No. 11.
Given that there is nothing in the subsection that could be taken to
mean that an individual could be required to disclose information, the
amendment is redundant. Although I understand the point about probing
to establish that fact, the amendment is unnecessary because there is
nothing in the clause that compels or requires an individual to give
information to the service. I understand the point but the amendment is
not
required.</div>
					<a name="08043011000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
substantial part of the Bill, and that covered by amendment No. 89, is
more interesting. I do not say that to be offensive but the subject
matter of the clauses is more interesting. They are not about
deficiency in any areas of the intelligence services work as defined by
the Act. Rather we have afforded, under the Serious Organised Crime and
Police Act 2005 sections 33 to 35, to those who disclose information to
the Serious Organised Crime Agency explicit protection from any duty of
conflicts or other restriction to keep matters private. Our concern is
that that facility should at the time probably have been afforded to
the intelligence services too. So the difficulty now is that there is a
higher benchmark and encouragement for SOCA to be able to do what it
does, regarding the disclosure of information to it and protection
under law for such disclosure. We should mirror those provisions for
the intelligence services. That is all that clauses 19 to 21 do. They
mirror sections 33 to 35 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act.
Our concern is that the absence of similar explicit protections for the
intelligence and security agencies may cause doubt in the minds of
those wishing to give information that it is safe to do so. Given the
vital work of the intelligence and security agencies it is important
that nothing should dissuade those wishing to protect our society by
giving information to the agencies, so that the agencies can carry out
their vital statutory functions. It is important that nothing gets in
the way of that, and that is why those clauses are
offered.</div>
					<a name="08043011000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 89 would remove the explicit relief afforded by clause 19(6) to a
person properly giving information to any of the intelligence and
security agencies, that is, relief from any duty of confidence owed by
the person making the disclosure or any other restriction on that
disclosure. Although a person could still rely on common law to justify
disclosing information in breach of a duty of confidence or other
restriction on the ground that it was for higher public interest
purposes, that falls well short of the explicit relief provided to our
intelligence and security agencies in clause 19(6), which mirrors the
same relief afforded to SOCA in sections 33 to 35 of the 2005
Act.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>
					<a name="08043011000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would perpetuate the anomaly that we are seeking to correct whereby a
person would get explicit relief in law from the duty of confidence if
they gave information to SOCA for the purpose of preventing or
detecting crime, but not if they gave it to the intelligence and
security agencies for the prevention or detection of serious crime or
even terrorism. Individuals fulfilling their responsibilities towards
the security of society by properly providing information to such
agencies should receive the relief and confidence provided in clause
19(6). For that reason, and because that relief is already established
for SOCA under the 2005 Act, it is more than appropriate not to accept
amendment No. 89. It challenges the raison d&#146;être of much
of the Bill. As I have suggested, although amendment No. 11 is probing,
it is utterly
irrelevant.</div>

					<a name="08043011000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a funny
way, that is a slightly circular argument. Interestingly, that appears
not to include the purpose of national security, but it does include,
in subsections (3)(b) and (c), the prevention or detection of serious
crime and criminal proceedings. I contrast that with subsection (4),
which
states:</div>
					<a name="08043011000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Information
obtained by the Secret Intelligence Service for the purposes of any of

					<a name="08043011000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">which apparently does not apply to the
Security Service. I do not wish to appear too nosey on the
subject&#151;maybe there is something that I ought not to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>know about, or maybe it is completely innocuous&#151;but that strikes
me as slightly odd. Will the Minister clarify why the test for the
Security Service is different from that for the Secret Intelligence
Service?</div>
					<a name="08043011000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can we also
have some clarification of the difference between disclosure in the
interests of national security, which is the primary function of both
services, and the blanket expression &#147;discharge of its
functions&#148;?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000438"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> The amendments appear to have been drafted in the
belief that clause 19 creates new permissions or prohibitions on what
the intelligence and security agencies can and cannot disclose. It does
not. The distinction between subsections (3), (4) and (5) is simply
that they revert to the parent legislation and its definitions. For
example, section 1(2) of the Security Service Act 1989 outlines the
functions of the Security Service. They include the protection of the
UK&#146;s national security and economic well-being, a support role
in respect of the prevention and detection of serious crime and so on.
So when we consider the proper discharge of the functions of the
Security Service&#151;I cannot call it the SS. I got into trouble for
saying that. We can call it the Security Service or SYS, but never, for
obvious reasons, the SS, and quite
rightly.</div>
					<a name="08043011000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The discharge
of national security is included in the functions, so there is no point
in repeating it in the clause. National security is included separately
in subsection (4) not because the Secret Intelligence Service somehow
does not have such a function, but as the hon. and learned Gentleman
will know, its principal concern is with the overseas dimension of
activities rather than national security per
se.</div>
					<a name="08043011000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand
it, the functions outlined in the legislation do not include national
security, because that is the job of the Security Service, but,
clearly, for the purposes of the Bill and the information gateways that
we are establishing, national security would be an additional function
for SIS, and I believe it to be entirely the same for GCHQ. In other
words, subsections (3), (4) and (5), as they currently stand,
deliberately mirror the information gateway provided by section 2(2)(a)
of the 1989 Act and sections 2(2)(a) and 4(2)(a) of the Intelligence
Services Act 1994, and do more than that, by establishing the proper
relationship in respect of
disclosure.</div>
					<a name="08043011000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accordingly,
the effect of lowering or removing criteria in subsections (3), (4) or
(5) would not in itself allow or prohibit the agencies from disclosing
information, as each agency will still be governed by the terms of the
1989 Act or the 1994 Act as
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08043011000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that it is not, but if the intention of the amendments were to stop or
undermine the agencies undertaking the full range of statutory
functions that Parliament has set them, this would not be the way to go
about it. I am sure that that is not the case. What we are dealing with
in this clause is the ability to share data and disclose information.
The clumsy interaction of subsections (3), (4) and (5) reflects more on
the distinct nature of the parent legislation that created the agencies
than anything remotely nefarious.</div>

earlier. As a result of the Bill, they will be subject to a statutory
framework, which is extremely important and useful.</div>
					<a name="08043011000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I have one concern: I
do not think that this Committee&#146;s role should be to pass
retrospective legislation that provides blanket exemptions for past
activities. I know of no example of the intelligence services being
taken to task over what they might have done in this area, but one way
of reading subsection (4) suggests that it seeks to do that. However,
another way of reading it suggests that one cannot quote what we have
now legislated on and pray it in aid as an example 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>of the new framework when looking at the old framework. For those
reasons, I am not completely comfortable with subsection (4), because
it either has a purpose or it has not. If there is no purpose to it, it
should not be there, and if there is a purpose, we need more detail on
what it
is.</div>

McNulty:
						</b> As we have discussed, the central purpose of
clause 20 is to provide clarity and reassurance on the fact that it is
right to give information to the intelligence and security services to
enable them to undertake their vital work. Amendment No. 69 would
remove subsection (4) from the clause, as the hon. and learned
Gentleman has indicated. The purpose of subsection (4) is to make it
clear that previous disclosure of information to the intelligence and
security services or by the agencies would not be unlawful following
the introduction of the specific gateways provided by the Bill, but it
is about exemptions. Until now, the reliance has been on common law,
perfectly reasonably and legally, so it is not about retrospectivity or
about seeking exemptions for what has gone before.</div>
					<a name="08043011000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it would be perfectly
reasonable to ask whether subsection (4) means that the intelligence
and security agencies are currently engaged in illegal activity. The
hon. and learned Gentleman has suggested that that might be questioned,
but I am not suggesting for a moment that that is a perverse
interpretation.</div>

							<a name="08043011000448"></a>Mr.

						</b> No, but others are far more mischievous than the
hon. and learned Gentleman, so it might be read that way. To get the
clarity provided by the interlocking nature of clauses 19, 20 and 21,
we think that it is appropriate to put that phrase in to say that, by
moving forward, we are not impugning at all any of the previous
activities that relate to the intelligence agencies, because they of
course were rooted clearly in common law.</div>

Mercer</b> (Newark) (Con): I absolutely take the point that
the Minister makes&#151;I also take the point from my hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield&#151;but he keeps using
the word clarity. Subsection (4) will do nothing to add clarity, as far
as I can see. It merely obfuscates. In a spirit of helpfulness, could
we take out some of the double negatives. Would that make it clearer? I
do not wish to go down the route of the canard, which is a phrase that
the Minster has not yet
used.</div>

in due course. As the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, when
subsection (4) states
that</div>
					<a name="08043011000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in the section shall be read as casting doubt on the
legality&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08043011000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">it is simply
referring to the disclosure provisions. It would be utterly mischievous
if someone were to remove that
clause from the Bill, look at it in a broader context and say,
&#147;Here we are. We have found a way to absolve the intelligence
agencies of anything they have done in the past.&#148; That is what
the hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>implied but did not pursue. The clarity that I talk of is the clarity of
the relationships between, and the responsibility of, the agency and
others regarding the disclosure of information, and no more. We are
clearly setting up&#151;in the jargon&#151;the information gateways
to put all that on a statutory footing, and it is a much clearer
statutory footing than the previous root in common law. I shall return
to the hon. Gentleman, but first, there may be some who suggest that if
we are setting up the information gateway to afford the agencies the
ability to disclose information in that fashion, there was no legal
basis to do so before. There was, however. To get rid of any notion
that the legal basis was not rooted in common law, or that somehow
things are different now, we think that in the context of clauses 19,
20 and 21, the clause, however elegantly or otherwise written, is
entirely appropriate and utterly relevant.</div>

					<a name="08043011000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am,
perhaps, less kind to the Minister than my hon. Friend the Member for
Newark is about the phrase under discussion, which is quite
deliberately obfuscatory. I do not think that it can be reworded,
because it would have to be reworded either one way or another. One way
would be to do something that is unlawful, and pass retrospective
legislation giving a blanket exemption to the security services for
past potential misdeeds, which is not what the phrase says. The
alternative would be to water it down still further, in which case the
question would be, why is it there at all?</div>
					<a name="08043011000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am a little
puzzled, because it is not right for the Committee, or indeed for the
House, to construct a statement making it potentially impossible or
more difficult for a person, if they were minded to do so, to make an
allegation of illegality against any public authority or organisation.
The Minister has nailed his colours to the mast, and I have never
suggested that the Security Service or the Secret Intelligence Service
have acted illegally in that area, which is about disclosure anyway. I
rather take his view that the common law has covered it perfectly
adequately in the past and it is not an issue. We have a common law
right to do all sorts of things. I, as a lawyer, have an absolute
common law right, for example, to disregard legal privilege if I think
that legal privilege in information imparted to me is for the
commission of crime. It is in fact my duty in those circumstances to
tell somebody about it, irrespective of the legal professional
privilege that may attach to it. I do not think that that is the issue.
However, in those circumstances, I am remain puzzled about why
subsection (4) is in the Bill at all, unless it is because somebody has
a superabundance of caution or got unnecessarily twitched
up.</div>

							<a name="08043011000464"></a>Tom

							<a name="08043011000465"></a>Mr.

						</b> I was about to say that I cannot, but in the
currency of things, I long ago discovered that if I find something odd
in drafting, somebody can usually find me a precedent or something very
similar in legislation, because that it is usually how parliamentary
draftsmen work.</div>
					<a name="08043011000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find
the subsection odd. I can just see the Minister&#146;s point that
somebody might go to court and say, &#147;What was done in the past
must have been illegal, because look at what has now been done to put
it right.&#148; The answer to that is, &#147;Not at all. Everything
done in the past has been done on the basis of common law rights of
disclosure, and we are quite confident about that.&#148; In any case,
there is no reason that that could not be said without the subsection.
If it does not provide a legal protection, but is merely a device to be
waved in the face of a court, it would seem to be peculiarly
valueless.</div>
					<a name="08043011000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, a bit of me does
not like putting in statute something that appears to be of no value
and, as a result, fairly incomprehensible in its thrust. For those
reasons, I do not much like the subsection. As I have said, I might
have missed something. The Minister might be in position to respond
further&#151;you might give him leave to do so, Mr.
O&#146;Hara. At this stage, I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>minded not to press the amendment to a vote, but I
am sufficiently uncomfortable with it to think that it will be returned
to at later stages. It is just the sort of thing that I can imagine
being returned to in another place, if we do not return to it here. For
that reason, I hope that the Minister will give it further
consideration.</div>
					<a name="08043011000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether the subsection is necessary and whether it might not
have the unintended consequence of being a red rag to a bull. The
subsection might encourage people to argue before the courts that it
means nothing and that, therefore, they want to ferret around to find
out what has been done in the past, which would require common law to
be invoked to provide the two agencies with protection. I am inclined
to say that there is no point in having the subsection, so why not take
it out? However, I shall not press the Minister on that, but I hope
that he will reflect on what it really adds to the sum total of the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="08043011000466"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I have listened carefully to, and shall reflect
on, the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s comments. However, it does
not detract from what I have said already. I think that the subsection
provides for a necessary requirement. As I said, it refers entirely to
clause 19 and the principle that information gateways be established
therein. It also needs to be considered that clause 19 simply reflects
sections 33 and 35 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005
and the gateways established there, which we seek to mirror with the
intelligence agencies. Some have suggested that the common law on which
those agencies have relied thus far&#151;perfectly properly&#151;is
not only challenged by the establishment of the gateways in the Bill,
but by the initial gateways established by sections 33 and 35 of the
2005 Act. There should be no doubt about the need for subsection
(4).</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043011000467"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> To make the position absolutely clear, is the
Minister suggesting that subsection (4) provides any kind of immunity
or protection against the security services being proceeded against for
breaches of the previous basis on which information was disclosed to
them? If the answer is yes, frankly we should have no part in it,
because it is retrospective legislation. If the answer is no, there is
no point in subsection
(4).</div>

							<a name="08043011000468"></a>Mr.

						</b> I do not agree that there is no cause to have the
clause&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;because I think that the
latter point, and not the former one, is the right one. As I have said
before, it is not about retrospectivity, exemption or immunity.
Exemption and immunity are not required because all actions up until
now have been rooted in common law. As with the SOCA Bill and this
Bill, the subsection is included to confirm that that is the case. It
may be clumsy and the red rag to a bull, as the hon. and learned
Gentleman suggests, but I am told, and I am persuaded, that the
subsection is better in than out. It is only in that context, and only
referring to the disclosure provisions outlined in clause 19, do I
think that it is necessary. As I alluded to earlier, one could
mischievously&#151;if one were far more mischievous than anyone
here&#151;remove the clause from the Bill in its entirety, wave it
around and say, &#147;Here we are.&#148; Then we get into the sort
of terms of immunity exemption and everything else that has been
referred to. Notwithstanding the comments about my clarity being
another&#146;s obfuscation, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>or the other way round, the provision is appropriate to the Bill and I
think that it should stay there.</div>

						</b> This group of amendments and
the change to the schedule are consequential and technical and they
follow from the thrust of clauses 19 to 21. Essentially, they reconcile
the disclosure and intelligence service provisions of clauses 19 to 21
with existing legislation through consequential amendments to, among
others, the Representation of the People (England and Wales)
Regulations 2001, the UK Anti-Terrorism Crime &amp; Security Act 2001,
the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, which I put through
the House&#151;if one lives long enough, one gets to amend the Bills

					<a name="08043011000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Simply put, at the time that

consequential amendments were not appreciated and the amendments are
the logical consequences of the original clauses 19 to 21.</div>
					<a name="08043011000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments to the 2001
regulations are required to preserve the existing rights of the service
to receive information on the electoral register while removing the
restriction on onward disclosure. The other amendments refer in similar
fashion to, among other things, removing the existing bespoke
information-sharing gateways to the intelligence and security agencies
for revenue departments, immigration and nationality information, and
Statistics Board-related information. The provisions are unnecessary
