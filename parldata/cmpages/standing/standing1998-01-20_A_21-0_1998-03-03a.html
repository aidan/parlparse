<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning Tiverton and Honiton): </b>The Committee already knows that funding for GM schools will be changed significantly, and we now come to the dissolution of the Funding Agency for Schools. Will there be an overlap between the two types of funding? For example, after the Bill receives Royal Assent, when will the provision apply? At present, GM schools need to plan for the next year or so; they need to know when their funding arrangements will change so that they can ensure that there will be no gaps in the system. Will the Minister explain the timing of the change?</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> The effect of the new framework under clause 114 is that there will no longer be GM schools, as a result of which there will no longer be the need for the Funding Agency for Schools. The Government's intention is that the work of the funding agency will cease formally at the end of the financial year, March 1998-99. The agency will be run down thereafter and several people will have to be in post to finalise and discharge its final liabilities and responsibilities.
<P>
We expect that the financial regime for GM schools for the new financial year starting in April 1999 will be determined in the period running up to that time. GM schools will probably be informed of their budgets in January or February. We shall debate an amendment later this evening to allow the Department to make contributions to grant-maintained schools to cover the period between April and September when the new school framework will not be in place. We will need a mechanism by which to continue to pay grants to grant-maintained schools during that final period.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I should like to deal with the period between March and September and the salary for existing staff. Do the Government intend to replace the funding on a like-for-like basis, or will there be an averaging out to GM schools? In other words, will schools suddenly find that they have to give notice to a teacher at that time, or will there be a guarantee that whatever mechanism is in place in those intervening months will ensure that staffing levels will be maintained, certainly until September? We have heard that the change in structure will mean that, in many cases, GM schools will have to dispose of members of staff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is premature, in March 1998, to give commitments about budgets for a school in April 1999 if only I could. The hon. Lady will know that that is impossible and it would be misleading for me to try to do so. I am not saying that only in relation to grant-maintained schools; I cannot give such a commitment for any school under the new framework because it is too soon to say what the budgetary arrangements will be. Two principles underpin our approach: first, that there should be as little disruption as possible to schools as they go into the new framework. That applies to financial arrangements as much as to organisational matters. Secondly, and specifically, the Government's objective is to level up, rather than down. Transitional arrangements will be put in place to provide a safety net, so that the difficulties that might otherwise occur will at least be reduced.
<P>
The Government are conscious of the uncertainty that change always creates. We shall be mindful of that; indeed, we are holding discussions with groups representing the grant-maintained sector, to ensure that the new system will meet their particular requirements and deal with any anxieties that they may have.
<P>
I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Lady about the arrangements that we want to put in place. The Funding Agency for Schools will not be discharging any responsibilities after March 1999.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster (Bath):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 191, in page 84, leave out lines 26 to 31.
<P>
You will be delighted, Mr. Gale, to hear that I intend to be brief, not least to demonstrate for once that the Minister is wrong. Many of us were somewhat taken aback when, only a few minutes ago, the Minister said that a subsequent debate was likely to occur "later this evening." We hope that it will not be that much later.
<P>
Amendment No. 191 is a probing amendment. Clause 116 creates a new section 42A to the School Inspections Act 1996. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For the purposes of the law of defamation any report published by the Chief Inspector under any of those provisions shall be privileged unless the publication is shown to be made with malice."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister can explain why the chief inspector should be so protected.
<P>
I realise that many hon. Members feel that the chief inspector's remarks are sometimes intemperate. I am in a difficult position because, only a few days ago, in his annual lecture, he referred to "My very good friend, Don Foster". I am not sure whether I should be happy with that appellation. However, in his report, he not only attacks the Chairman of the Select Committee on Education and Employment, but accuses Professor Robin Alexander of an "excess of academic unworldiness". He also accuses Professor John MacBeath of Strathclyde university, who is also a member of the Minister's standard task force, of "intellectual shoddiness".
[Mr. Don Foster]
<P>
Many of us are worried that some of the chief inspector's remarks, not only in his remarks in his annual lecture and at other public meetings but in his reports, appear rather intemperate and are sometimes not backed up with the necessary intellectual rigour. It therefore seems appropriate that those who feel maligned by the chief inspector should have the opportunity for redress.
<P>
Subsection (3) is an odd provision. I hope for a clear explanation of why it is necessary to give the chief inspector such protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The provision is necessary because we propose a far wider distribution of Ofsted inspection reports than normal; such reports usually have a fairly limited circulation. The reports are published in pursuance of a legal duty imposed on Her Majesty's chief inspector, so he will automatically be covered by qualified privilege. That simply means that he will not be liable for his comments, provided that they are made without malice.
<P>
The clause allows Ofsted reports to appear on the internet that is what we mean by "published by electronic means" so the reports will have a far wider distributiion. Our legal advice is that because of that wider distribution, qualified privilege will not automatically apply to the chief inspector. We seek to ensure that the present legal cover given to the chief inspector for Ofsted reports in their limited circulation will apply when we move to a far wider distribution by making reports available on the internet.
<P>
We are giving Her Majesty's chief inspector no special protection; we are just ensuring that the same protection that at present applies to the limited circumstances in which Ofsted reports are made available will be extended to their far wider distribution, in which the chief inspector is not under a legal duty to make reports available. There is benefit and merit in making Ofsted reports easily accessible to parents, teachers and other people who are interested in reading reports on individual schools. That is why we need the specific provision in the clause to ensure that qualified privilege will also apply in those circumstances.
<P>
I hope that I have been able fully to explain why the words are in the clause, and that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for at least giving the Committee an explanation of why the words are included. What he has said is that there is protection for the more limited distribution of the inspector's reports, and that with wider distribution, the words must now be included in the Bill.
<P>
Of course, the Minister could have taken the opportunity when considering widening the distribution of such reports to reconsider whether the chief inspector should have such a level of protection. It is interesting to note that inspectors can be deregistered under the Education Act 1997, which amends the Education Act 1996, for producing a "seriously misleading" inspection report "without reasonable explanation". Inspectors can lose their job for producing such a report; it appears that the chief inspector can produce such a report and not lose his job.
<P>
Nevertheless, given that we now have on the record an explanation of the reason for the provision, which is what I sought by moving the amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 190, in page 84, line 31, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) After section 15 of the School Inspections Act 1996 there shall be inserted 
<P>
`Complaints Procedures <P>
Complaints procedures relating to inspections.
<P>
(15A). (1) The Chief Inspector shall establish procedures for dealing with complaints relating to the conduct of inspections carried out by virtue of sections 3, 6 and 10 of this Act.
<P>
(2) Prior to an inspection of a school carried out by virtue of sections 3, 6 and 10 of this Act, the Chief Inspector shall inform the school of the procedures established under subsection (1).'.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment is even simpler. It is intended to ensure that a complaints procedure is established for the chief inspector's reports. I have carefully read previous legislation, including the Education Act 1996 and the Education Act 1997, looking for reference to a specific complaints procedure for Ofsted. I confess that I can find no such reference, although the Minister may correct me if I have got it wrong. Given that I can find no such requirement, I was slightly taken aback when I phoned Ofsted today to inquire what were its arrangements for complaints procedures. I was told by an Ofsted official that Ofsted is consulting on the establishment of a complaints procedure; that the consultation is now coming to an end; that Ofsted hoped within a few days to make a major announcement about its plans for a complaints procedure and that it was thought likely that there would be an announcement about the establishment of an adjudicator.
<P>
Given that that is what I have been told by Ofsted, I hope that the Minister will give the Committee and the wider public information about those plans. If he cannot, I hope that the Committee will agree that it is important to have a complaints procedure for Ofsted inspections, given that the chief inspector is on record as being critical of some of the inspection reports conducted in his name.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> A complaints procedure already exists. "Making the Most of Inspection: a guide to inspection for schools and governors" makes it clear that those who want to complain about the conduct and reporting of inspections should ring 0171-421-6680. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) rang that number. Had he done so, he would have received a more accurate reply.
<P>
If a formal complaint is lodged, Ofsted investigates it. That is in line with the procedures that cover all Government Departments and with charter principles which have been established for several years. In 1997, Ofsted received complaints on 2.9 per cent. of its school inspections. There are hundreds of schools inspections, so many people are aware of the procedure.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right it is appropriate for Ofsted to review and revise the means by which people can raise genuine concerns and complain about how Ofsted might have operated. If there has been maladministration, there must be a way to raise such matters. It is no secret that the chief inspector and I, as the Minister responsible, have been discussing for some time a better procedure than that now available which will enable that to happen. It is far too soon to say exactly what conclusions will be reached in those discussions, but I am confident that the chief inspector recognises the merit of having a clearly stated procedure of which the public will be aware.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister's comments are helpful. I am sure that he will appreciate that one of my purposes is to ensure that much wider publicity is given to the current complaints procedure. Given his conversations wih the chief inspector and given that Ofsted said that revised proposals might be issued in a few days, can he tell us more about the time scale in which he expects those proposals to be issued?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I had hoped to be able to say something about that during the Committee's proceedings clearly, that will not be so, unless I am bleeped in the next 30 minutes. We are a little way off having a full set of agreements. Such matters are legally difficult. However, I hope that something helpful might be said before Easter. Given those comments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Given the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>". The Local Government Act 1974 shall be amended as follows.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 419 to 423, 473, 481, 412, 416, 424, 399, 413, 425, 400, 426, 328, 474, 401, 475, 468, 427, 428, 476, 477, 429, 430 to 434, 403, 435 to 443, 414, 444, 478, 482, 445, 415, 404, 483, 405, 479, 487, 488, 446, 447, 484, 480, 448 and 485
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The amendments cross reference changes that will take place in other legislation as a[Mr. Byers]
result of the Bill being enacted. A range of legislation will need to be slightly amended and that is what this group of amendments will do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Many of us are concerned about the number of amendments and wonder whether it is the right way to deal with a Bill. However, putting that to one side, I have a question about Government amendment No. 420 which will remove the adjudicator from the remit of the local government ombudsman. I accept that the adjudicator will be covered by the Council of Tribunals, but on the sort of issues that will be involved, I believe that the local government ombudsman is a much more easily accessible person for the public to approach if they are concerned about the adjudicator's role. Will the Minister explain why amendment No. 420 is necessary? Is it possible for him to reconsider the position at this late stage?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): I want to address amendment No. 486, which replaces two lines of schedule 28 with 71 lines of text. It deals with the provision of information, particularly on individual pupils. I shall quote part of the amendment to highlight my concern about it. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) The Secretary of State may provide any individual pupil information 
<P>
(a) to any information collator,
<P>
(b) to any prescribed person, or
<P>
(c) to any person falling within a prescribed category.
<P>
(5) Any information collator 
<P>
(a) may provide any individual pupil information 
<P>
(i) to the Secretary of State,
<P>
(ii) to any other information collator, or
<P>
(iii) to the governing body or proprietor of the school attended by the pupil or pupils to whom the information relates; and
<P>
(b) may, at such times as the Secretary of State may determine, provide such individual pupil information as may be prescribed 
<P>
(i) to any prescribed person, or
<P>
(ii) to any person falling within a prescribed category.
<P>
(6) Any person holding any individual pupil information (other than the Secretary of State or an information collator) may provide that information to 
<P>
(a) the Secretary of State,
<P>
(b) any information collator, or
<P>
(c) any prescribed person."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Apart from the fact that that describes an enormous, bureaucratic merry-go-round, it raises a question about the sorts of information that the Government intend should be covered. I accept that individual pupil information is necessary in collating figures about the number of exclusions or individual results, for example, but I am concerned that there is no prescription of what information can be passed on to the various bodies. I am particularly concerned about the reference to the information collator. The Secretary of State could require a body that merely provides statistical services, or a market research company, to be contracted to collate information. Such companies would have access to pupil information, which relates not only to exclusions or absences, but gives specific information on individuals. How do the Government intend to ensure that such information will not fall into the wrong hands?
<P>
When the Minister referred this morning to the need for the Government to be responsible for children aged zero to eight, I had visions of babies being wrested from their mothers and put into appropriate institutions, from which they would emerge thinking like the Minister perish the thought. The point about what information can be held and provided on individual pupils is serious and I await the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I was extremely encouraged by the Minister's unequivocal endorsement of the scheme in Surrey for partnership between independent and state schools, which was welcomed by Surrey LEAs. The schedule deals at length with the powers under which LEAs can purchase education provision outside the maintained sector. I am daunted by the number of amendments that the Government propose to it and I seek an assurance from the Under-Secretary that nothing that she has learnt since her generous endorsement of the new partnership scheme in Surrey has changed her mind or that of her Department about it. Would she also reassure me that she will dissociate herself and her Department from the unfortunate remarks of the union spokesman Doug McAvoy, criticising the Surrey scheme and calling on the Secretary of State to make it illegal? Would she confirm that neither the amendments nor the schedule would limit the power of local authorities such as Surrey to carry out such schemes?

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> My recollection is that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) said that we had much sympathy with the scheme that the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) outlined. However, press reports about what the Surrey LEA is proposing differ markedly from his description.
<P>
We are not prepared to stand to one side while LEAs promote and develop alternative schemes for assisted places that would not be an appropriate use of public money. We shall take powers, under schedule 28, to ensure that LEAs will not be able to do so for a simple reason: although we welcome partnership between the state sector and the independent sector, the effect nationally and, we believe, the effect locally of the assisted places scheme is not to build bridges but to create divisions within the education service. We shall use the powers in schedule 28 to ensure that there will not be local replacements of the assisted places scheme.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Will the Minister give an assurance that nothing in schedule 28 will prevent an LEA from purchasing places at an independent school if it feels that it cannot provide a certain standard of education for pupils in its maintained schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There is a danger that that matter involves a discussion of new clause 12, which we shall reach presently. New clause 12 makes it clear that the Secretary of State will have the power to approve the purchase of places in the independent sector. Over the years, that ability has been used effectively by LEAs, especially in relation to special needs, and there is no desire to block such developments. However, we would be concerned about an LEA's decision effectively to set up its own local assisted places scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Minister's statement comes as a bolt from the blue. I do not see how the description of the Surrey scheme that I gave a few weeks ago differs in any regard from the facts of the case. I described how education provision under that scheme will be obtained from independent schools. The Under-Secretary was unequivocal I asked her twice in her endorsement of the Surrey scheme. I drew the Committee's attention to the fact that under that scheme the additional cost of private sector provision would not be borne by the LEA's funds apart from a very small kick-start sum and to the fact that such provision would not be purchased by the LEA. The additional cost would be obtained from other sources, including charitable organisations, parental contributions and sponsorship by local companies. The Government mentioned all of those sources when they discussed partnership between the public and the private sector. The changes to the schedule 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has made a very long intervention, and I have been as lenient as I can be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We need to see the details of the Surrey scheme, which we await with eager anticipation. There will be no difficulty if the scheme operates along the lines that the hon. Gentleman sketched. I hope that it uses that positive partnership approach, but we must wait and see. I have read press reports and listened to the hon. Gentleman's description, but we must see the details of the scheme, after which we can judge it accordingly.
<P>
The simple reason that the adjudicator is not subject to the ombudsman procedure is because the adjudicator will act in a quasi-judicial capacity. It is appropriate that the regime applying through the Council on Tribunals should also apply to the adjudicator, and that will be the case, so the ombudsman system will not apply.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) referred to the provision of information. She was right to express concern about information being misused and I assure her that the Data Protection Acts will continue to apply. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary informs me that information on exclusions is already available for individual pupils to enable monitoring of gender and ethnic background. We are discussing pupil performance and the aim is to enable more effective monitoring for example, if there is a problem of under-achievement by boys or a particular ethnic group. More effective monitoring will be possible as a result of the information provisions in the amendments. I apologise for the detail that is necessary, but the matter is technical, and to enable the proper monitoring and evaluation to take place such detail is necessary.
<P>
The Secretary of State will prescribe to whom the information is to be made available. We are considering at the moment that it should go to the relevant education authorities, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and so on. Those are the sort of groups to which such information is denied at the moment and we think it appropriate that it should be made available to them.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to explain our motives in the three areas and that the Committee will agree to the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 450 to 459.
<P>
Government new clause 12 Restrictions on financial assistance to non-maintained schools.
<P>
Government new clause 13 Payment of school expenses; grant of scholarships, etc.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It may be for the Committee's convenience if I say that I do not intend to press Government new clause 13 or Government amendments Nos. 453, 454 or 459.
<P>
New clause 13 covers two issues. One is linked to new clause 12, and I hope to table an amendment on Report specifically covering the item in new clause 13 that is linked to new clause 12. New clause 13 also relates to discretionary powers to make awards to local education authorities and it may be more appropriate for that to be dealt with in another place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I do not want to impede progress if the Minister intends to table a revised version of new clause 13, but will he explain why it was proposed that new clause 13 should form part of the Bill? Would it not have been more appropriate for it to form part of the Teaching and Higher Education Bill? Will he confirm that with the abolition of the 1962 Act, which provided the basis for discretionary awards, the Government intend to introduce new legislation to ensure that local education authorities continue to be able to provide discretionary awards?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> New clause 13 was tabled because we are trying to provide a power to cover students in schools and further education. That would go beyond the scope of the Teaching and Higher Education Bill because of its long title, which raises the issue of what would be appropriate and in order for that Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath is right the Government intend to deal with the discretionary awards aspect of new clause 13 in the other place. We intend that LEAs should continue to have the power to offer discretionary awards. We saw merit in separating two quite distinct issues, and I personally think that it is inappropriate to deal with both issues in new clause 13.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I apologise for intervening a second time. As the Committee will not now have the opportunity to debate the proposals for the revised form of discretionary awards, will the Minister confirm whether as stated in the current new clause 13 the new version of new clause 13 will still include a cap on the amount of money that an LEA can spend on discretionary awards? If so, will the Minister inform the Committee of the sort of level at which that cap might be set?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have to wait to see what is tabled in the other place if he wants to know the Government's exact thinking on that. There will be an opportunity to debate any changes in discretionary awards, as the Bill will have to come back to the House of Commons if it is amended by the other place.
<P>
The most important element of this group of amendments is new clause 12, which I touched on earlier in relation to the comments made by the hon. Member for Guildford. New clause 12 and the consequential amendments provide that LEAs will be able to buy places in the independent sector only in circumstances specified in regulations laid down by the Secretary of State. Most members of the Committee will know that at present there are many occasions on which LEAs buy places in the independent sector, and in many authorities it has long been a tradition to do so. In many areas the independent sector provides the only access to good quality special needs places. The Government do not intend to alter such long-standing arrangements.
<P>
As I said earlier, the motive behind new clause 12 is to ensure that local authorities do not seek to replace the assisted places scheme with a local variation of an assisted places scheme. By that we mean local authorities buying places in the independent sector, thereby taking children out of the maintained sector and offering them a different type of education. That is not partnership, but the creation of divisions in the school sector. We therefore believe it would be wholly inappropriate.
<P>
New clause 12 ensures that the Secretary of State, by regulation, will be able to prescribe the circumstances in which independent sector places may be purchased by an LEA. We expect that power to be used rarely, and we hope not at all. Local authorities in some areas are considering devising their own replacement for the assisted places scheme, so measures are necessary to ensure that that does not occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister rightly refers to the fact that much of the detail of the Government's thinking will again appear in regulations that we have not seen. Will he confirm whether the regulations will state that an LEA would not be expected to buy independent sector places if comparable places were available within that LEA's provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We will consult widely on the regulations. I do not think that it would be right for me to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions, but in light of the broad circumstances outlined by the hon. Gentleman, there must be some doubt about whether that would be an appropriate use of local authority power. I do not want to rule anything out and I do have some sympathy with the position outlined by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
New clause 12 is important to ensure that we do not see local replacements for the assisted places scheme. Where there are genuine partnerships between the independent and state sectors, they will be promoted and supported. But we do not want schemes to develop that will create divisions in our education service. That is why new clause 12 is so important.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall not move Government new clauses 13 or amendments Nos. 453, 454 and 459.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Minister will not be surprised to hear that we strongly oppose new clause 12. Not long ago, he was quoted in the press as saying that LEAs have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"no God-given right to run and lead everything".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That epitomises the Minister's contempt for democratically elected representatives and their ability to determine local education policy, in which governing bodies and parents can have a say.
<P>
I accept what the Minister said about the history of LEAs being able to purchase places from the private sector for children with special educational needs. I include in that gifted children. In talking about SEN we often think of children who have a disability, but gifted children also fall into the category for which an LEA might find it appropriate to purchase a private sector place, which might formerly have been done by provision of an assisted place in a local independent school.
<P>
The Minister said that assisted places are divisive. However, his policy shows not partnership but dogma yet again. Where the Labour Government do not like what parents, governors and local people want, they include powers in the Bill for the Secretary of State so that they can get their own way.
<P>
We are reaching the end of the Committee stage. The Government's actions are not untypical of what has gone before. We opposed the abolition of the assisted places scheme. The Minister has said nothing to make us change our minds on that vindictive dogma. We oppose new clause 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I feared at the beginning of our proceedings that my premonitions would come true, but I did not believe until a few moments ago that they would do so in such a dramatic way in the final stages of the Committee. I warned the Committee that dark forces are at work in the Government. We see them tonight, even if Labour Members do not recognise them.
<P>
It is deeply misleading to pretend that the Bill will improve education standards, provide a new framework and build on earlier achievements in our education system while, at the very last moment, slipping in a clause that goes against a great deal of what both Ministers have previously said.
<P>
When the Education (Schools) Act 1997 which abolished assisted places was enacted, I tabled clauses that the Minister of State told me were unneccesary. He said that the power to achieve what those clauses sought to achieve what we are now trying to do in Surrey with our partnership places scheme already existed in the Act. The Minister must have accepted the existence of those powers, but it would appear that he is trying to remove them.
<P>
He is trying to take them away immediately through new clause 12. He will try to sneak in their removal through the back door, through new regulations, which we have not seen. That is fundamentally undemocratic. It will be a bad mark for the Minister that he has gone back on what he intimated the Government accepted as the status quo, under which it was possible for LEAs such as Surrey to initiate imaginative proposals.
<P>
The Minister said that the new clause is necessary to prevent the creation of a new version of assisted places, because he believes that that would be divisive. I assure the Committee that the LEA in Surrey has no desire to follow a divisive education policy. We must face the fact that one in five children in our county is educated in the independent sector. It is our job to build bridges between those children and the four in five educated in the maintained sector.
<P>
It is not for the Minister, who knows absolutely nothing about conditions in Surrey and understands even less as he would be the first to admit to tell us how to do that. [Laughter.] The implication is that he will override the common sense and initiative shown by people on the ground in the county that I represent. The laughter from the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) is contemptuous. It demonstrates how unfair it is to impose views on the people whom I represent.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden (Blackpool, South):</B> We can all work ourselves up into a lather about these matters, but what know they of Surrey who only Surrey know?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Not for the first time, the hon. Gentleman has cast little light on the subject.
<P>
We have not proposed a partnership places scheme in Surrey without giving it careful thought and without consulting the independent and state schools. The Under-Secretary was quick to acknowledge the benefits of our proposed scheme when I first described it. All children will benefit from the interaction between the schools and the sharing of facilities, and from the creation of a new attitude. It is not divisive to continue the benefits of such a scheme in a community where nearly 400 children enjoy assisted places.
<P>
I also explained to the Minister that Surrey does not have a selective system. We have a balance between a system that is independent and selective, and one that is maintained and non-selective. Occasionally, it is not possible for children to fit into either category, in particular those children who live in outlying areas with no access to the most popular schools to which they aspire, but who require an academically focused education. The needs of such children have often been answered by the assisted places scheme. The means by which we can respond to that need in the future could be through a partnership scheme, such as the one that we are proposing.
<P>
It would be divisive to use a significant proportion of the education authority's much needed resources goodness knows how much the Government have cut from Surrey's money this year, to make our job even harder to spend more than the SSA per pupil on those whom we are proposing to include in the partnership scheme.
<P>
One of the great advantages of the scheme, which completely changes it from the previous assisted places scheme, is that it will bring more money into education in our county. It will attract outside money charitable money, corporate money, independent money. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I detect an end-of-term atmosphere in the classroom. I would hate to have to impose detention on anyone present. The more we listen, the faster we shall proceed a point that the hon. Member for Guildford will also accept.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sure that you, Mr. Gale, will appreciate the extensive efforts that have been made by people across the county that I represent to bring the scheme to fruition. We have worked extremely hard to come within the framework of partnership described by the Minister's offices during recent weeks. If the Government had any doubt about the scheme that I described to them a few weeks ago, it was open to them at that stage to express those doubts. It was open to them before they introduced new clause 12 to invite more particular representations from the county that I represent and from those who have worked so hard on what we saw as a trail-blazing scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I am confused; it is not merely that it is the end of term. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us to which specific parts of the clause he objects? The Minister seems to have assured him that if the scheme that Surrey proposes meets the objectives that he laid out earlier, it would be perfectly acceptable. However, we are not to know that. For my benefit because no one else is listening will the hon. Gentleman say to which elements of the clause he objects?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sure that you, Mr. Gale, are listening, and that the outside world will be listening. The words in new clause 12 to which I object are at the beginning of subsection (2):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Except in accordance with regulations".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those five words give the Minister carte blanche to pick and choose which schemes he will favour and which he will blacken, according to his personal opinion, uninformed by a true appreciation of conditions on the ground in the area for which the scheme is proposed.
<P>
In my constituency, firms are desperate not only for those who are reasonably well qualified, but for those who are exceptionally well qualified coming through the school system. Local firms advertise in Europe for people to take jobs from people who would live in Surrey, because they cannot find enough local people who meet the educational attainment that they require. The university in Guildford needs good quality students. Without the help of the partnership places scheme, there will be children who fail to make the grade and who therefore cannot go on to university in their home town.
<P>
All those points are understood in Surrey; they are clearly not understood by Labour Members. That is why the decision should be left to local authorities, within the constraints that we have suggested, such as that the LEA should not spend more than the standard spending assessment per pupil on any such scheme. Such a constraint would be entirely consistent with everything that the Minister said during consideration of the Education (Schools) Act 1997, abolishing assisted places, and in this Committee. To go beyond that, and to pick and choose which schemes the Minister will favour has all the hallmarks of the not-invented-here syndrome. It is because it is a Conservative scheme, from a Conservative-led LEA, that the Government are determined to attack it and to squash it under the jackboot that we have already seen try to trample the countryside lobby.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Try as I may, I find it hard to relate the countryside lobby to the Bill. The hon. Gentleman must conclude his remarks on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> When my hon. Friend said "jackboot", it made me think that there is something of the Stasi about the Bill. He should not have told the Government what is going on in Surrey because otherwise they would probably never have known; having heard about the excellent work that is being carried out there, the Minister immediately commissioned new clause 12 to put a stop to it. It is the fear of the Government's knock at the door 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am myself a past master of the obscure intervention, but that went extremely wide.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her intervention and shall take here advice to heart. We still live in a democracy and Surrey LEA's march of progress will be stopped only temporarily by the Government's petty-minded attitude. We shall put forward our case vigorously to the Ministers and will examine minutely their regulations which must be brought forward before Report. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I shall be most temperate in my remarks, for which I apologise to the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford did the Committee a service by raising the tempo at this late stage. He may even have woken some hon. Members.
<P>
Labour Members should take note of the remarks of my hon. Friends the Member for Guildford and for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning), which point to the insidious nature of the Government's policies. Labour Members may find constraints on local democratic powers and on local communities' ability to make such decisions amusing now, but the same logic applied by a Government of a different complexion may be less welcome to them. Before sniffing at the arguments for local decision making, Labour Members should think more wisely about the possible effects of the legislation. When Governments seek to stifle choice and to impose their own uniform solutions on the country, they risk causing unknown damage to local situations.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford spoke strongly and passionately about the scheme in Surrey that he has been promoting. It seems an admirable scheme that has the support of the local authority and it is strange and worrying that the Government should want to stand in its way. I must also press the Minister about a situation in my own area which was raised earlier in our proceedings the previous practice of pupils in Trafford borough council being sent to St. Bede's college, an excellent independent, co-educational Roman Catholic grammar school in Manchester. The practice has been followed before Trafford, by Cheshire county council since the war. It arose because the borough has no comparable co-educational Roman Catholic grammar school in the maintained sector. Nothing in the new clause or the Minister's remarks reassured me or local parents that the clause or regulations flowing from it could not be[Mr. Brady]
used to prevent the borough reintroducing a regime that has been in place for many years.
<P>
The Minister said that he did not intend the legislation to be used to alter long-standing arrangements. The Labour LEA in Trafford has, against strong local opposition particularly from the Roman Catholic community forced the ending of the scheme to provide places at St. Bede's college. There is therefore a highly charged local situation. The Conservative party in Trafford has pledged that those places at St. Bede's will be restored when we take control of Trafford borough council, either this year or next. At present, we have the support of the Liberal Democrats, although they may yet change their mind again.
<P>
It is a vital part of local democracy and decision making that choices should be available to my constituents and others in the borough of Trafford. New clause 12 and the regulations made under it are a means by which the Secretary of State could prevent the local democratic process It is a worrying new clause and must be vigorously opposed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I do not hope to reach the oratorical heights scaled by my hon. Friends the Members for Altrincham and Sale, West and for Guildford. However, an important question needs to be answered. At the start of the Committee's deliberations, Oppostion Members said that, as much of the Bill related to codes of practice, guidance and regulations, it was therefore important that, in order to give the Bill proper consideration, we should have sight of those codes, regulations and guidance in advance of our debating the relevant clauses.
<P>
In some cases we have been given some idea of the Government's thinking in advance of the debate. In other cases, as with new clause 12, we have not had sight of the regulations. Because of that, it is difficult for us to judge the new clause. It depends on what is to be contained in the regulations.
<P>
The Minister said that the Government do not intend to alter any long-standing arrangements. He said that he accepts that local education authorities should purchase places from the independent sector for children with special educational needs and that it is not the Government's intention to alter those arrangements or to prevent such arrangement from being entered into in future. However, we can only take the Minister's word for that; we do not know what will be contained in the regulations. Indeed, the Minister said earlier that the Government are in the process of consulting on those regulations, so it may be some time before they are published.
<P>
As we all know, the devil is all too often in the detail. Whether or not new clause 12 is acceptable will depend solely on what the Government put into the regulations. The new clause seems to be written entirely from the aspect of a local education authority making a payment for the education of an individual pupil at a school in the non-maintained sector. Does that mean that the Government intend to preclude schools in the maintained sector from purchasing the education of a particular subject a particular class from schools in the non-maintained sector?
<P>
In an earlier debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford referred to a Surrey scheme and referred specifically to the purchase of Japanese tuition from schools in the independent sector. Even without the regulations, it seems that the purchase of a curriculum offer for a group of children in the maintained sector is precluded by new clause 12. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response. It is difficult to support new clause 12 without knowing the details of the regulations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Until we have seen the details of the Surrey scheme or the Trafford proposal, it would be wholly inappropiate for me to comment adversely on them. Given the context in which the hon. Member for Guildford expressed the partnership programme that Surrey is seeking to promote, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I see much merit in it. There is no question of a jackboot being put in to stop it happening. We want to see the details. For the record, if one in five children in Surrey presently go to the independent sector, the Government do not believe that it builds bridges to allow one in four to go there. That is not the solution; the solution must be to raise standards in all schools in Surrey.
<P>
One of the most alarming features of our debate during the past 40 minutes has been the acceptance on the part of Conservative members of the Committee that pupils must go to the independent sector to get a good quality education. The hon. Member for Guildford talks about the need to have excellent, well-qualified people. Of course that is true, but those people do not have to go to the independent sector, they can become well-qualified and excellent through a good state system of education. That is the real challenge that we face. To be honest, it is a cop-out to buy one's way out of the existing problems in Surrey. I am disappointed to hear that Surrey has such problems. From what the hon. Gentleman has said, Surrey is a good education authority, but it seems to have little support from employers in Surrey, who seem alarmed at the quality of its products.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I warned the Minister that he did not understand the situation in Surrey; he is merely digging a bigger hole for himself. We have some excellent schools in Guildford and elsewhere in Surrey, but not every school is excellent and not every school is aiming to achieve the academic excellence that is appropriate for some children. Some children in some schools have other needs and a different ambition. In some schools, most of the children leave at the age of 16.
<P>
Some children cannot gain access to the excellent schools that have an academic profile; that is where the scheme, and others like it, have a role to play at the margin.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Much of my knowledge of the school system in Surrey is based on comments made by the hon. Gentleman, so any inaccuracies are down to his information; I apologise for that.
<P>
The important point of new clause 12 is that it will ensure that local education authorities cannot replicate the assisted places scheme. It would not stop a school that felt it necessary for the curriculum development for an individual child to buy a place in a private school. A school could if it wanted purchase tuition to enable a pupil to take a Japanese A-level to take the example mentioned by the hon. Member for Maidenhead in the independent sector. There would be nothing to stop that happening, because the school would be exercising control over its budget. New clause 12 refers specifically to a local education authority buying places in the independent sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I want to make it clear that I was not suggesting that places at St. Bede's were necessary to provide quality places; they are necessary to provide co-educational Roman Catholic grammar school places. Equally good maintained grammar schools are available, but they do not provide co-educational schooling in the Roman Catholic faith. That is the critical point.
<P>
The Minister says that he cannot be expected to give a guarantee relating to a new scheme that he has not yet seen. I am asking for a guarantee that a scheme that has been in place for decades, and of which the Minister is aware, can be reintroduced and that nothing in the regulations to be proposed by the Secretary of State will stand in the way of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It would be totally inappropriate for me to make a decision on that here, without knowing the arguments for and against. The hon. Gentleman should be aware as the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton will certainly be aware, because she has been a Minister that when Ministers have to decide on applications, they cannot prejudge such decisions by comments made in Committee 12 or 18 months beforehand. It would be wholly inappropriate for me today to fetter my discretion I think that is the official expression on the matter.
<P>
I should like to give the hon. Gentleman a clear statement, but I am unable to do so. I am not running away from the question, but in 12 months' time I may be called on to judge whether an application from Trafford is within the regulations. I would be in some legal difficulty if I were to give him a response today.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Minister said that the Government were consulting on the regulations and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate to comment on them in detail. If consultations are taking place, it is gross discourtesy to members of the Committee that we have not had sight of the consultation document.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It would be wholly inappropriate to begin the consultations if new clause 12 had not been agreed to in Committee and on Report. That consultation has not yet begun. The hon. Lady will know that it is a convention of the House that the Government give a green light to consultations and discussions formally to occur only after a Bill has been read a Second time. New clause 12 is not part of the Bill as drafted, so consultations on the regulation have not begun because that would prejudge the will of the Committee and the House.
<P>
We shall begin the consultation after Report and Third Reading, when the House has expressed a view on new clause 12. That is part of the conventions of Parliament, and that is how we shall conduct our business. When the consultation begins, I shall ensure that members of the Committee receive details of the consultation document.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Will the Minister remind the Committee when requests for bids for education action zones were first issued?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes, it was 6 January this year after Second Reading, on 22 December. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman. We have complied absolutely with every parliamentary convention. Details were issued and applications invited on 6 January, and we are looking forward to receiving them on 20 March. I am sure that there will be some strong applicants, which will show the success of the Government's policy on education action zones. All that was done after Second Reading, because the convention is that no consultation is held nor application invited until the House has expressed a view.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Where an education action zone is formed, could it fund an assisted place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It will be interesting to wait and see. Obviously, education action zones will not be covered by new clause 12; they are not local education authorities. So there is an interesting prospect of education action zones buying places in the independent sector. Although that is highly unlikely, they would be free to do so. I look forward with interest to any applications that might be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> A solution for Surrey.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It might be a solution for Surrey.
<P>
New clause 12 is important. It will enable the Secretary of State to ensure that no local schemes to replace the assisted places scheme are established. It is focussed on that aspect. I am sure that there are many well-established cases where local authorities have good reasons for purchasing places in the independent sector. There is no attempt to disrupt those arrangements, but the new clause is necessary in the current circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I seek a moment of the Committee's time because this issue is important. I am bound to put on record that people in my constituency will be disappointed by what the Minister has said. They will not understand why he and his colleagues have been driven by union pressure, Mr. McAvoy's outrageous statements and the prejudice of old Labour, which always wanted to abolish assisted places. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) says from a sedentary position that this is an autopilot reaction, but it is the Government who are reacting in that way.
<P>
I should like to clarify three points. First, employers in my area support our education system I would not want the Minister to think otherwise for a moment. The fact that they are prepared to consider the scheme shows[Mr. St. Aubyn]
how generous they can be. If successful, the scheme would raise 500,000 to add to the money spent on the maintained sector. That would surely benefit children, and it would not be divisive.
<P>
Secondly, I welcome the idea that education action zones might be the way out of such difficulties, but that shows how contradictory the Government's stance is. They are appealing to business and outside interests to help with the education of our children, but anyone who has anything to do with the independent schools sector is given a black mark and is deemed as being unable to offer anything other than on terms prescribed by regulations set down by the Minister. That is a fundamentally wrong approach to building a better education system.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
About two or three weeks ago, we informed the Committee that we would be tabling new clause 11. It gives effect to a statutory code of practice governing the relationship between individual schools and the local education authority in the changed circumstances under which as a result of clause 5 local education authorities will have a new duty to promote high standards in schools.
<P>
Most members of the Committee broadly welcome the idea that there should be a statutory code of practice, so that all the partners, whether individual schools, head teachers, governing bodies, the local education authority or parents, can understand clearly the responsibilities and duties of each partner in the education service. The new clause will make sure that all of those areas, which are relevant to the standards agenda, are covered fully by the code of practice. [Mr. Byers]
<P>
The areas that will be covered by the code of practice will include education development plans; the local education authority's power to issue a formal warning notice; the power to appoint additional governors; the power to suspend a governing body's right to a delegated budget; the duty of governing bodies and head teachers to provide reports to education authorities; the local education authority's powers and duties on school staffing; the appointment of head teachers, teachers and non-teaching staff; discipline; head teacher performance; suspension and dismissal; the LEA's power to prevent the breakdown of discipline; the appointment and removal of LEA governors; the control of school premises; the LEA's power to suspend financial delegation for mismanagement, and the LEA's rights of access to schools.
<P>
They are all covered by the code of practice provided by new clause 11. We thought it appropriate to have comprehensive coverage because although the local education authority must have the power of intervention and access, there were concerns that it might be heavy handed in its approach to its responsibilities and might intervene and meddle in the day-to-day running and operation of individual schools. the new clause will ensure a light touch with regard to intervention and monitoring.
<P>
There are other instances, which I have just listed, when the LEA needs clearly defined boundaries on the correct and responsible way of discharging functions. Perhaps there will be an over-zealous LEA or one that wants to flex its muscles in the new environment. We believe that it is correct to state clearly what a local education authority's new responsibilities will be as well as the duties of the governing body and the head teacher of a school. Clarity is important so that people know precisely where they stand.
<P>
Members of the Committee will say that they do not yet have details of the code of practice. Consultation has begun and we are trying to find a way of ensuring that all the partners will be content to sign up to it. That will not be easy because there are conflicting views and strongly held opinions about the different responsibilities and roles of the various parties. But with good will on all sides, we can have a fair and reasonable code. That is the Government's objective. It will not happen overnight; it will mean taking people with us in our discussions and debates. I have circulated an outline of what the code of practice is likely to contain, and I apologise for it not being more detailed. We are making progress in some delicate areas and it would not be sensible at this stage to prejudge some of the discussions that are already taking place.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Will the Minister clarify one point? Did I hear him say that, notwithstanding that this is a new clause that has just been tabled, the consultation exercise on the code of practice has already started?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes. When we discussed the new clause that was tabled by the hon. Member for Bath, I said that we would be introducing a Government new clause, so members of the Committee had notice that we intended to have a statutory code. Since then, we have been consulting people about what might be in the code.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am a little confused about parliamentary procedure. In a previous discussion on a group of amendments, the Minister said that if a new clause were tabled in Committee that had not been part of the Bill on Second Reading, it was inappropriate for the Government to take action, such as consultation, on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> When we discussed the new clause tabled by the hon. Minister for Bath, I said as the record will show, that we were beginning consultation with relevant partners. There was no opposition to that and most people would regard it as sensible.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have begun to consult. I make no apology for that. It is important that the various partners in the schools service have an early opportunity to see what the statutory code of practice which we had not originally decided to have might contain. We had the opportunity to discuss it earlier under the new clause moved by the hon. Member for Bath, which allowed us to begin consultation. In those cirucumstances, an exception to convention was wholly appropriate. Conventions are not written on tablets of stone and it is sometimes appropriate to progress in a sense of partnership instead of being stuck with pariamentary protocol.
<P>
As I said in the note that I sent to Committee Members, we are considering how to develop the code in a way that all relevant partners will support. That will not be easy, but it will say clearly, without ambiguity or any area for doubt, exactly where powers and responsibilities will lie. It will give security to individual schools that may feel threatened and clear guidance to LEAs on how they should operate in the environment created by new duties and responsibilities to promote high standards.
<P>
Making the code statutory will give it teeth to ensure that all parties follow its provisions. It will also give opportunities to those who feel that the code is not being followed to challenge its implementation and to appeal to the Secretary of State to make sure that people act reasonably.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will accept new clause 11 on the basis of that reletively brief explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am delighted that the new clause tabled by me and my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) has resulted in the Government bringing forward a code of practice. However, I confess to a degree of disappointment at the paucity of information backing the Government's plans. New clause 11 lacks information that could have been given at this stage, notwithstanding the consultation that the Minister has described.
<P>
For example, the Minister rightly said that a main motivation for the code is the new responsibilities of LEAs under clause 5. It is odd, therefore, that new clause 12(6) does not refer to clause 5. The Minister will say that powers to raise issues about standards, which are the responsibility of the LEAs, are covered by the list in new clause 12(6)(a) to (1). However, that list is not as exhaustive as the Minister suggested. Clause 5 adds to section 13 of the Education Act 1996, which refers to a wide range of matters that are the responsibility of LEAs, but many of those issues are not covered by new clause 12(6)(a) to (k).
<P>
The Minister should also explain why, for example, there is no reference to section 351 of the Education Act 1996, which deals with an LEA's responsibility for the curriculum in schools in its area. I could give other examples to show that the list is not, as the Minister suggested, exhaustive.
<P>
Strangely, the Minister said that he wanted all of the parties to be happy to sign up to the document. With regard to the responsibilities of the partners, new clause 11 gives details only of the responsiblities of LEAs, although subsection (2) states that the partners also include the governing body and the head teacher. It is surprising that there is not a similar list of their responsibilities.
<P>
There is nothing in new clause 11 to suggest that Parliament will have an opportunity to scrutinise the code of practice, once it is completed. The new clause simply requires the Secretary of State to consult on the matter, and it would be possible to introduce the relevant provisions without Pariament's approval. In view of discussions in Committee and in another place, that may be excusable. However, the last two lines of the new clause make it clear that the Secretary of State may change the functions and responsibilities of an LEA without the need for parliamentary consideration. In other words, the new clause will give the Secretary of State the power to determine what LEAs shall and shall not do. Indeed, it almost implies that the Secretary of State could begin to meddle in the much wider remit of local authorities generally. Why did the new clause include such a provision?
<P>
The Minister sent us several pages detailing what he thinks will be in the code of practice. Sadly, he did so with little notice, but we are still grateful for his efforts. However, those Committee members who bothered to study the letter in detail know that it is not helpful. It provides little more information than is contained in the new clause, and it leaves many gaping holes. For example, there is no reference to an LEA's responsibility for excluded pupils, or to the vital issue of special educational needs.
<P>
When we discussed my new clause which I eventually withdrew when the Minister assured me that he would bring forward similar provisions the Minister waxed lyrical about the need to explain precisely the role of the LEA advisory service and to describe its relationship with Ofsted. Sadly, his letter contains nothing other than the remark that those matters will be covered. The relationship is not explained, and the Committee will have no opportunity to discuss the code of practice. Indeed, the House may not have the opportunity to do so because, as I explained earlier, there is no appropriate requirement in new clause 11. I am disappointed by his letter.
<P>
We must spell out clearly for LEAs what their precise role will be in the new partnership arrangements envisaged by the Bill and the Secretary of State. We remember the statement in paragraph 19 on page 69 of the White Paper:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If we are to hold LEAs to account for their performance, we owe it to them to ensure that they have a clear job description and the tools to do that job."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not believe that new clause 11 provides that clear job description. Sadly, we will never have the opportunity to decide whether the code of practice will live up to providing that clear job description.
<P>
The Committee is well aware, however, that the Minister's thinking has from time to time been influenced which is perfectly understandable by a number of other people. When the Minister responds, will he confirm whether he concurs with some remarks made by Mr. Chris Woodhead, Her Majesty's chief inspector, whom we know has advised the Minister from time to time. Those remarks appeared today in The Guardian, in which he said about schools that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a good number do not relish the invitation to discuss their targets and development plans with outsiders for whom they may have little respect.
<P>
Look at it the other way round. Do we really want schools to be unable to stand on their own two feet? Do we really (any of us) believe that standards can be raised by anybody other than those who work in schools? The good LEA will have the good sense to let good schools pursue their own individual (but not isolationist) destiny."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will confirm that he does not agree with those remarks. If he does, he will be sticking to statements that he has made to the Committee and to comments in the Government's White Paper, which all hon. Members will have read. It is important to say clearly that LEAs have a role in raising standards in all of our schools. The Minister rightly said that it is a changing role, which is a view that we share. It is no longer a controlling role or an interventionist role, except in those cases where intervention is justified. Our view on that is clear.
<P>
The Committee may be interested to know the views of other members of the Committee. The views of the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Sir D. Madel) to whom I have given notice of my intention to raise this matter may have changed, but in a debate in 1992 he spoke of his vision of the role of an LEA. He said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"parents and friends of schools would like to see the LEAs going in to look at deterioration of the buildings; failure to deliver the national curriculum; very poor examination results; the conduct of a particular teacher; the conduct of the governors and the head; alleged financial mismanagement; failure to provide school leavers with guidance and help towards their future careers or towards getting places in a university or a polytechnic; and failure to investigate parental complaints." [Official Report, 30 January 1992; Vol. 202, c. 1098.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman pointed to many of the issues that should be examined by LEAs, but it is possible that his views have changed.
<P>
The new clause although I welcome the commitment to provide the code of practice is disappointing for the paucity of information that it provides. The paucity of background information provided by the Minister is also disappointing. We nevertheless look forward to the earliest possible conclusion for the consultations. We hope that as many hon. Members as possible of both Houses will have the opportunity to comment on the final proposed code of practice before it takes effect.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Bath believes that we have not done justice to the code of practice. He knows that the original intention was not to have a statutory code of practice, and our decision to have one is a good example of how the Government have listened to representations in this case from the hon. Gentleman, who tabled the new clause. On reflection, we believe that a statutory code of practice will be useful. As that decision was taken in Committee, the policy and the implementation and development of the code of practice are not that advanced because there has not been time to do the work. I make no apology for that. Our decision is a consequence of listening to members of the Committee and people outside. We believe that the Bill can be improved by taking on board their suggestions.
<P>
I assure members of the Committee that when the code of practice is formulated, and when there is wider consultation, the hon. Gentleman and the official Opposition spokesman will get copies of it to circulate among their colleagues so that they have a chance to express their views. It is appropriate that that should happen, and I shall ensure that it does.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The reason why special education needs and admissions are not included is because they will be dealt with in separate codes of practice. We will be able to look at the relationship between individual schools and LEAs in that context. How an LEA's advisory service will relate to individual schools will also be dealt with in the code of practice. When the hon. Gentleman sees the details he will understand what we have in mind.
<P>
The role of the LEA is an interesting and important concept. The Secretary of State and I believe, as a result of our backgrounds, that where LEAs work well they add value to what a school can achieve. I have no doubt about that. I know of authorities throughout the country where that happens. There is, however, a downside, and an under-performing or failing LEA is part of the problem. It is the Government's responsibility not to stand to one side, see LEAs fail and pull down schools as a result of that failure, but to intervene and act to ensure that schools get the support they need to discharge their responsibility to raise standards.
<P>
I am disappointed that we have not been able to meet all of the concerns of the hon. Member for Bath. I hope that I have explained why we have not been able to do so in the particular circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Will the Minister reflect on whether it is appropriate to include in the code of practice all those issues that are the responsibility of LEAs, including special educational needs and exclusions, which I accept will be covered elsewhere? That would enable the code of practice to become a document for LEAs and those who examine their role, including those who inspect LEAs, to use when they consider the full range of an LEA's responsibilities. On another matter, does the Minister agree with the chief inspector of schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am happy to see whether other codes of practice can be linked, especially those which touch on the relationship between the LEA, the school and the governing body. There may be a case to include cross-referencing on admissions, exclusions and special educational needs. I shall be happy to consider the practicalities of consolidating them in one document.
<P>
I have not seen the detail of the speech that HMCI is going to make tomorrow evening. As always, I shall read with great interest his observations and comments. The Government's view on the role of LEAs is reflected in the Bill and in my earlier comments that where LEAs work well, they add value to schools and to the education system.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a second time.
<P>
So uncontentious is new clause 9 that I expected to move it formally and to have it accepted, but the Minister did not give me the nod. It refers to an important issue and continues the theme of constantly reviewing practice and ensuring that at all times, in all aspects of our education system, we aim for the very best practice. That should also apply many of us believe specifically to Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools.
<P>
The tenor of the new clause is straightforward. In the run up to the general election, the Labour party then in opposition made it clear in examining education matters that the role of Ofsted should be reviewed. Few people disagreed with that. There will now be a review of the inspection service for Wales, but not of that for England, which is a cause for some anxiety.
<P>
The assessors who were asked to examine and review the inspection system categorically concluded, before the general election, that it was necessary regularly to review the inspection system. Two of the Government's advisers, Professors Ted Wragg and Tim Brighouse, said that the inspections were not as effective as they should be and that many procedures needed to be reviewed.
<P>
It is important that we have confidence in every aspect of our system. Whether we like it or not, the inspection system is here to stay and it will be at the heart of the standards issue. It would be inconceivable to have a school standards Bill that did not contain the power to review constantly the effectiveness of the inspection system. The new clause is designed to provide that. It is not contentious. It would give everyone in the system the knowledge that those who inspect will themselves be inspected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall ask the Committee to resist the new clause because it duplicates existing responsibilities. Under the School Inspections Act 1996, the chief inspector is obliged to keep under review the inspection regime, as is appropriate, and to report to Parliament about how he does that. That is the appropriate way to hold the chief inspector to account for how the independent inspectorate discharges its responsibilities. There is a clear distinction between the relationship of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools and the relationship of Parliament and HMCI. HMCI reports to Parliament, not the Secretary of State an important distinction of which many Members seem unaware. They assume that HMCI is employed by the Secretary of State, but he is independent.
<P>
However, the Secretary of State is responsible for ensuring that HMCI keeps inspections under review. The Secretary of State wrote recently to the chief inspector to improve the quality and consistency of school inspection. The Secretary of State will receive a report from the chief inspector on how inspections can be improved. There is no question of the Secretary of State not calling HMCI to account, within his limited powers. However, it is Parliament that holds HMCI to account for how inspections are carried out.
<P>
Some changes in recent months to quality assurance and to who may be registered as an inspector should improve the quality and consistency of Ofsted inspections. There is always room for improvement, and HMCI recognises that changes in the inspection regime will lift the burden of concern that many schools feel at the prospect of an Ofsted inspection.
<P>
Some changes have been made. For example, the period of notice before an inspection used to be five terms. Many schools found that intimidating, so it has been reduced to a more manageable period. HMCI recognises the need to monitor the workings of the inspection system. Ofsted has commissioned two major reports by Coopers and Lybrand and Touche Ross which have addressed the quality of inspections. Ofsted is conscious of the need to monitor the operation of inspections. A third evaluation is under way. There is no complacency. Ofsted and HMCI recognise the importance of gaining the respect of schools throughout the country. Steps are being taken to maintain the schools system's confidence in Ofsted's methods of conducting its important business.
<P>
The new clause duplicates existing provisions and is unnecessary. I ask the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough to withdraw it. If he does not, I invite the Committee to vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am disappointed in the Minister's response, to which I listened carefully. One of the key problems is that there will never be confidence in a chief inspector whose duties include inspecting himself. What we have heard during the past few minutes will be heard with great disappointment elsewhere, particularly in the teaching profession. The Government have totally capitulated to Her Majesty's chief inspector for schools, who is a loose cannon with carte blanche to say what he likes about the teaching profession without ever being held to account for his remarks. One purpose of the new clause is to make it a legal requirement that, from time to time, we hold the chief inspector and the service to account. However, I hear what the Minister says, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Records of standards at end of key stages and of exclusions</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>". Governing bodies, education action forums and local authorities shall make and publish records by ethnicity and by gender of 
<P>
(a) standards at the end of key stages and

<P>
and when such records show evidence of differential attainment, relevant governing bodies, education action forums and local authorities shall draw up plans to show how they will redress these inequalities.". [Mr. Don Foster.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The purpose of the new clause is to require governing bodies, education action forums and local authorities to keep and publish records by ethnicity and gender of standards at the end of key stages and also of exclusions. Where the data collected provide evidence of differential attainment, those bodies will be required to draw up plans to show how they will redress inequalities.
<P>
I am sure that the Committee will note that the new clause is not merely about monitoring the composition of the student cohort; it is about monitoring student outcomes. That is important. The whole purpose of the Bill is to raise standards in our schools and to ensure that every child achieves his or her potential. We know that at present not all children are under-achieving, only some of them are. The sad truth is that a growing body of evidence shows that there are differentials in achievement according to ethnicity and gender.
<P>
The Committee will be well aware of many of the statistics, so I do not intend to delay our proceedings by citing all the figures that are available. Suffice it to say that, some weeks ago, the Minister rightly drew attention to the Government's concern about the differential performance of boys according to a number of key indicators. Boys under-achieve compared with girls in virtually all subjects. In 1996, 49 per cent. of all girls achieved five or more GCSE passes at grades A to C, compared with only 40 per cent. of all boys. I think that it was the Minister it may have been one of his colleagues who also made the point that boys' under-achievement is especially marked in language-based subjects such as English language and literature and modern foreign languages.
<P>
We also have data on ethnicity. Again, sadly, studies undertaken in Birmingham in 1994, and more recently in Bradford in 1996, show huge variations in the results achieved by different ethnic groups, again based on five A to C grades at GCSE. For example, in the Bradford study only 13 per cent. of Pakistani boys reached the standard, and only 19 per cent. of Pakistani girls, compared with 25 per cent. and 33 per cent. respectively for white pupils. Not a single Afro-Caribbean boy reached that standard in Bradford in 1996, and only one in five of Afro-Caribbean girls did so. There is clear evidence from all the research that has been undertaken that there are real differentials in achievement according to gender and ethnicity.
<P>
We also know from earlier Committee debates that there are huge variations in levels of exclusions of pupils. All members of the Committee have at one time or another expressed concern about the rise in the number of permanent exclusions from our schools. Equally, many members of the Committee have drawn attention to the differential rates of exclusion particularly based on ethnicity. For example, Afro-Caribbean pupils are between three and six times more likely to be excluded than white pupils of the same sex. Of all permanent exclusions in 1995-96, 17.4 per cent. were of ethnic minority pupils, although they constitute only 11 per cent. of the total school population.
<P>
Those figures and many others are clear. It is therefore important that those who have responsibility for the education of children governing bodies, education action forums and LEAs and who gather data about the performance of pupils by gender and by ethnicity also gather information about exclusion. The new clause provides that if they find differentials of the sort that I have described, they should draw up an action plan to deal with the problem.
<P>
I hope that all members of the Committee will support the principle behind new clause 10. I hope that it will receive a positive response from the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> I certainly have sympathy with everything that the hon. Member for Bath said. He was absolutely right to say that unless we know whether a group of youngsters is under-performing, it is difficult to take the next step to raise their level of achievement to that which they have a right to expect.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right also to say that no provision exists to collect information relating to pupil performance. We already know the gender and ethnic make-up of the school population through form 7. We have decided to do it another way. We can collect information on pupils' characteristics under Government amendment No. 486 to schedule 28, which was accepted earlier. We shall therefore be able to put that information together with pupil performance at the key stages. For the first time, we shall be able to obtain the sort of information about pupil performance which, as the hon. Gentleman said, we already have about exclusion. That information is published separately, so there is no need to take action.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Bath that that is how we intend to use the provisions of Government amendment No. 486. Having collected that information, we intend to make sure that schools and all those concerned to raise standards take the action necessary to ensure an end to the under-achievement of whole groups of people. Such under-achievement is not acceptable in an education system that is designed to raise the standard of every child. We mean to raise the standard of every child, and having ascertained groups where there is under-achievement, we shall now be able to move forward.
<P>
I hope that in the light of that assurance, the hon. Member for Bath will withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> May I say how delighted I am by what the Under-Secretary said? The crucial part of her response was not that a Government amendment would allow that information to be collected as she rightly pointed out, although the amendment was not debated it has already been accepted by the Committee it was the commitment she made on behalf of the Government that if, having collected that information, real problems were highlighted in relation to exclusion or standards by ethnicity or gender, she would require the relevant organisations to take action to resolve the problems.
<P>
As the Under-Secretary rightly said, that is the critical issue. She has given a clear assurance and many people will be watching to see whether it is delivered. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause. by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is customary at this juncture for the Front-Bench spokesmen to say a few words of thanks. I first thank the Clerk and the other Officers of the House for their help and advice. A constant supply of mineral water was provided, and it was needed on many occasions. I also thank the Hansard reporters, who always make our speeches seem far better in print than they were in reality. They provide a wonderful service, which we all greatly appreciate.
<P>
I thank parliamentary counsel for drafting the Bill competently and for preparing a relatively small number of amendments. Although we failed quite badly on schedule 28, they have done extremely well in the circumstances.
<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who has shared the burden of taking the Bill through its Committee stage. She has been a great friend and very tolerant in the past few weeks, which I greatly appreciate. I also thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, who has joined us occasionally to discuss distinct aspects of the Bill. It is probably the first measure to proceed through Committee that reflects the evolving nature of our constitution in the United Kingdom.
<P>
There is nothing worse than being a Government Back Bencher in a Standing Committee, but my hon. Friends have borne their responsibilities extremely well, for which I thank them. They have made a real contribution to the debate in their speeches, although their key role has been to vote the right way. They have all managed to do that, so they will go into the good books of my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), the Government Whip, who has kept good discipline and kept us to our timetable, which we appreciate.
<P>
Right hon. and hon. Members on the Opposition Benches have played a key role in Committee. All too often, we ignore the effect of such detailed scrutiny. Many people may not realise it, but former Ministers will know that much work goes on behind the scenes in preparing a Bill for its Committee stage. We undertake detailed consideration of what the Bill has to achieve and we refine and adapt it accordingly. Opposition Members disagree fundamentally on a number of issues, but the Bill has been improved as a result of their contributions.
<P>
Both my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I want to put on record our personal appreciation to the staff in our private offices in the Department who have worked under great pressure over the past few weeks. They have worked extremely well, efficiently and in good spirit and we are very appreciative indeed. We should also record our thanks to the whole Bill team, which has done a good job in ensuring that we were properly briefed so that the Bill could be in a strong and robust position.
<P>
I am delighted, Mr. Gale, that your co-Chairman, Mr. McWilliam, has joined you for our final few words. I thank you both. I noted when reading Roth's "Parliamentary Profiles" that before coming to the House of Commons, Mr. Gale, you were a producer of children's television excellent training for being Chairman of a Standing Committee. I hope that you will feel able to award to every member of the Committee a Blue Peter badge because of the way in which we have followed your instructions.
<P>
Our thanks go to Mr. McWilliam for his robust good humour and for allowing hon. Gentlemen to remove their jackets. That always embarrasses me because I never iron the back of my shirts. Very few of us will ever use the word "you" again without a tremor of trepidation we shall look to see whether Mr. McWilliam is sitting in the Chair if we do. He kept us in order, and rightly so. We have been very fortunate in having both Mr. Galee and Mr. McWilliam to Chair our Committee. We have been in order, in good spirits and in good humour.
<P>
This is the first major education Bill of the Labour Government and I have been privileged to steer it through its Committee stage. It sets an agenda for the next century, based on high standards and excellent educational opportunities for all our young people. We are not fighting the battles of old, but are looking ahead to a new school system that will be world class and that will offer our children the education they need and deserve. Above all, it is a Bill that puts the interests of children first and I look forward to it being reported to the House.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I join the Minister in thanking the staff, particularly the Clerk of the Committee, the Hansard Officers of the House and the police who have maintained order. I also thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) who is unfortunately unable to be here who has led the Conservatives through a marathon of a Bill. It is three years since I sat on a Standing Committee in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, matters were decided across the water. I had not had the experience of taking a Bill through a Committee stage and I approached the prospect of a long Committee stage it turned out to be six weeks with trepidation. Our experience is different from that of the Minister, with his back-up team from the private office and the Department.
<P>
I also pay tribute to my colleagues, to all members of the Committee and to our Whip, the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire, who has not only kept us in order but has contributed to the debate. I also thank the people who have worked so hard behind the scenes, whom we do not see in Committee, who have helped my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, my colleagues and me.
<P>
We have appreciated your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and that of Mr. McWilliam. At the beginning of our proceedings, I knew you better than Mr. McWilliam but over the weeks Mr. McWilliam and I found that we had a lot in common.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Jamieson </B>(Plymouth, Devonport): D. H. Lawrence.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport makes his customary intervention. I am sorry that we would have been ruled out of order if we had discussed D. H. Lawrence in greater detail. One makes new friendships in such a Committee and that was an unexpected one.
<P>
We are disappointed that the Bill is going to the Floor of the House in its current state because although we support some of its measures, particularly those relating to raising standards, we have many objections as has been made clear over the past six weeks especially to the provisions relating to structure. We particularly regret the demise of grant-maintained schools and grammar schools, the lack of choice for parents and the lack of local participation through the democratic process. We are worried about the erorision of that process, from the right of parish councils to have as close an association as they formerly had with their local schools to the increasing powers that the Secretary of State is taking to himself. We shall therefore reinforce our objections on Report.
<P>
This has been a good-humoured Committee. I am sorry that I could not share with the Minister my aromatherapy recipes to help him with the cold that he has had for the past two weeks, and for which he has had my sympathy. I assure him that, across the divide, he would have been safe in my hands [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> It is impossible to follow that, but I shall try.
<P>
The Minister said that it was customary to thank various people. I am sure that he, like me, gives those thanks not because it is the custom, but because they are heartfelt and sincere. I thank the Officers of the House and the police. I thank the Hansard reporters, who have tremendous skills. I do not know how they make sense of what I say; certainly my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough never can! I thank, in particular, the Committee Clerk, who has been extremely helpful throughout our proceedings. He has informed us promptly and efficiently on how business may be progressed subject, of course, to your final decision, Mr. Gale.
<P>
It might seem bizarre, but I should also like to pay a warm tribute to the Minister's officials. Those of us who have not had the opportunity that the Minister now has of serving in government might not know everything that his officials do for him. They have clearly served him well during our proceedings. That has been shown in several different ways perhaps not least by the relatively small number of pieces of paper that they have had to pass him when we have asked him questions. That shows that they have briefed him very well other than on multiplication tables on all aspects of the Bill.
<P>
The Committee might be interested to know we are not meant to see what the officials sometimes write about us and the amendments that we table. However, I happened to stumble upon one of the offerings prepared by the Minister's officials on an amendment that I had tabled. It stated that the amendment was one of the most obscure that they had ever seen. To help the Minister, they proffered three different possible explanations of what I might have had in mind when I tabled it. I apologise to the officials, not necessarily for causing them confusion, but for the fact that I then failed to move that amendment. I suspect that they were not best pleased with that.
<P>
The Committee has probed many aspects of the Bill. However, the Committee has let my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and me off rather lightly despite constantly challenging us, and our constantly promising to answer, we have not explained our policy on selection for specialist schools. No doubt someone will pick up that point when the Bill is debated on the Floor of the House.
<P>
Finally, on behalf of the Liberal Democrats I thank you, Mr. Gale, for your fair, firm and helpful chairmanship, and ask you to pass on similar comments to your colleague, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With the indulgence of the Committee, on behalf of Mr. McWilliam and myself, I thank the Clerk of the Committee, Mr. Lloyd, who has done sterling work throughout and no more so than in the past two hours. Our thanks also go to the Hansard sub-editors and transcribers, other Officers of the House, officials and the police. Mr. McWilliam reminded me that the police do not have the duty of maintaining order in Committee that is our job. However, they maintain splendid order in the Public Gallery, and we thank them for that.
<P>
I thank the Committee for suffering the extremes of temperature that we have experienced during our sittings and for holding vigorous, but always courteous and good-humoured, debates. I hope that you all think that your work has been worth while and that the Bill leaves the Committee better than it arrived.
<P>
I hope that the Minister of State, on his path to what we are all assured will be higher office, will look back fondly on the School Standards and Framework Bill. I [The Chairman]
also hope that he will not mind too much if some of us slightly irreverently, but as a result of the diligent work of his officials remember it forever as the clod and stickings Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
