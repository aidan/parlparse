<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">51
</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000264"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Excellent. Going from my left to right, will you
now please each give us your general observations about the Bill? There
are a lot of witnesses, but you may take as much time as you like,
because parliamentarians will listen to what you say and your comments
will spark various
questions.</div><a name="09021070000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> Fiona can speak for our
organisation.</div><a name="09021070000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Weir:</b></i> We have a wide range of concerns about the
Bill, a number of which come from our perspective as a single parent
charity that not only inputs into policy debates affecting single
parents, but is very much a provider of employability training. A huge
amount of what we do is about trying to get single parents back to
work. Our concerns are focused on a number of main areas, one of which
is how to get the right balance between the parenting responsibilities
that parents have, and their need to get into a job and to obtain help
to get their family out of poverty.</div>
<a name="09021070000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second area
of concern runs through parts of the Bill. While we agree with the
thinking around getting children out of poverty, and while we very much
welcome the Government&#146;s commitment to that, it is very
important to ensure that work really is a route out of poverty. Several
aspects of the proposals give us concern that single parent families
will not find a route out of poverty, but will instead join the ranks
of the working poor, or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>will face problems such as cycling in and out of benefits or low-paid
jobs, with detrimental impacts on their families. We are
also&#151;partly from our own experience of what works, and partly
from our respect for much of what has been achieved in the past decade
to get lone parents into jobs and to improve the employment rate
significantly, which has happened through a mixture of incentives and
the removal of barriers&#151;very concerned about the shift from
incentives towards an approach that is very much based around
compulsion. We have particular concerns about the impact of sanctions,
in terms of both the hardships that they would cause to families that
are already vulnerable and at severe risk of poverty, and the kind of
discretionary powers that are to be given to advisers. We think that
they could be detrimental to building the kind of relationship that is
needed if you are going to encourage people back into work. We also
think that they could create a real risk of unjust and inconsistent
approaches. Those are our main concerns, in top-line
terms.</div><a name="09021070000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Eddy
Graham:</b></i> The Child Poverty Action Group shares a lot
of Gingerbread&#146;s concerns. The first thing to talk about is the
format of the Bill. We said that it was not so much skeletal as
invertebrate, in that it grants an awful lot of powers, such as for the
Secretary of State to abolish income support for any group of people if
he considers it expedient or necessary. What is expedient might not be
necessary or wise, and we are concerned about the Secretary of State
taking a power to remove the entitlement of vulnerable people to claim
income support before we know what system will replace it. The powers
that are being granted and the lack of draft regulations, unlike with
the previous Welfare Reform Bill, for which extensive draft regulations
were published, cause some
concern.</div><a name="09021070000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much
of the Bill is about increasing conditionality on claimants, lone
parents, and sick and disabled people, yet there is nothing about
benefit adequacy. We are primarily concerned with the eradication of
child poverty, but simply increasing conditions on benefit claimants on
its own will not meet the 2020 target. There is nothing in the Bill
about increasing benefit adequacy so that claimants who are forced to
claim benefits for long or short periods can live on a reasonable
income. We are opposed to increasing conditions on people for an
insufficient level of
income.</div><a name="09021070000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the extension of contracting out, although the Bill does not remove any
benefit claimants&#146; rights to appeal, it does move them one step
further away. It places more decisions and directions in the hands of
contractors and will leave claimants with less to appeal or complain
about. It is not clear from the Bill what claimants will do when they
have disputes with contractors about the action plans that they are
drawing up or directions that they do or do not want. The Bill retains
the right for claimants to appeal against benefit sanctions, but a lot
of decision making takes place before that. We are concerned that, in
effect, there is an eradication of people&#146;s right of
appeal.</div><a name="09021070000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000265"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Nichols, do you have anything to
add to what your colleague has
said?</div><a name="09021070000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> I would like to add just a bit to what Eddy
said. I want to make it clear that CPAG very much supports the
potential that work can have as a route out of poverty for parents and
children, provided that it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>high-quality, well-paid work. We certainly would not want our criticisms
of the Bill to be misunderstood as opposition to that in any way, but
we have concerns about the effectiveness of the approaches being taken
and about the Bill&#146;s impact on
children.</div><a name="09021070000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Financial
sanctions on a family will have consequences for the children in the
family. There are potential conflicts between some of the possible
directions and parental caring responsibilities, and we are also
concerned about the potential of the welfare to work agenda to drive
child care strategy too
much.</div><a name="09021070000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that the needs of children have to trump everything. The
Government&#146;s child care strategy has to be at the top and other
things must follow it. In terms of effectiveness, the Bill leaves
claimants with very little ownership of the process of gaining
employment support. The large majority of claimants want to get into
decent work. We would prefer to see a system that nurtured that
ambition much more and worked in a more positive way with that
potential, and that is part of the reason why we are one of the
organisations that has suggested that this is an opportunity perhaps to
look at ideas around a claimants charter so that a claimant would feel
that they had an entitlement to high-quality, personally tailored
support, rather than it being something imposed on them through a quite
bureaucratic sanctions regime. As somebody who was once a long-term
benefit claimant and experienced the new deal, I know that no matter
what things look like on paper, the feelings that you have as a
claimant and your personal experience of the process as it plays out
are extremely important to its success.</div>
<a name="09021070000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
concerns about the amount of time that is being given for consideration
of the Bill in Committee. After the evidence sessions, there will be
only six sittings. I believe that there were 12 sittings for the last
Welfare Reform Bill. Given how much will be left to regulations, we are
not sure that there is enough time really to scrutinise the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09021070000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I have sympathy with much of what has been
said, but Barnardo&#146;s takes a somewhat different view. It is
important that that view is not caricatured; we are not suggesting that
the vast majority of people who are unemployed or out of work do not
want to get into work, but we believe that many of them need help and
assistance to get into work. We do not shy away from the fact that a
small minority needs pushing into work. We have some sympathy with the
conditionality aspects of the Bill, particularly the emphasis given to
getting those on long-term and incapacity benefits back into work. I
say that on the basis of not only my experience running
Barnardo&#146;s, which works with about 120,000 children and young
people, but, and perhaps more significantly, my previous experience
running the Prison Service.</div>
<a name="09021070000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">When working
with offenders, which I did for 23 years, I was constantly
struck by the worrying number who believed that the world of work was
simply nothing to do with them. They came from families with parents
who had not worked. Indeed, there is some evidence now of young people
in families in which work has not been a factor for three generations.
Work can provide a route out of poverty&#151;although not always, and
it is a real problem that 60 per cent. of children living in poverty in
the UK have one or both parents working&#151;and it also improves
self-esteem and self-worth. A child 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>growing up in a family in which one or more parents work is much more
likely to think that the world of work, a potential career and getting
on in the world is something to do with them. The number of young
people in the UK who think that jobs and careers are things that people
like us do is a real worry.</div>
<a name="09021070000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021070000266"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Colleagues, there is plenty of food for thought
there.</div>
<a name="09021070000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><a name="09021070000267"></a><b class="B">Mr.
James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): I would like to ask
about the position of lone parents with younger children, which is a
very important aspect of the Bill. We will perhaps start with Fiona and
Kate. You have seen the Government&#146;s proposals, which were set
out in response to the Gregg report, on how they see the parents of
children under the age of seven in a progression to work group. After
the children are seven years old, the parents will obviously move from
income support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. Under this philosophy
of progression to work, those with children under seven will be in a
new group, and lone parents of children of three to six years old will
be</div><a name="09021070000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Required
to follow the full progression to Work regime based around Work Focused
interviews, action plans, work related activity and the backstop of
adviser
direction.&#148;</div><a name="09021070000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
do you feel about that?</div>
<a name="09021070000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Weir:</b></i> From our experience of working with single
parents, we feel quite strongly that the vast majority want to work; in
fact, nine out of 10 say that they want to work when it is right for
their family. Usually, when you unpick that a bit, there are very good
reasons behind their choices on work, and 40 per cent. of lone parents
with children under seven are already in work. Those who are not
working often have very good reasons: sometimes it is skills and
confidence, sometimes a lack of access to the right child care, and
sometimes a different set of barriers relating to the particular needs
of the children. Fundamentally, what is required is a system that
really provides support on skills training and building confidence, and
good provision of child care, but that essentially leaves the decision
about when it is right for the family for the single parent to return
to work up to that single parent.</div>
<a name="09021070000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
learned from our experience of what works that the relationship with
Jobcentre Plus advisers can be extremely positive and supportive for
helping a lone parent on the route to work. However, you take the
element of trust out of that relationship if there is the potential to
sanction that lone parent for not undertaking particular work-related
activities. What constitutes a &#147;work-related activity&#148; in
the Bill is wide open and it is also very unclear what would or would
not constitute a reasonable sanction. You must consider the experience
in the US. There, when an adviser has been given discretion to apply
sanctions, an element of racial bias has often come into decisions,
along with other issues. That all adds up to a system that, instead of
working with the desire that many people have to get their children out
of poverty and to get themselves back into work&#151;because they
want the adult company, to be a role model for their child and so
on&#151;somehow becomes very distrustful and based on a small number
of people, rather than the vast majority of people who want to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>take the right route for their family. It then becomes a system that is
working not with people, but against
them.</div><a name="09021070000034"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000268"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Have you any reflections on the age at which
this measure kicks in, which is the age of
three?</div><a name="09021070000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Weir:</b></i> It is difficult to put a figure on the age,
because if you look at the controls that are already in place, we are
receiving calls all the time from families with children over the age
of 12. That is because 59 per cent. of local authorities&#146; child
care sufficiency assessments show that there is nothing there for
children over the age of 12. Often, a difficult teenager is harder to
deal with than younger children. A lot of them will have particular
needs and parents will not want to leave them unsupervised over the
summer holiday. Very different sets of considerations apply at
different ages, and people&#146;s children and their family
circumstances are all different. Some families are very strongly
affected by domestic violence, or the conflict that has been going on
within the family. Really, you are in the realm of sensitive judgment
calls and therefore you have to decide who is best placed to make those
calls.</div>
<a name="09021070000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
emphasis that we are trying to get in this Bill is a move away from the
constant pressure of sanctions, the threat of sanctions, and
compulsion. Instead, we are saying, &#147;Please build into it
elements that are much more about encouraging people&#148;. For
example, there are provisions to pay employment and support allowance
claimants an extra premium for undertaking work-related activity, but
why could not those provisions apply to single parents? Instead, we
have an entirely unjust comparator, whereby single parents face the
threat of sanctions, even though another claimant group has an
incentive built in.</div>
<a name="09021070000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, a
lot of the issues that we are raising are about simple measures that
would make it easier for people to take shorter term jobs&#151;for
under 16 hours a week&#151;by increasing the earnings disregard.
Again, this approach builds on opportunities for support and incentives
to take a different route, rather than an approach that is very much
about telling people, without knowledge of their personal
circumstances, what works best for them.</div>
<a name="09021070000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> We feel that the way in which the progression
to work group is being conceptualised is adding complexity to the
benefit system. It will consist of some disabled claimants who will be
on ESA and, as Fiona said, they will be receiving an additional
premium. However, there will also be this group of single parents who
will be on jobseeker&#146;s allowance, but without full job search
conditions, who will still be subject to sanctions. Although the
approach is principled, we think that it will add an extra layer of
complexity to an already very complex
system.</div>
<a name="09021070000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000269"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> The point is that all the members of that
group, whether they are people on ESA who may have a condition that
inhibits them or a single parent caring for a young child, are on a
journey towards work. However, you say that we must balance these other
factors and take into account the age of the child. May I put the same
general question about the age at which this measure applies to the
Child Poverty Action
Group?</div><a name="09021070000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> We already know that lone parents are one of
the groups that are most at risk regarding child poverty. If those
families could be subject to sanctions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>on top of that, there could be a very damaging impact on them. We very
much agree with what Gingerbread says about wanting to emphasise the
positives and the incentives, because lone parents generally want to
work and, we believe, are in the best position to decide when the time
is right for them to do so.</div>
<a name="09021070000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also have
doubts about the extent to which it is possible to take some of the
successful schemes that are working with voluntary organisations and to
shoehorn them into the suggested sanctions regime. I discussed that
earlier this week with a social enterprise programme that is
successfully getting lone parents and partners into work and retaining
them in work through a voluntary programme. One of the key things it
does is to work extremely closely with employers. When you look at the
barriers, you find that they lie with employers and with access to
child care&#151;we have already heard from Gingerbread about some of
the big problems with access to child care. In summary, we think that
the provision is a distraction from the real problems and that it also
has the potential to do harm to lone parent
families.</div><a name="09021070000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000270"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Do you have any reflections on three as the age
limit for the youngest child at which the full progression to work
regime will kick
in?</div><a name="09021070000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> We think that that is too young. We do not
want to have the argument about the age at which the sanctions should
kick in because we think that that will take us away from the drive to
address the real barriers and to work with the positive ambitions that
are already in place with lone parents and that need to be nurtured,
but if that argument is already taking place, I would say that as you
go down the age groups, you get different kinds of concerns. For
younger children, we are concerned that there are particular
developmental needs in pre-school years, but for older children, we are
concerned that, as Gingerbread has said, there are particular problems
in the transition at secondary age. Those older children will be
meeting a load of new life challenges and might have new problems to
deal with, including serious issues such as coming into contact with
drugs and alcohol or sexual activity for the first time. There can
therefore be very good reasons why the parent might want to have the
time to be
there.</div><a name="09021070000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000271"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Finally, may I ask Martin Narey the same
question?</div><a name="09021070000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I bow very much to Gingerbread&#146;s
detailed grasp of the issues. Broadly speaking, I think that the
principle of allowing a mother&#151;it is almost invariably a
mother&#151;support and preparation for work when the youngest child
reaches the age of three, with the expectation that she might work when
that child is seven, is not unreasonable. The key factor is child care.
Child care has to be available so that a mother can prepare herself for
work and then, in particular, work afterwards. A single mother who is
always worried about where her children are, about whether they are
being looked after adequately, and about whether she will get back from
work in time to pick them up will not be a very good employee, so the
availability of child care, which is patchy, is absolutely vital.
However, I think that the general principles of the Bill are
reasonable. I frequently see young mums with young children who left
school without qualifications and are essentially 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>unemployable, but who are certainly bright enough&#151;and could do
so, with help and assistance&#151;to become work-ready by the time
the child is
seven.</div><a name="09021070000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><a name="09021070000272"></a><b class="B">Mr.
James Plaskitt</b> (Warwick and Leamington) (Lab): May I ask
about clause 13, which deals with reform of the social fund? I would
welcome your comments and the perspectives of your organisations about
the effectiveness of the social fund in tackling and alleviating
poverty. What shortfalls do you think it has, and to what extent will
the proposed reforms, such as the introduction of external providers,
meet the problems that you perceive with this part of the welfare
system?</div><a name="09021070000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> We have long been concerned about the social
fund. The main concern has been the lack of funding in the social fund
and the balance between loans, which are controlled by a tight budget,
and grants, which are available when people are facing genuine
emergencies. Organisations have suggested a number of reforms, often
jointly. A more grant-based system setting out defined moments of need
that could be met through such a fund would be very helpful.</div>
<a name="09021070000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have some
concerns about the proposals to use external providers. First, we do
not know exactly how those proposals would work. A consultation
document was put out just before December, but the details of how the
scheme would operate are still pretty sketchy. They follow on from a
feasibility study conducted by KPMG, which said that it was very
sceptical that any external providers would be willing to operate in
this area without charging interest. You will all be aware of very
serious concerns about interest being charged on loans to meet the
essential needs of the most vulnerable people.</div>
<a name="09021070000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are very
concerned about this area of the Bill because we do not know what the
implications will be. We are particularly worried about the provision
that will allow Jobcentre Plus to restrict the availability of social
fund loans when there is an external provider, partly because there is
no detail about the conditions under which the external provider would
provide those loans. We are grateful for commitments that they would
not be interest bearing, but we do not know what conditions the
claimant would have to meet to access one of those loans, and we are
worried about the ability to restrict availability to Jobcentre Plus
loans.</div><a name="09021070000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Eddy
Graham:</b></i> A great frustration is that CPAG, like other
groups, has pushed for changes to the social fund for many years, yet
various Governments have not done very much. Now that there has been a
decision to take action, the consultation&#151;or
non-consultation&#151;before Christmas was disappointing. The Bill
itself talks only about contracting out to an external provider and
includes a provision to supply white goods rather than give money. If
the Government have decided to take action, it would be much better to
look at the social fund as a whole. You could look at some of the
research that has been done, as Kate suggested, into making grants at
key stages in claimants&#146; lives, such as when their children
start school and move to secondary school, and to deal with things that
cause big increases on costs, such as moving home. You could consider
expanding the loan scheme so that it is more generous and more money is
put into it. In effect, the loan scheme is the claimants&#146; own
money, because they pay it back.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="09021070000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On outsourcing
to private providers, it seems a bit odd to privatise the social fund
when the Government are nationalising part of the private banking
system. We would much rather see a more generous scheme that would meet
people&#146;s needs. Although the social fund is inadequate, it is
there as the last resort for some of the poorest people in the country.
We would like the loan scheme to be made more generous, with
eligibility enhanced. The whole system of eligibility for grants, which
is more than 10 or 12 years old, needs to be looked. It should be
widened to help people who are living on subsistence levels of income,
often for long periods of time, who need access to the social fund for
one-off
costs.</div><a name="09021070000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I am relaxed about the proposals for private
sector providers. The real urgency is to provide avenues of affordable
credit for poor people. As I visit our service users in
Barnardo&#146;s, I meet many families who, rather than getting loans
from credit unions or the social fund, have gone to some of the other
high street providers. I have in my bag the current application form of
the Provident, which is the main company. The interest rate on its most
popular loan of &#163;300, with a weekly repayment of &#163;15 a
week, is 351 per cent. For families who already have virtually nothing,
debt like that at such interest rates drives them into the most
appalling situation. If something could be done on the availability of
the social fund and if the grants system could be looked at, as Eddy
has suggested, it could make things dramatically easier for some of our
poorest families.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
59</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000273"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> May I follow up what Martin said with the other
two bodies represented? Martin put his finger on the problem of
unaffordable credit, but what scope do you see for the social fund
providing affordable credit? I know that you have spoken about
grants&#151;I understand the argument about grants versus a
loan&#151;but taking the issue that we are trying to deal with, which
is unaffordable credit and the interest rates of 300 per cent. or 1,000
per cent. that doorstep lenders charge, do you see a role for the
social fund in addition to providing a certain amount of interest-free
lending, perhaps in providing the facility for low-cost
credit?</div>
<a name="09021070000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> We have pushed for consideration of how the
social fund could also meet the needs of people in low-paid work for a
long time. Currently, it is restricted to benefit claimants, and the
transition from being a claimant to being in low-paid work has been
difficult. Providing affordable credit to low-paid and poor people is
difficult and expensive, as every study has stated. We are keen to see
proposals on how it could work, and there might be a role for an
expanded social fund, but its first job must be to meet the severe
needs that it currently meets. Then we need to take a good look, but
that might not be possible in the time scale for this Bill. Our
frustration relates to the wider issue of providing affordable
credit.</div>
<a name="09021070000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Eddy
Graham:</b></i> CPAG&#146;s concern is about where the
distinction would be drawn between an extension of affordable credit
and what the social fund currently does: providing money to people on
benefits to buy essential items. The idea of charging interest to
people through an expanded scheme for renewing basic household items,
such as cookers, washing machines and beds, which is what we worry that
any expanded scheme might drift into, seems completely out of
place.</div>

about extending loans on a commercial basis at a low interest rate. I
reiterate that the social fund is for the neediest and poorest people,
and we would not want the charging of interest to creep into loans for
replacement of basic household items, which is what it is currently
used
for.</div><a name="09021070000060"></a>

Narey:</b></i> I think that in addition to arrangements for
absolutely basic items&#151;I agree entirely that as far as possible
they should be provided free&#151;there is a case for some sort of
affordable credit. Many families, not illegitimately in my view, want
to borrow money for things that are not essential. The Provident
mailshot before Christmas was aimed directly at mothers, who were asked
whether they wanted to provide a decent Christmas for their kids.
Paying such an interest rate to do something that we all want to do is
pretty
sinful.</div><a name="09021070000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not being glib. I know that the default rate on such loans is very
high, and my colleagues behind me have reminded me that in Scotland we
have been looking at the possibility of Barnardo&#146;s issuing
loans, but we have calculated that to break even, without making a
penny profit, the interest rate would have to be very
high.</div><a name="09021070000063"></a>

would be lending to very high-risk families, but some of the companies
that I am talking about could have lower interest rates than their
current rates, as demonstrated by their high
profitability.</div><a name="09021070000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><a name="09021070000277"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): May I take you back to
conditionality? There are two issues. In the CPAG evidence that you
kindly provided for Second Reading, you said that conditionality is
wrong in the current economic circumstances. The Barnardo&#146;s
memorandum shows that the current economic climate makes it even more
important to promote work experience. So there is a difference of view
there, which seemed to me to be encapsulated in what you said at the
beginning about a difference in attitude to conditionality for lone
parents as a whole, with the four at one end of the table being
anti-conditionality and you, Martin Narey, if not being pro, then not
accepting it as much of a
negative.</div><a name="09021070000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
you like to comment first on whether there is a polarity between you in
terms of the acceptance of conditionality, and secondly, within that,
on the relevance and the impact that you think the current economic
circumstances have on the issue of conditionality?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div><a name="09021070000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Martin Narey,
since you are the loner in this group, perhaps you might like to
start.</div><a name="09021070000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> So I am a pariah here. On most things to do
with child poverty, most of us agreed on the things that needed to be
done and we all agree, I think, that most people who are not in work
want to get into work and make a better future for their children, and
we agree that they should be given all assistance. We simply differ on
the following: I think that when help is not taken up and individuals
refuse any assistance to get them into work, ultimately, in the
people&#146;s interests and those of their children, there is a case
for conditionality to encourage them
further.</div><a name="09021070000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of your question was about the recession. I read the Second
Reading debate and saw that mentioned a couple of times. The experience
of previous recessions is that some people have drifted out of work for
ever and have never got back into work. The fact that we are entering a
recession and the fact that there may be fewer jobs does not mean that
there is not a case for trying to get people who are persistently,
long-term unemployed work-ready. We will not be in this recession for
ever, but history shows that sometimes the damage caused in the
recession means that you can never get people back into work when it is
over.</div><a name="09021070000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> I do not think that there is necessarily
that much of a conflict. This can be overstated. As I reiterated at the
beginning, we think that it is important to give people the support
that helps them towards work. In the current economic situation, where
the claimant count and the numbers out of work rise, you will see
people who are a long way from being work-ready potentially being put
in competition for a declining number of
jobs.</div><a name="09021070000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
there is a limited amount of resources to go round. Secondly, some of
the people who we all want to see given work-related support can be
quite a number of years from being job-ready, for example because of
the circumstances of their life, the age of their children and
particular barriers that they might face, which emerge when a holistic
personal assessment is made of a person&#146;s needs. Certainly,
during this time there is potential for them to be helped. You can do
work with someone who is, perhaps, roughly five years away from being
ready to contend and go directly into the labour market that will bring
them, over the next couple of years of economic difficulty, to being
three years away from that point. The question is not whether that work
should be done, but what is the right and most effective way of doing
it and whether stepping up conditionality is what
works.</div><a name="09021070000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Child Poverty Action Group would like to see investment in support.
There are some good voluntary sector programmes that are getting good
results, but we do not think those will work if they have to be put
inside the red tape of sanctions bureaucracy that undermines the way in
which the voluntary sector works and the trust relationships that are
built.</div><a name="09021070000073"></a>

yes.</div><a name="09021070000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> Like the CPAG, our view on this is
evidence-based. We are interested in what works in respect of getting
parents back to work. The Department for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>Work and Pensions published its own research last summer, saying that
the impact of sanctions on single parents&#146; decisions about work
was negligible. That research looked at the actual barriers to people
taking up jobs, such as child care, lack of flexibility around working
and difficulties with caring for children with disability and health
issues. We have seen a big increase in single-parent employment over
the last 10 years without the impact of sanctions. We do not think
sanctions are the most effective way of achieving this
change.</div><a name="09021070000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Weir:</b></i> May I add to that by looking pragmatically at
what is going on? A lot of experience shows that while the job entry
rate for lone parents is very good, 29 per cent. of them are
back on IS within a year. There is an issue about how to keep people in
work. Similarly, while there has been a huge success with Government
programmes such as the new deal for lone parents, there are barriers
when you pursue a &#147;work first&#148; approach too strongly. You
risk getting people into low-paid jobs rather than sustainable
longer-term work opportunities. It takes the emphasis off skills
building. You get into a risk of cycling where people go into a
low-paid job, fall back out again, get into debt and suffer the
consequent problems. There is a need to look pragmatically at how to
support people along a path of working with their aspirations, building
their skills and getting the work path right for their personal
circumstances. We want something to work long term to get that family
out of poverty, rather than lots of churning through a system that does
not achieve that
goal.</div><a name="09021070000077"></a>

65</b><a name="09021070000280"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): This question follows on from
that last point on conditionality. I noticed as well, Mr.
Narey, that you had said you were more in favour of conditionality. I
wonder whether that is in favour of conditionality whatever the level
of benefits. Or are you saying that the present benefits are excessive
and therefore families could afford to lose a bit? Or would you be in
favour if benefits were higher and the extra bit of benefits could be
conditional?</div><a name="09021070000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I certainly do not think there is an extra bit
of benefits. I think our benefits are very low and families living on
benefits, as well as some families with one or more parents in
full-time work, are frequently in dire poverty, by any measure. There
is a wider issue for the Government to do something about that. That
presents formidable problems in protecting children if you are applying
sanctions to benefit levels that are already very low. I have been
critical of the Government many times in recent years, not least on
issues of child poverty, but both in conditionality of benefits and the
allied and important subject of conditionality for getting 16 and
17-year-olds back into work or training, the Government are grasping
some difficult nettles that need grasping. We cannot allow young people
to be damaged by decisions made very early in their lives or decisions
made by their parents.</div>

Mason:</b> May I press you on that? I understand that some
Nordic countries have conditionality but starting from a higher base.
What happens to a family that is on the minimum when you take that
away? Do they steal or do the grandparents have to
pay?</div><a name="09021070000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> That is a very real problem and I do not have
a ready answer. I am saying that in principle, despite those problems,
the Government are right to look at conditionality because the ultimate
prize is getting a family out of long-term poverty. We know the
probability that a child brought up in poverty in a workless family
will bring their own children up in poverty. The potential break in
that cycle is worth exploring. Of course, you have to ensure that
children are reasonably protected. Some people refuse to work. We
cannot dodge that. Although I accept entirely that most people who are
unemployed want to work, there are some people who simply do not want
to and resist any attempt to get them to work. That is very damaging
for them and it is appalling for their
children.</div><a name="09021070000083"></a>

away?</div><a name="09021070000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> It is instructive, again, to make the
comparison with employment and support allowance. The Government have
said that there is a level below which adult benefits should not fall,
but that they will pay an additional premium to those who take steps to
get back to work. We reiterate that we are disappointed that that is
not the approach that has been taken for single
parents.</div><a name="09021070000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Responding
to your question about what happens to people when they get sanctioned,
the research shows that people have to borrow from family and friends.
They often suffer from financial hardship and increased stress, neither
of which are good conditions for moving back to work. Your point about
the adequacy of benefit levels is very important.</div>
<a name="09021070000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Eddy
Graham:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>The sanctions regime in the
British welfare state has been directed at jobseeker&#146;s allowance
claimants&#151;people who are required to be available for work, who
do not have health conditions and who are actively seeking work. It has
now been extended to whole groups of people who have health problems
and child care responsibilities, and lone parents. The impact of
substantial cuts in benefit on those groups is bound to be greater than
on those on jobseeker&#146;s allowance, 80 or 90 per cent.
of whom leave the benefit within six months anyway because they find
other work for themselves or move into education or training. The
impact on families, children and sick and disabled people is one of our
major concerns.</div>
<a name="09021070000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are right
to say that a fair amount of cherry-picking takes place when new
schemes are devised. The Nordic countries that have fairly
comprehensive social insurance schemes that protect people from poverty
ally that with a high level of conditionality. In this country,
claimants are being asked to do more and more in worsening economic
conditions for nothing else&#151;for benefits that still leave them
below the poverty line.</div>

whereby, because of sanctions and conditionality in the welfare system,
parents are pushed from of out-of-work poverty into in-work poverty in
which they do not see any benefit to their income or to their family.
All they get is a net loss of time, and as a consequence their set of

the attention of the witnesses to two other parts of the Bill. First,
some proposals have been put forward on part 3 on the amendments on

travel authorisations have to be taken through the court process.
Ministers contend that that is not effective and want to move to an
administrative process. I am interested to hear each of your comments

end result, which is getting more absent parents to pay maintenance. If
you broadly support that approach, do you think that any changes need
to be made to the Bill as a
result?</div><a name="09021070000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fiona
Weir:</b></i> The first thing to say is that after all these
years of trying to enforce better child maintenance systems, we still
have a situation in which only one in three parents are receiving
maintenance for their children, which is little short of scandalous and
leads to a number of children remaining in poverty. The estimates show
that if all the non-resident parents who were currently assessed as
required to pay actually paid up, it would lift another 100,000
children out of poverty. It is important to understand the vital
importance of stepping up enforcement.</div>
<a name="09021070000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, and while we are strongly supportive of giving CMEC a lot more
enforcement powers, it will be extremely important for the Committee to
examine very carefully how the administrative changes would work. It
will require very scrupulous measures to examine the issue of wilful
and culpable neglect by the non-resident parent and it will be
necessary to be really sure about the transparency of the appeals
process so that the non-resident parent affected has proper warning and
opportunity to appeal against the decision should they wish to do so.
The reason that is so important is not just because of the obvious
issues of fairness and so on; if there is a backlash, a sense of
unfairness, it will be counter-productive as we step up the enforcement
powers. It is important that we do not create a sense of there being
martyrs when the problem that we are trying to tackle is that of people
who are not contributing to their child&#146;s upbringing. Being
sensitive to the need to get that right is important for the Committee
as it looks at the fine
detail.</div><a name="09021070000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also important to consider some other things. The evidence shows
that where it is safe, it is in the interests of children for both
parents to engage. If a non-resident parent needs their car to see
their child, it is important that you do not take away their driving
licence. Getting that kind of detail right is important. We also urge
the Committee to look at extending the review period of 24 months that
applies to the driving  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>licences to the provisions for passports. The motivation behind the Bill
is well driven and there is much that we are supportive of, but getting
the details right is
crucial.</div><a name="09021070000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000285"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Before I ask the others to comment&#151;perhaps
they can comment on this piece as well&#151;do you see any evidence
from the work that you do with families and both, if you like, the
remnants of the Child Support Agency and the new cases dealt with by
CMEC that the accuracy of the assessments is such that the enforcement
powers would be used accurately and that the right people would be
targeted? Do you have any sense of that having
improved?</div><a name="09021070000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> These processes are being used as an absolute
last resort. A long process of enforcement will have taken place where
the non-resident parent will have had multiple opportunities to say,
&#147;I think my assessment is wrong.&#148; We are seeing these as
a last resort, but once the process has been followed, we think that we
probably need some kind of backstop there to say, &#147;You have an
obligation and you need to pay
maintenance.&#148;</div><a name="09021070000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> The Child Poverty Action Group has less
knowledge and expertise in this area than Gingerbread, so I will be
brief. We do not really know enough about the accuracy of assessments
to comment. We believe that improving enforcement is important because
of the potential that that has to lift more children out of poverty. We
recognise that that might require new and stronger powers for CMEC. We
urge caution in consideration of the specific proposals on driving
licences, on the grounds that it may have an impact on child contact
with a non-resident parent and on the livelihood of a non-resident
parent.</div><a name="09021070000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Narey:</b></i> I am afraid that I am going to break the
consensus a little again. I have spent a lot of my time visiting our
400 projects around the UK. I was in a Sure Start centre on Friday and
saw there what I always see: mums by themselves bringing up two or
three children in the complete absence of the father. There is a
complete absence of any contribution from the father&#151;economic or
emotional. I would be very hard-line on bringing those fathers to
account, both to make them fulfil their responsibilities to the
children and to discourage future fathers from behaving fecklessly and
irresponsibly and leaving young mums in the
lurch.</div><a name="09021070000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000286"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The second area that I wanted to touch on was part
4 of the Bill on birth registration. I want to get a quick sense of
whether you think the provisions in the Bill will be effective in
practice in encouraging fathers&#151;that is whom it is largely aimed
at&#151;to take more responsibility, both in acknowledging their role
as the father and in
contributing.</div><a name="09021070000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> We are concerned about part 4 of the Bill. We
are obviously extremely keen to see fathers involved in their
children&#146;s lives as much as possible, but although the problem
of sole registration is small and declining, we do not think that the
best way to achieve greater father involvement is through legislation.
Some research by the DWP indicated that the decision was often being
taken long before that point and was very much dependent on the kind of
relationship that was going on at that point. Although we would very
much like to see programmes and projects to promote early involvement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>during pregnancy, for example, we have some concerns about the
effectiveness and feasibility of doing that through
legislation.</div>
<a name="09021070000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
particularly concern we have is that single parents who feel that it
would be unsafe to put their former partner&#146;s name, or that of
the father of their child, on the birth certificate be protected. A
proposed clause in the legislation states that such parents will be
able to exclude themselves from the joint birth registration proposals,
but we need a bit more detail on how exactly that will work and the
kind of evidence they will have to provide in such a
situation.</div><a name="09021070000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000287"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I wanted to focus on responses in terms of the
Bill&#146;s effectiveness. My reading of the Bill&#151;I am sure
others will correct me if I am wrong&#151;is that it is actually weak
in terms of the compulsory element, because simply not knowing the
father&#146;s whereabouts is a sufficient reason for the mother not
to put his name down. To be honest, I am not entirely sure that will
make a terribly big impact on registration, but let us assume that it
will. I just wanted to focus on its effectiveness, so your response was
very
helpful.</div><a name="09021070000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> Again, this is not really an area of our
expertise. If the focus is going to be on effectiveness, I think one of
the key things that can be done is simply to better resource the
enforcement.</div><a name="09021070000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin

73</b><a name="09021070000288"></a><b class="B">Helen
Jones</b> (Warrington, North) (Lab): Mr. Nichols,
may I take you back to something you said earlier? You said that there
could be developmental issues, with children as I understood it, or
problems with teenagers, that prevent a parent of young children from
preparing for work. Will you elaborate on what those problems might
be?</div><a name="09021070000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> For the earlier years, more and more is
being learned about the specific caring requirements of very young
children and the key developmental stages and neurological development
that they go through in terms of things that can have a potential
impact right into adult life. That makes it of great importance that
parents are able to provide a very high standard of care. If they
decide that providing care themselves is the best standard, they should
be left in a position to do that.</div>
<a name="09021070000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
convinced that there is a capacity of very high quality child care for
younger children, where the ratio of carers to infants is of a
sufficient level to meet some of the concerns that are being expressed.
It is a difficult area, because the scientific evidence is still
emerging, but it is such that we would have concerns about entering
into a situation where parents did not have those
choices.</div><a name="09021070000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000289"></a>Helen
Jones:</b> First, the scientific evidence is far from
conclusive, as I think you would agree. Secondly, we are talking about
single parents going to work when their children are seven. I have two
questions for you that follow from
that.</div><a name="09021070000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
how are the issues you are raising different in developmental terms for
children with single parents as opposed to those who are fortunate
enough to have two parents present? Secondly, once children are at
school&#151;at seven, they should be quite settled at primary school
because they will have been there for two years&#151;how does a
parent not being at work affect their
development?</div><a name="09021070000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate

75</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000290"></a>Helen

if you do not mind. The question was to
him.</div><a name="09021070000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim

are their parental care needs at the time. It is one area that is

exactly what the activities might
be.</div><a name="09021070000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000294"></a>Helen
Jones:</b> Most do not have a choice. Firms that keep in touch
with staff who are on maternity or paternity leave, to keep them in
touch with the workplace until they are ready to go back to work, are
considered to be following good practice, are they not? So why do you
feel it is wrong to have a system that keeps single parents who are not
working in touch with the world of work until it is time for them to go
back to
work?</div><a name="09021070000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> I feel as though I am being misinterpreted
as making an argument against contact with work and work-related

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021070000295"></a>Helen

are.</div><a name="09021070000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> That is not the argument that I am making.
My argument is about choice and about people not being put into a
regime whereby directions are given and people are subject to
sanctions. We support access to work-related activity for people whose
youngest children are down to that age level&#151;or, indeed, any age
level; I do not think an age level is specified&#151;and we would
support having much stronger entitlement that people can pursue to make
use of work-related activity, but we do not think that compulsion is
necessary or desirable.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
80</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000296"></a>Helen

whom there are quite a lot, who are holding down one or two jobs to
keep their family going, as to why single parents should not take steps
to make themselves ready for work at an appropriate time?</div>
<a name="09021070000236"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> I do not think I would make an argument that
they should not take steps. I would argue that, in terms of effectively
progressing people along the road back into work, this system of
compulsion is not the most effective. I would argue that some
programmes out there are working very successfully using outreach work,
for example. Instead of using compulsion to bring a parent into an
office, to give them directions about what they should be doing, they
take a friendlier approach&#151;knocking on doors, but not using
compulsion, and talking about the whole range of challenges that people
face and when they would like to go back to work, as well as looking at
that whole
path.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
81</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000297"></a>Helen
Jones:</b> The evidence that we were given earlier suggested
that most single parents would like to get back into work, and we all
accept that. The difficulty is with those who will not engage with the
system. What would be your answer about them? Should we leave them and
their children in workless families, with the effect that will have on
their children as they grow
up?</div><a name="09021070000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> I think it is a mistake to believe, if
people are pushed through a bureaucratic system, and people are
checking things in a certain way and ticking boxes as they go through,
that those people have genuinely engaged with that system. You can give
all the appearances of doing that, and you can get reports that give
that appearance, which will go to politicians and Ministers, but my
experience of going through such a system is that the reality of
someone being engaged with it, even if they are sat there and all the
forms are being filled in and all the boxes are being ticked, is
something very different.</div>
<a name="09021070000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we
generally see, in the whole direction of welfare reform, is an overall
idea about how people are motivated and how you work with
people&#146;s psychology. That is very much about giving them pushes,
rather than nurturing their motivation. If you look into areas of
social research and social psychology, you will find that extrinsic
motivation, which comes from outside, which could be perceived as a
threat, is less successful than techniques that nurture intrinsic
motivation.</div><a name="09021070000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021070000298"></a>Helen

82</b><a name="09021070000299"></a><b class="B">Meg
Munn</b> (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab/Co-op): I wanted to come
back to joint birth registration, about which the witnesses have not
had much to say. I want to explore it a bit more from the angle of the
rights of the child. It seems to me that regardless of the
father&#146;s background, and even in situations where a father is
violent and it may not be desirable for him to have contact with his
child, it is a fundamental right for every person to know who their
biological parents are. Wherever possible, we should try to achieve
that. There is extensive research about the importance of such
knowledge; for example, research on people who were adopted, some of
whom want to find out who their parents were. Therefore, I am a little
surprised that you seem to be as hands-off as you are on the
question.</div><a name="09021070000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mark
Harper asked about the effectiveness of the legislation and whether it
would work, but I want to push this a little further. Is it
intrinsically important to children that they have written down
somewhere who their parents
are?</div><a name="09021070000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> Basically, our objections to the legislation
stem from the effectiveness principle. We do not think that the
legislation will be an effective way of achieving the laudable aim of
ensuring that all children know who their parents are, and of
safeguarding both parent and child&#151;there may be real dangers to
both mother and child from contact with the father. We do not feel that
the legislative process will necessarily achieve the aim. It will have
an impact on parents and children but will be difficult to put into
practice, and that raises some concerns.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div><a name="09021070000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">One thing that
we have been thinking about is a situation where the mother says,
&#147;Yes, I would like the father&#146;s name on the birth
certificate,&#148; and the father is written to but makes no contact,
and that delays the joint birth registration. We do not know what will
happen to the child benefit application during that time, because a
birth certificate is needed to apply for child benefit. Our concerns
about this section of the Bill are pragmatic, but those pragmatic
concerns are what will impact on
families.</div><a name="09021070000132"></a>

convicted paedophile who has a child and is deemed to be extremely
dangerous to children should never have contact with the child while
they are a child. None the less, it does not mean that the name should
not appear on the birth certificate, however difficult that information
is. It is what follows that matters. I am somewhat surprised that there
is not a bit more thinking on some of these issues and how we might
achieve that desirable outcome while safeguarding
children.</div><a name="09021070000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate

Bell:</b></i> We are talking about evidence and the publicity
around the benefits of joint birth registration. We have been doing
some work with the Department for Children, Schools and Families on a
campaign called Kids in the Middle, in which we have looked at
programmes that promote better relationships between the parents of a
child, whether they are together or apart, and ensuring that they are
both involved in the child&#146;s life. We think that those
programmes will make much more of a difference, and they are where we
would like to see investment and energy

86</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000303"></a>Meg

should aim to achieve will begin to change the view in society? Instead
of saying that something is okay, that it does not matter, society will
say that it is important to have both the names on the
certificate.</div><a name="09021070000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate

action plan between the parent and the adviser and could never force a
parent to take up work or to put their child into inappropriate child
care? I am asking you whether your organisation is aware of
that.</div>
<a name="09021070000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim

the question of how concrete those guarantees will be, we will want to

going to give a simple yes or no, I shall need to know the specific
circumstances. Scientific evidence details and outlines the pattern of
care, how many children are being cared for at one time and whether the
situation involves group care or parental care; scientists will look at
the pattern of that parental care. If I answer a question in that way,
I do not think that it can be meaningful in respect of the scientific
evidence that I have read.</div>

94</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000311"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Time is pressing, so I shall move on. You said
that lone parents who move into work do not gain anything in terms of
income, and that all they gain&#151;I wrote it down&#151;is a net
loss of time. Could you explain what evidence you have for
that?</div>
<a name="09021070000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tim
Nichols:</b></i> I said that there is potential for lone
parents to move into work but to gain little net benefit in income,
because a transition into work does not necessarily mean a transition
out of poverty. On the better-off calculation that a jobcentre
provides, some costs are not taken into account, such as the transport
costs of taking a child to child care in one place, getting to a job
and then returning to the child care. So, the current calculations are
not robust enough to convince us that people will definitely be better
off. We worry that they will go to work and lose time with their child,
but not be left in a financially better
situation.</div>

Chairman:</b> Professor Gregg, will you kindly introduce
yourself to the Committee?</div>
<a name="09021070000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> My name is Professor Paul Gregg, and I am a

95</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000314"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>Thank you. Before colleagues ask
questions, will you kindly comment on the Bill?</div>
<a name="09021070000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> I have not read the Bill, but I wrote
something that it was, supposedly, based upon. As an opening statement
I would like to say that the ideas here are part of something that has
been developing over the past 10 years or so, by which I mean the
activational objective of taking people who are relatively inactive, or
not searching for work, and moving them into an engaged situation to
raise activity. That strand has been developing for 10 or 12 years. The
new element, which is the part that I feel has not received enough
attention, is marrying that, for the groups that are not job-ready,
with the advocacy element of sitting them down, talking about what they
want, where they want to go and what needs, supports, and capabilities
they have, and trying to design an intervention that helps them to make
the journey that they would like to engage in. That draws a little on
other areas of welfare reform&#151;personalised budgets for the
disabled in social services. It is trying to bring those ideas into
welfare to work and say, &#147;Let us engage with you as an
individual,&#148; rather than having a rules-based system of saying,
&#147;You have to do this&#148; or &#147;You have to do
that,&#148; which is the traditional model for the job-ready
jobseekers, but does not fit for those who are not job-ready. We need a
subtler approach that is more about engaging with the individual,
talking to them about where they want to go and then trying to deliver
it, which has a parallel with advocacy. In a sense, I would like to
lodge that as an opening statement because it tries to bring those two
parts together and I want to make sure that that has got through. I
feel that that second part was often missed in some of the discussions
that I overheard. I am happy to leave it there.</div>
<a name="09021070000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021070000315"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. Mr.
Harper.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div><a name="09021070000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000316"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I just wanted to touch on two things in your
report. The first is about what age a child has to reach before single
parents are expected to move into or prepare for work, which was
probably the most publicised bit and I do not know whether you were
happy about that. They are your progression-to-work group, and I would
like to touch on the extent to which you felt that sanctions and
compulsion was appropriate for parents of children of those
ages.</div>
<a name="09021070000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
extract is your recommendations, which are partly taken up in the White
Paper and the Bill, about the funding models of welfare to work and
about the split between annually managed expenditure and departmental
expenditure limit; using benefit savings to fund programmes.</div>
<a name="09021070000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will begin
by addressing the first point. I was not entirely clear about something
in your report on the progression to work group. What was reported was
that you had said that parents of children as young as one would be
expected to take part in activity to prepare them for work at a later
date. I was not quite clear about something. I think you said that
parents of children between one and three would be in a more
&#147;relaxed&#148; category. I was not quite sure about that.
Perhaps you could elaborate on that, so that the members of the
Committee are clear about your views, what you said in your report and
the extent to which that may or may not have informed what is in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09021070000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> What is going on here for people with younger
children is not a case of, &#147;You have to look for work or you
have to take that job.&#148; It is a case of engaging them in a
discussion to ask, &#147;When would you like to return to work and
what do we need to put in place for that to happen when you are
ready?&#148; To use a phrase that somebody else used in the
discussion, it is a case of, &#147;When you are ready, let&#146;s
make sure you are ready,&#148; so that we have dealt with the basic
skills problems and any other problem from the range of potential
problems that an individual may have. Consequently, when they are ready
to make that transition&#151;I do not mind if it is when the child is
three, five, seven or younger, because that is up to the person in
discussion with the benefit adviser or provider&#151;and they feel
that it is right to go back to work, part of the agreement with them is
that we have dealt with the underlying issues. So we do not just wait
until the child is five or seven and say to the parent, &#147;Hey,
you have basic skills problems, let&#146;s deal with them
now;&#148; we should have got that out of the way first.</div>
<a name="09021070000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">So that is
the position, in my head. The idea is not to say, &#147;You have to
look for work or you have to do this.&#148; Instead the idea is to
say, &#147;Let&#146;s set out the timeline that is right for
you.&#148; Some people will elect to go back to work while their
children are relatively young&#151;one, two, three or
whatever&#151;while other people will say, &#147;This is not right
for me; I want to go back to work a bit later.&#148; However, we must
ensure that the problems and barriers that they will face after being
out of work for some time are dealt with by the time they are ready to
start that process.</div>
<a name="09021070000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">For me,
therefore, the age issue is less of an issue than the kind of
discussion that we were just hearing. It is about the person saying,
&#147;I think that I would like to try to go back to work when my
child is three,&#148; and we say, &#147;Let&#146;s make sure that
everything&#146;s done before that, so that when you are ready to do
it, you are ready to go.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="09021070000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">While their
children are between the ages of one and three, you may wish to place
certain restrictions on the type of intermediate activities that people
can be compelled to do. I am just putting that on the table. In my
view, I do not see strong reasons why you need to do that, because it
is about an individual agreement that the person makes with you.
However, it may be felt by Parliament or others that there are certain
relaxations around the direction. That seems to be the one area of
contention. It is a case of, &#147;Okay, if they agree to it,
that&#146;s fine,&#148; but if there is some direction required,
and the provider feels that it is reasonable for the person to
undertake an activity, you may put certain limits on what the person
can be directed to do. I think that is a fairly small area, but you may
say that, where there are children below the age of three, perhaps
direction to achieve certain things, when the person is not willing to
agree to it, is inappropriate.</div>
<a name="09021070000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000317"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Just to be clear about the timeline, at what age
for the child do you think that parents on benefit ought to be
compelled to look for work? Also, how long a run-up period, as it were,
is reasonable to deal with some of their skill issues and some of the
underlying problems that they may need to overcome to prepare them for
work? In other words, if you say that getting them into work when the
child is seven is appropriate and, say, two years was the period to
deal with some of their underlying issues&#151;there would clearly be
different periods in different cases&#151;then you would start the
process when the child was five. I am just working out how far you go
back for that run-up period&#151;or is it not that
straightforward?</div><a name="09021070000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> In my head, it is not a case of, &#147;We
say when it has to be&#148;&#151;I will talk about the upper age in
a minute. Instead, within that period when the child is between one and
seven, it is not a case of, &#147;We think that it is right or
appropriate for you to be moving into work when your child is one, or
three, or four.&#148; There is a dialogue with the person about what
is right for them.
</div><a name="09021070000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
had a little debate earlier about the scientific evidence of child
neurological development. The key point is that that development is not
uniform. There is no black and white or this and that&#151;it has to
be about the dialogue with individual mums. Children who have
disabilities will need a different kind of interpretation. So that
allows those individuals to have a dialogue&#151;for one to say,
&#147;For me, it is not right,&#148; but for another to say,
&#147;Yes, go for it&#148; and you just support them through that
process.</div>
<a name="09021070000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
an upper age limit, is there a point at which you move into
conventional JSA? There are two issues here. One is, does it have any
side effects on the children? There is a limited piece of
evidence&#151;and it concerns teenagers, not
seven-year-olds&#151;which suggests that a reduction in the
supervision that lone parents can provide can cause some children to go
off the rails. That is American evidence, where they do not have the
kind of child care and after-school environment that we have. So I will
say that there is some evidence, but it might not apply in our
circumstances because we do have a much more structured after-school
system than the US.</div>
<a name="09021070000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bottom
line is that we have two models. One is support and engagement moving
towards looking for work and moving on; and the other is the JSA model,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>with job search at the beginning, support later. It is a sort of
shake-out model. You wait and hope for people to disappear in the short
term and then you start investing when you get to six months, or a
year, in flexible new deal. You are trying to lose the easy stuff
without spending any money, which is reasonable enough, and then and
only then do you start investing in the support services. It is an open
question which of those two models is right for families at different
ages.</div>
<a name="09021070000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
whether seven is the right line, but I would like to see us test it.
Let us look at the model that is being introduced of switching people
to JSA and look at the effects there, and let us look at the
alternative model&#151;support first leading towards work and
engagement&#151;and find out which one works better, not just in
terms of job outcomes and income, although that is pretty central, but
also in terms of child
well-being.</div><a name="09021070000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
98</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000318"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> So, to clarify what you feel is appropriate to be
mandatory, the mandatory piece should be the engagement of the parent,
with the adviser, to have the
conversation?</div><a name="09021070000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> Yes; to have the conversation and to follow it
up when a plan is
agreed.</div><a name="09021070000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
99</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000319"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> And to agree on a
plan?</div><a name="09021070000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> Yes, and follow it once you have agreed it,
subject to flexibilities of changing it, but fundamentally you agree
it. But it does not say you have to do this at age one or you have to
do this at age two. The whole point is that it is flexible around the
individual. That is why it is called
&#147;personalised&#148;&#151;that is the buzz
word.</div><a name="09021070000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
100</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000320"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> As far as you are concerned, the personalisation
bit is key to the mandatory bit. If you did the mandatory bit with some
sort of prescribed solution, that would not be the right thing to
do.</div><a name="09021070000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> Yes. For this kind of group, I think that is
right. The diversity of the group that we are looking at means that
something laid down from on high by the Department for Work and
Pensions at the centre to try to give a blanket story for kids of a
certain age, or families of certain types, is not the right approach.
We are moving to a much more flexible model. That is why I am trying to
emphasise that second part, because you are trying to design it around
the individual rather than lay down rules at the centre: maximum
flexibility to front-line staff, fewer rules laid down from on high.
You agree an action plan, you work with the person, and you support and
encourage and try and push them a little bit. Once they agree to a
plan, it is agreed and then you follow it; that is the mandatory
part.</div>
<a name="09021070000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">At some stage
there is a kind of flip, when you move a person into a JSA regime,
which is the complete obverse in the sense that you have very strong
rules about what you do on day one, but no real support and engagement
until later. I am not clear whether seven is the right age for that and
I do not believe that anybody else is particularly certain that seven
is the right age, so we need to find out. We need to find out by
trialling them next door to each other, so we can try and see which one
works best.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div><a name="09021070000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021070000321"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Mr. Amess, I will come back to my other
point. I think I will wait and see how things
develop.</div><a name="09021070000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> Was that long
enough?</div><a name="09021070000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021070000322"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I think it was enough from me for the
moment.</div><a name="09021070000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
101</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000323"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> In your report, Professor Gregg, you state the
conditions you think are necessary to achieve a radically reformed
welfare system, as you put it&#151;that is your word. You have three
things: the vision of engagement and support; the system whereby that
engagement reflects the needs and capabilities of the individual; and
thirdly giving the claimants an ownership of this
process.</div><a name="09021070000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now,
all that focuses on the claimant. You and we are talking about the
concept of work-readiness. Where does the employer&#146;s vision fit
into that? We have a lot of experience of the welfare system thinking
it knows what work-readiness is and turning out claimants deemed
work-ready but the employer receiving that person saying they are not.
An employer&#146;s vision is important, is it not, because if we are
to translate all this work into jobs there has to be real employability
from the perspective of the employer. How important should their view
be and how do you fit it into this kind of welfare system?</div>
<a name="09021070000237"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> I agree with what you are saying but I would
broaden it slightly. Employers can also come with significant
prejudices&#151;against disabled people or people with mental health
problems or people with young children who they think are going to take
days off all the time. They come with a set of &#147;priors&#148;
and are often resistant to employing the kind of people that we are
looking at, partly for legitimate reasons such as that they do not have
the skills or attitudes, but also for some we might not think
appropriate. They have certain prejudices or &#147;priors&#148; and
we have good evidence of that. What can you do about it? We need a
process for the providers delivering this kind of thing to engage with
prospective employers. That could range from work trials to
intermediate labour markets or transitional jobs, giving people a mix
of work experience but also allowing employers to see the people to
challenge some of those prejudices.</div>
<a name="09021070000238"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">A
related point is that we need more employers saying that their
&#147;priors&#148; were wrong about this group&#151;that they
have taken on people who have had sickness or with disabilities, or
have taken on lone parents. Bunches of employers will stand up and say
that was the best thing they could have done&#151;that these are the
kind of workers who stay; they are not the ones who bugger off to the
job down the road that pays more, because stability is important to
them. We need more employers&#151;we need a campaign&#151;to
articulate what is valuable about these workers. So it is partly about
getting the employers engaged with the providers so that there is an
ongoing relationship and providers learn what employers want and need.
It is also partly about getting the people in front of the employers so
that they can see them and realise that some of their prejudices are
unjustified, and it is also about employers openly speaking about the
benefits. I have tried to articulate that. We have a range of work
experience, job trials, and transitional job-type models to put people
in front of employers before they take that hard decision, so they get
to know the people and that helps a
lot.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
102</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000324"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I appreciate your emphasis on that from the
point of view of dealing with whether employers have prejudices about
certain groups coming into their work force, and it is relevant that
you should talk about that. It was not exactly where I was coming from.
I have conversations with employers in my constituency all the time.
The sort of issues they raise are not so much to do with that but to do
with the attitude that someone might arrive with, communication skills
and concepts of team working. They say people arrive allegedly labelled
&#147;work-ready&#148; but with no concept of things like that. If
we are going to make this work in significant numbers, what I am trying
to get you to address is how we can bring in those who know about that
and have skills in transmitting those aptitudes to be part of a welfare
system preparing people for work on a large scale&#151;possibly
larger than first envisaged&#151;as this will start to come into
effect, hopefully, as we are coming out of
recession.</div><a name="09021070000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> You are probably right. I did not focus on
that enough. There are two fundamental points here. Jobcentre Plus has
been relatively poor about building ongoing relationships with
employers&#151;it views it in a sense as the matching of an
individual job. The providers of support services to the groups we are
focusing on&#151;the harder to help&#151;will, as part of their
functions, have to engage in that long-term relationship, which is a
dialogue. The employer feeds back what is wrong with the people they
are getting, and the provider tries to fix that. The reverse is the
dialogue, which I was trying to articulate, of trying to accommodate
the
others.</div><a name="09021070000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point, crucially, which I did not address so much&#151;we have
some experience of this&#151;is that what you get in the early months
is a major conflict of expectations between what the employer thinks
they want and are getting, and what the newly hired person is coming
with. I shall not say which side is right or wrong, but there is a
massive disconnect. The lone mother wants to take a bit of time off to
look after their kid because they are sick, and the employer is saying
that they need someone who comes in regularly and that they cannot have
people turning up three hours late with no notice. Negotiation or
conflict resolution is part of the ongoing process, so that the deal
for the providers does not end on moving them into the first job.
Crucial to what we have been moving towards is that they must look for
sustained employment, so they must deal early on with that crisis
management. In a sense they are acting as an arbitrator, ACAS-style,
between the different expectations on the two sides of the

a resolution.</div>
<a name="09021070000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
combination of trying to fix it when there are different expectations
after the person has started, but above all of having the dialogue
first to try to ensure that they produce the goods. Employers must
recognise that these people will not be perfect, model workers. That is
almost a given, in a sense, but you can do your damnedest to make it as
close as possible, and you must engage in the feedback process when the
employer says that the people are not suitable because they come with
the same sort of problems every time and that that must be fixed before
you send people to them. That is fine, but when the person is in post,
you start having to negotiate the conflict away and to get both sides
to give a bit to try to make it a viable, long-term
position.</div>

104</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000326"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> In your view, there is an important
progression-to-work group, which comes between people who are ready for
work and should be looking for work, and people for whom no
conditionality should be applied. The large progression-to-work group
consists of people on the journey to work, whether lone parents or
people in receipt of employment and support allowance. You will be
aware that we have a problem with many people who have claimed
employment and support allowance&#151;incapacity benefit as
was&#151;for a long time, many of them for more than five years. You
will be aware of the statistics on that. Do you see them as full
members of the progression-to-work group of whom the same should be
expected as of other members of the group, and that the conditions
should be applied to them as
well?</div><a name="09021070000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
105</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000327"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Should long-term employment and support
allowance claimants be full members of the progression-to-work group on
the journey to work alongside everyone else, and receive the same help
as everyone else, subject to the same
conditions?</div><a name="09021070000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> The short answer is yes. The longer answer is
that at this stage pathfinders are doing different things with
different groups. The AME-DEL one focuses on the long-term stock; the
multi-client group&#151;or some other phrase now&#151;consists of
new deal people, short-term unemployed and lone parents; and there is
another pilot. The pathfinder structure is that each one is doing
something slightly different, so that we can learn what each bit does
separately and what AME-DEL do distinct in their own box, while we
learn other things about conditionality and sanctions in other places.
If all that is put together in one big bang in a pathfinder, it is
difficult to isolate which bit works for each group. It is useful to
map it out and say, &#147;This is what is happening over here. We are
going to learn this from it.&#148; Then we can put the bits together
as the next stage, rather than trying to do everything as one big bang,
when it becomes difficult to work out what the positives and negatives
of all the bits
were.</div><a name="09021070000197"></a>

Gregg:</b></i> Indeed. It is almost testament to the inaction
over the last God knows how long. The other point that is worth making
is that there is the learning process, which I have just described, but
there is also a cost process. That is partly why that group is being
pushed into the AME-DEL territory where you try to align cost to the
potential receipt of savings, which is why that kind of group makes
most sense there. Longer term, this is in the territory of moving all
the boundaries that divide client groups by duration or IB versus lone
parent. We are moving in a direction of the single working age benefit
with a single, overarching system, but we are trying to focus the right
support on the right individuals. At the moment I am talking about it
in big groups, which is not necessarily the end game. The end game is
much more trying to allocate people on their own individual
circumstances. But the first stage, just for clarity and ease of
delivery, is to do it in clearly separated groups with clearly
separated
pathfinders.</div><a name="09021070000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
108</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000331"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> We have discussed sanctions a lot today. Views have
been expressed by a number of organisations that the way forward is not
sanctions but nurturing and encouragement. Clearly some of the
witnesses have not experienced doors being shut in their faces in the
way that I have in relation to things that you are trying to get people
to do. I should be interested to hear your views on sanctions. What do
think their role is? How can they be used in a way that will be
effective in encouraging more people into
work?</div><a name="09021070000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> An obvious point to say about sanctions, which
is trite but nevertheless true, is that you do not want to be
sanctioning people. It is a sign of failure, not success. So the first
and fundamental point is: how do we maximise the information flow to
avoid people being sanctioned through mistake or misunderstanding, and
only get into the territory where the sanction applies to people who
are refusing to engage or who are messing about in some way? A large
chunk of what I was trying to say is about whether we can improve that
process. I talked about an engagement process when people sign on to
make it very clear what the regime is and the process that will follow
if they do not engage. A warning is the first instance, so that you do
not instantly get into fines. You initially say, &#147;Look, you are
out of order. You&#146;ve gone wrong.&#148; And you make it very
clear to them why they have gone wrong. Then you have what is already
in existence. Essentially it is a slap-across-the-wrist fine&#151;a
fixed fine for non-compliance. Then, recognising that if this is going
on repeatedly there is something wrong&#151;either the person is
unable to engage in some way or they are simply unwilling to
engage&#151;you have to distinguish between the two.</div>
<a name="09021070000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have talked
about a review where someone like a compliance officer sits down with
the claimant and says, &#147;Why is this going wrong?&#148; Some
will say that they have agoraphobia which has not been picked up and
they cannot leave the home. Then you try to sort out that problem and
make sure that it happens for them. That is fine. Then you go back to
the beginning and you try a new system. For those who repeatedly refuse
to engage with the system, it is right and proper to have a credible
backstop position of a sanction which says, &#147;This is meant to be
a positive engagement strategy. We are trying to bring you through on
an engagement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>process. If you refuse actively to engage with the system, there is a
significant backstop which says that you will face a significant
intervention.&#148;</div>
<a name="09021070000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I tried
to float was a distinction between monetary and non-monetary
interventions. I draw the analogy that for ordinary people who park
their cars illegally you use fines&#151;you can assume that they have
money because they have a car&#151;but children do not have money so
you use time sanctions: penalties such as detention. Could we be more
flexible and think of non-monetary, time-based sanctions for those
groups for which money is obviously a big issue? For example, they
would have to come into their jobcentre or their Working Links provider
for a monitored activity, or, if they were able-bodied, they should
perhaps be going out and looking after old people&#146;s gardens. It
is a punishment, but a non-financial one. That is quite a new and
radical idea and has been implemented in a few countries. I recognise
that we have not covered this territory in the UK, but the idea of
non-monetary sanctions for client groups that are at significant risk
when money is taken away is interesting enough to
explore.</div><a name="09021070000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000332"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> That is really helpful. I have a final related
question, on the concerns that have been voiced about the power of
advisers. How does the system protect itself from unreasonable advisers
who are not following the process as you are, which suggests that they
are incapable of managing a complex
process?</div><a name="09021070000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> First, I do not think it is right for outside
providers to do the sanctioning. The Government are responsible for
that, and passing it over to charitable organisations and so on is not
appropriate. The buck stops with Jobcentre Plus. Information flows and
so on can come from providers, but the tough cop element
here&#151;the hard guy&#151;is JC Plus. Sanctioning is under
Government control, not the control of random
others.</div><a name="09021070000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
we need a series of checks and balances. The obvious one that we always
start with is a right of appeal, but I do not think that that is enough
here. We also need specialists with accumulated knowledge in JC Plus,
who have regular experience of this and can oversee more junior people.
But I would like to see systemic review of this kind of thing, which is
an Ofsted-type approach. Ofsted goes into schools and reports on
whether providers are delivering the model. On sanctions in Jobcentre
Plus, we would look at whether they were working as we intended or were
potentially being abused. So you have systemic assessment of the
system. An appeal system potentially deals with that person&#146;s
problem but does not pick up that collectively we have a
malfunction.</div><a name="09021070000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
alternative, or an addition, is a sort of ombudsman figure who has the
power to investigate when they hear lots of reports coming out. That
kind of appeal system, and also a more claimant-voice advocate/systemic
assessment is a necessary check and
balance.</div><a name="09021070000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000333"></a>John
Howell:</b> My question follows on well from Meg Munn&#146;s
questions. It is on the link between aspiration and delivery. There is
a lot of aspiration in your report, which to a certain extent is
reflected in some aspects of the Bill. But on delivery, my impression
is that we are in what you rather imaginatively described as the
shake-out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>model. Do you think that the way in which support will be delivered,
through a flexible new deal, will deliver the aspiration that you
started off with? I refer to your aspiration for the long-term
unemployed, the support starting after six months, the great fears
about parking for those who are furthest from the market, and the
opposite of that&#151;the creaming-off of the best in order to get
them through. Are the delivery mechanisms adequate to deliver your
aspiration?</div><a name="09021070000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> Let me take the specifics and then move to the
general. On parking and creaming, I fundamentally believe that a
flat-fee system encourages that. If you have a flat fee of
&#163;1,500 a head, you are going to look at some people and say,
&#147;This person is not worth investing in,&#148; and you will go
for the ones who give you your margin at the bottom. What I
specifically advocated trying&#151;I had a meeting with some DWP
officials this morning to discuss it&#151;is sometimes called an
escalator, or accelerator, model of funding. Broadly, that means that a
provider gets a group of people&#151;say 100&#151;and the
outcome-related payment rises the further they get through that
population. You start at relatively low costs, perhaps just enough to
cover their basic up-front fees, whereas the nth person, close to the
end, is very valuable to them, so they will always have an incentive to
work harder for the next person, even though that means they are doing
that work at the beginning. They know that if they go from 60 to 70 per
cent. they will get much bigger money than when they go from 40 to 50
per cent., so they will decide to work on those marginal people early
on, to ensure that they come out the right end.</div>
<a name="09021070000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two things
follow from that. One is that it is essential to have long-term
engagement: you have to own the people for a long time. That raises
questions about the flexible new deal ending after a year, when people
are sort of pushed off, or about lone parents going off somewhere else
when their children reach seven. I would advocate not having that
discontinuity of care, using pathfinder pilots that work with the
escalator model, so that people stay with that provider for longer than
one year, or until their kid turns seven. They should stay with the
same provider. Rules that might give a break of provider are unhelpful
in trying to overcome the creaming model and in giving people
incentives to go for harder-to-reach people. We need to look into that,
and I should like to see that happen within pathfinders, so that we can
learn the lesson more generally. That is the
specific.</div><a name="09021070000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
general terms, there are two points to be made. First, we have learned
a hell of a lot about working with client groups including the
long-term unemployed, the new deal for lone parents, the new deal for
disabled people and, more recently, pathways. What has been surprising
is how quickly organisations have ramped themselves up to be able to
deliver the new models. Yes, there is a learning curve, but JC Plus has
untapped potential. Lots of people are doing things by rote and do not
really have to use their brains. There is unmet potential there, as we
have found when JC Plus has been asked to deliver pathways in some
areas, when it has risen to the game quite successfully. Having said
that, there is clearly a cultural change going on here, and in good
Maoist tradition that needs a cultural re-education, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>otherwise known as retraining. We need an attempt  to produce a
new skills set within claimant offices and so on.</div>
<a name="09021070000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">To park that
issue slightly, I am very struck by the fact that providers typically
provide much higher-quality, calibre people, at higher wages, than
Jobcentre Plus. That might be an issue in the longer term. They
principally take graduates, and they pay them a lot more. That is a
particular problem for Jobcentre Plus in London, which is having real
difficulties with retention and so on. It tends to have, relatively,
less educated people and a high turnover, and that is never a good
business model. There might be ramifications to trying to build a skill
set and to trying to raise the quality of the position, and therefore
the staff, in the longer
term.</div><a name="09021070000216"></a>

Howell:</b> There are culture change elements to your
weddedness to the black box approach. Do you think there is enough
acceptance of that being a black box approach, both amongst the DWP and
the market as a whole, so that it is a pure black box? It has always
struck me that you cannot have a half-black box in this. That position
is probably the most comfortable for officials.</div>
<a name="09021070000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> Yes. There is a desire for control and that
will come from politicians and from senior officials in Jobcentre Plus
or the DWP. It is hard for central Government to let go in that kind of
black box way, so maybe they need a bit of re-education as well. That
is the way to go. We have tried a few experiments with it and they have
generally been positive. My view is that when JC Plus is given a new
task with a new set of rules, it tends to do almost as well as an
outside provider. It has some inside knowledge and it knows the game,
whereas the other groups are probably going to innovate. They are going
to learn and push, and a rules-based system crushes innovation.
Although in the first instance they may be reasonably comparable, my
argument is that the productivity&#151;the learning&#151;is much
greater in a black box model than in a rules-based model. That is what
we need to try to
release.</div><a name="09021070000218"></a>

Mason:</b> Earlier, you were discussing monetary and
non-monetary interventions. That is interesting. I think a lot of
people are open to conditionality, but they are asking, if there are
financial sanctions and people are already on a fairly minimum income,
what happens to those people and how can they live if their minimum
income is taken
away?</div><a name="09021070000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
113</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000336"></a>John

sanctions at all on a vulnerable group such as
that?</div><a name="09021070000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> My view is that for the JSA job-ready people,
there should be monetary sanctions. For the rest&#151;the progression
to work group, which is the harder-to-help group&#151;I am suggesting
minor monetary sanctions as a short, sharp shock, a slap across the
wrist. However, those should not be escalated into&#151;as happens
with the jobseeker&#146;s allowance people&#151;what might be
considered very severe sanctions. In relation to jobseeker&#146;s,
you can get disallowal, disentitlement and severe monetary sanctions
going on&#151;four, six or multiple weeks of sanctions. I
am  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>saying, I do not think that that is the best approach for this group;
can we look at doing it somewhat differently? By which I mean
non-monetary sanctions.</div>
<a name="09021070000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">You have a
basic slap across the wrist&#151;12 quid in the first
instance&#151;and you make sure that the person knows about it.
However, when we are looking at real breakdown and the high-conflict
end of the business, we do not go into heavy financial sanctions for
the reason you are describing. We try to do it rather differently. To
put it slightly differently, as someone else was saying, you do it more
through hassle, bringing the person in and ensuring that they are there
pretty much every day doing something, rather than using monetary
penalties. That is for exactly the reasons you are
describing.</div>
<a name="09021070000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
114</b><b class="B"><a name="09021070000337"></a>John
Mason:</b> Okay. Even for the job-ready group, would there not
be a knock-on effect on children, for example, and child poverty
aims?</div><a name="09021070000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> Yes, there are two points to make. For most
people with children, their own benefits make up a relatively small
proportion of the total income&#151;housing benefit and tax credits
and so on are the biggest ones. We really should be talking to people
at the extreme end. What I tried to describe was a series of steps
ranging initially from warning through to something more
serious.</div>
<a name="09021070000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
against the idea of non-monetary sanctions for the JSA population. That
is an eminently sensible idea, which we should try out. Because they
are job-ready, the range of things that you could ask them to do could
be much wider. In my head, I have the idea of community service where
you have to go and look after old people&#146;s gardens or whatever.
Doing that for your dole money is, as far as I am concerned, a
punishment. I am open to that idea and I would like to see that
experimented with, but it is very novel so it needs to be done
carefully and we need to know the implications. As a direction of
travel, I would like to see us trying out non-monetary sanctions for
both populations and learning a few lessons about whether they are
effective in getting people to
engage.</div><a name="09021070000226"></a>

Munn:</b> As we have time, I shall follow up the issues in
relation to people with learning disabilities. For a long time I have
been concerned about the tendency to find things for people to do that
are not necessarily related to their capabilities or what they can do.
I have seen some good examples in my own city of people doing voluntary
work that could perhaps lead to paid employment. There is still a real
need for a change of mindset, so that we see people as having some
skills and capabilities, rather than just finding them something to do
with their days. I should be interested to hear your views on that.
Because there is such a lot of discussion about these issues, including
sanctions and the like, often people who have not been in work and have
not had any help to identify how they could do something, either in the
paid sector or the voluntary sector, end up being extremely frightened
of what might happen to them in this process. I should also like to
hear your thoughts on how that can be dealt
with.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="09021070000228"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Gregg:</b></i> To be totally honest, this started for me when
thinking about adults with learning difficulties. I have a close
personal friend who was one of the early developers doing the early
work on the personal adviser advocacy role for adults with learning
disabilities. Rather than each profession having a columnar
relationship with the individual, you sit down with them and ask,
&#147;What do you want? How can we negotiate it?&#148; Often, they
want different things from those provided by the various agencies: they
want to learn to drive, to live independently and to start the process
of getting into work. They want diverse things. So you sit down with
them and try to work out, as an advocate, in a sense, how to negotiate
the package of support and so on, to try to get them where they want to
go. That is very much at the heart of what I am talking about here. I
see strong parallels between those models and bringing some of those
ideas into welfare to work services for those with such large barriers.
I regard those things as very much
meshed.</div><a name="09021070000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pushing
slightly further, into an area that we have not discussed, perhaps
because it is beyond the scope of the Bill, with hard-to-help people,
lots of agencies will be dealing with any individual. A homeless person
obviously has housing problems and is likely to have alcohol problems
too, and some will have mental health problems. There can also be
long-term disconnection from work and problems with basic skills. How
do we start to make this a journey that deals with all the problems of
the individual, rather than each agency working
independently?</div><a name="09021070000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am trying to open up a starting point in the debate. On welfare to
work, let us talk a little bit more holistically about the
individual&#146;s needs and capabilities. I would like to conclude by
saying that we are opening up how we can try to join that approach up
with the other objectives so that, in a particular case, we have the
retention, advancement and progression stuff coming after the first
welfare to work stuff. So the Department for Innovation, Universities
and Skills and DWP are trying to link up to say, &#147;It&#146;s
not just welfare to work. It&#146;s welfare to work and then
we&#146;ve got retention, advancement and progression on the table,
funded, potentially, from different sources, but maybe with the same
agency working through the
process.&#148;</div><a name="09021070000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure that I have answered your question. I have probably rambled
