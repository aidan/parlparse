<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I raised a point of order at the beginning of Tuesday's proceedings to which I have not received a reply, perhaps inadvertently. The draft regulations on clause 87 have yet to be circulated to the Committee. Given that we may discuss that clause today, it would be helpful if they were made available.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mrs. Liddell.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for returning to the matter. I intended to reply on Tuesday to his point of order, but the opportunity did not arise. The draft regulations for clause 87 will be published at the end of June.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> What?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman should reflect on his party's actions when they were in power. The Government will publish the regulations at the end of June, and they will be subject to full consultation. They will not take effect until April 1999 at the earliest, allowing ample time and scope for detailed consideration. Such practice is normal, but it is in marked contrast to that which prevailed under the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is not a point of order for the Chair. It has been raised and a reply has been given to it. However, for the moment I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I contend although not wholly optimistically that this is a matter for the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. The Committee cannot properly consider clause 87 precisely because it is the draft regulations, not the clause, which define personal portfolio bonds. When we consider the clause, we shall not know what we are debating.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's worry. However, the same can be said of every statute that empowers the making of regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must again make it plain that the matter is not one for the Chair and I shall not therefore take any more points of order.
<H4><center>Schedule 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Changes to EIS etc</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 237, line 10, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Trustees: anti-avoidance <P>
. (1)Paragraphs 13 and 15 above shall have effect in relation to the subscription for shares by the trustees of a settlement as if references to the individual subscribing for the shares were references to 
<P>
(a)those trustees;

(b)any individual or charity by virtue of whose interest, at a relevant time, paragraph 17 above applies to the settled property; or

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that today's proceedings are long and fruitful, and that the tone of the debate and the room temperature remain similarly moderate.
<P>
The amendment will correct a minor technical defect in provisions that bring reinvestment relief and the existing enterprise investment scheme together in the new, unified EIS.
<P>
Where chargeable gains are invested in companies and the tax on the gain is deferred under the new EIS, a number of provisions will protect the relief from being exploited. Two such rules will prevent abuse of the scheme where the investor receives value from the company or a loan is made to the investor on terms that are linked to the investment. They will ensure that relief is not available in circumstances where the investor's money is effectively returned. Equivalent provisions have always applied for reinvestment relief.
<P>
The amendment will provide for the two anti-avoidance measures to take effect where the investment is made by a trust and the loan or value is received by a beneficiary rather than the trustees. There is a corresponding fine-tuning provision for reinvestment relief, but it was overlooked when schedule 13 was drafted. Failing to close the gap in the new EIS provisions would provide trusts with tax-saving opportunities that could bring the scheme into disrepute. It is clearly desirable that the amendment be made.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Thirteenth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> There is one important point on which we need further clarification. In your absence on Tuesday, Mrs. Dunwoody, the Committee extracted from the Economic Secretary, by a dubious and second-hand route, a pledge to keep the liquidity of the alternative investment market under review. We were treated to an extraordinary sequence of events which you were well out of. The Paymaster General was spotted at the back of the Committee Room briefing the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander). The hon. Gentleman, who until then had not taken much[Mr. Fallon]
interest in the affairs of the alternative investment market, suddenly expressed concern about it.
<P>
Convoluted as that procedure was, it extracted from the Economic Secretary a commitment to keep the liquidity of the alternative market under review. That commitment is welcome, but will the limit of qualifying asset or the nature of the shares involved be reviewed during the passage of the Bill? Both those matters the limit of £10 million and the definition of shares are included in the primary statute. Or is it the case that the Government are keeping the matter under longer-term review and that we will not be able to return to it until we discuss a forthcoming Finance Bill? The Economic Secretary said on Tuesday that her commitment to keep the liquidity of the alternative market under review was specific. Her clarification of that would be helpful.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I will resist the attempt to participate in the hon. Gentleman's ham acting. Although he had a sabbatical from the House, he is perhaps more used to the behaviour of his party, in which Front-Bench Members do not fraternise with Back-Bench Members. In the new Labour party, we are all colleagues together. That must be why he took such offence at my hon. Friend the Paymaster General's speaking to my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South.
<P>
I am sorry if I did not make myself clear on the substantive point. I thought that I had been specific when I said that we would review the situation in relation to the liquidity of the market, but that there was insufficient time between now and the Report stage of the Bill to allow the important review to take place. We will consider what is happening to limits, but we will not be seeking supplementary action on existing shares this year.
<P>
Schedule 13, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 139</center></H4>
<H4><center>Abolition of certain other CGT reliefs</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 131, leave out line 32.
<P>
I have been caught slightly on the hop, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
The amendment would remove subsection 1(a), which relates to provisions on roll-over relief on re-investment. The paragraph will remove the advantages that existed under previous capital gains tax reliefs that enable companies to roll over any gains made on disposals of shares that they hold in unquoted companies. That will be enormously damaging for people who make risky investments in unquoted companies and will damage the Government's intention to encourage entrepreneurs to put their own money into enterprises, which, as the Government have said, will benefit the economy. Why have they decided to remove that valuable relief for entrepreneurs and angels when it has been so successful in the past? It seems to be part of the Government's discreditable aim to simplify and harmonise the reliefs into one, overall definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I am glad to be able to give my hon. Friend the opportunity to get his notes together. Does he agree that the Chancellor's announcement yesterday, supposedly to encourage the investment of large amounts of money in venture capital businesses the sort of businesses that will eventually qualify for the alternative investment market is at odds with the clause, in which the Government are discouraging the very same seedcorn of future successful, high-tech, high-risk British companies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. Despite their new labour epithet, the Government are again trying to pick winners. The best people to pick winners are entrepreneurs who invest their own money, not money belonging to other people such as taxpayers. There is nothing like putting their own money on the line to make people concentrate on the risk.
<P>
I urge the Government to think seriously about their repeal of this valuable capital gains tax relief because it enables people to invest in high risk enterprises, which is helpful to the economy. If they cannot accept the amendment, perhaps they will reconsider their strategy for encouraging entrepreneurs and table an amendment on Report. The clause that we debated on Tuesday and the clause before us show that the Government are out to get the small entrepreneur. They intend to abolish this relief and retirement relief. Such reliefs are valuable for entrepreneurs trying to set up businesses that provide jobs. All that we have seen from the Government is a ham-fisted attempt to harmonise the definition of reliefs with the consequence of damaging incentives for entrepreneurs to invest their own money.
<P>
There is no correlation between the definition of companies for venture capital trust purposes and EIS purposes. They are two different things and the Government should not try to harmonise the definitions. Their attempt to repeal the provision is reprehensible and I hope that they will return with an alternative proposal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I do not want to add too much because we debated a closely related subject at length on Tuesday. You will be pleased to know, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I shall not trail another list of AIM quoted stocks.
<P>
It is a pity that Labour Members have no interest in the hard end of British business and the nuts and bolts of companies that are the high-tech, high-risk, future great businesses. They expand much more rapidly than unquoted businesses and account for more than 5 per cent. of private sector employment in this country already. Labour Members have no interest in that, which says reams about their lack of understanding of how business works.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Has the hon. Gentleman ever started or run a company, or is he simply a merchant banker a parasite on the financial world? I have started a number of high-risk companies that have been very successful. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has not.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmonds): What a stupid thing to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> As usual, my hon. Friend puts the point rather more succinctly than I could. Once again, it appears that Labour Members have been snoozing, absent or busy getting briefings from the Paymaster General. If the hon. Member for Croydon (Mr. Davies) had been listening when we discussed this matter on Tuesday, he would have heard me disclose at the beginning of my speech that I was a non-executive director of a small internet service company, which an associate and I set up from scratch. I put some funding into it and I have had an interesting and successful association with it. It is precisely the sort of business that we should be discussing in relation to the clause, and it is highly conceivable that we may apply for an AIM listing for it in the near future.
<P>
I believe that the hon. Gentleman worked at a desk in a multinational such as Unilever, which does not face the hazards of raising venture capital from shoestring operations because it can rely on its finance-raising abilities.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman might want to come up with an apology and concede that I have some experience of running small businesses. I have also worked in a large finance house, which finances those businesses, and its work is not parasitical.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and his Labour colleages have no recognition of what the primary and secondary markets are. We should remember that merchant banks, venture capital houses and other financier houses are crucial because they provide finance for those businesses. Without them and without the tax relief that the Government are trying to kibosh today individual entrepreneurs would be less likely to invest their capital in high-risk businesses.
<P>
I am happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman again if he wants to correct his earlier statement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I do not want to waste the Committee's time, but for the record I was employed by Unilever and by several other multinationals before I started several successful companies on my own. I accept that the hon. Gentleman has several balls in the air, and that his merchant bank interests may have applied for tax breaks and help to further the projects that he is pursuing today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am even more bemused I was not aware that I had applied for any tax breaks that we are currently discussing. Be that as it may, it was good to have a contribution from a Labour Member, absurd though it was.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said, we are again discussing harmonisation without purpose. The Government have fallen into the lap of Treasury bureaucrats who supposedly want to simplify and harmonise, although they have no reason for doing so. They often pay no regard to the consequences of what they are doing.
<P>
The ending of CGT investment relief for acquisitions after 6 April 1998 will harm future capital-raising. In clauses and schedules that we discussed earlier, the Government have already limited the companies that will qualify for various forms of venture enterprise capital. I fear that we lost the battle over mushroom farmers and other market gardening activities so, in a schedule that we discussed earlier, the qualifying company level was limited to £10 million. The stock exchange AIM team has made it clear that that will hit many companies, and we have seen evidence to that effect share prices have underperformed greatly on the AIM. The other day, the Economic Secretary was unable to respond to the accusation that the Bill would create a two-tier system in the AIM. Indeed, the schedule limits the provisions only to new shares.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend did not miss the significance of the Economic Secretary's remarks earlier today. She made it clear that she would not alter the definition of shares before the introduction of the next Finance Bill, although she did not wholly rule out an alteration in the £10 million limit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I noted that, and differing reports in the newspapers. All of us not least members of the Government are on a learning curve about how the legislation will turn out in the end. Many of its provisions seem to be made up on the hoof, and much of it has deferred to the Treasury's powers to regulate afterwards. It is absurd that we are discussing clauses and schedules when we do not even know the definitions of the relevant terms. The £10 million level set by the Government is arbitrary Labour Members had no understanding on Tuesday of the reasons for that level. The use of gross balance sheet assets is arbitrary 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to limit the hon. Gentleman's discussion of the amendment, but it is a very specific amendment. Now that he has put the amendment in context, I hope that he will bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. You will appreciate that the amendment is closely related to a previous discussion. My argument held sway then, and I hope that the Government as long as the amendment is not technically flawed will take it on board. The function of the secondary market, which is key to this clause and this amendment, has not been recognised.
<P>
The stock market has given its reaction to these clauses and schedules. The amendment is an attempt to salvage something from the damage already done. How long must we wait before the Government are convinced of the Bill's damaging consequences? The Paymaster General who has now joined us is always happy to extol the virtues of an increase in the value of the stock market when it represents a supposed reaction to Government legislation. The value of AIM stocks has clearly decreased; does the Economic Secretary not take that as a token of how real practitioners in the real world are reacting to this damaging Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that the notes on clauses say that the reinvestment relief, which is to be abolished by the clause, is to be replaced by the tax deferral for reinvestment under the new, unified EIS scheme? The notes on clauses indicate that the new EIS scheme will preserve many of the best features of reinvestment relief. Is that not utter nonsense? The new scheme, which we debated on Tuesday, is not an adequate replacement for the former reinvestment relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend sums the situation up correctly. The new relief is not adequate. It preserves some of the old relief's functions, but destroys some key features that have made the AIM and the EIS-backed companies that come on to it such a success.
<P>
It is ironic that the Economic Secretary said earlier, on a point of order, that the consultation process which is supposed to collect and collate the industry's responses on personal portfolio bonds and will no doubt be ignored would cause a delay. In this case, the Government are not prepared to delay the changes until their likely consequences have been observed. Yet again, there is incongruity in the Bill.
<P>
The amendment would continue reinvestment relief until the Government were better placed to determine whether its removal would damage as we maintain it will AIM and the whole venture capital system. If the Government are not convinced of our argument, they may change the law at a later date. The amendment proposes that we maintain the status quo until they start to have a clue what they are doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I have one question for the Economic Secretary. Is she aware that the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry wrote a letter on 21 November 1997 to Mr. David Poole, of Singer and Friedlander Investment, who is a well-known and recognised expert on AIM companies? She wrote that reinvestment relief
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is an integral part of the United Kingdom's tax system which is currently one of the most favourable tax regimes for small businesses in the world."
<P>
How can the Economic Secretary square that statement with this clause?
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I am worried that the clause, in combination with the clauses that we discussed last week, will damage seedcorn and entrepreneurial companies in this country. Unless we encourage the small, seedcorn companies, which could become tomorrow's large multinational companies, we shall begin to destroy the entrepreneurial base of this country. The Government are intent on restricting these tax reliefs and, with a heavy hand, directing them into certain very targeted sectors through direct grants, subsidies and other measures. It is much better if, through tax reliefs, the individual can make his or her own choices about where to invest. Here we have yet another example of reinvestment relief being restricted to the new EIS schemes, which themselves are further restricted, as we heard last week.
<P>
One of the previous Government's successes was the establishment of the AIM. Today, that market is worth £5 billion. If the effect of the clause without the amendment, so rightly tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, will be to depress that market even by 20 per cent., it will still have an effect on the market of £1 billion. In addition to promising to consider liquidity, the Government should look carefully at the whole raft of tax reliefs that have previously been introduced not only by Conservative Governments but by Labour Governments, way back in the 1970s precisely in order to encourage entrepreneurial businesses.
<P>
All hon. Members have small businesses in their constituencies, and we know that they employ comparatively few people; in many cases, fewer than 100 people. We should be encouraging those businesses in every single industrial estate in our constituencies. Anyone who knows anything about small companies knows how frightfully difficult it is to obtain venture capital and subsequently move on to the AIM. If we further restrict these tax reliefs, as clause 139 will, it will be even more difficult for such companies to start up. The Government should think very carefully about their combined strategy. I hope that if they do not accept our amendments, they will return to the matter on Report and see what they can do to help the AIM. Since the Budget on 17 March, the AIM has undoubtedly developed into a two-tier market for those companies there are about 150 of them that are not subject to these reliefs. The market has demonstrated with its feet what it thinks of the Government's proposals. I hope that the Government will reconsider their whole strategy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I apologise to the Committee for not being here at 10.30 am, owing to my involvement in an Education Select Committee press conference. However, I endorse all that my hon. Friends have said, which goes to the heart of the previous sitting's debate. I am obliged to declare an interest because I am a director of a company that has benefited from this section of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. I believe that many companies would benefit if the provisions were retained.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> This is not an innocent little amendment; it is a wrecking amendment. Having been defeated in Committee on preceding clauses and schedules, and having had their arguments knocked down, Conservative Members now seek to reintroduce the same argument in relation to clause 139. The amendment would give us reinvestment relief in addition to the new unified EIS, even though the new scheme incorporates all the best features of reinvestment relief.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) said that my hon. Friend the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry stated that reinvestment relief was an integral part of the UK's tax system. Yes, it is certainly true that reinvestment relief had an important part to play, but it did not represent good value for money and was poorly targeted in some respects. The new EIS is a considerably improved relief, which does retain the best parts of reinvestment relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The hon. Lady is reinterpreting the quotation. The words are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This is an integral part of the United Kingdom's tax system".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I have already explained that it had an important part to play 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> It still has.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We are discussing a Finance Bill that will put in place an even better structure to allow small, high-risk companies to raise capital in a more targeted way. It will give UK taxpayers and businesses better value for money.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would resurrect an entire chapter of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. The provisions in that chapter are largely replicated in the new EIS legislation. For what possible purpose would we want to approve the amendment? Would it be to perpetuate a relief that was in desperate need of reform because it was badly targeted and represented poor value for money? Would it be to perpetuate a relief that took no account of the size of the company in which the investment was being made? Or would we want to perpetuate a relief that was available whether the investor put money directly into the company or used it to buy the shares off someone else?
<P>
As I have said, the purpose of the EIS and the reliefs contained within it is to help businesses in high-risk areas to raise capital that will allow them to function and grow. Its purpose is not to promote a secondary market in their shares. We discussed at length asset size and new shares when we debated our proposals for the new EIS. There is nothing to be said for repeating myself.
<P>
In a nutshell, our reform will ensure that the new scheme helps to provide equity funding for small, unquoted, high-risk trading companies the very companies that find it hardest to attract risk capital. Reviving reinvestment relief would run entirely counter to that reform. I have no hesitation in rejecting the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 139 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 76</center></H4>
<H4><center>Tax credits for accounts and for PEPs</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Subsection (1)(a) provides that dividend credit tax will cease to be repaid to an individual savings account from 6 April 2004. Will the Economic Secretary confirm the Government have not highlighted this in any of their marvellous spin-doctoring operations and media manipulations that the tax credit repaid to equity holders who hold their equities through individual savings accounts will cease after 6 April 2004? Not even the 10 per cent. credit will be repaid. If that is the case, will she tell the Committee and the general public what the advantages are for basic or lower-rate taxpayers in holding their equity shares through an individual savings account?
<P>
Capital gains relief is worth hardly anything to basic or lower-rate taxpayers, most of whom do not generate gains in excess of the annual allowance. Charges will be incurred on ISAs which may or may not be covered by the 10 per cent. tax credit. What will happen at the end of the five years, from 2004 onwards, when the tax credit ceases to be paid? What will be the advantage for basic rate or lower-rate taxpayers after 2004? If the Economic Secretary urges basic or lower-rate taxpayers to hold equities through individual savings accounts, I believe she will be guilty of mis-selling the scheme because I can see no advantage whatever in that.
<P>
Clause 76(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Treasury may by regulations make provision for"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
these issues. I am pleased that the clause includes regulations which we have seen, unlike those in clause 57 which set a rate of tax and which, disgracefully, we have not seen. It is astonishing that the annexe to the report of the draft regulations in clause 76 gives a summary of the consultation process that was undertaken by the Government before the draft regulations were published. If the Economic Secretary could focus on the Committee's deliberations instead of talking to her Back Benchers, will she say whether, before 17 March, the Government employed focus groups to test the presentation of their revised ISA scheme? Will she today say yes or no. Were focus groups or other market testing mechanisms employed by the Government to test the presentation of individual savings accounts? If such mechanisms were employed, how much did that cost and how were the Government able to market-test the presentation of the details of individual savings accounts without divulging secrets about the Budget, which they were not supposed to do prior to the Chancellor of the Exchequer reading his statement in the House?
<P>
I look forward to hearing the Economic Secretary's answers to all those questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> You will be aware, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I tabled an amendment to the clause, which you were minded not to call. I respect that, but am greatly disappointed and I hope that in compensation you will allow me a little leeway on the subject of PEPs.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The placing of defective amendments is not a good reason to be allowed to make a long speech. A good try.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My comments will be brief, Mrs. Dunwoody. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"] I know that that amuses Labour Members.
<P>
The culmination of the whole sorry tale that started with the Paymaster General on 2 December is one of the biggest U-turns we have seen in the Government's legislation to date. We are pleased that they made that U-turn. The Paymaster General vamped up a great new system offering simplicity, flexibility, accessibility and fairness some of those words were dropped half way through the exercise but we are not convinced that that is what we have ended up with. The crux of my argument and of my perhaps defective amendment is to sort out a complicated system because the culminating system is far more complicated. There is no guarantee that it will appeal to the army of 6 million virgin investors who are supposedly queuing at the doors of the Treasury to hurl their money into the new ISA scheme, which the Paymaster General is desperately trying to market through every spin doctor and public relations company he can rein in.
<P>
In the past few days we have seen the invention of the CAT mark cost access terms. It is a cop-out mark and an admission that the Government are unable to give a[Mr. Loughton]
guarantee of performance or security or anything else to those financial products, as we could have told them initially.
<P>
We have ended up with a diluted product in preference to what went before the very successful personal equity plans and tax-exempt special savings accounts. I shall not go over the figures on how much money and how many investors were brought into those schemes and I am sure you would rule me out of order, Mrs. Dunwoody, if I did.
<P>
Having waited so long for the ISA regulations and the great anti-climax of a CAT mark, leaving only nine months until the system is supposed to start, there are still major anomalies in the treatment between PEPs and ISAs which the clause deals with in part. The clause shows that the Government now admit that generous tax relief is necessary to encourage savers to save more. No one now disputes that, although the Government used to, and tried to save money on the quiet. As the appalling pension provision figures published in the press today demonstrate, people need generous tax relief to boost savings that must help to cover future living costs. The clause admits that, and provides the necessary tax breaks.
<P>
By and large, tax breaks for the new ISAs and for the ring-fenced existing PEPs have been harmonised. Opposition Members applaud that measure. However, all the documents heralding ISAs state that they
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will take a less restrictive approach than with PEPs for stocks and shares components".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why will they do so? It is plainly silly to run two parallel systems where the qualifications are very different on the same stocks and shares component.
<P>
When the Government finalise the details such anomalies should be ironed out. For example, there remains an anomaly between qualifying holdings in the stocks and shares element within PEPs and within ISAs, even though they are treated equally for tax purposes. That means that ISA investors could invest all their money as part of a stocks and shares component in a high-risk Australian uranium mine. However, PEP holders who hopefully would not so invest could not so invest. The qualification is rather more serious in respect of pool funds, unit trusts and investment trust vehicles that are spread internationally.
<P>
The anomaly prejudices the many people who want to continue to invest in PEPs. If the government treat PEPs and ISAs equally for tax purposes, I see no reason for that anomaly. The Government should therefore re-examine the matter. Many other funds also qualify, such as warrant funds. Again, if they are to be allowed in ISAs, they should be allowed in PEPs.
<P>
Following on from our previous debate, I moot that AIM stocks, which apparently will not qualify for re-investment tax relief, should be allowed within ISAs and PEPs. It was argued that AIM stocks should not qualify because they have generous tax reliefs available elsewhere. However, the Government are busy removing those reliefs, as we discussed this morning and on Tuesday.
<P>
Single-company PEPs, which are the country cousin of general PEPs, have not proved as successful as was hoped. When they were introduced during the financial year 1991-92, single-company PEPs attracted 110,000 accounts. By 1996-97, that figure had risen to approximately 400,000 accounts only. Currently, about £2.5 billion is invested in single-company PEPs, where approximately 25 times that amount is invested in general PEPs.
<P>
It will amuse the hon. Member for Croydon, Central if I make a somewhat late declaration of a personal interest. I am a director of a financial institution that deals in and offers PEPs; I have run PEPs since their inception; and I have owned PEPs and will continue to own them thanks to the Paymaster General's generous decision to allow them to continue. That decision was sensible because PEPs form an important part of the savings plan of ordinary people.
<P>
Those who have invested in single-company PEPs since 1991-92 will now have six different single-company plans. Any cash attached to those plans has to be held in separately designated accounts for six years. Those who have a general PEP deposit account as well can have at least seven different pots of cash on deposit. Some of those single-company plans will be of completely different sizes. If you had invested as I am sure that someone of your acumen, Mrs. Dunwoody, may have done in 1991-92 in a successful blue-chip company that has increased in value many times, your original £3,000 investment could be worth as much as £25,000, £30,000 or even more in some cases. Less successful investments might be worth only £4,000 or £5,000. The problem is that all of that sum of £25,000 must be re-invested in a single-company.
<P>
We have created a great imbalance in the way in which single-company PEPs work. I causes an administrative nightmare for savers who want differentiation in the deposit accounts relating to those single-company PEPs and for the PEP provider trying to keep track of it all.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I seriously ask the Government to abolish single-company PEPs and pool the proceeds from them in the general PEP fund as part of their reform of the savings system. That would make such investment far easier, and gel with the Paymaster General's promise to make savings simpler for future investors. Many PEP providers and PEP investors would like that, and given the introduction of ISAs this is an ideal time to introduce such a change. It would not affect the tax break, but would be a great tidying-up and harmonising measure, which Ministers want to encourage.
<P>
We have not yet seen details of when the Economic Secretary will establish the fund of funds and a cash fund OEICs availability within ISAs. She has still failed I hope that she will enlighten us further today to promise such an availability even when ISAs are up and running in April next year. That is not difficult to accept but for the sake of providers and the growing market in OEICs [Interruption.] OEICs is a particular investment term, not what various Labour Members seem to think it is. The growing market in OEICs, into which many major unit trust houses are converting forward funds on a daily basis, will be an important part of the market in the future. We have not yet received any direction from the Treasury as to availability to investors.
<P>
You have been generous, Mrs. Dunwoody, in allowing my speech on this clause. I would like to wax lyrical, but will not, on the disastrous subject of CATs, which is yet another acronym to bash around the head of the honest investor. That debate will wait for another day; I hope that it will be after the consultation exercise on the proposals of the Paymaster General and the Economic Secretary has given the Paymaster General his comeuppance.
<P>
I have made a several important practical points, which, in the interests of simplicity and of making PEPs and ISAs more attractive to everybody, I hope will be taken on board.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> A very interesting strand has emerged this morning. We have repeatedly returned to the word "consultation" and the fact that this Government believe in consultation. The responses we have heard from Opposition Members have shown that they have a deep-rooted psychological problem relating to the very process of consultation. We have just heard the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) talk about the consultation on CATs, which is a means of finding a way to benchmark safeguards for low-income savers. He made sweeping statements such as that about the comeuppance for the Paymaster General and me. That shows that, even after its humiliation at the general election, the Conservative party in its heart has never learned the lesson of listening to people and responding to their concerns. [Laughter.] Conservative Members are responding to my remarks in an arrogant way; they should be taking the opportunity to reflect on the lesson delivered by this country's electors on 1 May 1997. A Government must take people with them and listen to their views, which is how we approach the task of government, as opposed to the Opposition, who have a derisory attitude to consultation. Frankly, the Government believe in consultation and we will continue to consult. We shall not be as arrogant as the previous Government, who refused to listen to consultations.
<P>
I want to consider the clause's detail in relation to individual savings accounts and to put our proposals in a more general context. The ISA is part of the Government's commitment to high levels of savings and investment. We want a tax system that encourages long-term investment. The scheme is an essential part of the Chancellor's commitment to stability and growth in the economy. We are trying to create a tax system that encourages saving in a fair and efficient way.
<P>
The aim of the ISA is to extend the savings habit to the half of the population who currently either do not save at all, or who save very little. Within that objective, the ISA is designed to be simple, accessible and fair. That is one reason why we are consulting about benchmarks. We want to ensure that the ISA is readily understood. I have said on many occasions that one needs to be a Philadelphia lawyer to understand some of the savings products that are currently on the market. We are keen to ensure that savers feel confident about savings products and have easy access to them.
<P>
We consulted widely on ISAs. The ISA consultation was one of several consultations that the Government carried out over the last year. It brought about a genuine, constructive and wide-ranging debate. As well as two conferences and numerous written submissions, the Paymaster General and I met several representatives from the savings industry. There were many informal contracts during and after the formal consultation period. Many people contributed to that consultation process. It is insulting to hear Opposition Members demean the process this morning. We valued highly the input that we received, and we shall continue in the same collaborative vein in relation to the draft regulations, which were issued for consultation on 20 May.
<P>
The Government's approach in proposing legislation for the ISA scheme is to follow the approach adopted by the previous Government when they introduced PEPs and indeed tax exempt special savings accounts. Their approach was to have part of the legislation in primary legislation and the greater part of it in regulations.
<P>
We looked at, and took legal advice about, the powers we should need for the new accounts. We found that the powers already conferred in relation to PEPs were, with a few exceptions, already so wide that they were quite wide enough to allow us to do what we want to do.
<P>
During the course of this much-derided consultation period, the savings industry made it clear to us that it wants us to make as few changes as possible to the present procedures, except where they can be lightened. Providers want to minimise the changes to their computer systems, especially because IT resources are currently stretched in the industry, as it prepares for the millenium. We thought that the most helpful approach would be to build the new ISA regulations on the pattern of the PEP regulations, with the simplifications that the scheme envisages. I shall respond later to the point about anomolies that was made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham.
<P>
All the draft regulations for the new scheme, together with the necessary changes to the PEP regulations, were issued on 20 May. They reflect our discussions with representative bodies and other interested parties since the Budget and they take on board several of the issues that were raised. Apart from a couple of issues that we wish to consider and to discuss more fully, the four sets of draft regulations that were issued a couple of weeks ago cover all the provisions that are needed to introduce the scheme. The consultation on the regulations runs until 26 June, and we hope to lay the final versions of the regulations before the House towards the end of July.
<P>
The clause will do two things. First, it will allow tax credits on dividends paid on UK equities between 6 April 1999 and 5 April 2004 to be paid to investors where the equities are held in either a PEP or an ISA. Many members of this Committee also served on the Finance Committee that considered our first Budget of July last year. We discussed at length our corporation tax measures which were designed, as those hon. Members will know, to change the previous rules that allowed profits to be paid out as dividends rather than to be retained for the good of the business. That practice[Mrs. Liddell]
distorted behaviour and affected investment. As I have said, it is important to ensure that there is a high level of investment and stability in the economy.
<P>
As part of those measures, the payment of tax credits on equities held in PEPs would have ended from 6 April 1999. However, we have recognised the importance of ensuring that PEP investors in equities had time to adjust their investments in light of the changes. That is why we have proposed a five-year period in which the tax credit will still be paid. But we do see the need for a specific time period.
<P>
In the Committee of the whole House, the Opposition tried to cause confusion where there was no confusion. They tried to suggest the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham attempted this today that the five-year payment of tax credits would guarantee tax relief for ISAs for only five years. Let me confirm what was clearly stated in the Budget day press release: the five-year payment of tax credit is in addition to the 10-year guarantee of tax relief for ISAs.
<P>
The second part of the clause ensures that PEP or ISA investors who become non-resident can still claim the full tax credit for investments in their PEP or ISA. Only people who are resident and ordinarily resident can subscribe to a PEP, but if they become non-resident, the rules do not require them to close down their PEP. They cannot make further subscriptions, but their investments continue to be tax free. We propose to adopt similar rules for those who invest in ISAs. The provisions for both PEPs and ISAs are contained in the draft regulations that were issued recently. The relevant provisions are in regulation 22 of the draft ISA regulations and regulation 7 of the draft PEP regulations.
<P>
To return to more specific points, the obsession with consultation was clear from the question asked by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham who wanted to know what market research had been carried out on the introduction of ISAs. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General's response to a parliamentary question outlined the nature of the research that formed part of the consultation process in preparation for the introduction of ISAs.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and his hon. Friends keep telling the Committee how extensive their business experience is they say that they are the people who really know and understand business. Let us consider some of the most exciting businesses in this country. The Prince's Youth Business Trust 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> What about the Mirror group?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentions the Mirror group. I do not know what that has to do with the Prince's Youth Business Trust which provides one of the most exciting ways of allowing young people to establish new businesses. I have seen some of those small businesses in my constituency become quite large businesses. They have saved young people who would otherwise have been left with a life of unemployment because of the previous Government's policies. Those young people have been given a chance to advance themselves. I would have thought that Opposition Members, who want to be the voice of business, might occasionally stop being merely the voice of big, profitable businesses or of businesses that are quoted on the alternative investment market, and speak in favour of embryonic businesses. In the training packs for businesses that are set up under the PYBT, you would find, Mrs. Dunwoody I am sure that you take a close interest in these matters that all businesses are advised to check their market research and to ensure that what they will introduce into the market matches the market's requirements. That is what we have done: it is sound business practise and sound government.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We trust the British people to make intelligent judgments about economic policy. That is why, in the pre-Budget report of November 1997, the Chancellor announced that he was considering proposals for an individual savings account and for a working families tax credit. He also said that he would consult widely on those proposals in the run-up to the Budget and that Fishburn, Hedges and Ogilvy and Mather would be employed by the Treasury to examine the presentational aspects of those proposals. Their appointment was entirely consistent with long-established rules about the appointment of consultants by the Government, and the Chancellor drew on their work in preparing the Budget. We are a modern Government who do things in a modern way, and we want to bring the people's views into play.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made a good point about anomalies. There are anomalies, and we have had discussions with the industry about the anomalies relating to PEPs and to the transfer of PEPs into ISAs. We shall continue to listen to the savings industry. I happily agree that we should see how the ISA regulations develop and reconsider the position when they are up and running. The hon. Gentleman made a fair and important point.
<P>
I was asked about the alternative investment market. Let me go back to first principles. ISAs are designed to encourage ordinary people to save, especially people who do not have a great deal of income and who therefore have to put a greater proportion of their income into savings than do others who are wealthier.
<P>
In view of our previous discussions, I am sure that all Committee members acknowledge that AIM shares are riskier investments, and that they are not really suitable for a savings scheme that is targeted at a broad section of the population. We had a lengthy discussion on Tuesday about the importance of risk in encouraging businesses to establish themselves and to grow. That is why the AIM exists. If we want to give people confidence in savings products we must, frankly, ensure that the system does not veer towards greater risk.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I take the Economic Secretary's point. Why have the stocks and shares element of ISAs not been restricted purely to FTSE stocks and to tracker funds, which are the only vehicle to which she is prepared to give her CAT mark?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not understand that consultation means consultation. Consultation on CAT marks is currently under way. When it is concluded, we shall come to a conclusion that is based on the advice of those who are likely to use the products and on that of those who are likely to provide them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That was not my point. The Financial Secretary said that the purpose of ISAs is quite rightly to encourage more savers. However, she said that investments should be made only in less risky areas and that the wide gamut of investment strategies would not be used. I asked why ISAs had not been restricted I do not want them to be to tracker funds and to FTSE stocks, which are at the safer end of risk investment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I was answering the hon. Gentleman's question about stocks in the AIM. He should recognise that those stocks are of their nature a riskier kind of investment than some others which are more generally available. My point is that if people are to have confidence in ISAs there must be no uncertainty and we must not increase the risk to their savings. I am not trying to say that there should be a blanket restriction on the sort of products that providers of ISAs can become involved in. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I listened carefully to the Economic Secretary's response, which was inadequate. She did not answer my clear question on whether the Government's advice to basic and lower-rate taxpayers is that they should or should not put equities into ISAs. Will it be advantageous or disadvantageous to do so from the tax point of view? An answer to that question is needed and expected.
<P>
I also want the Economic Secretary to tell me whether the market testing and focus groups to which she referred, involving Ogilvy and Mather, and Fishburn, Hedges, Boys, Williams concentrated on the product or the presentation of the policy to the public. How could those focus groups be conducted without confidential Budget information being revealed to a selected group of people who would then have had sensitive information not available in draft or final form to the rest of the population? How was she able to conduct those exercises without breaching that long-established Treasury rule?
<P>
The Economic Secretary referred to consultation. Will she give a guarantee today that when the draft regulations become final by the end of July, the House will have an opportunity to debate them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for your grudging allowance, Mrs. Dunwoody, to enable me to make a couple of further points.
<P>
The Economic Secretary has had some good sport misrepresenting our case on consultation. We are not against consultation; we are fully in favour of it, but it should start from an intellectually sound base, which the ISA proposals on 2 December blatantly failed to do. It should take account of the responses from practitioners which should be published in full and should then come up with considered proposals.
<P>
From the end of the consultation exercise on 31 January until today we have made numerous attempts to prise from the Paymaster General the results of the consultation exercise. To date, a full record of the consultation findings has not been published. Summaries have eventually been made available in the Library, after they were dragged from the Treasury, kicking and screaming. Every so often during the ISA and PEP debate, the Paymaster General has extracted yet another billet doux from his pocket which he claims supports the Government's proposals on savings as the best thing ever invented in the history of the universe, but he then declines to finish the sentence or paragraph that would put those comments in context.
<P>
The entire investment industry and thousands of PEP investors more than 11,000 personal letters have been sent to the Treasury were up in arms about the initial proposals. That pressure and the pressure that the Opposition have maintained on the Government to pull something out of the quagmire has resulted in what we have today. It is not ideal, but it is much better than what we started with and we realise that we shall have to work with that.
<P>
I appreciate the Economic Secretary responding to some of my points on the anomalies, but why could the changes not be made now? She rightly pointed to the pressures on information technology staff and the enormous costs arising from innovations and the savings programme. It will only exacerbate costs and deficiencies if she irons out those anomalies months or years after April 1999 when the new system begins. The anomalies are clear now. To iron them out now would make the process simpler and less complicated. It would make the programmes cheaper to run, and I applaud that key consideration. Why will she not do it now? Nine months remain until ISAs start next year.
<P>
The abolition of single company PEPs and the ironing out of the differential authorisation qualifications between PEPs and ISAs are not complicated. She has received representations on that from the trade. I urge her to consider making the changes now. I also urge the Government to stop tarring the concern expressed by Opposition Members to get the proposals right as a wholesale decrying of the consultation process. That is not what we are doing, but we do want proper consultation that is taken on board by the Government.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> If the hon. Gentleman does not want to be attacked for his attitude towards consultation, he should be more careful about how he describes consultation.
<P>
I omitted to say something when I summed up. The hon. Gentleman asked specifically about funds of funds and OEICs. We have considerable interest in those matters, but his proposal is not simple or straightforward to introduce. I am in contact with the industry and I am taking the requisite legal advice to ensure that I am properly advised when final decisions are taken. The industry appreciates that. I know of its determination and anxiety. We are doing everything to ensure that we make proper decisions, which means that we might not be able to make them as rapidly as people would want. I apologise to the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham for not mentioning that earlier.
[Mrs. Liddell]
<P>
As for the market testing of ISAs, I explained that in November 1997, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced to the House of Commons in the pre-Budget report the introduction of ISAs and the research that would be undertaken on matters relating to them, including the presentational aspect. One reason why market research on presentation is so important is that the products are aimed at encouraging people to save who otherwise would not see themselves as being able to save. I would have thought that that was fairly obvious. As the Minister responsible for national savings, I am well aware of the importance of ensuring that products match the needs of the public and are presented attractively.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked whether I would give financial advice to encourage people to enter into equity investments through ISAs. I would not give financial advice to anyone. That is not my job as a Minister. I, of all people, want to see the highest possible standard of financial advice. I sometimes think that I need one of those Philadelphia lawyers when I see some of the products that are on the market, which is one reason why I am anxious to ensure that people receive good financial advice. I underline the fact, however, that it would not be wise to take financial advice from me.
<P>
The Government recognise the importance of having equity investments through PEPs. That is one reason why we are phasing out the 10 per cent. tax credit. That provision, together with capital gains, higher rate income tax reliefs and the expertise of the providers, should give ISA investors who choose to invest through equity a good return on their investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady referred to higher rate relief. I asked whether basic and lower-rate taxpayers should use an ISA to hold their equities. I did not expect her to say which equities they should hold. Should basic and lower-rate taxpayers use an ISA to hold their equity? Yes or no.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman gets awfully excitable. I was responding to a point raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. I will get round to answering his questions, but he needs to be a little more patient. I know that the Leader of the Opposition did not get round to promoting him at the beginning of this week, but I am sure that if he keeps doing his homework and bringing an apple to the teacher he will be recognised in due course.
<P>
As for the question that was asked about a change in PEP rules before 1999, we have responded to such concerns by keeping the rules as they are at present. The industry has asked us to keep the rules as similar as possible, in order not to put extra pressure on its IT resources.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In relation to the laying of the regulation before the House, we hope that it will be done before the end of July. These matters are usually decided in another way, but the regulation will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the normal manner. I have now completely forgotten the question asked by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Perhaps if you had spent less time attacking me and more time dealing with the question 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have not attacked the hon. Gentleman. When I do so it will be clear to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. Will the Economic Secretary tell us whether basic and lower-rate taxpayers will be able to hold their equities within an ISA?

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I told the hon. Gentleman earlier that people must choose ISAs according to their own particular circumstances. It is not my role to give financial advice to people as to which ISA will be most suitable for them.
<P>
<B>Ms Helen Southworth </B>(Warrington, South): In the light of the dubious integrity of some of its proposals, does my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary regard the Conservative party as capable of giving advice? A Conservative proposal for legal aid reform, which is on today's Order Paper, would deny legal aid
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to persons resident outside of, or not paying tax in, the United Kingdom."

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I take my hon. Friends point. I have been restrained this morning: it would be easy for me to remind the hon. Gentleman, who was trying to lure me into giving financial advice, that some of the previous Government's financial advice caused people to opt out of occupational pension schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> If the Economic Secretary believes that that was the Government's responsibility, is she proposing Government compensation in respect of personal pensions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have had our fun this morning; perhaps we could return to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. As we are having our fun, I wonder whether I could take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) on his appointment. We are glad to see that he is still conducting himself in an honourable manner in this Committee, and we are glad to welcome him back.
<P>
To return to the point, the clause aims to put in place the kind of machinery that would encourage people to save. The Government are trying to introduce mechanisms to help people to be prudent for the future, and I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee but I must have an answer to my question. I shall try to put it in another way. Are there any circumstances in which it will be advantageous for basic or lower rate taxpayers to hold their equities within an ISA?
 <P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is seeking to lure me into giving financial advice. One must consider the circumstances of the particular saver. I would have expected the hon. Gentleman, who alone enters Committee with a bigger comfort blanket of papers than mine, to accept that.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Paragraph 13 of the notes on clauses states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Under the proposals, the new account will be a stand alone savings product guaranteed to run for at least 10 years".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps the Economic Secretary can help me with my homework. Despite my assiduous efforts, I cannot find mention of that guarantee. Clause 77 introduces a new section, 333B, which further empowers the Treasury to make regulations. The draft includes those regulations, but they do not refer to a 10-year guarantee. Can the Economic Secretary show me where mention is made of the guarantee? Moreover, are ISAs intended to run for 10 years only? If so, will the £50,000 limit be reintroduced by the back door?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was not listening during an earlier part of the debate, when I specifically made the commitment. The current regulations are draft regulations. However, the Chancellor made an explicit commitment on page 79 of the Financial Statement and Budget Report, where the new savings account is discussed. The account will run for 10 years starting from 6 April 1999. I made that very point earlier during today's proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does page 79 of the Red Book have the force of legislation? If not, why have the Government not enshrined that commitment in legislation? During the general election campaign the Labour party made various guarantees. They said that, if elected, they would reduce health service waiting lists and class sizes, and not reduce taxes. As with those guarantees, the Government's guarantee on the new savings account is not worth the paper that it is printed on.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): The clause seeks to limit the circumstances in which relief would be available for capital losses on unlisted shares in trading companies.
<P>
Less than half an hour ago, during our discussion of clause 76, the Economic Secretary suggested that Opposition Members are interested in only those businesses that are large and established, and she expressed a wish that we would show the same level of concern for the problems of embryonic businesses. The clause goes to the very heart of the interests of such businesses. I wonder whether the crocodile tears that the Economic Secretary shed for embryonic businesses during the debate on clause 76 are reflected in the provisions contained in clause 80.
<P>
Anyone who has set up or operated a small business will know that an informal capital market exists that is far removed from the world of alternative investment markets and unlisted securities exchange. Through that informal market, friends, local business men and relatives provide embryonic businesses with small amounts of capital. Indeed, most of the businesses that start from scratch in this country probably depend to some extent on informally provided capital. I have been on both sides of that equation I have been a recipient of such capital investment in an embryonic business and a provider of seedcorn capital and I know that the downside risk is a major factor to any investor who is considering making an investment. The failure rate of start-up businesses is high and, in the nature of things, it will always be so. The ability of companies that are excluded from eligibility for loss relief to attract such informal investment will be severely damaged if those companies fail and if investors find that they have lost the money that they invested.
<P>
The proposal will affect the smallest companies, which are at the beginning of their existence. There are no logical reasons behind it: it is not necessary for the Revenue's protection and it is not helpful to small businesses. The only reason for introducing it is as an exercise in bureaucratic housekeeping it might help to tidy up definitions and to harmonise the eligibility for VCTs, for enterprise investment schemes and for the relief that is available for investments in unquoted, unlisted shares that are outside VCTs and EISs.
<P>
EISs and VCTs are very different vehicles with minimum lock-in periods. The current provisions, which allow for relief against income for capital losses on unlisted shares in the generality of small businesses have no time limit. They are an extremely useful incentive for investors in small companies and for people who seek to acquire that vital start-up seed capital without which it is impossible to approach banks and other larger financial institutions for investment.
<P>
The proposal has no place among the Government's stated objectives of supporting and encouraging small businesses and of creating jobs in this most dynamic sector of the economy. The Economic Secretary should resist the advice of officials in her Department or perhaps in the Inland Revenue who would like the definitions to be tidied up for tidiness' sake. She should think seriously about the proposal's serious consequences and about the real effect that it will have[Mr. Philip Hammond]
on the cost of capital for those businesses that are currently excluded from eligibility for relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I fully support the points of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge.
<P>
Clause 80 might be termed the clause that is an attack on Aunt Agatha. It has a long pedigree it even goes back to the previous Labour Government which involves the notion that losses on an unquoted business should receive income tax relief. The thinking in those days and it remains as true today as it was then was that some people who invest in those companies may not have a vast portfolio of shares with capital gains against which they could effect offset losses on their one venture into an unquoted small business. The person might be an elderly relative, for example, who relies predominantly on a fixed income. It would be inequitable if he gave a member of his family a chance to get seedcorn capital but did not get tax relief. The rest of his investments and holdings might be income-generating rather than capital-gains generating.
<P>
The logic of the Government's proposal is that any investment in a non-eligible company whether quoted or unquoted should be denied capital gains tax relief as well as income tax relief. That is, of course, a nonsense. The sectors that are dear to the Government's heart are no doubt noble in themselves, and they may regard some of the non-eligible companies as less risky. They all play their part in servicing the needs of our economy. That is why the clause is inequitable.
<P>
<B>Mr Gibb:</B> This is the last in a series of measures with which the Government, for some peculiar reason, are trying to introduce a semblance of neatness in an area where that is not appropriate. It will result in a massive reduction in investment in risky business. Prior to the Bill, if an investment in an unlisted qualifying company made a loss, that loss could be offset against your other income perhaps not against your other income, Mrs. Dunwoody, because I am sure your investments would not make a loss. Such a loss could be offset against other income.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Now, under the Bill, all the restrictions of the new enterprise investment scheme that we discussed and criticised on Tuesday and today will be applied to the sort of company qualifying for the relief, which is ludicrous. The purpose is not a reassessment of incentives to increase investment, but is given in the notes on clauses which state triumphally:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for the first time there will be common rules to determine whether a particular trading activity is a qualifying activity for the purposes of"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a venture capital trust, enterprise investment scheme or the other forms of loss relief. Who has called for such harmonisation? Why do we need those common rules? The measure is so inappropriate. If common rules are needed, why have the Government chosen the narrowest definition instead of the widest? Is it because they want, as with all Labour reforms, to level downwards.
<P>
The Institute of Directors condemned clause 80, as have a number of industry representatives, for narrowing the relief. The institute stated that narrowing the relief will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"inevitably be taken into account when investors are assessing risk".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The restrictions will reduce the incentives to invest in new and risky businesses that have the potential to grow and create significant numbers of jobs."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Yet again, a measure directly conflicts with Labour's rhetoric of wanting to increase investment and jobs. As with so many other measures that we discussed today and on Tuesday, the clause will reduce investment and the number of jobs.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy for people who help young companies to start up. In a previous incarnation I was chief executive of a company that specifically brokered such arrangements and I have had a long involvement with the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust. I know how important capital is when a company starts up, but the points made by the hon. Gentleman are misdirected. Other changes elsewhere in the Budget are aimed at assisting business angels and encouraging them to keep their investments in companies for a longer period.
<P>
I must apologise to the hon. Member for Guildford for confusing him with his hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I am pleased to see that the hon. Gentleman is joining us and I wish him well in his new position. He said that the measure will reduce the incentive for investing in new and risky businesses. We must return to points that were made earlier in our debate. I understand why the hon. Gentleman could not be present and I shall restate them briefly.
<P>
We want to target the nature of the reliefs to maximise their benefit. The purpose of the clause is to make important changes to venture capital loss relief to make it easier not for the Revenue, but for taxpayers to understand how the system of relief works. Venture capital loss relief was introduced in 1980, a year before the business start-up scheme, which was the earliest predecessor of the enterprise investment scheme. It is no longer in tune with other venture capital reliefs. It is right to review it now in the light of the changes we are making to the EIS and VCTs.
<P>
Venture capital loss relief allows individuals and investment companies who subscribe for shares in qualifying trading companies to offset losses on those shares against income. The main effect of the clause is to bring the rules which define qualifying trading companies for the purposes of the relief much more in line with those that determine which companies can qualify for EIS and VCT purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We heard the other night how the hon. Lady was so in awe of the rules introduced in the early 1980s, which restrict investment under the new EIS scheme for those who have had a connection with a company within seven years of making an investment. She said that she believed that the rule had stood the test of time. Why is a rule that restricts investment in unquoted companies allowed to stand the test of time while a rule that encourages investment in unquoted companies is knocked down on the basis that it is out of date?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I reiterate the point that I made earlier; the clause represents a simplification of the tax relef system, which is to be welcomed. It is all about targeting. We have already discussed the importance of targeting. All reliefs cost the Exchequer money, so we have to ensure that we get the best value for money. That is the purpose of clause 80, which I commend to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her remarks. I am not sure that I understand her reference to other parts of the Budget that assist business angels. I suppose she has in mind measures relating to corporation tax levels, and so on. However, we are talking specifically about losses. If the hon. Lady has been involved in seedcorn money for start-up businesses, she will know that it is the downside that is critically important to investors. They do not lie awake at night thinking about how they might have hit on an enterprise such as the Body Shop, in which case their capital will increase a hundredfold; they look at the more realistic, downside risk, which they must face when they invest in very risky enterprises. Of course, both the EIS and VCT schemes are surrounded by a plethora of restrictions, which may make them perfectly appropriate vehicles for some businesses but not for others, for whatever reason. Let us be blunt, one reason may be the inability of the entrepreneurs running them to wrestle with complicated rules. Many people who run small businesses are not especially partial to complex rules and lots of paperwork but, none the less, are able to run successful small businesses and need access to sources of seedcorn capital.
<P>
Perhaps the Economic Secretary will assist me by pointing to other features in the Budget that will offset the clause's effect by encouraging the provision, outside the scope of EIS and VCT, of informal capital to high-risk start-up situations, and by offering alternative ways of reducing the losses of people who make investments that fail and find that they have no capital gains against which to offset those losses.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The Budget is a package designed to encourage people to invest, but also to retain their investments with specific companies, especially high-risk companies, with which they are involved. I cannot see why the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge finds it so reprehensible that we should want to bring together the rules for EIS and for VCT. In doing so, we have simplified the structure, made it more transparent and encouraged people to invest in high-risk companies. Other provisions throughout the Budget, and throughout the Government's economic policy, encourage entrepreneurship and ensure that people recognise its true value. So I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Economic Secretary has said nothing to justify the clause. She has failed to say why capital gains should be relieved when she objects to the offsetting of income against losses. Above all, she has not addressed the distinction between EIS, which gives the taxpayer an up-front advantage whether or not the business fails in those circumstances it would seem justifiable to have a test of the riskiness of the business and the situation in which the benefit is derived only after the business has failed and, by definition, must have been risky. Unless her definitions are perfect frankly, none of us believe that they are there will inevitably be businesses in that situation. Then, the proof will be in the pudding. It will be shown that the relief was deserved by the investor who was brave enough to take a risk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I listened carefully to the Economic Secretary's reply. Does she accept that some projects need funding but are not appropriate for EIS?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> There are certainly cases in which EIS would not be suitable, but there are other means of obtaining finance, and formal finance at that. There is, of course, an informal financial network. Indeed, the Department of Trade and Industry goes to great lengths to encourage informal investment through business angels, links and other schemes.
<P>
The thrust of the Opposition's argument is that they wish to see a system that would allow all capital losses to be set against income. That would be extremely costly to other taxpayers. Are the Opposition giving a commitment that they wish to increase taxes?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is very clear that the clause is referring to unlisted shares. It is not about a general relief against income.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not said how he would fund such a venture. At the end of the day, someone has to pay for it. All reliefs impose a cost on the Exchequer. If the Opposition are proposing to increase taxes, they should tell us the extent of that commitment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> No, I am not giving way.
<P>
The relief will provide an exception to general rules to give an incentive to people to invest in high-risk trading companies. Frankly, I cannot see much reason for the Opposition's concerns. Indeed, if they are so anxious, why have they not tabled an amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is extraordinary that the Economic Secretary asks a question and then refuses to wait for an answer. The Government tell us that they are a listening Government, but they do not want to listen. We are discussing an existing relief that is where the money will come from. The Government, not the Opposition, are removing the relief. If the thrust of the Economic Secrertary's argument is that money will be directed into other high-risk companies, she should recognise that that will cost the Exchequer because where there is only post-loss relief under the old rules, there will be up-front relief on investments under EIS. Our proposal would save the Government money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I should like to comment on the Economic Secretary's suggestion that opposition is not genuine unless an amendment is tabled. Where we believe that a clause is wholly wrong and has no place in a Bill, we oppose it in the clause stand part debate. There is no point tabling amendments to a clause that is fundamentally flawed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon Gentleman shoud have been around the other night when we saw how effective some of the Opposition's amendments were. I suspect that Opposition Members could not get their act together to table an amendment.
<P>
I reiterate what I said earlier: the purpose of the relief is to encourage high-risk investment. The Opposition's argument has not caused me to change my mind.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 37, in page 67, line 7, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(A) Section 797 (Limits on Credit: Corporation Tax) and section 797A (Foreign Tax on interest brought into account as a non-trading credit) of the Taxes Act 1988 shall be amended as follows: 
<P>
(a) in section 797(3B)(b) omit `or in accordance with subsection (3) of that section';
<P>
(b) for subsection 5(c) of section 797A substitute 
<P>
`For the purposes of (a) and (b) above any non-trading deficit brought forward to the applicable accounting period under section 83(3) shall not be treated as a non-trading deficit of that period.'
<P>
(c) for subsection (6) of section 797A substitute 
<P>
`Section 797(3) shall have effect as if any amount carried forward to the applicable accounting period under section 83(2)(d) of the Finance Act 1996 were an amount capable of being allocated only to any non-trading profits of the company.'
<P>
(d) in section 797A(7) insert at the end 
<P>
'In determining whether the company has a non-trading deficit for the applicable accounting period, any deficit carried forward to that period under the provisions of section 83(3) Finance Act 1996 is to be ignored.'.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>The clause relates to a complex area of tax law, which relates to the taxation of interest income and expenses. I apologise to the Economic Secretary for having such a large comfort blanket, but I do not have the advantage, which she has, of four or five highly expert Inland Revenue officials passing her notes every two or three minutes.
<P>
The taxation regime for income and expenses was changed by the previous Government in 1996. The clause seeks to remedy a remaining anomaly. Unfortunately, the way in which the clause is drafted means that it not only fails to remedy the anomaly but changes the regime for the worst, and does so retrospectively.
<P>
The new regime means that if there is an excess of interest expense over interest income on a loan taken out for non-trade purposes for example, the acquisition of an overseas subsidiary that excess is called, in the jargon, a non-trading deficit. It is possible to offset that deficit against other profits, make it subject to group relief or carry it back to previous years. If a company does not do one of those three things, under this clause that deficit can be carried forward as a non-trading deficit arising in the next accounting period.
<P>
Previously an unrelieved non-trading deficit was treated as a non-trading debit arising in the next accounting period. The distinction between a deficit and a debit, to which I hope Labour Members will pay attention, is important. On a strict reading of the law, debits that were carried forward would have to be included in a calculation of profit or loss in the following accounting period. That meant that the debit would be automatically offset before any other reliefs, such as double tax relief, were available. As a result of that, double tax credit relief would often be lost, because the loss brought forward would be automatically offset.
<P>
As every member of the Committee will know, double tax relief cannot be carried forward from one year to the next in other words, the overseas tax paid is wasted. To avoid that, the Revenue introduced a concession whereby deficits could be treated as deficits in the following year. The clause purports to make that concessionary basis a statutory basis. Unfortunately, the clause does not amend section 797A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The unintended result of that omission is that where a non-trading deficit is brought forward under section 83(3) of the Finance Act 1986, an equivalent amount of current period non-trading debits would compulsorily have to be relieved against the company's current period non-trading loan credits. That would give rise to a wasted double tax relief, which was not the Government's intention in the clause.
<P>
The amendment would remedy that oversight. If the Government do not accept it, there will be a retrospective restriction on a company's ability to claim double tax credit relief. I therefore hope that the Government accept it.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> We congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his grasp of this difficult and technical clause. We have no quarrel with his aims, although he will appreciate that his amendment is defective and that we cannot accept it as it is. If he wants our reasons, I would be happy to give them to him. We are aware of the matter, and we shall bring forward the necessary amendment on Report. I hope that with that assurance he will withdraw the amendment so that we can make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> In view of the Paymaster General's response, I look forward to seeing the amendment on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We are being invited to place what is virtually a defective clause on the statute book.
<P>
A few moments ago the Economic Secretary criticised the Opposition, perhaps rather rashly, for the drafting of our amendments. We have to draft our own amendments, but the Government have the advantage of hundreds of officials and weeks of time and they have at their disposal the Parliamentary Counsel Office. They even have officials in this Room to help them.
<P>
I must draw your attention, Mrs. Dunwoody, to lines 16, 17 and 18 of the clause, which appear on page 67 of the Bill and which include paragraph (b). Is that paragraph (b) a replica of the paragraph (b) that appears a few lines above it? Has it slipped into the Bill by mistake from the word processor perhaps the same hapless draftsman who worked on schedule 5 is involved or should it be paragraph (e)? The last time that we came across such sloppy drafting, both explanations were offered in the course of one afternoon. Perhaps the Paymaster General will make up his mind and say which paragraph (b) he is commending to the Committee.
<P>
More seriously, I am given to understand that the amendments that the clause will make to schedule 28A of the Taxes Act 1988 are also defective. They do not properly amend paragraph 7(1)(b) of that schedule, and they do not correspondingly amend paragraph 16(1)(b) of that same schedule. A good case can be made for recommitment, and there is no shame in that. The Government are new to office, they have got a lot of things wrong in the Bill and there has been much sloppy drafting. I have established that there are at least four technical deficiencies in the clause, which should be taken away and brought back at a later stage of our proceedings or who knows? on Report in a proper form.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I should take this opportunity to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that there are two small misprints in subsection (2): "1998" should be "1988", and the second paragraph (b) in line 16 should be paragraph (e). They will be altered when the Bill is reprinted. There is no need to withdraw the clause for such minor corrections. An amendment will be made on Report to meet the point that was made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. On that understanding, we recommend that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am sorry to say that I am not satisfied by that. First, the Paymaster General has accepted that paragraph (b) of subsection (2) should be paragraph (e). We are grateful for that clarification, which will require an amendment at a later stage. Secondly, he has drawn attention to a further error in subsection (2), where a wrong date has been given. Such an error cannot be corrected even by the sleight of your pen, Mrs. Dunwoody. That will also require a formal Government amendment. Thirdly, he has failed to comment on the clause's omission of paragraphs 7(1)(b) and 16(1)(b) from schedule 28A. Perhaps he could now deal with those points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to make a great deal out of very little. They are straightforward misprints that will be corrected. With regard to his other points, they are simply not correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is the Paymaster General clear about the difference betwen a misprint and an omission? The misprinting of the date of the Taxes Act, or of paragraphs, can be corrected by reprinting the Bill. However, the omission of references to additional paragraphs of schedule 28A can be corrected only by a Government amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The two misprints are simply misprints. I have made it clear that we are taking advice on how to amend the Bill. That amendment will be tabled in the normal way on Report. I have acknowledged that Conservative Members, who are quite good on some technical matters, have successfully spotted those errors. On that gracious basis, I shall seek advice on how best to redraft the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Paymaster General keeps looking around in the desperate hope that advice may reach him. Perhaps we should summon the hon. Member for Paisley, South who has not been in the Committee today; he may be able to assist the Paymaster General.
<P>
Five deficiencies have now been recognised in the clause: the date is wrong; the paragraph lettering is wrong; two paragraphs, 7(1)(b) and 16(1)(b) of schedule 28A, have been omitted altogether; and my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has drawn attention to a yet further deficiency. Is it right to include in the Bill a clause that has, by the Government's own admission, five errors?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> As I have categorically stated, we will table any necessary amendments on Report.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 82 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 83</center></H4>
<H4><center>First-year allowances for small businesses etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I beg to move amendment No. 202, in page 67, leave out lines 30 to 34, and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) any expenditure which, disregarding any effect of section 83(2) on the time at which it is to treated as incurred by 
<P>
(i) a small company or a small business; or
<P>
(ii) any person on the provision of machinery or plant for leasing for a period of 2 years or longer to a small company or small business;
[Dr. Vincent Cable]
<P>
in the period beginning with 2nd July 1998 and ending with 1st July 1999; and".
<P></ul></font>
The purpose of the amendment is to incorporate leasing finance into a clause that rightly extends first-year enhanced capital allowance for small enterprises. Those who have experience of the manufacturing industry will realise the importance of leasing finance. Currently, leasing and hire purchase accounts for well over one-third of capital investment finance in manufacturing. Such finance is particularly important in small-scale industry because many companies are unable to finance investment themselves. Approximately half of all small-scale enterprises in the manufacturing sector use leasing finance; about 20 per cent. of their outstanding commercial debt takes that form.
<P>
Leasing is therefore a very important form of finance. By excluding it from the enhanced capital allowance provision, the value of otherwise welcome support for manufacturing investment is significantly devalued.
<P>
We have been approached as, I am sure, have the Government by the industry. The Finance and Leaseholds Association obviously has an interest and the Confederation of British Industry, which sees this as a important mechanism, wants leasing finance to be properly recognised. It was clear from the Committee's debates last year that the Government had some difficulty with treating leasing finance on the same basis as other forms of finance. The problem is that it revolves around the somewhat artificial distinction between the finance and manufacturing sectors. Because of the peculiar nature of leasing finance, the lessor the owner of the machine who is, in effect, the financier, has to claim the tax allowance. It is not claimed by the manufacturer. That technical difficulty causes the Government problems.
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is a technical legal distinction rather than an economic one. The sector is highly competitive. Any benefits that are derived by the lessor as a result of claiming allowance are immediately passed on to the user the manufacturing company through lower leasing rates. It is perverse to deprive small-scale manufacturing enterprises of the same benefits that are accruing through other financial channels.
<P>
I ask the Government to reconsider their position. I should like the Paymaster General to answer two questions: first, do the Government recognise and acknowledge the role of leasing finance, particularly for small-scale enterprises; and secondly, if they agree that the tax law discriminates against leasing finance, how can we overcome that? Our amendment suggests a way to do that, but I would welcome any other ideas on how to remedy the deficiency.

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I suppose we should welcome an amendment from the Liberal Democrats. They are moving into the big league. The first two issues that they raised for discussion concerned bottle fermented cider and the exact date of the millennium. At least we now have a serious amendment on which they appear to have a position. A few moments ago, they could not tell us whether they were for or against clause 80. Indeed, they abstained when we voted.
<P>
Before I comment on the amendment in detail, I must point out that the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) gave no idea of how much his proposal would cost. I understand from material supplied to the Committee that it would cost £55 million over five years. It would have helped the Committee had he given us that figure and said where the money might come from. It is all very well coming to the Committee and asking for £55 million, but is that to come from the education or health budget, or does he intend to propose other fiscal changes?
<P>
As for the amendment itself, the point regarding leasing is important. I am sure that the Paymaster General, who had to deal with this last year, will address it. A number of issues need to be considered, not least the effect on inward investment, where leasing plays an important role. Given the further changes in this year's Budget, it would be helpful if the Paymaster General gave some idea of his longer term strategy for first-year allowances. Will the rate continue to decline? Will it be 30 per cent. in the following year and so on?
<P>
Finally, it would be helpful if the Paymaster General would say whether he intends to maintain the same period. We understand why it was July to July because of the timing of the new Labour Government's first Budget but that may not be the most helpful period for those affected by the allowances and perhaps the Paymaster General has plans to align the period more properly with the tax year.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I want to follow on from the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) by saying that I support the amendment on the grounds that it would provide some help to the very businesses that the Economic Secretary told us, when debating clause 76, that she wanted to help. She denied that help in the debate on clause 80 and I fear that her colleague is now being asked to deny the help that the amendment would provide.
<P>
It is regrettable that the benefit for small businesses is available for only one year at a time. Many small businesses simply do not have the resources available or even the taxable profits within that one-year period to take advantage of clause 83. Many people outside the Committee have said that the clause will accelerate investment decisions that would have been made anyway, but it will not enable small companies to plan a higher level of capital investment over a longer period. One way of tackling that would be to extend the period of the concession. Another way, perhaps less satisfactory because of the costs that might be involved, would be to allow leasing finance to be brought in so that companies could afford the higher level of investment while the concession exists. As it stands and without any improvement the amendment might be one improvement and others could be considered the clause is another example of the Government's tokenism towards small businesses without giving any real assistance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> We have had this debate several times and, as the hon. Member for Sevenoaks said, we discussed the matter at length last time round. We are still far from clear whether the provision covering capital allowances provides only a one-off, short-term effect. I opposed the measure when it was introduced in 1983 or 1984 in one of the last Bills on which the hon. Member for Sevenoaks and I worked together. Now that I am in office, I find it disappointing that no one has carried out a study of the effects of the shift. There is a body of thought in the Treasury and Inland Revenue that capital allowances have a one-off effect and merely bring forward investment decisions that would have taken place anyway. The measure may be useful during a depression or when industry is coming out of a long period of inactivity or inadequate investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
I should like a serious study to be carried out of some of the companies that are directly involved and perhaps even the Machine Tool Technologies Association could work on it and sponsor a professional study of the situation in comparable industries and even comparable countries. We might then have a clearer view of the matter.
<P>
For the moment, there are sufficient indications to continue the measure that we introduced last July, albeit at a slightly reduced level. I believe that it has considerable potential benefits, but we need to prove that more conclusively than we have been able to do so far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I declare an interest in making my point. The Paymaster General rightly said that first-year allowances can be given to industries in depression. Agriculture has seen its profits roughly halved over the past year. Why has the writing down allowance of 12 per cent. not been continued in the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That is another issue, to which I shall willingly come back although it arises in relation to neither the amendment nor our debate on capital allowances, leasing and the other ways in which companies can invest in equipment.
<P>
The introduction of leasing would be an advantage to leasing companies, which pay tax at the high rate. We have thought carefully about the matter, and our view is that there is no need to change the present regime. We all know about the problems that are associated with leasing. If a company wants to make an investment and to take advantage of the extended allowance, which will be available for a further year, there is nothing to stop it. Most companies that I know of take advantage of the allowance they do so in relation to bank overdrafts and hire-purchase arrangements, and qualify automatically for it. Leaving leasing companies outside the system is not in any way a hindrance. We did not find great resistance to the proposal even in the leasing industry I met some leasing organisations only this week.
<P>
We must establish a settled policy on capital allowances for small and medium-sized companies, which are important they constitute 99 per cent. of companies and are responsible for up to 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. of investments. The matter needs to be studied and we must come up with a proper policy, perhaps in relation to other policies. We explained the various reviews that are currently under way, including research and development expenditure and ways to recruit specialist management to small start-up companies. The capital allowances scheme is important in that context.
<P>
We are not prepared to accept the amendment at this stage I do not believe that it significantly affects the usefulness or effectiveness of our capital allowances programme. We are examining the matter and I hope that by the next Budget we shall have a settled view on it and on related measures, which may encourage investment in research and development and help the small and medium-sized company sector.
<P>
Against that background I must resist the amendment. If it is pressed to a vote we shall oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Paymaster General has been helpful, but he did not reply to two of my points. Is he satisfied that the exclusion of leasing is not damaging inward investment? If he would reassure the Committee on that matter it would help the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) to decide what to do with his amendment.
<P>
I also asked the Paymaster General an even more technical question about the July to July periods. Is he safisfied with that arrangement continuing year after year or should it be tidied up and brought into line with the tax year?
<P>
I welcome the study that the Paymaster General suggested. It is, I think, 14 years since he and I tangled over the Industrial Development Bill, which is a long time ago now. If he is suggesting that the Finance and Leasing Association and the Machine Tool Technologies Association should co-operate with the Government in that study, that would be thoroughly welcome all round.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I should respond to the question that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked when he seemed to be rehearsing for the job of Paymaster General in years to come that job may be a long time in coming, but he seemed to be preparing to defend the Treasury brief. He asked about the provision's cost. His figure of £55 million is reasonable, taking into account capital allowances and the revenue gained subsequently. The logic of his remarks if a question of econony is involved is that there should be no capital allowances. Basic economics about which we should not argue in Committee means that we should not see the cost of advanced capital allowances in narrow fiscal terms. When additional investment is made, outputs and additional incomes will be generated, all of which are in turn taxable. The figure of £55 million represents a purely static and narrow consideration of public sector accounting; I would not accept that as a criticism of the amendment. But I share the view of the hon. Member for Sevenoaks that what the Paymaster General said about the approach to capital allowances and his willingness to study the matter takes us a little further forward. If the Paymaster General's study incorporates the role of leasing finance in relation to small scale[Dr. Cable]
enterprises and inward investment that takes us forward. We do not need to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to make one further point in response to the Paymaster General's comments. I think that he is perpetuating misunderstanding by saying that the purpose of the allowance or even its effect  would be to benefit the leasing companies. The workings of the market mean that the effect would be passed on to the manufacturers and users. Regarding the allowance as a benefit for the lessor only would be a misunderstanding of the way in which the market works.
<P>
I am happy with the Paymaster General's assurance that the issue will be properly studied over the year, and I hope that a more satisfactory basis for this complex area will be established.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Many leasing companies pass on the benefits, and given the higher rate of tax that they pay for which the figure is 40 per cent. the disadvantage is not that great. It would be sensible to find an alternative for the July arrangement as soon as possible we have just entered it this year but we want to introduce a range of policies that relate specifically to small and medium-sized companies. We shall introduce those policies in the next Budget, if we can get the package together in time, thereby addressing various problems in the same Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks also asked about inward investment. I think that he would readily agree that the purpose of capital allowances is not to increase inward investment, and I am told that it is an inefficient way of promoting inward investment and is contrary to EC law. He may wish to address that matter on another occasion.
<P>
I think that I have covered all the points, and I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Are we discussing the amendment or the clause?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are discussing the amendment. I am sorry if I have not been clear, but I called the amendment in the name of Dr. Cable.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> As I said a few moments ago, I am happy, in light of the Paymaster General's remarks, to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am glad to catch your eye, Mrs. Dunwoody, at the appropriate point. The Paymaster General brushed aside my point about agricultural allowances. If he is prepared to respond. I will desist from making a speech. Otherwise, I will have to make a speech and make my points at greater length. Since it seems that the Paymaster General will not respond, I must make the points.
<P>
In the previous Finance Bill, there was a special provision giving agricultural and other long-term assets a 12 per cent. writing-down allowance. As the profits of the agricultural industry have declined by 45 per cent., it seems somewhat bizarre that that measure has not been continued. As the Paymaster General and my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford said, the whole rationale for capital allowances is to speed up investment in a sector that is in a depressed condition. It would be most appropriate, therefore, to continue the benefit for agricultural buildings. On behalf of the whole agricultural industry which is suffering in difficult economic conditions I hope that the Paymaster General will explain carefully why the Government are unable to continue with this tax concession.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I should like to draw the Paymaster General's attention to a retrospective change, which has not been flagged sufficiently.
<P>
The previous Finance Bill introduced first-year capital allowances for small and medium-sized enterprises at the rate of 50 per cent. for qualifying investments made before 1 July 1998. The clause extends that, albeit at a lower rate.
<P>
The Inland Revenue issued a press release when the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced packages of business assistance for Northern Ireland. In paragraph 8 of page 2, it proposed a significant change to the regime of first-year capital allowances. Until 12 May 1998 the date of the Revenue press release it was possible for a subsidiary of a foreign group that satisfied the small and medium-sized enterprise size test to obtain the first-year allowances introduced by the Finance Act 1997, provided that the enterprise was not a member of a large sub-group with a UK-incorporated parent. Those foreign-owned subsidiaries were able to benefit from first-year capital allowances.
<P>
Tucked away in the 12 May press release and unannounced in all other respects, was an announcement that from that date, those foreign companies could not take advantage of the first-year capital allowances if the group of which they were a subsidiary was large by the test of UK company law. The Revenue's proposal was that the foreign-owned group of which the subsidiary was a member in this country should itself satisfy the small and medium-sized enterprise size test as laid down by the Companies Act.
<P>
The Government propose retrospectively to withdraw the possibility of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country not just in Northern Ireland that are foreign-owned subsidiaries from obtaining first-year capital allowances up to 1 July 1998. That is a withdrawal of a legitimate expectation. It seems that the purpose of the Inland Revenue's press release was to prevent the allowances introduced by clause 83 from being available to those foreign companies. There is a logic to that.
<P>
However, at the time of last July's Budget, the Financial Secretary specifically said that foreign companies in such a position would be able to continue for the full year until 1 July 1998 to claim allowances. She said that, as a one-off measure, it was not worth legislating to prevent those companies from making qualifying investments under the regime introduced by last year's Finance Bill. Why did the Financial Secretary make that statement? Will he acknowledge that the measure introduces retrospective taxation which he and his officials should reconsider?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> On the agricultural point made by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), the buildings were not included in the measures announced in July last year. Plant and machinery for agricultural use were, of course, included. We deliberately excluded all long-life assets cars, ships, railways and buildings. The hon. Gentleman should concentrate on that essential point.
<P>
I have no immediate response for the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, but I shall get back to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Does the Paymaster General intend to answer my question in the debate? I would prefer an oral explanation to a letter at a later date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give the hon. Gentleman an explanation when I have had time to discuss the matter with my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary. I will ensure that he gets a letter or is properly briefed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My request is that we debate the matter in Committee. I do not want a letter. It is a vital point about retrospective taxation. The ability to claim first-year capital allowances is being withdrawn during the year in which the allowances were made available for qualifying companies and for qualifying investments. So from 12 May until 1 July, companies will suffer retrospective taxation.
<P>
Many times during our debates, we have seen that the Government seem to think that they can introduce retrospection willy-nilly, without accounting for their reasons. It is my legitimate request that the matter should be debated in Committee, not brushed off in a letter. I have already made one request for information, to which the Financial Secretary said that she would respond by letter, and I have yet to receive a reply. I should like a prompt and full analysis from the Paymaster General, of which I am sure he is capable, during the course of our sitting today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> We need not go any further into the matter at the moment because it does not relate to clause 83. Legislation will be tabled on Report, and there will be ample opportunity to discuss it then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I do not see the problem with a Committee member raising a question about retrospective taxation in relation to something as important as first-year capital allowances. Is it too much to expect the Paymaster General to do his homework during lunchtime and respond in full, so that we can debate the issue?
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 83 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 84 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 14 agreed to.

Further consideration adjourned. [Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]
