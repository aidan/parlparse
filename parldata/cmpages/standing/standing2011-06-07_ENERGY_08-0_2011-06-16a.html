mentioned to me that before the break they heard me state that I wished
to peel an otter. I assure hon. Members that I have no intention of
doing that; I would not wish to get into trouble with animal rights
lobbies. I was talking about piling Pelion on Ossa, which is what I was
about to do. The carbon emissions reduction target is popularly
supposed to have stayed outside the definition of imputed taxation;
while that might have been an indication that its successor, the energy
company obligation, will also stay outside it, that is not the case.
CERT has never been looked at by the Office for National Statistics;
indeed, I understand that CERT has just been referred to the ONS
classification committee for precisely that purpose, so it is
conceivable that if the ONS classification committee decides that CERT
is indeed imputed taxation, it could come within a framework before
CERT runs out at the end of
2012.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With
regard to the upcoming potential range of funding for ECO, not only do
we not know what the extent of the funding might be; we may well find
that the funding, for reasons outside the control of the Department of
Energy and Climate Change, is seriously circumscribed for the future.
That is why it is doubly important that we are clear about what the
overall priority for ECO
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
occasion I have referred to the little diagram in the booklet produced
by DECC that accompanies the Committee’s deliberations. It talks
about green deal finance. The circle below that refers to<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the next most

               </p>
               <p>That
relates to hard-to-treat homes. Then there is a reference to the ECO
subsidy and measures providing affordable warmth to the vulnerable.
That makes clear the idea that there could be two purposes for
ECO—indeed, one might say two and a half purposes, inasmuch as
it is certainly true that a disproportionate number of those
hard-to-treat homes will be homes in which people who are vulnerable
and fuel-poor
live.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
without a target arrangement as far as ECO is concerned, bearing in
mind the limitations that there may well be on its budget, it is more
than possible that the diagram in the document will end up with most of
the second circle of ECO subsidy, or perhaps all of it, being taken up
by the next most cost-effective measures, particularly as the document
itself, as I have previously mentioned,
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
Committee on Climate Change recommended in their 2009 Report,
‘Meeting Carbon Budgets—the need for a step
change’, that 2.3 million solid wall homes will need to have
taken up solid wall insulation by 2022 in order for the UK to be on
track to achieve carbon
budgets.”<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000545">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
may well be, as my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree, has
illustrated, that most of the homes that could be insulated by 2022
could be solid wall homes in which people in fuel poverty live. She
referred to 1.9 million homes falling into that category. Even that
figure is way outside what looks like the current funding envelope for
the ECO. If we do the mathematics on the cost per home to install solid
wall insulation, even that measure would require, according to the
report from the Committee on Climate Change, far more funding than we
think is likely for ECO in that period. That should be
revisited.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
absolutely essential campaign on homes that are hard to treat and do
not have cavity walls may need other forms of assistance behind it, in
addition to ECO, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 285<a class="bkMark" name="Column285">&#160;</a>
                  </div>if we are to reach the target. The purpose of ECO may be to deal with
some solid wall homes, but essentially it is to support people who are
vulnerable and in fuel poverty, and who may not be able to access the
green deal due to their particular circumstances. As has been
emphasised, if they accessed the green deal, they would, by and large,
do so not to save money on their fuel bills, but so that they could
heat their homes to acceptable standards of warmth, so that they were
not cold, under-heated and deprived of a decent temperature in their
homes.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Fundamentally,
that aim runs over the question of the golden rule. If we had the
provision in the Bill, it would give important clarification on where
the ECO is going. It would also be an enormous help for those people
who are already preparing to get under way; it would allow them to
anticipate what the ECO will do. I spoke at a conference yesterday, and
the lack of clarity about what the ECO will do was a widespread concern
among those in the practical business of thinking about how to go along
with green deal proposals, what role the green deal may play in that,
and the extent to which the green deal will work in tandem with ECO
where people are vulnerable and fuel-poor. The new clause has an
enormous amount to commend it. I hope that the Minister will at least
feel able to clarify, for all our sakes, where the ECO is going, and to
accept it as an addition to the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000046">&#160;</a>

grateful for the opportunity to make a few remarks about the ECO in
relation to new clause 23 and clause 64. We have heard from members of
the Committee—and, I think, from the Minister in an earlier
sitting—about the split between the two areas that the ECO is
intended to address. Various people have talked about Venn diagrams and
how big the crossover part in the middle is. It is well understood that
there is a degree of crossover; some hard-to-heat homes are inhabited
by people who are fuel-poor.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000047">&#160;</a>

of occasions, including on Second Reading, I have raised the point,
with regard to the development of the green deal, about hard-to-heat
homes in my constituency and the constituencies of many others. In the
part of the world that I represent, there are a lot of stone-built
properties with high ceilings and big, draughty windows. Often, they
are tenement properties; people who are familiar with Glasgow and
Edinburgh will know of them. I just place on record that I do not
represent Glasgow, in case any of my constituents read this
contribution. Rutherglen is very different from Glasgow, although it is
next to it. The properties are very similar, and were built by the same
people at around the same time. They are hard to heat; they do not have
lofts and often do not have walls suitable for cavity-wall insulation.
However, a lot of them are social housing. Even those that are not are
flats rather than large houses, and the occupiers are fuel-poor. That
is where priority should be aimed.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I understand
the point made earlier in response to the hon. Member for Brighton,
Pavilion: this is a 10-year programme. We are talking about a possible
£20 billion over 10 years. However, how we start is important.
If the amount is in the order of £2 billion a year, we should
start with people in fuel poverty, some of whom will be in hard-to-heat
homes. That will give a degree of certainty, to refer to what my hon.
Friend the Member

                  </div>for Southampton, Test, said about the discussions he has had. It is also
important to set the priority for the Government. As time goes on and
some of the issues are dealt with, it might be possible to extend the
programme further to hard-to-heat homes where fuel poverty is not as
acute an issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000049">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
also want to make a point referred to in the TV documentary mentioned
by a number of hon. Members. This is not the direct responsibility of
the Ministers here or of the policy that we are discussing, but dealing
with fuel poverty can have a huge positive impact on other areas of
public policy where there might be public spending implications, such
as health and social care. There is a benefit for public policy and the
Government in putting that initial focus on people who are
fuel-poor.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000050">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I have a
couple of points to make about the ECO, on which I have received
representations from a Scottish perspective that may not have come to
the attention of Ministers and their officials. I grew up in south-east
England and have lived in Scotland for eight or nine years, and for the
past year I have had the bizarre existence, as many of us have, of
being in both one place and another. I cannot remember the quote that
the Minister gave earlier to describe being in two places. Even at this
time of year, I know the difference in climate between central London
and the west of Scotland. Only a couple of weeks ago, we had to have
our heating on at home during the day, which people in this part of the
world probably did not.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000051">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The serious
point is that there is a difference, as is shown in studies. I
appreciate that some of the studies are hard to quantify exactly, but
there is an appreciable difference in the amount of money people spend
on their fuel bills in the west of Scotland and the west of England.
Some studies from before the recent price increases put that at about
£120 a year. There is a significant difference, partly due to
the climate and partly due to the styles of property.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000054">&#160;</a>

differences. I am not sure whether the Minister has had an opportunity
to address that. He will probably tell me that it will be part of what
is looked at in more detail in the autumn. It would be useful to get an
indication of what will happen in geographical areas—not just
Scotland—where there are significant differences that will need
to be addressed if the ECO is to be the successful antidote to the
market mechanism that the Minister has talked about in the green deal.

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. There is
another point that has not come up in Committee. There has been an
assumption that money is spent either in a prosperous, able-to-pay
household or in a fuel-poor household. We are trying to be creative in
looking at the ECO. It is entirely possible that we could end up
subsidising the advancement of new technologies, but not at the point
at which they are put into the household. Energy company partners could
work on helping, either at the design or testing stage, to bring
forward or scale up products that will have more than one application.
For example, there has been little advancement in product design and
economics in recent years on solid wall insulation or similar products,
particularly for older properties which could be inhabited either by
the fuel-poor—they often are—or people who are
significantly wealthier. Working with the industry to identify how we
can drive innovation and bring down costs in the product development
stream is another possible avenue. It does not have to be a binary
choice between subsidising a product at the point of installation in a
wealthy person’s home or in the home of someone who is
fuel-poor.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000060">&#160;</a>

development, a move to subsidise either the roll-out or the scaling-up
is entirely feasible. I am not saying that we will do that, but we are
considering it. What is the best way to leverage up the subsidy? Is it
to use it at the very end of the supply chain, at the point at which it
is being installed in a home, or might a more discreet intervention
earlier on in product development result in bringing to market cheaper,
more effective products? We are keeping the door open on that. We
should not just think that we have to pay full whack at the end of the
supply chain process.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000062">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree for getting that point clarified.
While the Minister was speaking, I thought to myself, “He cannot
possibly mean that there’s yet another call on this very small
pot of money.” Of course, it is helpful to promote innovation,
but the idea that the already hard-pressed pot of money, which, until
now, most of us thought would be used primarily to help the fuel-poor
immediately, will go on subsiding the industry to come up with more
innovate products is deeply
worrying.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000063">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Don’t get me wrong; I am not saying that
the money will be an alternative source of research funding, but there
is a point at which it could subsidise products with more than one
application. By subsidising products that go into fuel-poor homes at
scale, we would help to bring down the price of products that could
then be installed in other properties. I am not saying that there will
be a different type of funding, because we have budgets for research
and development, but we should not believe that it will be a binary
choice. The economic impact of helping to scale-up products that will
go to the fuel-poor will have a knock-on economic effect on the
availability of
products.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
whole point of the green deal, creating a market framework and using
the ECO is to inject investment and scale. We want to use a new
framework to drive private sector investment into product development
and create larger-scale investment that will bring down the cost of a
whole suite of products. While the focus obviously remains on in-home
applications, the cascading effect of that will be much wider than the
simple binary choice between expensive products going into home A or
cheap products going into home
B.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000065">&#160;</a>

innovation, research and bringing forward new products. I wish to press
him a little further, because that is a new departure for the Committee

                  </strong> In general terms, subsidising at scale a new range
of products—such as solid wall insulation or window
treatment—designed to treat fuel-poor homes will give rise to
support for a range of products that can perhaps be fitted in a
complete development. When that learning is captured and the product is
developed and manufactured at scale, or there is a large order,
benefits will accrue throughout the supply
chain.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000067">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister’s clarification is
helpful. As other members of the Committee have made product
placements, I will, too. Rockwool in my consistency generates hundreds
of jobs and provides a good wall insulation product. According to the
Minister, it could bring forward a new product specifically for
households that might benefit from the ECO. It could make a claim on
the ECO pot of money to develop it and bring it to
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000068">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Obviously, we are talking in broad terms. It would
not work with a small number of homes, but Rockwool could work on a
project where it is retrofitting a large number of fuel-poor homes. If
it were identified that it would be useful to work with a particular
product for a type of property that was common across a large number of
fuel-poor households, that intervention could be subsidised. The
knock-on effect would mean that the scale, the learning and the product
development would not be lost, but benefit the wider product
development and range, and continue to bear down on the cost of the
products. Many solid wall products, in particular, have not come down
in price as quickly as we would like, because of a chicken-and-egg
situation. However, once we start to invest in them at scale and see
orders come forward, albeit specifically in response to dealing with
problems of the fuel-poor, the benefits will accrue right across the
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000069">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Would not that scheme run better if it were driven
by demand rather than supply? If the Minister wants to stimulate
innovation, surely the way to do it is to ensure that a lot of ECO
money goes to the many houses needing solid wall insulation. Once there
is demand, that will drive innovation and get costs down. It seems
perverse to do it the other way round, if that is also at the expense
of giving scarce resources to those homes more
directly.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000070">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Let me make it clear that we are not giving direct
support for research and development; that is not the role of the ECO.
However, the ECO could support specific measures in homes. Projects
could identify the need for specific measures at scale purchase either
through a green deal provider acting across a range of similar
properties, or through a local authority that, as a green deal
provider, signs up to improve many similar properties as part of a
co-operative—in other words, has a sufficient volume of similar
homes with similar problems to find it worth while to work with a
supplier on a specific contract for specific insulation
products.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Doing
that would incentivise the supplier—for example, the company in
the constituency of the hon. Member for Ogmore—to invest in that
product; to come forward with a cheaper production price; to invest in
research and development and in product development, and to create
something which, in relation to product specification and price, better
fits the needs of the fuel-poor. However, the resulting learning and
economies of scale will benefit everyone else in the supply chain who
might benefit from such an intervention, regardless of whether they are
fuel-poor. The ECO will have the ripple effect of driving market
development which, in turn, will help those—not necessarily the
fuel-poor but those with hard-to-treat homes—who could benefit
indirectly from such
treatments.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000072">&#160;</a>

slightly new departure in the use of the ECO. There might be great
logic to it, but I am still struggling to understand whether there is a
direct draw for companies, which may be good or bad, on the limited pot
of money for the ECO. Will the Minister write to all the members of the
Committee at the weekend to outline his thinking? It might be a
fantastic innovation, but we are worried about the draw on what he has

commensurate with the size of the challenge, and it will drive down
costs. The opportunity for co-operatives and local community groups, in
particular, to use their purchasing power smartly, rather than just on
an individual house-by-house basis, will have a more punchy effect in
driving innovation and bringing down
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000075">&#160;</a>

something that we can put off until we have defeated fuel poverty. We

the scale of interventions in the average household. We have said that
they should have an entitlement, or an expectation, of a reasonable
spend of up to £10,000. We fully accept that there will be
exceptions to that rule—either larger homes that have larger
heating bills, which means that it makes sense that they can afford a
bigger intervention, or homes with a need to spend more. That may be
through the paid-for-through-savings model, if a household is able to
pay for it, or it may be from the ECO. However, we will have to be

change.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000086">&#160;</a>

reasonable person, and he is. I therefore find it hard to understand
why he appears to be saying that if we are tackling fuel poverty,
somehow we are not tackling climate change. To me, the two things come
together beautifully, and they could do so with the ECO. For example,
if we have two properties that are both hard to treat, in one of which
there is a fuel-poor family and in the other an able-to-pay family, the
environment does not care which one we insulate first. As long as the
emissions come down, it does not matter what position the family inside
is in. However, if we as politicians say, “Let us combine the
environmental and social agendas by prioritising properties that have
the fuel-poor in them,” surely that is a gain for both the
environment and the social
side.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000087">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> That is exactly what we are doing. The hon. Lady
articulates our point entirely. However, there may be cases where it
makes good sense to offer some form of subsidy, through the ECO, to the
average home owner who is not fuel-poor, but who lives in an older or
difficult-to-treat building. Someone on average earnings, or even on
below-average earnings, but who does not meet the narrow definition of
“fuel-poor”, should be entitled to some additional help
to treat their home to bring it up to a standard that will help us meet
our climate change targets. That is what the ECO is designed to do. It
is not just about eliminating fuel poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000088">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We must
remember that when dealing with the fuel-poor, in some cases, the
consumption of energy can go up. The rebound effect of the fuel-poor is
disproportionately larger than that of a typical household. Often, what
we are talking about in dealing with fuel poverty is installing heating
systems and raising the warmth of the home. Obviously, we are looking
to do that in a much more efficient thermal envelope, but we are not
necessarily talking about making the same level of carbon savings as we
would in another
household.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000089">&#160;</a>

its bill to jet off to the Caribbean three times a year. The idea that
insulating a fuel-poor household that would benefit from thermal
comfort would be worse for the environment than whatever an able-to-pay
family might do with the money saved from its fuel bills, which may go
on iPads, widgets, aviation and all kinds of carbon-intensive things,

because the situation will change. However, general economic analysis
suggests that the rebound effect is typically about 15% in an average
family, and up to 40% for the fuel-poor. I gave evidence to the House
of Lords European Union Sub-Committee on the EU energy efficiency
framework to that effect. Those figures are generally accepted. Any
general theory is of course open to all sorts of exceptions, but I do

would allow us to keep on track to meet our carbon reduction targets.

                  </strong> What I attempted to make clear in my earlier
contribution, which I hope the Minister will take on board, is that it
is inevitable that the ECO will be rationed for the reasons the
Minister gave and that I put forward in my comments. If the ECO were
not rationed, it would be perfectly reasonable to say that the bulk of
the money in an ECO programme should go to the fuel-poor and for the
Minister to make the point about action on fuel poverty being linked to
action on climate change and improvements to people’s property
generally.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
because we know that the ECO will be fundamentally rationed over the
next period, the issue is how to prioritise what is the best outcome
for the ECO overall. The best outcome would be to combine action on
fuel poverty and action on climate change. It would not be the best
outcome if the ECO were not rationed because the sort of circumstances
that the Minister describes would rightly come into play, and everyone
who would benefit from having their home uprated would have an ECO.
However, I am afraid that that will not be the case. I am sure that the
Minister is working very hard to ensure that the ECO is as large as it
can be, but we know that it will be rationed. That is the fundamental
point being made
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000103">&#160;</a>

legislation, having engaged widely with stakeholders on a genuinely
complex area, we will endeavour to steer our way through these issues.
I am being drawn here, but I am trying to be clear about the matter.
Opposition Members seem to be suggesting—although this seems to
change in their interventions—that the ECO should be exclusively
for the fuel-poor. I know that the hon. Member for Southampton, Test is
not saying that, but other hon. Members have said in interventions that
it should be exclusively for the fuel poor or “not for the able
to pay,” which I think is what the hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree said. If it is not for the able to pay, that is the same
thing as being exclusively for the fuel-poor. That is not semantics; it
is just the basis of what she said.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000104">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
agree with the hon. Member for Southampton, Test. Our focus must be on
trying to do as much as we can for the fuel-poor. I would be hesitant
to put a figure on that, but it could be anywhere from 51% to 100%. The
bottom line is that in order to meet our climate change targets, we
have to tackle solid wall insulation. The reality is that the
able-to-pay customer will not, at this point in time, shell out for
solid wall insulation in large numbers. We know that because we have
undertaken a great deal of research. The hon. Gentleman is an expert,
so he will know exactly what we do. There is a market failure there. If
we ignore that and focus exclusively on the fuel-poor—the bottom
element in society—we will not meet our climate change targets.
We are perhaps not as far apart on the matter as we thought we were at
the beginning. I must make it clear that we have twin objectives, not
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000105">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This has been an important debate. It would be
dangerous to conclude from our discussions that we would prefer not to
use the ECO exclusively in fuel-poor households because we are afraid
that those households will heat their homes more fully to be more
comfortable and they will therefore generate more climate change
emissions. We cannot tackle climate change by keeping the fuel-poor in
fuel poverty. If this scheme is not the right way to deal with that
matter because, as we are discussing, households may use more energy as
a result of insulating their homes better, we need to look at a range
of other tools to tackle climate change. I am deeply worried that the
tenor of the argument seems to suggest that because we are worried that
emissions will rise, we will not do as much as we could for fuel-poor
households.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000106">&#160;</a>

absolutely did not say that. The hon. Lady sought to draw me on the
impact of the rebound effect. That is not the purpose of our policy.
Let me make it absolutely clear. The purpose of our policy is to tackle
fuel poverty, and we will make a much better job of it than previous
Governments have been able to. However, to tackle fuel poverty and our
climate change objectives, we must tackle solid wall insulation, and
that is relevant only partly to the fuel-poor.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000107">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Large swathes

people who by no stretch of the imagination are those that the hon.
Lady is trying to caricature as taking three holidays a year in the
Caribbean. They may be teachers, nurses, public sector workers, and
people who work in supermarkets. They may not be fuel-poor, and they
might be insulted if it were suggested that they were in a position to
take three holidays a year. Some people who do not fall into fuel
poverty will need help to make their homes fit the sort of standard
that the hon. Lady and I know must be achieved if we are to transform
the UK’s building stock to meet our climate change objectives.
She cannot expect our climate change objective to be met by providing
subsidy only to the fuel-poor. There is a grown-up, pragmatic balance
to be struck, and I am confident that we will be able to do so through
secondary

exactly how we anticipate the ECO blending into a community roll-out
scheme so that it would benefit the fuel-poor, and also other families
who live in similar houses. A family may live next door to people who
are not working, who live next door to a single mother, who lives next
door to a family with four working people, who live next door to a
widow with a half-decent occupational pension. They may all live in a
relatively non-affluent area and not take three holidays a year in the
Caribbean, but only some would fit into the strict definition of fuel
poverty. It would be sensible, particularly if there was a community
group, to offer them the opportunity for subsidy. The ECO could play an
important role in a community-based solution and blending in the
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000117">&#160;</a>

I shall describe a scheme to tackle fuel poverty that takes
a spatial approach, area by area, that has economies of scale. It is
called CESP—the community energy saving programme. It is already
in place. In effect, the Minister is building on CESP and giving the
ECO a spatial planning dimension. We fully support it, and nothing that
we have said rules it out. However, we are against the finite pot that
he continually stresses to the Committee should be disbursed to those
who might be able to afford to do it themselves as and when he secures
more money from the Treasury. Seeking carbon reductions and tackling
fuel poverty together requires a degree of targeting, including in the
spatial approach that he describes.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000118">&#160;</a>

He says one thing in Committee and another on a blog. We are talking
about allowing the ECO to be deployed in community-based schemes, so
that whole streets and communities can be done; in that way, it will be
most forcefully deployed.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">People should
not be picked out on fuel poverty alone. For example, Birmingham and
Coventry city councils—I met the latter recently—aim to
do their whole housing stock, but they can achieve that only by doing
large groups of neighbourhoods together. That is exactly the sort of
street-by-street roll-out that we want. However, it cannot be done if
councils say, “Your neighbour’s getting solid wall
insulation. We know that you only earn £2,000 a year more, but
you don’t qualify for the fuel poverty definition so we
can’t offer it to you.” It is about being inclusive and
fair, and recognising that many hard-working families need help with
insulation and not only the most fuel-poor. In the long run, it makes
economic sense to cover the housing stock in that way; it is good
economics as well as being
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000120">&#160;</a>

opportunity as a Committee to help the 44,000 people who die every
year, given that the ECO could perhaps prevent people from dying in
future? Should we not be discussing that? Instead of just talking about
the fuel-poor, should we not be looking to introduce legislation so

reductions it could save people’s
lives?<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000121">&#160;</a>

it in context. Successive Governments have pledged in good faith to
tackle fuel poverty. However, under the five years of the previous
Administration the number suffering it increased by more than 2
million. It is simplistic to say that we could stop 44,000 people dying
in cold homes. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it pulls at the
heartstrings, but the solution is rather more complex. If it was not, I
dare say that the last Labour Government would have bequeathed us a
rather better record on fuel poverty. It is not that they did not share
the hon. Gentleman’s passion for helping those 44,000 people,

ECO. We have had a big discussion about that this afternoon. Will there
be some notional figures that give us a sense of how much of that money
will be directed to the fuel-poor, rather than being used in the other
ways that the Minister has described? We are all driving at a real

proposition to try to navigate our way through a range of different
scenarios. It is not only a choice between a rich man in his castle and
the fuel-poor. We can think of lots of different scenarios from our
constituencies, let alone right across the country. We must work not
only with stakeholders, but with other groups who have a legitimate
viewpoint that they want to feed into the consultation, so that, at a
later stage, we come up with a complex, detailed analysis and solution
relating to how we will get through those difficult areas. We want to
reach exactly the destination that the hon. Lady describes, but it will

deal and the ECO will be a game changer for fuel poverty. We will no
longer have Warm Front, CERT or CESP; this will replace all those. In
my estimation, 2 million of the 7 million solid-wall homes are
households in fuel poverty. The whole ECO pot, if we get the £20
billion, would help only those 2 million households, and
there would be nothing left. By National Energy Action’s
estimates, there would still be 3.5 million homes in fuel poverty, if
the ECO is solely targeted at homes that are both fuel-poor and hard to
treat. That is why the amendment has been tabled and why we seek the

Labour Members were party to a Government that failed to tackle that
problem. They could have proposed the green deal and the ECO in the
previous Parliament, but they chose not to. They could have proposed
large at-scale solutions, but they chose not to. They decided to rely
on the Warm Front scheme. If we had carried on with that, it would have
been 80 years before fuel poverty was eradicated. It was absolutely up
to Labour Members during their 13 years in government to make
game-changing proposals that would have anticipated dealing with fuel
poverty, carbon emissions, and the housing stock at the same scale as
the Bill intends. In the first year of our coalition Government, we are
introducing that game-changing legislation. They had 13 years, but they
failed to crack it.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000131">&#160;</a>

realise that we are all moving forward together now. We are not trying

try to build artificial divides that suggest that the Government are
not concerned about fuel poverty. We will be judged on fuel poverty on
our record and not only on our rhetoric. We are doing our best in the
Bill to tackle the twin objectives of ensuring that we meet the climate
change imperative and doing something transformational for the
fuel-poor, albeit within the context of also having to deal with the
record deficit that we
inherited.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
move on to new clause 39. The Government are of course focused on the
importance of our energy efficiency goals, but the hon. Member for
Brighton, Pavilion and my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park will
not be surprised to hear me say that the Treasury is responsible for
the allocation of public funds. A duty on the Secretary of State to
report on potential uses of central Government revenues would conflict
with the Treasury’s responsibilities. We also have 300 years of
prejudice against hypothecation to contend with. My hon. Friend raised
the excellent example of the landfill tax, and I urge him to remind the
Chancellor of the Exchequer of that when he next has the chance to talk
to him. My hon. Friend made those points well, but we cannot include
them in the Bill—not if I want to keep my job, at any
rate.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000132">&#160;</a>

Exchequer in the most recent Budget, when he spoke about the need to
bring forward incentives and other fiscal instruments that will help
drive and support the programme. On that basis, and knowing how
committed the coalition Government are to this flagship
agenda—we are going to will not only the end but the means, to

               <p class="tabbed">I
will now outline the central purpose and effect of clause 64. It amends
the Secretary of State’s existing powers and provides
flexibility over how to design a future ECO. The new powers allow the
Secretary of State to set out the basic structure of the scheme; for
example, it might be focused on those who are most in need of
assistance by requiring the companies concerned to provide support to
specific groups of people, types of property or homes in specific
areas, and by setting out what sorts of measures will be included and
how they will be scored.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
also inserts a power for the Secretary of State to appoint a body other
than Ofgem to be the administrator of the scheme. Indeed, the Secretary
of State may appoint himself to be such an administrator. The future
ECO is a key component of our overall strategy for domestic energy
efficiency. The clause builds on existing legislation and the
experience of existing schemes to enable us to create an obligation
that ensures a step change in our approach to energy
efficiency.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000135">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 301<a class="bkMark" name="Column301">&#160;</a>
                  </div>years of its operation. Fourthly, people in fuel poverty
disproportionately live in hard-to-treat homes. Fifthly, targeting
people in fuel poverty who live in hard-to-treat homes should therefore
be undertaken within the limited scope of the existing ECO. Sixthly,
targeting that raises the energy efficiency of a district even though
some homes in that district might not be in fuel poverty makes sense,
provided that the targeting relates to the likelihood of high fuel
poverty existing in that
district.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000145">&#160;</a>

we at no point have said that we should abandon our carbon emissions
reduction target. If the Minister looked back in <em>Hansard</em>, he
would see that I had said it was not mutually exclusive. However, while

million homes in the UK have solid-wall insulation. It is estimated
that 2 million of those are also households in fuel poverty. If the ECO
pot is at the £20 billion mark, that money will help those 2
million homes and no others, leaving anything between 3 million and
4 million households in fuel poverty, at current estimates.
Nothing else is on the table, and the Minister has said that ECO is the
game-changer for fuel poverty, so the ECO pot and whatever is limited
within it should at least be directed at those households experiencing
fuel poverty, and we would therefore not need to have 44,000 excess
winter deaths every year. That is where our resources should be
targeted.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000148">&#160;</a>

same types of housing across the board. She would only provide ECO
support to those on a defined, fuel-poor income basis, not on the basis
of the housing lived in. She is trying to have her cake and eat it. We
cannot define eligibility simply on the income of the household,
irrespective of the type of poverty. If we are to roll a scheme out
effectively and economically, to whole areas and street by street, we
cannot exclude next-door neighbours because they might be just above
the fuel-poor

not to unduly amend this Bill, which started in the other place. There
is a balance to be struck, and the more we amend the Bill, the more
likely it is to be delayed on its return to the upper House. We cannot
afford to amend the Bill unnecessarily and risk delaying Royal Assent
until after the summer recess. I have to be frugal with the amendments

                  </strong> I wish to speak to amendment 167, the aim of which
is to ensure transparency of the energy company obligation and its
costs, because they are passed on to the consumer. As it stands, clause
69 requires specific information from energy companies in order for the
Secretary of State to assess the effectiveness of the ECO, but it does
not require information on costs to be reported, which is the essence
of the amendment. Last week, the <em>Telegraph </em>reported, as did much
of the
press:<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000185">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Scottish
Power became the first of the six major suppliers to disclose a new
round of price rises. It told five million customers that gas and
electricity bills would go up by 19 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively.”<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000551">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
was the first of many announcements from large fuel providers. One of
the others said on Sunday that it intends to increase its prices, too,
which signals the ever-rising costs of
fuel.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With
these rising prices, it is essential that we have a guaranteed
transparency in revealing what proportion of rising prices on our gas
and electricity bills is attributable to the ECO. Without that
information on costs, it is not possible to assess exactly what costs
are being placed on customers’ bills and whether they are
achieving value for money. The Department of Energy and Climate Change
report from May 2011, “Extra help where it is needed: a new
Energy Company Obligation”, states
explicitly:<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“A
key criticism of CERT has been the relatively poor transparency over
costs and delivery. We are keen to improve this under the ECO, but this
will require better and more frequent provision of data on a wider set
of issues. We have included powers in the Energy Bill that would allow
more detailed data provision requirements to be placed on suppliers to
this end. In the meantime, we are looking closely at precisely what
sorts of information would be helpful and of interest in terms of
allowing better scrutiny of the scheme, and to what extent it might be
practical and sensible to collect it. For example, we are exploring the
scope for collecting some form of data that would allow us to better
understand the cost the scheme is incurring suppliers to deliver, and
to who and where the benefits are being
delivered.”<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000552">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Consumer
research by Which? in November found that 87% of consumers would like
to see in their bill details of those costs that are not directly
related to their energy consumption, including costs of environmental
and climate change programmes. Fifty-one per cent. said they wanted to
see a detailed
breakdown.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
the current supplier obligation, the carbon emissions reduction target,
energy companies promote energy efficiency measures and consumers
receive free or subsidised installation, and energy companies recover
that subsidy from bills; but there is no mechanism to report on those
costs, and therefore only estimates are available. However, the costs
are significant. DECC estimated in June last year that, assuming
suppliers pass all their costs on to consumers in their energy bills,
the average annual supplier cost per consumer bill will be £50
under the CERT extension, compared with £41
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Considering
those anticipated expenses, it is urgent that consumers should be able
to understand how costs are allocated on their fuel bills, particularly
with reference to the ECO. It is therefore essential that the ECO
should be transparent to customers and that its impact should be
maximised. Why is the disclosure of costs not currently included in
clause 66? Is the omission of that mandate in clause 66 an attempt to
protect the fuel

                  </strong> I will not delay the Committee by discussing
amendment 120 any further. On amendment 167, I remind the
hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree that the Government have already
committed themselves to including annual reporting requirements in the
Bill. As amended by new clause 6, the Bill requires the Secretary of
State to report each year to Parliament on what has been achieved by
our energy efficiency schemes—not just the ECO but the wider
green deal. That is in stark contrast to the total lack of transparency
in CERT, where we had about 300 million light bulbs.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are
committed to reporting on the progress and effectiveness of the ECO and
the wider green deal. I agree with the hon. Lady that
information on cost-effectiveness is an important component, and that
is why we have taken powers in the Bill to ensure that there will be
better reporting of the ECO than before.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As to timing,
amendment 167 would require the Secretary of State to publish his first
report on the ECO no later than one year after the Bill comes into
force. The Bill, all being well, is likely to be given Royal Assent
later this summer, so that would mean publishing the first report in
summer 2012, before the ECO has even begun. I am afraid there is
therefore a timing fault in the amendment as well. We do not need it,
because the Secretary of State is committed in the Bill to an annual
report to Parliament that will encompass all the
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000193">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The disclosure of costs is not specifically
included, but cost-effectiveness will be very much part of the
Secretary of State’s report to Parliament, and I am sure that
parliamentary colleagues will take the opportunity to press on
cost-effectiveness and on costs within that. I am sure that if we sat
here long enough there would be other issues that we could think of,
which should also be included, but which do not necessarily need to be
specified in the Bill to ensure that the Secretary of
State—whoever that may be in the decades to come—will
come to Parliament and report to the House.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000195">&#160;</a>

not spend a little longer on amendment 120, which deals with targeting
priority groups. I know that we have had a big discussion about that
but if the Minister finds it hard to target everything on a category
called “fuel-poor”, would he consider widening that to
low-income and vulnerable households and making them a target priority
group which the ECO should be used exclusively
for?<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000196">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Amendment 132 and new clause 31 seek to address the
role of energy performance certificates in the house-buying process. I
am sure hon. Members will agree that it is vital to encourage awareness
of energy efficiency, particularly when people are moving house, which
is often the best opportunity that many of us have to make
improvements, whether we are renting or buying.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Greater use
of EPCs would allow buyers or tenants to make a more informed choice
about the energy efficiency of the home they are considering moving
into. EPCs are the primary means of doing that, and their effective
delivery is crucial if households are to be made aware of the energy
efficiency of their homes and the measures that they could use to
improve them, which might be financed by the green deal or through the
energy company obligation or directly by home owners or social or
private landlords.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000214">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I do not
believe that a simple transposition of the recently recast EU energy
performance of buildings directive into UK law is sufficient. Such a
move would, for example, only require a new EPC if the existing one was
more than 10 years old when the house was put up for sale or rent.
Instead, I believe legislation should be enacted now, so that EPCs can
be implemented in a way that maximises their impact and effectiveness,
increases awareness of energy efficiency with prospective tenants and
home buyers, kick-starts the green deal and gives industry the
confidence to invest in energy assessment measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(1) of new clause 31 seeks to ensure that the EPC is provided to
prospective tenants and buyers rather than, as is currently the case,
made available on request. That, in effect, means that many people
never see an EPC. If enacted, the proposed new clause would mean that
when a prospective tenant or buyer inquires for the details the EPC
must be provided as part of the property’s particulars. The
measure simply brings forward the requirement in the EU energy
performance of buildings directive, which must be implemented by member
states by July 2013. I am simply suggesting that we bring that forward
a little.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(2) of new clause 31 would ensure that all materials produced to market
a property, such as a website listing, window display and brochure,
will include the asset rating of the property from the EPC—in
other words, the A to G ratings. Such a change would mean that the
energy efficiency of a property would be communicated to prospective
buyers and tenants at the earliest possible opportunity. As things
stand, the marketing materials do not have to detail the energy
efficiency of a property at that early stage. I firmly believe that
providing prospective tenants and buyers with information on energy
when they are first considering renting or buying would make the
efficiency of buildings a much greater part of their overall
consideration.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The measure
was, in fact, recommended by the Department for Communities and Local
Government consultation on EPCs, which was launched in March 2010. The
consultation argued that requiring EPC rating on adverts would ensure
that prospective tenants and purchasers of domestic and non-domestic
properties are provided with details of the EPC rating at the earliest
possible stage. It would enable prospective tenants and purchasers to
focus their search on properties above a certain band or rating, if
they wished. It would allow landlords and vendors of properties with
high levels of energy efficiency to highlight that feature in their
advertisement. It would improve awareness of energy efficiency and the
contributions that buildings can make to a decrease in carbon
emissions, and it would improve compliance with the current
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The summary
of responses to that consultation records that the proposal was
supported by 94% of the 140 respondents, which is pretty strong
support. Despite that overwhelming support for the measure, the
proposal was abandoned by the DCLG under the coalition Government, as
it was deemed to be gold-plating that would not be pursued. I argue
strongly that the proposed new clause is not about gold-plating. It is
merely about bringing forward EU regulations so that they dovetail more
neatly with the implementation of the green deal. I hope the Minister
will concede that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000219">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(3) of new clause 31 would ensure that all written particulars for
marketing a property for sale or rent would include a valid EPC. At the
moment estate agents can provide details of a property that do not give
any information on the energy efficiency of a building if the EPC has
been commissioned but not delivered, or if the property is for rent. As
I said earlier, including an EPC in a property’s written
particulars means that the energy efficiency will become a key
determinant in a decision on which home to rent or buy.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000220">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
subsection (4) of new clause 31 would ensure that EPCs remain up to
date by setting a realistic and workable validity period for the
information provided in an EPC. As the EPC is to become a key tool in
communicating energy efficiency in general and the green deal in
particular, we should ensure that it is always relevant. An EPC with a
lifespan of more than a year risks being out of date by the time it is
being considered, to the detriment both of the property owner or letter
and the property buyer or renter. Informed decisions cannot be made on
inadequate information. The current validity period of 10 years is far
too long in the new climate of energy efficiency improvements that the
Government want to create. Nevertheless—this is
important—the shorter validity period that the new clause
envisages does not mean necessarily that the EPC must be replaced each
year, which would be onerous, because a new EPC would be needed only if
a property were to go on the market and if the EPC at the time was more
than a year
old.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000221">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
remind members of the Committee that the information contained in an
EPC, particularly the all-important recommendation section, is
time-sensitive, as technologies change rapidly. It should therefore be
updated regularly. Even more rapidly changing are the costs of energy
efficiency measures and the cost of energy itself, which clearly affect
the payback period of a measure. The Government’s advice
websites or telephone numbers on the EPC might also change regularly.
The purpose of an EPC is to inform a tenant or purchaser about the
costs of running a home and of improving it, so it is absolutely
essential that such information is accurate and up to date.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A shorter
validity period means that EPCs would be genuinely useful and not just
a regulatory burden. There is a real risk that out-of-date or
irrelevant information on EPCs might act as a barrier to households
taking up the green deal, so I ask the Minister and the Committee to
support new clause 31 as well as amendment 132 that would amend the
current
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000223">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I wish to speak to new clause 38, which shares
many of the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Brighton,
Pavilion about amendment 132 and new clause 31. Its aim is to ensure
that up-to-date EPC information is available before sale or rent of a
property. At present, an EPC is not always made available in advance of
the purchase or tenancy agreement of a property and, under current
regulations, it is an offence to disclose information derived from an
EPC about a building to someone who is not connected legitimately to
the decision to purchase or rent the property. That can prevent
consumers from comparing homes of similar design in similar areas on
the basis of energy efficiency and further prevent energy performance
companies from contacting home owners to offer them deals regarding the
improvement of their homes. Under current 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 311<a class="bkMark" name="Column311">&#160;</a>
                  </div>requirements, EPCs are legally valid for 10 years, which inherently does
not ensure the accurate measure of the present state of a
property.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000224">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government envisage that moving home will be a key trigger point for
the green deal take-up, so the EPC has a crucial role to play in
encouraging energy efficiency. It signals to the potential owners or
tenants that their energy bills will be lower and it could be an
influencing factor in the decision to buy, adding value to a property.
However, as procedure currently stands, many people do not see the EPC
until they are in the property. I know from experience of buying a new
build in Liverpool last year that I did not see the EPC until I had
moved into the
property.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
new clause would inform the private rented sector tenants of matters to
avoid their renting hard-to-heat properties. Communicating energy
efficiency to prospective buyers and tenants is therefore an important
part of kick-starting the green deal, improving awareness and
encouraging energy efficiency behaviour change. If the EPC is to
provide accurate information to the tenant or home buyer about the cost
of heating the home and the potential for improving it, such
information must be up to date and relevant. Making EPCs more visible
in the marketing of properties is also important when communicating to
potential buyers or renters, and could enable tenants and purchasers to
focus their home search around the energy efficiency rating. That would
also provide an incentive to landlords and sellers to improve their
properties.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000226">&#160;</a>

recast of the energy performance of buildings directive, we will also
be introducing a requirement that details of a property’s energy
efficiency rating are included in marketing material. It would not be
appropriate, therefore, to take powers in primary legislation to
introduce that requirement when there is already scope to do so through
secondary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000245">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I said at the beginning, the system that we inherited from the previous
Government means that EPCs are currently valid for 10 years. I fully
agree with the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion that that is not fit
for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 314<a class="bkMark" name="Column314">&#160;</a>
                  </div>purpose, particularly in the context of the green deal and what we hope
will be a step change in the dynamism of the interventions,
technologies and costs associated with retrofitting homes. As a result,
we will be consulting on that issue in the autumn as part of a wider
consultation on the recast of the energy performance of buildings
directive. Obviously, I cannot prejudge the consultation, but I think
the hon. Lady will appreciate our sympathy for her wider case and the
common sense that underpins it. The consultation will be a good
opportunity properly and comprehensively to assess the likely costs and
benefits of a shorter validity period for energy performance
certificates and to gauge the level of support for changing it.
Although I do not wish to prejudge the outcome of the consultation by
amending the validity period now, I think there is momentum and a clear
sense of direction behind the agenda and on what we need to do in
the
autumn.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000246">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
will make some changes to the content and format of energy performance
certificates before the green deal is rolled out. In future, if
improvement works are funded through the green deal, there will be an
obligation to produce an updated energy performance certificate to
capture the impact of those works on the energy efficiency of the
property. One change will be to ensure that the certificate covers
information about any green deal finance that has been taken out to
improve the property, including the total amount borrowed, the
repayments and when the loan is due to
expire.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000247">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
there will not be such an obligation if a householder or a landlord
does not use green deal finance, it would be logical for them to obtain
an updated EPC that reflected the benefit of that work. That would be
likely to improve the marketability of the property and to make it more
desirable to prospective buyers or tenants, but it is not necessary to
introduce a statutory obligation to cover such
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000248">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
on balance, it is not right to remove the current defence available to
sellers or landlords, under which they are not liable for a penalty
charge for failing to obtain an energy performance certificate if they
demonstrate that the duty to do so does not apply to them.
Such a situation may occur in limited circumstances—for example,
where it can be demonstrated that an estate agent has contractually
agreed to take on that responsibility, as it would not be appropriate
for the Government to interfere with the business agreement between a
seller or a landlord and their agent. With those reassurances, I hope
that the hon. Lady and I are largely on the same page and that,
although more detail has to be decided, she will withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000249">&#160;</a>

light systems going on to warn us that we are consuming more than we
should. A shout then goes down the corridor: “What on earth are
you playing at? Who has the wi-fi and the Wii on?” I am sure

are already many different types and standards of smart meters out
there, and it is entirely laudable that many of the larger energy
companies have decided to launch their own initiatives. However, there
are also fears about that path too, particularly when the most recent
estimate indicates that something like 170,000 smart meters have
already been installed in Britain. I do not have the up-to-date
figures, but I am sure that the Minister can give them to us.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000268">&#160;</a>

which is owned by Centrica, has one of the most ambitious programmes.
It is reported to be installing up to 1,000 smart meters a day, with
the target of 2 million to be installed by the end of 2012. Before the
Government have a firm grip on the smart meter roll-out, we will see 2
million from British Gas. Also, E.ON has said that it is likely to have
1 million meters installed by March 2014, and 100,000 meters by the end
of this year. Significant numbers of smart meters will have been
installed before the official start date of the Government roll-out. As
I said, while it is great to have some technology on the market and
have some feedback from it, there are dangers with it, which
I will come
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000269">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Energy Retail Association has, commendably, already developed a code of
practice for the installation of smart meters, but it is voluntary. One
of the key concerns regarding the code is that it does not exclude
sales activity during installation, when the supplier is in
customers’ homes. Widespread problems with doorstep selling
practices have already been acknowledged, including, regrettably, from
energy companies. We want to protect consumers against the risk of some
suppliers, or individual operators for suppliers that have been told
not to, going for the hard sell when inside people’s homes. That
is why we need a mandatory code of
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000270">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is precedent to validate consumers’ concerns. The 2008 Ofgem
probe into the energy retail market found that more than 40% of
consumers switched to a worse deal as a result of high-pressure
doorstep selling. We have seen prices rising over the last winter and
currently, and one way that the Secretary of State recommends people to
avoid that is to switch suppliers. However, we know that slightly less
than half of all consumers switch to a worse deal as a result of
high-pressure doorstep selling. The study that was carried out by
Consumer Focus in May 2009 on supplier sales practice found that 34% of
consumers described their experience of doorstep sales as
“intimidating” and 68% ranked their customer experience
as the lowest score possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000271">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Ofgem
launched a spring package of measures to deal with what it terms early
movers on the roll-out. The document covers issues of interoperability,
which I will come to, remote disconnection and leaving stranded
assets—leaving behind a redundant, inoperable smart meter when a
consumer switches suppliers—and customers’ ability to
switch supplier. The document also covers marketing, as I have just
mentioned, but states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000272">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Ofgem
is not persuaded that there are urgent issues that need addressing.
Furthermore, Ofgem already has powers under existing consumer
protection legislation and through the marketing licence condition to
tackle certain forms of behaviour should it
arise.”<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000559">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Not
only do we know that elements of marketing mis-selling are going on in
a different area of energy, but it is clear from customer feedback that
Ofgem is not applying whatever powers it has to deal with them. The
document
continues:<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000273">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“In
particular, the marketing licence condition now requires suppliers to
take all reasonable steps to ensure that their marketing activity in
respect of new domestic supply contracts is conducted in a fair,
transparent, appropriate and professional manner…At this stage,
Ofgem does not propose to introduce any new requirements to deal with
sales and marketing as part of the Spring
Package.”<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000560">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am not persuaded by Ofgem’s argument, because the feedback from
consumer organisations and individual consumers shows consistently that
they are worried about doorstep and high-pressure selling. We still
need to address things such as the sale of tariffs at the point of
installation, the marketing of products and clarifying the difference
between good, sensible advice and marketing.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000274">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I now turn
away from the code of practice, but I hope that the Minister is
sympathetic and sees the need for it. He may well say that the
Government will bring one forward subsequently, but amendment 168
proposes that he commit to doing so in the Bill. I realise that I am
tying the Minister’s hands, but I think that I am tying them to
something that he intends to do anyway. In new clauses 36 and 37 we are
trying to develop a robust approach to the smart meter roll-out and to
ensure

                  </div>transparency and accountability throughout. I recognise that the

where we are heading with the roll-out of smart meters, because it is
essential that the roll-out provides real benefits to

               <p class="tabbed">I want to
voice our concerns and explain why we need a strategy and a duty to
report to Parliament. The impact assessment that DECC produced for the
roll-out estimates that the cost is likely to be about £10
billion, although I am sure that the Minister will give me an updated
figure if that has changed. The consumer benefits of about £4.6
billion that are indentified in the impact assessment are expected to
come from customers being able to use up-to-date information on their
gas and electricity consumption to reduce their energy use and to save
money on their energy bills.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The impact
assessment estimates that the roll-out will cost approximately
£10 billion, but it is worth stressing that the net benefit for
Britain plc should be positive at £15.8 billion, which includes
consumer benefits from reduced consumption. If that does not happen; if
something goes wrong with the roll-out; and if, with the best will and
the best intentions, it does not all go as planned, the business case
that this is predicated on—the cost analysis—might be
considerably weakened, and customers might end up worse off. I will
explain why. First, DECC estimates that customers will reduce their
energy consumption by on average 0.3% to 0.4% a year or an estimated
£23 a year for a dual fuel customer by 2020. It is expected that
costs will be passed on to consumers across the whole customer base, so
if costs spiral, consumers will foot the bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000277">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The benefits
of smart meters are intended to derive from reductions in energy use.
It is not just smart meters, but smart consumers. The Minister will
know, because we are at the vanguard of this, that there are other
parts of the world where they have tried versions of smart meters, but
not to the extent we are talking about rolling out right across the
country. We do not know exactly what savings there will be. While there
is good primary evidence to suggest that there is an immediate response
from consumers as they learn to understand the technology, to use it
and to reduce their demand, we have no similar longitudinal studies to
show that that is sustained and that households do not simply slip
backwards as they become used to the idea of paying a little bit more.
Yes, they have the traffic lights system but they get used to it and
they do not work quite as hard to manage their energy down and deal
with carbon reductions.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000278">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The full
effect on bills and carbon reduction is slightly open to debate,
especially after that initial period. Will the Minister explain how we
will persuade, cajole or motivate people so that they not only take the
initiative seriously at the start but continue with it long term? That
is to do with changing hearts and minds. It is not simply having a
technological device in the home. Perhaps I could point him towards one
of the developments that we used quite extensively and successfully at
DEFRA during my term as a Minister. It was known within the civil
service as the four Es model. He might not be familiar with it at DECC,
although I should be surprised because DECC grew out of the old DEFRA
family.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000279">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
model aims to combine factors of encouraging, motivating and enabling
people to make easy decisions to make the change possible. It not only
explains to people why they should do it, it makes it easy for them 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 319<a class="bkMark" name="Column319">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to do so. It involves engaging people and gaining their support for
policies and leading by example. Leading by example should also apply
to Government buildings, both central and local, agencies and so on.
That approach takes some resource to make it happen. I should like to
hear something about the resources to persuade people of the benefits
of smart meters, both in carbon reduction and price
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000280">&#160;</a>

persuade people to engage with it. The review

               <p class="hs_brev">“Customer
engagement with smart metering will have a significant impact on the
overall costs of the programme and the consumer’s opportunity to
benefit. In places such as the Netherlands and California where there
has been a consumer backlash against smart metering as a result of
health concerns and privacy issues, this has resulted in a considerable
increase in
costs.”<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000563">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
should like to hear the Minister’s thoughts on the hearts and
minds aspect, the engaging and motivating and putting the
Government’s argument out there. Then there is the impact on
low-income households. The Government’s impact assessment has
been criticised in some quarters for its lack of focus on the impacts
on low-income and vulnerable customers. I am sure that the Minister and
his team will have been working to respond to those criticisms. DECC
has stated that it will review the impact of roll-out on different
consumer groups, including vulnerable customers, in 2014. As I have
said, it is estimated that by that time 4 million meters will have been
installed, a significant number of which are likely to be in low-income
or vulnerable households. Has there been a thorough assessment of the
impact of the roll-out on low-income households? Where will the costs
lie, initially and in the long
term?<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000284">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
have had great debate in a different context about prepayment meters.
What we want to avoid is another cost being added on for low-income
households because they joined up with the Minister in his drive to get
smart meters out there, and to save energy and drive carbon down. We do
not want those households penalised for that. Perhaps the
Minister’s assessment would be
useful.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000285">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s impact assessment highlights the potential
additional costs from an accelerated early roll-out, but the early
roll-out also carries the potential of missing cost savings. I would
therefore be interested in what discussions the Minister has had to
revisit an earlier one that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion and
I engaged in with the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Bexhill
and Battle, on the issue of water metering.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000286">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At what point
will there be synchronicity, as to display functions and so on, between
smart meters that engage with energy and electricity, and those for
water? I suggest we need a strategy, even it is not immediate or in the
early stages, to deal with the issue and explain how, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 320<a class="bkMark" name="Column320">&#160;</a>
                  </div>when we have compatible technologies and display functions, they can be
included in the roll-out. The smart meters will have a lifespan and
will need to be refurbished or renewed at certain points. It seems that
there will be an opportunity to do that if our thinking caps are
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000287">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is essential that the programme, with the coherence strategy, should be
designed and monitored with a view to the impacts on energy and carbon
reduction; the benefits for and impacts on consumers—especially
those on low incomes, and vulnerable customers; the effect on fuel
poverty levels; the contribution to wider policy goals in
Government—that is where the strategy really plays in; the
resolution of interoperability issues between devices and different
energy companies and retailers; and, of course, security
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000288">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to make a few comments on interoperability and the ability to
switch. Switching has been a live issue in the past few weeks. At some
point we shall be talking about switching with meters in place,
provided in one way or another by a particular energy company. Of
course, technology could be incompatible between the meters of
different energy companies.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000289">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If customers
must change their meter to change supplier, it will not only be harder
to switch, but pretty inconvenient, and unnecessarily costly. The meter
costs would surely be passed on to the consumer somehow. In its spring
package, which I quoted earlier, Ofgem
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“In
these very early stages of rollout we recognise that the meter may need

               <p class="hs_brev">“and
full technical and commercial interoperability being introduced, smart
prepayment presents a particular challenge as these meters cannot be
used in dumb prepayment mode. Without a communications link there is no
ready way to top up the meter as there will no longer be any physical
device…In order to encourage suppliers to find a solution to
this issue and to protect consumers in the meantime we are proposing
that suppliers should not be allowed to install smart meters for use in
prepayment mode unless they could be used in prepayment mode by an
incoming
supplier.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000566">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Full
interoperability is not expected to be in place until at least 2014,
when the data communications company is operational. In the meantime,
if a customer wishes to switch supplier, their smart meter will only
operate in dumb mode after they switch. They will not be able to switch
from a smart deal to another smart deal, without having their meter
changed. I speak from experience, having made one change
myself.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000295">&#160;</a>

used in some homes if they have basements or are in certain areas.
There are also concerns that that technology might become obsolete. If
every household that could access GPRS had a smart meter with that
technology there would be issues about the capacity of the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000296">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes a good point, of
which I know the Minister is aware and concerned about. It is not just
the technology of the device, it is the platform on which it rests. We
are waiting to see that resolved. It again argues the case strongly for
a strategy and a report. If we, with the Minister’s wise team of
officials, devise this in the correct way, we will be able, on the
basis of the amendments, to hear each year how that is going.
Alternatively, we could hear each year that there have been problems,
because the Minister with his wise counsel has selected an innovative
platform that seemed to be the bee’s knees but has not quite
lived up to it. We know that happens in Government. I am not pointing
the finger at the coalition; we know that happens. However, with
something like this which is on the scale of digital roll-out, to come
back and report to Parliament on annual basis on  how that
strategy is performing is necessary as well as
desirable.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000297">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With
regard to tariff complexity, a key benefit of the smart meter programme
comes from consumers reducing their energy consumption and taking
advantage of tariffs that would reduce their consumption, particularly
at peak times. That requires smart consumers as well; I have made that
point repeatedly. It is no good just having the device there if one is
not going to use the information to one’s advantage. Smart
meters offer the potential for a new range of tariffs, for example,
multiple rate time of use tariffs, so that they can help reduce demand
at peak times and lower the cost for consumers. From a personal
perspective, that is what we are already doing in our house. The
wonderful device we have flashes when there is peak demand or when that
is anticipated. It flashes to warn against putting on the kettle or
other devices, and to wait for another
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000298">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Truly
smart meters, with their two-way communication, mean that one can save
money as well as help the Minister to manage his carbon reduction
targets. Ofgem’s response
was,<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000299">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Ofgem
is aware of the wider concerns about tariff complexity and the
importance of consumers being able to exercise effective choice. As
part of the Probe remedies the marketing licence condition was
strengthened to require suppliers to provide a written estimate of the
annual charges based on the consumer’s annual energy use. Where
suppliers are making claims about the savings to be gained from a
time-of-use tariff we would expect this to be based on the
consumer’s consumption pattern in different
periods.”<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000567">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Again,
the strategy for Parliament would be extremely useful in putting
forward the Minister’s joined-up thinking, as the years go by
with the roll-out, of how tariff systems would work, in favour of
consumers. The systems should not confuse them with complexity, but
enable them to pick simply, under the E of enabling, easy choices of
how to reduce bills and carbon take.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000300">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have
already mentioned remote disconnection. Concerns have also been raised
about load limiting, restricting the amount of electricity and gas used
by a household when low on credit. There is a worry of remote
disconnection that could arise from that. We cannot have a situation
where smart meters, rather than enable the consumer, allow
disconnection, without notice or discussion, because there is
intelligent monitoring of a household. That would be the worst sort of
use, so I look forward to hearing the Minister’s response and
whether he sees that those considerations will form
part  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 322<a class="bkMark" name="Column322">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of his strategy. We also need robust safeguards to prevent remote
disconnection or customers being switched from debit to pay as you go
without their consent.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000301">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, I will refer to Consumer Focus’s three key asks.
First, it requests new protections to safeguard customers in a smart
world as soon as possible, including measures related to smart meters,
as I have mentioned, as well as switching, sales and marketing, and
data protection—I will not go into that issue in detail, but the
Minister will know that there are worries over effective encryption and
decryption, not only within the home, but when that information leaves
the home and is communicated down two-way lines to suppliers. Consumer
Focus also asks for protections relating to remote functionality and
for vulnerable and low-income consumers.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000302">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly, it
asks for a strategy to be put in place, as we are asking now, to
deliver the consumer benefits of smart metering. That should include
governance of the scheme, its reporting, and a national engagement
plan, which I have referred to. If the Minister does not like the
previous Government’s four Es, by all means, rebrand it, but we
need a strategy that will engage and motivate people, and not simply
leave it up to them or companies to drive it forward. As part of that
second point about a strategy, Consumer Focus also suggests that the
Government should report back annually to Parliament on the costs and
benefits achieved for consumers and Britain plc, as proposed by one of
our new clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000303">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
Consumer Focus recommends that extra help must be provided for
low-income and vulnerable consumers, because all consumers should be
able to access the benefits of smart metering, especially when all
customers will pay for it. That suggestion is absolutely right, and it
is one of the points that we were seized with during the digital
roll-out. We have to focus precisely on people who might have the most
difficulty making sense and use of a new technology within their homes,
or on people who might be able to make sense of it if they had a little
support. That does not always have to be from the Government; it could
come from within their community, which fits ideally into the big
society.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000304">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
our three asks are for a code of practice, the reporting function to
Parliament, and that a strategy is put in place. I think that the
Minister would be sympathetic to all those suggestions—but
perhaps not. However, if he is sympathetic, in the cordial spirit of my
speaking to the new clauses and amendments, I hope that he will accept
them on to the face of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000305">&#160;</a>

called “Snibbo”, which he regularly advertised on his
television programme. If someone put it on their dog, it would cure its
fleas. People could lubricate their rusty bicycle chain with it. It was
a suitable spread for toast on a cold winter evening, and broken vases
could be glued back together with it. I mention that, because it
appears to be the way that smart meters have been discussed recently.
It is said that they are the all-in solution to the question of how we
use our electricity 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 323<a class="bkMark" name="Column323">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and gas most effectively, how we measure it, and how we develop the role
of smart grids, which use the relevant information. Altogether, they
will revolutionise how our energy is used, supplied, transported and
decreased, in terms of the amount that goes out. All that is true. That
is what smart meters can do. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Ogmore said, we have moved to the roll-out of smart meters and
recognise that they are not Snibbo. They are devices that can do a good
job, but have several difficulties in their operational process, and
their roll-out could end us up in a bad place. We must bear in mind the
ability of our grid to operate in the best possible way if the roll-out
is botched, if the results of the roll-out are far less optimal than
expected or if, indeed, the public decide over time that the smart
meters are not of universal benefit, but are some sort of universal
demon in their houses and should be
resisted.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000307">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
this country, big brother watch is already under way in denouncing
smart meters. Indeed, Mrs Doretta Cocks of the weekly bin collection
campaign stated recently
that,<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000311">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“First,
we had a spy in the bin and now we’re going to have a spy in the

               </p>
               <p>That
is how some of the debate on smart meters is beginning to shape up in
certain parts of our country, and which has been the case abroad. It is
imperative that smart meters are rolled-out in the most efficient,
effective and speedy way, and I am completely sold on the idea that
they will indeed revolutionise how our energy is supplied and works.
Among other things, they will make a substantial contribution to the
battle against global warming and how we can manage our electricity in
a much smarter way
overall.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000312">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is precisely the issue to which I am
alluding. Several people might not want a smart meter installed in
their home for either actual or perceived views about the security of
the data that might be supplied through the meter, and the extent to
which it would be possible remotely to undertake actions that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 324<a class="bkMark" name="Column324">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the householder might not want undertaken. In rolling-out the smart
meters, it is essential that such issues are properly addressed and
that a strategy is in place that enables them to be dealt
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000314">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
want a strategy to enable us to be sure that people are not undertaking
some disruption in order to have a dumb meter in their homes rather
than a smart meter, which perhaps would need to be ripped out and
replaced after a few years. Indeed, we can already see that the early
roll-out of smart meters by some utilities is clearly designed to
capture the market for interoperability. Whether that will prove to be
the case over time remains to be
seen.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000315">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
need to have a clear strategy about what can be delivered on consumer
benefits. We need to know how to answer all the questions relating to
the privacy, commercial confidentiality and security of smart meters,
in terms of how they perform a national function, as far as that smart
use of energy information is concerned, so that they do not end up
being only as good as mobile phone coverage. All those issues are part
and parcel of a successful roll-out of smart meters, such that they
work in the best possible way for this
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000316">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is common
sense that we should have not only a strategy to address that when
roll-out takes place, but post-legislative scrutiny of the roll-out in
action, as well as an annual report to address the degree of success or
to flash up warning signs, just like the smart meter flashes up a
warning sign when my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore should not put
his kettle on. We should have warning signs if the roll-out is being
pursued in a way that is inimical to its ultimate success.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000317">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The measures
in new clauses 36 and 37 should be an integral part of a smart meter
roll-out, so I hope that the Minister will welcome them. They would
underline and underpin what would be an ambitious and hopefully
successful programme of smart meter roll-out, which has to be carried
out in the full knowledge that it will not be without problems that
will need to be addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000318">&#160;</a>

smart meters. I hope that the process will be such a success that
people will say, “I have seen what it has done for the hon.
Member for Ogmore, and I want that in my house.” We should be
doing this because people want to buy into it. A great deal of our
effort is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 325<a class="bkMark" name="Column325">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to ensure that there is consumer satisfaction so that we get demand for
this to be rolled out more quickly, rather than resistance. We are very
much alive to that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000322">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
thought that we got a fascinating insight into the home of the shadow
Minister and life in Ogmore—the children running wild with no
idea of where they are, and more gadgets than one finds in a branch of
Currys, by the sound of it. When the lights are on and all the family
are home, they can probably be seen from Mars.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000323">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman rightly recognised that the Government have got a grip of
this issue. We have put a great deal of effort into ensuring that we
can move forward more quickly, and the way of doing that is to get
early agreement on the key stages that have to be sorted out. I am
worried that the longer we talk about intra-operability and what the
key criteria and functionality should be, the more the companies will
hold back from putting in place smart metering in the early part of the
phase.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000324">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am
encouraged that companies such as E.ON are joining Centrica by saying
that they want to see a big roll-out of the smart metering programme,
and that they have committed to putting in place a million over the
next few years. They can do that only because we are saying that they
will have clarity by early next year about what the functionality of
smart meters should be. They are aware that there is a risk that if we
set a functionality that the current smart meters do not address, they
would have to be removed at some point. We want to give the companies
clarity as soon as we can—to some extent this addresses the
issue raised by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree—on what
the functions should be, and we will then know that the companies are
there for the longer term. Consumers can then switch when they want to,
and they will not need the smart meter to be taken out or to go back
into dumb mode. That is the key to enabling the process to go forward
at the speed to which we
aspire.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000325">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman raises a critical point. We will not be doing this on
the basis of what business tells us is commercially convenient. We will
be putting in place a regime that works for the longer term and that
will, therefore, pass the test of time. We do not wish simply to rule
out things that the companies are doing—we can learn a huge
amount from the work that is happening now—but we have to get
smart meters right.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000329">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also referred to the point that we have to ensure that smart
meters are future proofed. New things will come along—for
example water metering can be tied into this—so we should not
make decisions now that will close down future
options.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000330">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
the connectivity mechanisms to which the hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree referred, we want to ensure that a wide range of technologies
is used so that all parts of the country are covered and we do not
close down options that might be more useful or better in some parts of
the country. We do not want our decisions to require unnecessary,
significant investment in the telecoms infrastructure. The decisions we
are making now will make this right for the longer
term.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000331">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
can also learn from what has been done in other places. Sweden, Ontario
and Italy have each had a full roll-out. Holland has had a sizeable
roll-out during which it has experienced significant problems. We
should learn as much from what people have got right as we do from what
they have got
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000332">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Ogmore is completely right to say that smart meters do
not bring about change themselves. People have to buy into them and be
active participants in the process if they are going to achieve these
benefits. If they simply choose to keep to their existing consumption
patterns, they will not derive the benefit of switching to better
tariffs, so the consumer engagement process will be critical. The
impact assessment states that £100 million will be
spent on the consumer engagement programme, a lot of which will come
from industry. Having seen the way in which Centrica, E.ON and some of
the smaller companies are taking this forward, it is encouraging that
they are emphasising how consumers can get the best out of their smart
metering
investment.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000333">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other thing we can look to is how technology can deal with some of the
problems. Through smart metering and the development of smart grids
over time, it will be possible for people to say, “When the
price of electricity drops below a certain variable tariff, charge up
my immersion heater; and when it goes above a certain level, switch off
my fridge and freezer.” The smart meter will be able to make
those decisions. Rather than us all wanting our hot water at the same
time and wanting our immersion heaters on when we come home from work,
we will be able to spread those things that can be spread in the most
sensible
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000334">&#160;</a>

Minister agree with reports that at times of peak demand the price of
electricity could be up to nine times higher than during off-peak
periods? That would adversely affect people with ill health who are not
able to change their lifestyle pattern. Such people need electricity at
certain times, so will the Minister please give that

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point,
which is easily resolved. There will be competition between the
tariffs, and there will be no requirement for people to go on to those
that involve that sort of penal charge at times of high demand.
Companies will offer tariffs, and people who are out all day might say
that, as none of them is back until after 6 pm, they do not mind buying
into a tariff that requires them to buy electricity 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 327<a class="bkMark" name="Column327">&#160;</a>
                  </div>at times of peak use. That would be one of a range of tariff options
that people could choose. Any problems of affordability and fuel
poverty—we will come on to them under later clauses—that
might arise from how tariffs are set can certainly be avoided. That is
undoubtedly a live concern, but it will be completely resolved by how
the tariffs are
structured.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000336">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Has the Minister given any thought to
whether any consumers will simply be unable to avail themselves of
better tariffs—for example because of continuing medical or
other needs? In the water industry, it is usual to devise social
tariffs to avoid the problem of vulnerable consumers being penalised by
their inability to switch to more attractive tariffs. Will he apply
such thinking to tariffs for smart
meters?<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000337">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> There is every reason why tariffs should work in
that way. In addition, we and Ofgem are carrying out work to improve
liquidity so that more companies offer their services and act as a
broker. The Co-op is coming in and other high street retailers are
looking to do so as well. They will be able to offer a range of tariffs
in response to such circumstances. Specialist niche providers, whom we
have seen and given extra support to this week, can also offer
specialist tariffs. All such issues can be resolved in that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000338">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
final issue about fuel poverty relates to prepayment meters, which the
hon. Member for Ogmore raised. One of the most encouraging things about
the position is that in Northern Ireland, where about half the homes
have smart meters, people on prepayment meters are on a better tariff
than those who are not. There are challenges to do with prepayment
meters, but they can bring very real
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000339">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">You
might have thought that I had already done so, Mr Crausby, but I turn
now to new clauses 36 and 37 and amendment 168, the purpose of which
was set out by the hon. Member for Ogmore. When similar proposals to
the new clauses were debated in another place, the Government explained
the approach that we have followed, including extensive consultation to
ensure that our plans for the roll-out of smart meters will achieve the
benefits sought for in the programme. We explained our view that new
requirements would be counter-productive, and we also stated our
commitment to transparency about progress and levels of
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000340">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government are clear that we are accountable for the successful
delivery of the programme, and because of that we have brought more of
the programme work that was being done by Ofgem into DECC. The benefits
of the programme are set out in the impact assessment, and there is a
difference of perhaps more than £7 billion between the costs and
the ensuing benefits. However, a provision in primary legislation to
consult on and to publish a new strategy is not required, and that
would cut across what the Government have already done. There has
sometimes been a tendency to over-consult in the development of energy
policy. At a time when we are engaging constructively with the
industry, consumer groups and trade unions, it would be a mistake to
require a further period of consultation, as that  would only
delay the time when installers can have certainty.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000341">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Yesterday,
I had an extremely useful meeting with the union Unite, which included
a discussion about smart metering. It is concerned that until there is
clarity in the interim phase, people involved in installing meters
might be laid off because companies might scale back the roll-out. If
we were to announce now that the Bill will not come into force for some
weeks and that there will then be a further period of consultation, all
we would do would be to roll back the date when people could start to
install with clarity and certainty. As a consequence, the time period
about which Unite is understandably concerned would grow, and more
people who can be actively involved in this process could lose their
jobs.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000342">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Perhaps I may suggest a way forward. I
appreciate the Minister’s concerns that we would inadvertently
put a hiatus into the process, which would be the last thing that we
would want. When we looked at the same issue with respect to avoiding a
pause in progress with the digital action plan, that was exactly what
we did. Rather than going for a complete consultation and a strategy,
we brought together the excellent work that had already been done, as
well as examining some areas that may not have been covered before.
That was pulled together into an action plan that was published and
then discussed within Parliament. May I suggest that to the Minister as
an alternative? If he were willing to do that, it could cover the
issues to which new clause 36 relates about carbon targets and the
elimination of fuel poverty, as well as wider governmental
goals.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000343">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I hope that I can persuade the hon. Gentleman that
that is not necessary. We have had an immensely lengthy consultation.
We have published one of the longest documents that I have ever seen.
We consulted on it and then gave our feedback on the documentation.
There has been positive engagement from industry, consumer groups and
the unions on how that process is being moved forward. We are aware of
all the areas in which there are remaining doubts for the consumer
groups, the unions and the industry itself. We are now working on
getting consensus on those areas. The sort of consultation that he is
talking about—even the non-consultation
consultation—cannot add to the work that has
happened.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000344">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will take the hon. Gentleman through that a bit further. In March, we
published a detailed set of decisions and plans for further work. That
represents our strategy to achieve the full range of benefits, and it
followed a full and thorough consultation with consumer groups,
industry and other parties. We published our prospectus in July last
year. To re-consult on that now, or to go further in the way for which
he is calling, would only slow down the process. Everything that we
have been trying to do is to give people early clarity about what will
be
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000345">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
plans that were published in March set out the work that is now under
way as part of the foundation stage of the programme. That includes
developing and implementing a consumer engagement strategy. The
development of a code of practice on installation will ensure that
energy suppliers provide information to consumers to enable them to
benefit from their smart meters. That code of practice will be binding.
It will be a licence condition, and it will not be something that they
can opt in or out of.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000346">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">There
will be an absolute requirement for those installing smart meters to
adhere to that code of practice, which was initially being taken
forward by industry and consumer groups. I specifically asked for the
trade unions to be involved in that process so that it would be as
comprehensive as possible. To suggest that there needs to be a separate
independent code of practice, which, by definition, suggests that the
one that has been done by consensus between the different groups is
somehow inadequate, would make it more difficult to take things
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000347">&#160;</a>

be a licence condition. There will be a need to sign up to the code of
practice as it is consolidated and finalised, and the major companies
are clear that they want to do this. If there are new suppliers and new
entrants into the market that want to cut corners, this is our way of
ensuring that they still adhere to that code of practice. We are
ensuring that the code of practice is fully robust and something that
delivers what the hon. Gentleman wants to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000349">&#160;</a>

already well through the process, and because of the word
“independent” in amendment 168, which I find particular
queer. We are getting agreement and consensus from industry, consumer
groups, trade unions and others on what the code of practice should be.
We had very useful discussions with Unite yesterday about how to
protect consumers from being told “Your wiring isn’t up
to scratch; you’ve got to spend thousands of pounds with my mate
round the corner to get it put right,” and how to protect people
from being taken advantage of at the point of sale.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000351">&#160;</a>

touch on the proposed annual report. There will be some requirement for
an annual report, but I am concerned about setting out a requirement in
the Bill as the hon. Gentleman proposes. That approach would give us no
leeway for adaption. In addition, we want the roll-out to be finished
well before the end of the decade, but new clause 37 would require the
detailed work in question to be done for time immemorial at an annual
cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds, even when the roll-out is
complete. The only way round that obligation would be to remove it
through a further Act of Parliament. The new clause would impose a
significant obligation and would provide more detail than would be
absolutely
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000356">&#160;</a>

there would therefore be a need to amend it.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000358">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We believe
that it is better that anything of this kind should be dealt with by
secondary legislation and, more importantly, should be able to evolve

flexibility would be better to enable us to take things forward in the

to a Division and perhaps to reflect on the position before Report. I
believe that we have the powers to make an annual energy statement to
Parliament that will undoubtedly deal with smart metering. There are
other occasions on which we report to the House. There are many ways in
which we can do so without binding us to a bureaucratic measure in
legislation for time

regulation Minister, I suspect that he is trying to minimise the impact
and burdens by not putting in something mandatory, for which he would
have to account to the Secretary of State and the Cabinet Office, at
least. However, the amendment would simply make real in primary
legislation what the Minister has told me that he will do anyway
through a licence condition, which will have exactly the same impact;
it will be a minimal and absolutely necessary burden on those

will withdraw the amendment, but I suggest to the Minister that we may
want to revisit the matter at some point, because I am not convinced
that we do not need that provision in the Bill. The amendment would
simply make clear what we all regard as good practice by putting in
place a code of practice. The Minister has described the current
voluntary code of practice, which is wonderful and which is coming
together. From what the Minister has told me, however, that voluntary
code of practice will in fact be mandatory, because it will be subject
to licence conditions for installing smart meters, so I struggle to see
the difference.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000364">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I turn to new
clause 36 and the smart metering strategy. I take on board what the
Minister has said about trying to avoid any delay or hiatus. I am
concerned about the points that we have raised in new clause 36; often
when we table new clauses and amendments we do not get the wording
absolutely right, but we have deliberately included issues such as
carbon targets, fuel poverty—a major source of debate in
relation to various aspects of the Bill so far—and wider
Government policy goals including healthy living, water affordability
and digital access. I accept the Minister’s argument, however,
so we will withdraw the new clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000365">&#160;</a>

meters are related to a particular property. We know the status of the
people who are living there when the meter is installed, and therefore
we might know whether they are in fuel poverty. We have no idea three
years later whether those people are still there, and without going
back to every single one of our 40 million homes to ascertain the
status of the occupants, such information simply cannot be provided
properly. We can have targets and we can work towards these things, but
we cannot with certainty measure some of those outcomes. Although we
understand the aspirations, the delivery might be fairly
complicated.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000366">&#160;</a>

strategy. I suggest that he considers drawing together the work that is
currently going on into some coherent action plan, or whatever he wants

It would simply pull everything together so that the industry, the
public, Committee members and both Houses of Parliament could see the

said that if we could not make progress, I would put people in a room
on a bank holiday Friday and we would not leave the room until they had
finished. So far, it has not been necessary to do that, because we have
made huge progress on agreeing across the industry, which has very
different perspectives, the objectives, the functionality and the
operability issues. The prospectus that we set out recently shows how
much progress has been made, and there is a great deal of industry
support for those conclusions.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000368">&#160;</a>

it is the darkened room with either a gun or a bottle of whisky. Both
are quite effective, but I find that the whisky is normally more so. I
take his reassurances, but new clause 37 causes me more difficulty. We
will withdraw our request for a code of practice—with the
proviso that I have given about the possibility of modifying the
wording—and we will withdraw our request for the Minister to
devise a strategy for the good reasons that he has
articulated—everything is in place already. On that basis it
seems straightforward that the Minister would want to bring forward a
report once a year, although not on the Floor of the House, so that we
could look at the progress of the roll-out. As he has said, in other
countries and regions there have been good examples, and also some
worrying examples of the technology and the way it has engaged, or
failed to engage, the wider public.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000369">&#160;</a>

so significant, on such a huge scale and with such a potential impact
on so many different people, including the more socially disadvantaged
who might have fears about the technology, it seems logical to have an
annual report to Parliament in one form or another. We could build in,
as I mentioned, some form of sunset clause, so that when the process
has finished in four, five or six years’ time, we can happily
say, “That is the end of it; we no longer need to monitor how
the Minister is doing.” Would the Minister be willing to take
that away this weekend and have a good look at it to see whether he
could fashion something simple that removes the detail but gives both
Houses certainty that there will be an annual report on this critical
area of Government
policy?<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000370">&#160;</a>

Those reports include a sector-by-sector account of the carbon savings
that have been achieved. Smart metering, once under way, would be an
integral part of that process. There is a legally binding obligation on
the Government to report to Parliament, so to some extent the proposal
would mean repeating an obligation. My concern is first about the
open-ended nature, and secondly about being so specific about what
would have to be reported on. The nature of these things should be that
we can respond to pressure from Members of Parliament and from Select
Committees to change and evolve the statements so that they are as
helpful and constructive as possible. The structure, the intention and
the will are there, and I

trying to persuade me. Bearing in mind the length of our debate today,
and the time, I will not press the new clause, but I ask him to try to
clarify exactly how the duty to report on smart meters will be
discharged. Perhaps, with the good will that he has already shown, he
will write to all members of the Committee to explain precisely where
that reporting function will be discharged. My strong feeling is that
we are talking about such an important area of Government
policy—it is on the scale of the digital roll-out—that it
merits a separate report to Parliament. If he is convinced that there
is another way of ensuring that, I simply ask him to write to us and

                  </strong> The aim of the amendment is to ensure that the
proposals for the cheapest tariff information are not open to abuse,
and that consumers are protected from unanticipated hikes in their
energy bills. Currently, consumers are unable to anticipate increases
in fuel costs in time to compare prices with other providers. The
amendment would ensure that consumers have a fixed rate for long enough
for them to conclude whether it is best to remain with their current
provider or seek an alternative tariff.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000383">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>The
amendment would ensure that consumers have the flexibility, time and
information to do just that. Providing the cheapest tariff information
on bills is meaningless unless the price is guaranteed for a set
period. If the price rises the following day and the price that was
stated is no longer the cheapest option, the information will be
useless to consumers. As the average time it takes to switch between
energy providers is five to six weeks, we are asking for a tariff to
remain at a set level for 12 weeks to ensure that consumers
are provided with the flexibility needed to make informed decisions
about how their energy is
supplied.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000385">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Data
from Which? reveal that two thirds of people feel that the price they
pay for energy should be guaranteed not to increase for a set period. A
Which? investigation last October found that the average household can
choose between 89 different tariffs, and that more than a fifth of
customers who switch their tariff end up paying more. As reported by
the BBC, separate research by Ofgem in 2008 found that of those who
switched their energy supplier, more than half did so in response to
contact with a salesperson. It found that many who switched following
doorstep sales ended up on a more expensive tariff, because they were
misled and found it difficult to compare bills. Ofgem also said that
customers were bamboozled by a complex system of tariffs, increasing
from 180 to more than 300. Ofgem research also reveals that 70% of
customers found the number of tariffs on offer confusing. It found that
households that failed to compare different energy rates could be
missing out on savings of up to £170 a
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000386">&#160;</a>

will be aware, the first block of units used by many energy consumers
is often significantly more costly per unit than subsequent blocks.
Energy therefore becomes cheaper per unit, the more it is used. That
seems counter-intuitive, and goes against what we want to achieve in
the Bill, which is to reduce energy use and tackle fuel poverty. The
way in which blocks of energy are priced for consumers seems to be a
back-to-front incentive and undermines those
goals.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000390">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">By
charging the highest amount for the initial units, those who are trying
the hardest to save energy—perhaps because they can least afford
it—are paying on average more per unit than excessive energy
users. The new clause would undo that position, so that when a
reasonable amount of energy for the type of property in question was
used, the cost would increase from a low initial unit cost. That
provides a more sensible incentive to keep energy use down, and those
with low and moderate energy use would see a drop in their bills. A
tariff structure of that kind is used commonly in south-east Europe and
the Flemish part of
Belgium.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000391">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Consumers
should be able to access a pricing structure for their energy that is
revenue-neutral overall for the suppliers, but which seeks to reflect
the ambition under the Bill of reducing energy use and tackling fuel
poverty. While smart metering is not required for the rising block
tariffs that I propose, it would help consumers monitor their energy
use, so that they could avoid moving into higher-consumption-priced
blocks. I accept that an issue could arise from the new clause for
those who are fuel-poor or in circumstances—perhaps
medical—in which a high level of thermal comfort becomes a
necessity, and clearly we do not want to penalise those groups.
However, I hope that the green deal will solve that issue by improving
the insulation of homes, thereby enabling a system of rising block
tariffs that is equitable for all. A system of dispensation might need
to be introduced for low-income households with necessarily high energy
needs, but I hope that the Minister will consider the new clause, and I
look forward to his
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000392">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I shall deal with first with amendment
166. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree, made the good point that
it would not help consumers if information on their tariff went out of
date quickly. Her amendment would require the Government to fix the
length of time for which the supplier’s lowest tariff was
available to a particular 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 336<a class="bkMark" name="Column336">&#160;</a>
                  </div>customer at 12 weeks after information about that tariff had been
provided to the consumer on their bill. I recognise that the intention
of the amendment is to allow customers sufficient time to consider the
information on their bills and to act on it before the supplier can
move the goalposts and change the price, and to ensure that consumers
are confident in the information that they are given by their
supplier.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000393">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Bill will allow the Government to require suppliers to inform customers
about their lowest tariff and how to switch to it. It is a feature of
our competitive market that energy suppliers can react to changes in
the market. The amendment would effectively stop suppliers making
changes to the price of a tariff in respect of a particular customer
for 12 weeks, which is not the intention of the Bill. Such a
requirement would limit the ability of suppliers to react to changes in
the market, and we remain of the view that that would lead to a more
conservative pricing strategy overall, and that it risks higher prices
for customers across the
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000394">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment could also lead to discrimination between customers of a
particular supplier. Those consumers already on the tariff in question
will be given 30 days’ advance notice of a price increase. That
is a change that has been made since the Government came to power. It
used to be the case that customers could be advised retrospectively of
a change, and we believed that that was completely unacceptable.
Customers who had been offered a tariff by their supplier would have
that rate guaranteed for 12 weeks, which might give them eight weeks
extra at the lower rate if prices increased. That would be evident
discrimination between new customers and longer-standing
ones.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000395">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I agree with
the objective of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree, which is to ensure that the information that consumers
receive is clear and credible, and that they fully understand cost
implications when they decide to change tariffs. I remind her, however,
that the information on the bill is a prompt; customers must contact
their suppliers to switch, at which time they can discuss their energy
needs and receive a personalised quote. Any changes to existing offers,
or new offers, must be made clear at that point. In addition, suppliers
are required to give 30 days’ notice of a price increase, so if
customers call to inquire about a tariff that is shortly to change,
suppliers will be obliged to make that clear. The customer will
therefore be aware of the increase in advance, and can decide whether
to go ahead with a switch.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000396">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The issue has
required careful consideration, and having reflected further on it
since it was raised in the other place, we remain of the view that the
proposal would result in discrimination between different types of
customer. Inevitably, the hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree—and all of us—would soon start to receive
complaints from constituents, who would say, “I have been with
this company for years and I was given only 30 days’ notice of a
price change, whereas my next-door neighbours, who joined it two days
before the price increase, enjoyed their tariff for another eight
weeks.” It would be hard to defend that relationship, because
there would be no equity in it. I hope, therefore, that on reflection,
the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000397">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When I took
on this brief in opposition, I had tremendous sympathy with the issues
dealt with in new clause 30. The system seemed illogical on the grounds

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 337<a class="bkMark" name="Column337">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of energy conservation and affordability. However, I was persuaded, even
before the election, that the sort of change that my hon. Friend the
Member for Norwich South outlined would not achieve what we are trying
to do. I think we all agree that we want to encourage households to
reduce their energy consumption, and we are mindful of the consequences
of energy bills on people who are least able to pay them.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000398">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
new clause would require the Government to mandate energy companies to
use the inverted, or rising block, tariffs system. Under the present
arrangements, suppliers are free to respond to consumer demand in their
pricing systems. Many tariffs that are currently on offer charge the
first unit of electricity and gas at a higher rate, and subsequent
units at lower ones. Others take a time-of-use approach and charge less
at certain periods—at night, for example—or offer a
flat-rate tariff with a standing charge to cover fixed costs. Some
suppliers are considering the potential for further alternative pricing
structures, including other time-of-use and rising block
tariffs.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000399">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
we were to mandate a rising block tariff, as the amendment suggests, we
would, effectively, be putting price controls on suppliers. Competition
would be affected, to the detriment of consumers, who would be denied
the wide range of tariffs and opportunities that might appeal to them.
Incentives to compete for low-consumption customers would be reduced,
and services to such customers might suffer. The incentives for
suppliers to sell more gas and electricity would be
greater.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000400">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Most
importantly, I remain concerned about the social impacts of a rising
block tariff model. We want customers to reduce their consumption, but
we do not want even more of the poorest consumers to cut their energy
use to levels that put their health at risk. Evidence suggests that, on
average, fuel-poor households have higher energy requirements than
non-fuel-poor households. Therefore, many fuel-poor customers who spend
more time at home, such as the elderly, those with disabilities, or
those with large families, might receive higher fuel bills as a result
of such a policy, which might actually increase fuel
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000401">&#160;</a>

extreme interest in the matter. It strikes me as crackers to have a
system that allows people to be charged more for their first units. Our
whole aim is surely to reduce the use of energy and thereby minimise
the energy gap, with which we are threatened at every turn. Surely, the
green deal will help precisely those fuel-poor households. As a
Government, we should take a flier on this and try to persuade energy
companies to act in the interests of keeping energy use down and
ensuring that the fuel-poor households save
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000402">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The green deal
will help all households in time—not just the
fuel-poor—and all households should be able to consume less
energy. It will remain the case, however, that people who have to stay
at home because of a disability or long-term illness or large families
who are at home more will consume more electricity and gas than people
who are out all day. The household with two working parents, where the
children have left home, would benefit significantly from the proposal,
but the household that the hon. Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West
referred to earlier, where they already 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 338<a class="bkMark" name="Column338">&#160;</a>
                  </div>have to use more energy in the winter months and at other times of the
year, would be penalised—relative to other parts of the
country—because it is simply colder there. The hon. Member for
Hyndburn mentioned earlier that he was worried about some households in
his constituency, because they have to be at home due to general
poverty issues, age and disability. They would also be penalised under
the
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000403">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
can understand why a range of tariffs is desirable, so that those who
can be encouraged actually opt in, but to mandate it would end up
hurting most the people who we all believe can least afford to be hurt.
We have seen campaigns about other Bills going through Parliament from
organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Relief on behalf of those who
are at home with terminal illnesses and who inevitably need to keep
warm, because they cannot move so much. Again, unless one finds a way
of compensating those households in particular, which is difficult,
they will be hit by a policy that mandates it. For all the reasons
about energy conservation and logic, I understand why it is desirable
that people should move towards that sort of tariff, but mandating it
has an unintended consequence that would end up hurting people who
should not be negatively affected by the proposals. I hope, therefore,
that my hon. Friend the Member for Wells will be prepared to
reconsider the new
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000404">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
final point is that part of the way of dealing with the issue is to get
new entrants into the market, to get the Co-op coming in as an energy
supplier and to get others in that will shop around for the best deal
and offer different tariffs. Getting greater liquidity into the sector
must be one of our priorities, so that the consumer has more choice. I
urge the hon. Lady to decide that mandating it is not the best way of
taking the proposal forward for all
households.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000405">&#160;</a>

However, I want to draw the Committee’s attention to the need
also to ensure that the energy being used has as small an impact on the
environment as possible. My proposed new clause 18 addresses the
emissions from large-scale power plants, seeking to limit their
emissions to no more than 300 grams of CO<p class="Sub">2 </p>per kWh, but we

amendments address the other end of the market, seeking to promote the
use of small-scale power generation through distributed energy, which
is sometimes also known as decentralised energy. In 2009, energy supply
was responsible for just over a third of the UK’s carbon
emissions, making it the UK’s single greatest contributor to
climate change. At present, up to 6% of energy used to generate
electricity from centrally burnt fossil fuels is wasted, with only 40%
or so actually making it to the transmission network. If that were not
bad enough, roughly a further 7% of that energy that does reach the
grid is lost during transmission. In total, the energy wasted at the
power station and on the wires is equal to the entire water and space
heating demands of all the buildings in the UK—industrial,
commercial,

efforts that we make to reduce the consumption of energy, important as
they are, are severely compromised if we do not also revolutionise the
way that we generate the energy that we need. Distributed energy
systems produce power close to or at the point of use, significantly
cutting inefficiencies. Instead of being passive consumers of energy,
buildings can become constituent parts of local energy networks,
through, for example, the installation of small and medium-sized
renewable or local combined heat and power plants. A further advantage
is that locally based energy generation can empower communities to take

energy has already proven that it can be a vehicle for tackling fuel
poverty, with, for example, substantial interest in the feed-in tariff
in the social housing sector, where schemes have eliminated or
substantially reduced energy bills for social housing residents. As

community-owned renewable energy schemes in which local people benefit

hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion a moment ago mentioned the
proportion of energy that comes from home-grown sources. Will the
Minister confirm that such energy buffers the consumer from price
increases? My particular interest is that only renewable energy can do
that, because we will no longer be held hostage by power sources that
come from outside. Even the most ardent advocate of nuclear power would
admit that it does nothing to increase our energy security. Nuclear
energy is reliant on uranium, which is mined abroad. I am not sure that
Kazakhstan is the most secure of sources, and neither are Niger and
Russia, which has caused chaos in the gas market. The price of fuel, if
not from sources that are home-grown, is still susceptible to
international instability, which will affect us. Fuel poverty affects
everything. If we can sort out the price, that will be a
help.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000444">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
fully recognise the important role that distributed energy has to play
in the United Kingdom in meeting our objectives for energy and climate
change, and the benefits that it brings in increasing competition
throughout the energy market and helping communities to maximise
opportunities that exist within their local areas. We also know that,
as demand increases for electrification of heat and transport, local
generation and local heat networks can help to reduce the cost of
transmission system reinforcement. Distributor generation can also play
a role in short-term demand side response. I want to reassure the hon.
Lady and my hon. Friends the Members for Richmond Park and for Wells
that such matters will be an integral part of our policy going forward.
We want more local distributed energy within the
mix.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000447">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government are committed to ensuring that appropriate support exists at
all scales of the energy market. The feed-in tariffs for renewably
generated electricity, in particular, will provide support for the
small-scale distribution market. One of the clear 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 343<a class="bkMark" name="Column343">&#160;</a>
                  </div>commitments that directly answers the question about the coalition is to
support community-owned renewable projects. We have launched the
community energy online web portal, which is aimed at providing advice
to communities and local authorities looking to install energy projects
at such a
scale.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000448">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have also lifted the bar on local authorities generating their own
electricity, and many of them will be keen to do so in a way that
generates electricity locally for the local community and will of its
nature be distributed energy. We are soon to publish a full
microgeneration strategy and, within the market reform process, the
capacity mechanism will be able to bring forward some technologies and
give support to them. Under clause 78(2)(2D), the assessment
of capacity required must take into account a number of issues,
including the “generation of electricity”. I am happy to
place it clearly on the record that, in that context, it includes
distributed generation, provided there is a practical way in which to
assess it. That is not a cop-out; it is simply to say that some of the
distributed generation installations might be of a scale that means
they do not have to register, thus we are not necessarily aware of
them. Moreover, they do not need planning consent, so the local council
is not aware of them. However, where we are aware of them, they will be
incorporated within the procedure. The structure of the process takes
absolute account of distributed
generation.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000449">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion will appreciate that one of the
benefits of distributed generation is the range and scale of
technologies that it covers. It also presents a challenge in terms of
the amount and quality of information that is available. I have
therefore asked my officials to work with Ofgem to agree on how best to
take account of distributed generation in our assessment of the
security of supply. My hon. Friend the Member for Wells made a valid
point about renewables, and we have to be much more on the front foot
about explaining the role that renewables have in the security of
supply.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000450">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
do not know what the price of gas will be in the early part of next
year, but I know what the price of wind will be for the rest of my
life. I know what the price of the tide will be, and that there is a
significant element in how we provide long-term protection for
consumers if we know that there is a fixed installation cost and that
we are using a free resource. The contribution that they make to the
security of supply is very significant.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000451">&#160;</a>

an advantage in using domestic resources. Increasingly, gas will be
imported, as will oil. More than half of our coal is imported. Uranium
has to be, although one of the largest producers of uranium is
Australia, which is a very benign nation and a good trading partner for
us, in that respect. Taking advantage of what I call our home-blown,
rather than home-grown, energy resources should be part of our energy

                  </strong> The OECD has produced a report saying that it is
very comfortable about the availability of uranium. I understand that
we are straying away from distributed generation by talking about the
global sources of uranium, but there are clearly costs and risks that
the generators would have to take into account. If those make it
unaffordable, generators would find that they cannot get the return
that they sought on their investment. I would say, however, that I see
this as part of a mixed-balance energy approach: we want to take
advantage of the renewable resource that exists; we want clean coal
through carbon capture; I believe that we want new nuclear within that
mix; and we need to find out what the long-term role is for gas in
terms of security, which it can also bring. Balance in energy matters
is a critical part of the policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000454">&#160;</a>

want to address the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Wells
makes regularly. I think that she has asked me more parliamentary
questions on this matter than all the Members of Parliament have put
together, on every other issue, so I congratulate her for her tenacity.
We are continuing to work on the undergrounding costs, although more
work needs to be done. I am absolutely committed, however, to ensuring
that we have a proper handle on the costs of undergrounding, compared
with overgrounding, and that we look more carefully at where it is
appropriate to underground, so that we can see where sensitive areas
are and find ways to address that. That is not a conclusion in relation
to policy, but it is a sense of direction that I hope reassures
her.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000455">&#160;</a>

reassure me even more would be a bit more clarity about whether there
will be a strategy for distributed energy. I can see that it could form
part of the microgeneration strategy mentioned by the Minister, and I
would be interested to know what the time scale for that is—I
apologise, because I do not know when it is due. To me, however, it
still seems that there is a need for something that sets out more of a
pathway for how distributed energy will be operationalised. I

certainly before the summer recess? We also fully understand that
microgeneration is not the end of the story. It is a very exciting part
of decentralised energy, and it is the most consumer-facing part of the
story, so it gets the most airplay. We think that there is huge
potential to drive this much more widely, but in the electricity market
reform process we will look at how decentralised energy systems can
play a much greater role—in particular, low-carbon and renewable
DE. We look to the example of economies such as Denmark and the
Netherlands, where industrial combined heat and power—for
example, gas-fired as a transitional fuel—meets a big chunk of
energy supply and energy security needs. We are a long way from being

something that would bring those things together and look at the
overall potential, whether that is through the EMR, the microgeneration
strategy or another measure. I would like an overall strategy that
tells us how we will get from where we are now to a much greater
investment in decentralised energy. I appreciate that, at the moment,
it is in different parts of the overall Department of Energy and

hope that the Minister will recognise that at a time when we depend on
imports for 60% of our energy, it is terribly important to ensure that
we have some framework so that developers and communities know where

absolutely clear indication that it will not be done by what I suppose
would be called small-l liberals who knit yoghurt, or whatever it is
that we do. It is a realistic prospect to reduce the quantity of energy
that comes from outside. It is not fringe activity; it is central to

                  </strong> I am grateful to the shadow Minister for that
question, which goes to the nub of where we are on the issue. The
United Kingdom does not have enough gas storage at the moment. As we
move increasingly to becoming net importers of gas in
particular—60% of our gas could be imported by the end of the
decade—we must have a variety of ways to ensure that the
consumer has security.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000474">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
investment secured under the previous Government in the liquefied
natural gas terminals in south Wales and the Thames, and the Langeled
pipeline to Norway, have dramatically enhanced our energy security. We
had the coldest December for about 100 years, but we came through it
without pressure on consumers. It might have been more challenging if
we had followed it with a very cold January and February, but when we
are becoming more reliant on imports, energy security will be an
important part of the process.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000475">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, we
still want the market to deliver a solution. Storage is one part of
that solution rather than the only part. I hope that our approach is
creating a framework that will put much greater financial penalties on

invest in whatever technology they think is most appropriate: gas
storage, long-term contracts either through shipments or pipelines, or
interruptible contracts with their customers, which would ensure that
they found a way to deliver on their commitments. I hope that that will
deliver more investment in gas storage. Rather than being too
prescriptive, it is right that we try to use a market mechanism to give
the industry the ability to react as it sees best to that process. I
hope that reassures the hon.

part of the Bill, dealing with access to upstream petroleum

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments 53
and 55 to 60 are intended to clarify the scope of the chapter and
refine it to make the powers provided more effective, both for the
Secretary of State and industry. Amendments 53, 59 and 60 clarify that
the provisions of this chapter are to apply to gas processing
facilities only where they are upstream. It was pointed out to us by a
company planning to build a liquefied petroleum gas import terminal
that the previous definition of gas processing facility was
sufficiently broad that it would catch its proposed facility and it
would be possible in principle for someone to apply to the Secretary of
State to determine access terms for that terminal. That is not our
intention as this chapter has been framed specifically for the upstream
petroleum sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000482">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
53, 59 and 60 therefore amend the definitions in this chapter so that
it applies only to upstream gas processing facilities. The main feature
of these amendments is that gas processing facilities now fall within
the scope of this chapter only insofar as they are used for processing
gas conveyed by pipelines from a production project. That is to say,
they are not in scope with respect to gas delivered or arriving by
tanker.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000483">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 55
extends the provision for access notices to provide for compensation
where the access may reduce the value of the composite liquids passing
through the system. Subsection (10) already provides for compensation
where the access sought adversely affects the capacity available to
other users of the system. This new subsection allows additionally for
compensation in cases where the adverse effect in not on capacity, but
on the quality or value of the commingled petroleum liquids.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000484">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">We also wanted
to make sure that the provision in subsection (12)(b), for access
notices to be copied to all users of the system in question, took
account of the commercial interests of the persons most affected by
such notices, namely the owners of the facilities and those seeking
access to them. We think it is right that other users of the system
should be made aware of provisions in the notices that might affect
their interests, particularly any provision for compensation under
subsection (9). But the owners, or the applicants, might reasonably
regard publication of other terms of the notices as being potentially
damaging to their interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000485">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 56
therefore provides for the Secretary of State to hear any
representations from the owners and applicants before copying the
notice more widely; and if necessary, to redact the notices
appropriately. By virtue of amendments 57 and 58, we have made similar
provision in respect of modification notices issued under clause 82.
Finally, amendments 61 and 62 remove carbon dioxide pipelines from the
scope of this chapter: third-party access to these pipelines will be
addressed through separate regulations implementing the third-party
access requirements of the carbon capture and storage directive to be
laid before Parliament in the near future. These are detailed technical
amendments, and I hope that that has clarified their purpose to the
Committee. I hope that they will be

                  </strong> The group is fairly straightforward and brief. New
clause 11 will make a number of amendments to section 12 of the Gas Act
1995, which at present covers third-party access both upstream and
downstream. We think that it will be desirable to have different
regimes governing access to upstream and downstream gas facilities, and
we propose to do so by amending section 12 so that the provision will
apply only to downstream facilities, leaving the new regime set out in
clauses 80 to 89 and schedule 2 to cover upstream petroleum
infrastructure.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000492">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
new clause will effect the necessary changes to section 12 so that the
section applies only to downstream gas processing facilities. The new
clause will also amend a number of relevant definitions and remove the
Secretary of State from any involvement in access applications to those
facilities. They will instead be considered by the Gas and Electricity
Markets Authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000493">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The new
clause will also impose new requirements on owners of such facilities

                  </div>and to take into account any representations made before publishing
final versions. They reflect a new consultation requirement in the new
European Union gas directive, which forms part of the EU third energy
package of legislation. The new clause will also change the enforcement
mechanism for a failure to comply with the requirements of section 12
to align it with other requirements that will stem from the EU third
energy package. It is convenient to effect the changes here because the
introduction of the new upstream regime will in any case require
amendments to section 12. The rest of the transposition of the EU gas
directive will be effected by regulations that will be laid before
Parliament
shortly.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000494">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other amendments in the group are related to the new clause. Amendment
54 will amend chapter 3 for consistency with the new scope of section
12. Amendment 73 will remove the present provision in
schedule 2 relating to section 12, which will be overtaken by the new
provision set out in new clause 11. Amendment 76 will amend the long

                  </strong> I want to say a few words about the clause and the
other clauses in the rest of the chapter. I am concerned that what they
are driving at is a facilitation of the exploitation of the last
hardest-to-reach oilfields in UK waters and of those with smaller, more
marginal, reserves, neither of which are likely to be profitable
without assistance. That assistance is found in the provisions that
make it easier for third parties to access upstream oil and gas
infrastructure such as pipelines to
shore.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000503">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Further,
exploitation of UK oil will obviously delay the point at which we can
wean ourselves off unsustainable fuel. That in turn will reduce the
pressure to maximise the potential of the energy efficiency and
renewable energy industries, which, as we have been hearing throughout
the Committee sittings, represent significant economic, environmental
and social opportunities for the UK. Furthermore, hard-to-reach
oilfields are by definition riskier propositions. If they required only
straightforward operations, the areas that the clauses seek to open up
would already have been exploited.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000504">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
exploitation of such areas is seen as a niche market. As such, the
harder-to-reach fields are often exploited by niche operators. I
believe there is a significant risk attached to making it easier for
new, typically smaller companies to enter that particular market. I am
also concerned about the setting up of legally insulated small
subsidiaries of larger oil companies operating in this area. I
understand that, despite operating in riskier circumstances, niche or
subsidiary oil and gas companies often do not have the same level of
liability cover as larger operators.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000505">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As the
Deepwater Horizon and Macondo well disaster showed, when a mistake is
made in such a hostile environment, it can be catastrophic and
extremely difficult to correct. Some 200 million barrels of oil poured
into the Gulf of Mexico. Billions of pounds have already been paid out
in compensation and clean-up costs, and that is to say nothing of the
impact on BP’s share price. It is unlikely that a smaller
company or a legally insulated subsidiary of a larger company will be
able to survive such a financial battering and it will simply fold,
even with the Government and the taxpayer as insurers of last resort to
foot the
bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000506">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
addition to having fewer financial resources to respond to disaster,
smaller companies may also lack the practical resources to react with
the necessary speed. I oppose the clause because I want to see less oil
drilling, not more, and because I want to ensure that the oil rig is
extracted as safely as possible. The clause and the whole chapter
generally move us in the wrong direction on both
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000507">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, but I think she
has misunderstood the nature of the clause. It is a relatively
straightforward change to the way that we try to resolve disputes on
infrastructure matters in the North sea. She talked about the need to
wean ourselves off oil and gas. We agree with that, but at the moment
we are dependent on oil and gas for approximately two thirds of our
energy today. The reality is that for the foreseeable future, however
much we try to change that—it will be a gradual change—we
will either have to use our own resources or import them at a cost of
billions of pounds to the British economy, but we will still be using
virtually the same amount every year. We are going to use other
measures to lead us in the direction of a low-carbon economy. It is not
realistic to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 351<a class="bkMark" name="Column351">&#160;</a>
                  </div>suggest that we can do that at an incredible speed and will have come
off oil and gas completely in the next few years. That is not going to
happen and we therefore have a national interest in making sure that we
continue to get the benefit of our own natural
resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000508">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady said that the hard-to-reach fields are by definition riskier.
That is not the case. Some of the riskiness, danger and difficulty
depend more on things such as the temperature or pressure of the oil.
Those may be in shallower rather than deeper waters. We are
nevertheless seeing a change in the way in which the North sea is
operated. I welcome the fact that we are seeing some smaller companies
moving in. The huge international oil corporations are perhaps less
interested in fields of the scale that we now find in the North sea and
UK continental shelf and are looking
elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000509">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is a real role for specialist niche operators that are still nominally
multi-billion pound companies that can take part in the process. The
issue at stake in the clause is that where they want to use access that
is already in place—not their own infrastructure, but somebody
else’s—it can sometimes be difficult to get agreement.
Sometimes it is straightforward. Sometimes they cannot agree on the
funding formula and the long-term arrangements and liability issues. At
the moment, the legislation enables them to come to the Secretary of
State for a determination, but that is a rarely used procedure. Only
one application has been made. We are aware that companies are
sometimes worried about approaching the Secretary of State for a
determination, because of the importance of that trading relationship
to them. They feel that if they come to us, it may be adverse to our
long-term relationship. The simple change that we are making here gives
the Secretary of State the power, where he believes there is a
blockage, to intervene and say, “This is how I believe that
access to the infrastructure should be
covered”.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000510">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
change makes no difference to the long-term liability cover: there have
to be assurances that those companies are in a position to decommission
or reach an agreement on how the decommissioning should be funded, and
the liabilities issues remain intact. It makes a very small change
indeed to the process, in which the Secretary of State would now be
able to instigate finding a solution rather than having to be asked to
do so. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Lady will be prepared to
accept that the clause should stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000511">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful that the Minister acknowledges that
we need to wean ourselves off fossil fuels, but the word that we
disagree about is “gradually”. Climate change cannot wait
for us to gradually wean ourselves off fossil fuels. He said that it is
not realistic to go faster, but I think it is not realistic to believe
that the climate will wait until we finally garner the political will
to deal with this differently. I strongly argue that were the political
will there, we could certainly wean ourselves off fossil fuels much
more quickly and go much more rigorously towards the alternative, be
that distributed energy, renewable energy or energy efficiency. It is
clear that I will not persuade him and he will not persuade
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000512">&#160;</a>

my mind, the clause and the rest of the chapter are essentially about
facilitating access to the remaining oil reserves, and that is
incredibly dangerous. The scientists 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 352<a class="bkMark" name="Column352">&#160;</a>
                  </div>are already telling us that we are very unlikely to be able to stay
beneath the 2° so-called threshold, given the trajectories that
we are all on. We also hear from scientists that the 2°
threshold is not the distinction between acceptable climate change on
one hand and dangerous climate change on the other, but between
dangerous climate change and very dangerous climate change. I regret
that I need to detain the Committee, because I am not sure that I will
get much support from other Opposition Members, but to make my point I
want to object to the clause and press it to a Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000513">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am pleased that we have been able to make so
much progress. These are technical amendments, which deal with the
Secretary of State’s powers to amend transmission and
interconnector licences. Clause 95 empowers the Secretary of
State to amend gas and electricity licences in order to put in place a
cost recovery mechanism should we ever need to use energy supply
company administration. Government amendments 63, 64 and 65 will ensure
that if interconnector licences are modified under this clause, the
modifications form part of the standard conditions of those licences,
which are provided for in section 146 of the Energy Act 2004.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000534">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Government
new clause 17 ensures that if the standard conditions of transmission
licences are modified under clause 95, or under any of the other powers
to modify transmission licences contained in the Energy Acts of 2008 or
2010, those modifications are reflected in section 137 of the Energy
Act 2004, which governs standard conditions of transmission licences.
This amendment will, among other things, cover modifications to
transmission licences made as a result of clause 71 of the Bill, which
enables the Secretary of State to modify those licences for the
purposes of the smart meter roll-out. Government amendment 80 adjusts
the long title of the Bill to reflect this new
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11061638000535">&#160;</a>
