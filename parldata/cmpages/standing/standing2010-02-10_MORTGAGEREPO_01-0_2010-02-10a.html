Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): It is a great
pleasure to be in Committee for the first time under your chairmanship,
Dr. McCrea, especially as the Bill applies only to England and Wales,
rather than to your part of the
country.</div><a name="10021057000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank all hon. Members for attending the proceedings this morning and
for their support. I hope that we can deal fairly quickly with the
Bill, especially given that there are no amendments. If anything is not
clear, I shall try to explain it as we go.</div>
<a name="10021057000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mr.
Malik), said that this issue is a no-brainer and that there is a
problem out there that the Bill is intended to fix. I hope that we can
all agree to allow it to proceed back to the House and then down to the
House of Lords. Everyone realises that we are
time-constrained.</div><a name="10021057000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the various external bodies that have sponsored the Bill, such as
the housing advice organisations. We have also met several trade bodies
representing both the lender and the borrower. I thank hon. Members on
both sides of the House for supporting the Bill. There was cross-party
support during our Second Reading debate, and I am optimistic and
confident that we shall continue in a similar vein today. I am sure
that members of the Committee who were not present on Second Reading
will have had a chance to read the report of those proceedings, which I
sent to them. I do not intend to repeat what I said at that time, but I
shall give a brief summary of the issues covered by the
Bill.</div><a name="10021057000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Due
to a gap in legal protection, unauthorised tenants of repossessed
landlords can suffer distressing short-notice evictions. The issue is
about a legal anomaly that we need to fix. When much of the legislation
on mortgages was brought on to the statute book in the 1970s, the
market for rented properties was different from how it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>today. For example, the term &#147;buy to let&#148; was almost never
used in the 1970s, but it was part of common parlance at the turn of
this century.</div>
<a name="10021057000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
given how the economic situation was then and how it is now, there is
some commonality with the mid-1970s; both situations led to some
interesting developments in the tenanted property market. In the 1970s,
the private rented sector was heavily regulated. That was followed by a
period of deregulation in the 1980s, which, in part, has led to the
current problems.</div>
<a name="10021057000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
buy-to-let landlords are professionals who take their responsibilities
seriously; I emphasise that the Bill is not aimed at responsible
buy-to-let landlords. Indeed, it will not affect them. However, the
rising property market in the 1990s led to landlords who were keen to
make financial gain with minimal input. In those instances, individuals
failed to gain consent from their lender to let before renting out a
property.</div>
<a name="10021057000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conversely,
the stagnation in the current property and employment market has led to
a rise in reluctant landlords&#151;people who, for one reason or
another, have rented out property to a tenant without permission from
the lender, which makes the tenant unauthorised. They are people who,
for example, have moved to another town to work. They have tried to
sell their own property in the town they have moved from, but have
failed to do so because of the economic climate. They have been
servicing two mortgages, so they have put a tenant into the first
property and that tenant has become unauthorised. Those tenants are
covered by the Bill, too.</div>
<a name="10021057000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other reasons why people become reluctant landlords. Perhaps a relative
has died and there is still a mortgage on the property in which they
lived. If a tenant is put into that property, that tenant will become
unauthorised if the permission of the lender has not been
sought.</div><a name="10021057000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Typical
owner-occupier mortgages do not allow a property to be rented out. If a
landlord has not received consent to let from the lender and
subsequently falls into arrears, and the lender commences possession
action, the tenant is unauthorised by the lender as the landlord has
not received the relevant permission. That means that the tenant has no
right to request a delay of the lender, although they could, and that
the lender has no obligation to give them one, although they
might.</div>
<a name="10021057000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any
possession case, the tenant can turn up in court, but under current
legislation the judge has no discretion to take any notice of the
tenant or their circumstances. The result for any tenant is that they
can often suffer extremely short-notice eviction, involving only a
matter of days, with no time whatever to find alternative
accommodation.</div><a name="10021057000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the progress of the Bill, I have had correspondence from, and talked on
radio programmes with, people who have found themselves in very
difficult circumstances. Landlords have fled to Spain and left the
tenant to cope for themselves. In other words, the landlord has
abandoned financial responsibility. In another case, a gentleman who
appeared with me on &#147;You and Yours&#148; came home to find the
bailiffs changing the locks, and he asked what would happen to his
furniture. The bailiffs were intending to put it on the pavement as
they left the property, because he had not been in when they had
arrived. Fortunately, he had come home and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>was able to deal with the situation. Some people have come back from
holiday and found that they cannot enter their property because, while
they have been away, court proceedings have gone on without their
knowledge. They have found themselves locked out of their property
after a long journey from a long-haul destination.</div>
<a name="10021057000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Everyone on
the Committee believes that what happens in such cases is wrong,
whatever their political opinions. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure
that tenants of landlords who are repossessed by their lenders do not
suffer short-notice eviction. The objective is to give the tenant the
right to request that the possession be delayed by up to two months;
the period does not have to be a complete two months, but up to two
months, to give the tenant time to find alternative accommodation. The
Bill will not prevent the lender&#146;s right to possession, but
simply delay it for a short period. I stress that it applies only in
the case of unauthorised
tenants.</div><a name="10021057000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us have a quick look at what the Bill contains. It will give tenants
the right to be heard at possession hearings, which they are not
allowed to take part in at the moment. It will give courts and judges
authority to take tenants&#146; needs into account, and it will give
powers to postpone possession by up to two months so that the tenant
can find an alternative home.</div>
<a name="10021057000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will
also require lenders to serve notice to a tenant or occupier of their
intention to enforce a possession order. It will cover tenants of
landlords in respect of whom the courts have previously made a
suspended possession order. The new notice will apply to all properties
subject to an outright possession order or when the suspended
possession order is breached. In addition, the Bill will enable tenants
to apply to delay the enforcement. Lenders will be able to dispute the
claim for tenancy and apply for a warrant of execution. Tenants will be
able to appeal to the court.</div>
<a name="10021057000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
only two substantive clauses in the Bill. Clause 1 enables unauthorised
tenants to apply to court to postpone the date for delivery of
possession when a lender seeks to repossess the property. The clause
enables the court to postpone the date by which the tenant must leave,
by up to two
months.</div><a name="10021057000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) allows the tenant a second, but not an additional, opportunity to
apply for a postponement of possession when the lender applies for a
warrant of possession. The tenant may apply directly to the lender for
the delay of possession. If that application is refused by the lender,
the tenant can pursue the application through the
courts.</div><a name="10021057000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) enables the judge to have regard to the circumstances of the
tenant. The provision is designed primarily to take into account
situations in which tenants may have breached the tenancy through no
fault of their own, such as the non-payment of rent when that is caused
by a delay in the payment of housing benefit by a local housing
authority.</div><a name="10021057000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(6) recognises the concerns raised by lenders, who say that they should
be able to receive rent from any tenant within the two-month notice
period. Subsection (7) makes it clear&#151;again, in
response to lenders&#146; concerns&#151;that receipt of such rent
does not create any tenancy obligations between lender and tenant.
Subsection (8) defines an unauthorised
tenant.</div><a name="10021057000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
that introduction to the Bill, I look forward to comments from the
Committee. My hon. Friend the Minister might have something additional
to say.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="10021057000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10021057000108"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con): Dr. McCrea, it is a
pleasure to serve under your benign chairmanship for the first time; I
say that
hopefully.</div><a name="10021057000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
had a good Second Reading debate on 29 January; it was one of those
rare debates during which new information comes out. The experience of
hon. Members was useful in informing a better discussion&#151;not
many of us were there, so it was a question of quality rather than
quantity.</div>
<a name="10021057000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bolton, South-East will not be getting so much valedictory
praise in Committee as he did on Second Reading, but we are delighted
to be in a position to support the Bill, which is extremely important.
I pay tribute not only to the organisations that he mentioned, such as
Shelter, Crisis and the Chartered Institute of Housing, but to him for
the dogged and determined way in which he has pursued the Bill, which
is very much for the public good. We are delighted and pleased to
support it today. We hope that the Bill gets a speedy passage to the
other place and is enacted into law
expeditiously.</div><a name="10021057000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is needed because this year we could be looking at 53,000
repossessions. The issue affects at least 2,000, but possibly 3,000 or
more. One of the key factors to emerge from the debate is that we have
qualitative data about the impact of the problem on families, via
organisations, such as the citizens advice bureaux, that do a superb
job, but we do not have quantitative data on how many people are
affected, on the cumulative impact on housing allocation policies
or&#151;this is the issue of most concern&#151;on the impact of
repossession on young children. The thought of very young children
literally being made homeless, through no fault of their own or of
their family, is
intolerable.</div><a name="10021057000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be remiss of me not to make a slightly party political point,
because my party was urging the Government to look at such issues as
far back as March last year. Notwithstanding the sincere undertakings
from the Minister for Housing and others that they were concerned and
that the issues needed to be examined, we were disappointed not to see
substantive commitments in last year&#146;s Queen&#146;s Speech or
legislative
programme.</div><a name="10021057000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is self-evident that we do not have a problem with the Bill, because we
have not tabled any amendments; nor have any other hon. Members.
However, I would like the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East to
consider and answer some questions on a few issues. The Minister, too,
might want to touch on those
issues.</div><a name="10021057000086"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="10021057000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the issues is the word &#147;a&#148;. It reminds me a bit of
Bill Clinton&#146;s problem with Monica Lewinsky&#151;what the
meaning of &#147;is&#148; is. The meaning of &#147;a&#148; is
important. What is its meaning under clause 1(4)? The issue was raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies), regarding how
many opportunities within the two months a tenant will have to make an
application under the clause. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bolton,
South-East will give some attention to that matter in his
remarks.</div><a name="10021057000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
concern, which the Building Societies Association had, was about the
need for the court to consider the specific circumstances not only of
the tenant, but of the borrower and the lender. The association was
concerned about whether the discretion of those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>parties would be fettered by the clause as it relates to the Financial
Services Authority&#146;s ruling in reference code 13.6.1 of
&#147;Mortgages and Home Finance: Conduct of Business
Sourcebook&#148;, or MCOB, in respect of treating borrowers in
arrears fairly. The hon. Gentleman might wish to consider that matter
too. I will not get on to clause 2 in respect of the suggestion that
notice be sent to the property by the Courts Service rather
than the lenders; perhaps we can discuss that later in the
proceedings.</div>
<a name="10021057000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues
that I have raised are only minor, but they are nevertheless important
to tease out; the fact that we have not tabled any amendments does not
suggest that they are not pertinent issues. I commend the Council of
Mortgage Lenders and the Building Societies Association for generally
supporting the proposals in the Bill. However, they are right to say
that there is a trilateral relationship between the landlord, the
tenant and the lender. All the interests need to be properly protected
when difficult situations
arise.</div><a name="10021057000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those minor caveats, I should say that clause 1 seems eminently
sensible, and we support it. I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman
and the Minister addressed the issues that I have
raised.</div><a name="10021057000043"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10021057000109"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Barbara Follett):</b> I should like to echo the
words of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East and the hon.
Member for Peterborough in saying that it is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship today, Dr. McCrea. It is the first time that I have
done so. It is also a pleasure to serve on a Committee that is doing
what I believe Parliament does best&#151;discussing points of
legislation without making party political points that obscure the
intention of the legislation.</div>
<a name="10021057000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East. I do not
know whether I can congratulate someone on their luck in coming first
in the private Member&#146;s Bill ballot&#151;I entered that
faithfully, but never came anywhere higher than about 300th.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I realise that many other hon.
Members are in the same position.</div>
<a name="10021057000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
congratulate my hon. Friend on getting the Bill debated in Committee.
It will be a great legacy for him. Although I was unable to attend the
debate on Second Reading, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities
and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury
(Mr. Malik), told me about the unprecedented cross-party
support for the Bill and the remedy that it offers to unauthorised
tenants.</div>
<a name="10021057000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government welcome the Bill unreservedly, and I understand that it is
broadly welcomed by all members of the Committee. That is important
because I am sure that, as the hon. Member for Peterborough mentioned,
the problem of short-notice eviction, particularly in today&#146;s
difficult economic times, exists in most of the constituencies
represented in the room today. I have certainly had to deal with the
problem in my constituency
surgeries.</div><a name="10021057000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is recognised that the problem of short-notice eviction often arises
from a landlord&#146;s failure to gain consent to let from their
lender, whether intentionally or not. The effect on tenants is not
acceptable. The Government&#146;s support for the Bill is based on
the consultation document that we issued over the summer, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>entitled &#147;Lender repossession of residential property: Protection
of tenants&#148;, in which we outlined our preferred course of action
in addressing the problem through legislation.</div>
<a name="10021057000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill that
we are scrutinising today is that piece of legislation. It fully
supports the Government&#146;s preferred course of action. I realise
that it has come before we have published our response to the
consultation, and I apologise for that. The response will be coming out
shortly, and will take into account the deliberations on the
Bill.</div><a name="10021057000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government worked with stakeholders last year, and more recently, in
developing the policy response to the problem. I know that my hon.
Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East has continued that engagement
with a range of stakeholders&#151;he mentioned them in his
speech&#151;since he introduced the Bill to the House. I would like
to thank all the stakeholders involved for their work in improving the
position of tenants within the current legislative framework.</div>
<a name="10021057000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
points raised by the hon. Member for Peterborough. On the mortgage
conduct business, I was wondering whether the hon. Gentleman had
received the letter from my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton,
South-East following Second Reading.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Excuse me, I am getting
information as I speak.</div>
<a name="10021057000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10021057000110"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b>
Inspiration.</div><a name="10021057000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10021057000111"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b>
Inspiration&#151;exactly.</div><a name="10021057000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10021057000112"></a><b class="B">Peter
Bottomley</b> (Worthing, West) (Con): And

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10021057000113"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> And perspiration. The matter depends on the facts
of the case, but the Financial Services Authority has confirmed that
lenders&#146; giving reasonable notice to tenants does not conflict
with the MCOB. On the point made by the hon. Member for Peterborough
regarding &#147;a&#148;, not &#147;one&#148;, I suggest that my
hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East should reply to that,
because I know that he has dealt with it on previous
occasions.</div>
<a name="10021057000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the
Building Societies Association&#146;s concern, judges have discretion
in such cases. They do not have to take only delay into account; they
can also take into account lender and borrower circumstances. The
lender would expect a court hearing to state the lender&#146;s case.
A judge can refuse to grant possession if necessary. I hope that those
rather garbled pieces of inspiration were sufficiently clear for the
hon. Member for Peterborough. If they were not, I will attempt to
address them in more detail in
writing.</div><a name="10021057000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Meanwhile,
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East once
more on the calm and competent way in which he has taken through this
important legislation. I commend the Bill to the
Committee.</div><a name="10021057000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10021057000114"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> Forgive me if I speak briefly, and also for
being here for only a short time; I am supposed to be giving blood at
10 o&#146;clock.</div>
<a name="10021057000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East on promoting the
Bill competently in the Second Reading debate and on presenting clause
1 informatively. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>comfort is that the Bill will do good; it will not do harm. It allows a
judge the power to do something, but it does not require them to use
it. The judge can take circumstances into account. For example, if the
person who has granted the mortgage has allowed reasonable notice to a
tenant of whom they become aware, that can be taken into account by the
judge. The Bill does not involve an automatic two-month extension to
the possession
order.</div><a name="10021057000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only question that has been floating around my mind may not
be directly relevant to the Bill, but it is of interest. In
respect of an unauthorised tenancy, what if the person who grants the
mortgage has said to the person who has taken it, &#147;You are not
allowed to let or sub-let without our permission, and we are not going
to give such permission. We require you to regularise the position
without seeking a possession order&#148;? Will the Bill apply in such
circumstances? The issue is not vital to whether the clause is
acceptable; it is just on my
mind.</div><a name="10021057000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10021057000115"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> I shall try to respond to those points as well as I
can. The word &#147;a&#148; and the use and meaning of it in the
Bill was raised on Second Reading. We took the criticisms seriously and
I consulted the legal people in the Department for Communities and
Local Government. They are aware of the criticisms and I am assured
that in a court of law the judge will interpret the word
&#147;a&#148; as meaning &#147;only one&#148;. We do not think
there is any doubt about that. We appreciate the concerns of the
lenders, as represented by the Council for Mortgage Lenders, for
example. I have met a representative of that organisation and people
from the Department have met the organisation&#146;s representatives
several times and tried to reassure them on that
point.</div><a name="10021057000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is the scaffold, and the regulations and guidance notes will fill
in the rest of the building. The judge will have all the information in
front of him, and anyone else who wants to consult the Bill will also
have that information. The Department for Communities and Local
Government assures me that it will ensure that, in the guidance notes
and regulations that will have to go before a delegated legislation
Committee, the word &#147;a&#148; will mean only once&#151;the
tenant will have only one shot at delaying the procedure, whether at
the possession stage or application for warrant stage. I do not think
that any judge in any court of law in Britain would allow tenants to
abuse the law as people have suggested they might if the word
&#147;a&#148; were not understood. I am confident that we are sound
on that
point.</div><a name="10021057000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has already referred to the MCOB, which requires the person
selling the property to acquire the best possible price. The rules are
from the Financial Services Authority and consultations have taken
place. As the Minister has said, we do not believe that MCOB rules are
infringed in any way by the Bill.</div>
<a name="10021057000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for who
delivers the envelopes, under the current rules either the lender or
the Courts Service can do that. However, I and others believe that it
is best if the lender delivers the envelopes. Envelopes from courts are
likely to be branded, and we must consider the fact that the tenant
might not want people who live in the same property or in the vicinity
to know of their difficulty. Moreover, a branded envelope from a court
might just raise curiosity, as a result of which someone else might
open it. We consider that envelopes that are not branded in such a way
are preferable, which is why it is best if the lenders send them
out.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10021057000116"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> For the avoidance of doubt, I should say that I
support that view. The indicated cost to the public purse of sending
such correspondence via the Courts Service is prohibitive, and the
existing system, which works, is not a substantial impediment to the
information getting to the
person.</div><a name="10021057000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we are on the subject of guidelines, I wish to make a plea about the
generic issue of data protection, which was mentioned on Second
Reading. Would it be possible for the guidance given by the Information
Commissioner on the sharing of information in respect of repossessions
to be included in the regulations? If not, can the letter from the
Information Commissioner be placed in the House of Commons
Library?</div><a name="10021057000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10021057000117"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> We shall certainly bear in mind the second issue
raised by the hon. Gentleman; I think that it can be accommodated. I
thank him for his support in respect of his first
point.</div><a name="10021057000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to respond to the hon. Member for Worthing, West on whether there
is another way of maintaining the tenant in the same property, by
regulating the situation legally. Curiously, just yesterday I received
a letter about a person who became an unauthorised tenant, without
knowing so until the procedure had started. The situation was worked
around in such a way that the landlord became an accepted buy-to-let
landlord.</div>
<a name="10021057000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such
cases, higher interest is payable on commercial buy-to-let mortgages;
indeed, there will probably be a higher arrangement fee. That happened
to the person who wrote to me. The two people in the property became
authorised tenants instead of unauthorised tenants, so there are ways
to unravel the situation. That is obviously the best outcome for the
lender, who does not have to sell the property, and for the tenant, who
does not have to leave the
property.</div><a name="10021057000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say to the hon. Member for Peterborough that I have been told that the
letter from the Information Commissioner is already in the Library. The
data protection issue raised on Second Reading will be dealt with under
guidance to the Bill, but not under
regulation.</div><a name="10021057000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Iddon:</b> Clause 2 will apply to lenders once they have
obtained a possession order and applied for a warrant of possession. It
will introduce a new light-touch process for lenders that will oblige
them to give notice of the execution of the possession order to the
occupier of the property. That will give the tenant or tenants a second
opportunity in the process to request a delay in possession if they
have failed to act at the first
opportunity.</div><a name="10021057000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
