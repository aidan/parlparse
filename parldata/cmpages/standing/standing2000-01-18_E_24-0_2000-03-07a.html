Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 606, in page 81, line 7, at end insert—

<P>
( ) Charges imposed in respect of any motor vehicle by a charging scheme under this Part shall be paid—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) by the registered keeper of the motor vehicle, or

<P>
(b) in circumstances specified in regulations made by the appropriate national authority, by such person as is so specified.—[Mr. Raynsford.]

<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we may take the following Government amendments: No. 625, No. 626, No. 637, No. 655,{**JU**}
No. 656, No. 680 and No. 694.

<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): As I was saying, exemptions are a problem; unfortunately, we may not have a long debate on the matter.

<P>
The Bill states that the Government will set national guidelines, having done so for national health service hospitals, for the fire service and for the police. However, many organisations such as the St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade, meals on wheels services and those who deliver to schools believe that they should be exempt. The proposal will be a minefield for local authorities, who will have the power to issue exemptions. There will not be uniform schemes throughout the country and that will cause confusion and difficulty.

<P>
How will tourists going from one charging scheme to another be accommodated if there are different schemes? How will delivery lorries, which travel across the United Kingdom, be encompassed in different local schemes? The Government must think about those problems.

<P>
The consultation paper states that a key issue is

<P>
an understanding of the potential for charges to damage business and commerce and the need to protect the vitality of towns and city centres—including the need for a regional perspective to protect the sustainability of competing economic centres.
Many town centres have grave economic problems; we all know of areas where there are charity shops or building societies but little other trade. Our anxiety is that if a scheme is introduced, especially if it is done badly, it could have a substantial impact on local business and commerce.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Is my hon. Friend aware of a recent Confederation of British Industry survey of its London members which found that 68 per cent. of all businesses in London opposed a parking tax outright and a further 40 per cent. would more or less oppose it, and that 41 per cent. of companies said that if there were parking taxes in London, they would stop investing there?

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Business costs are a serious matter. There will soon be revaluation of the unified business rate; many town centres may have a substantial uplift and in the course of the five years in which they have to live with the new figures they may have to introduce some of the proposed schemes. That may have a material effect on the capacity of business and trade to survive.

<P>
The Minister may wish to comment on the suggestion by several organisations that there should be a season ticket or permit for regular users in an area; couriers from international delivery firms, for example, are always nipping in and out and it would be much easier if there were a ticket or permit system for those organisations. Their presence may mean that there are no delivery lorries.

<P>
There is nothing in the Bill to cap a maximum charge. Although we hope that people will be reasonable, sometimes they are not, and it may create substantial difficulties for local businesses if there is no cap on the charge.

<P>
I do not want to prolong the proceedings, as the Minister gave a long explanation before lunch, but real concerns have been expressed and, if we are not careful, the measure will be detrimental to business and to town centres.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) for raising some important issues. As some were raised before lunch I cannot undertake to remember them all, but I shall do my best to respond to what I recall as being the key issues, in reverse order, and briefly.

<P>
The cap on charges is an interesting and important issue. As I emphasised, the Government's view is that the introduction of the schemes is a matter for local authorities and local consensus. It is unlikely that such schemes will be introduced without the local business community being consulted and giving its support. The Secretary of State will bear that in mind when he considers proposals for introducing congestion charges—[
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister is endeavouring to respond to the debate, but three conversations are going on in the Room.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Member for Poole made an important and fair point about the costs to the business community. We expect local authorities to work closely Mr. Hillwith the business community in considering such schemes; I am bound to tell the hon. Gentleman that they are already doing so. In those authorities that have made most progress in developing such schemes there is the clearest evidence of co-operation with the business community. [
Interruption.] If the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) will forgive me, I shall complete the thought and then give way to him.

<P>
Shortly before Christmas, I had the pleasure of receiving a delegation of local councillors and business people from the west midlands. The Committee will be aware that five west midlands authorities are seriously considering introducing a workplace parking levy. Among the business people present was Digby Jones, who was then secretary of the regional Confederation of British Industry and who is now general secretary of the CBI. He was highly supportive of the local authority's congestion charging and keen for the proceeds of the scheme to be applied to the development of the midland metro system, to which local business attaches considerable importance.

<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) quoted figures showing the attitude of London businesses, but it is a matter of record that the business community as a whole has not evinced much enthusiasm for the work place parking levy option. I remind the hon. Gentleman that since the mid-1980s, City institutions have been extremely supportive of road-user charging proposals for London. Indeed, in many respects they have been groundbreakers in the capital city in advocating such schemes. The picture is mixed; among some business communities in certain areas, there is clear enthusiasm for congestion parking measures.

<P>
I said that I would give way to my opposite number, the hon. Member for North Essex, and I shall then give way to the hon. Member for North Wiltshire.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): Given that a third of journeys are made by people driving company cars, a significant proportion of journeys must be reclaimable. Will the expenses of a congestion-charging scheme be reclaimable, and will it be possible for employers to pay those charges in respect of journeys to and from work? Will that be a taxable benefit and are the charges VATable?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me offer two thirds of a response to the hon. Gentleman while I gaze around for inspiration for my response to the final question. The answer to the question about claimable expenses is yes. As to whether expenses would be claimable by companies, the answer is no. On the question about VAT, a gesture of the head would suffice in the circumstances. But I will go one better: the journey to work is taxable, and it would be subject to VAT. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Minister makes little of the CBI's anecdotal account of the remarks made by the new Secretary General of the CBI when he was in the west midlands. But the survey of London members shows that 68 per cent. of London businesses are totally opposed, and that 41 per cent. will reduce investment. The Minister, as someone who favours parking taxes, also argues that the City of London is opposed to parking taxes and in favour of congestion charging—exactly as I have said. Of course the fat cats in the merchant banks are all in favour of clearing the roads. The Minister has made my point for me.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It is true that those who choose to pay the charges and use the roads will benefit from the greater ease of movement and faster speeds that will result from a reduction in congestion. But the benefits are general. I have dwelt almost excessively on the benefits—primarily economic—that will accrue to road users in private vehicles as a result of reduced congestion. I mentioned the environmental benefits of a reduction in noise and pollution and the benefits that will accrue to the wider community, in terms of investment in public transport projects and local road improvements—where these are deemed appropriate—as a result of the revenue from charging schemes. This is not a fat cats' charter. I reiterate my amazement that after 300 years of existence the Tory party is apparently condemning fat cats. It reflects the desperation of a party that has been abandoned by the Greek colonels and billionaire supporters, and certainly by the squillionaires of Hong Kong, and, as we now know, extensively by the British business community. Frankly, that does not wash. We need more evidence—a bit more of a track record—of concern for the least well-off in society before we can remotely accept the image of the Conservative party as the party of the underdog.

<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): I wonder whether my hon. Friend has seen the letter sent to me by Sainsbury's, a reputable company that pays a great deal of attention to its customers' needs. Commenting on road user charges and the workplace parking levy, the writer states:

<P>
However, it is acknowledged that measures such as these will be required in some areas to address existing congestion problems and provide the local authority with a potential revenue stream to support the provision of attractive and meaningful alternatives to the private car.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend. I have not seen the letter, but I find the views expressed by Sainsbury's entirely typical of many businesses. It is wrong of the Opposition to suggest that there is anything like blanket opposition to the proposals from business.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The quotation from Sainsbury's letter traduces the realities of what the company is saying. It is only reasonable to ask the Minister to take an independent line and put that right.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has been in the House long enough to know that the Chairman is not responsible for the Minister's words. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to catch my eye, he may seek to do so.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale.

<P>
The hon. Minister for Poole made an important point about the desirability of interoperability, which the Government wish to encourage. The rapid development of technology makes it a great deal easier to achieve.

<P>
The hon. Minister for Poole mentioned exemptions that bridge the lunchtime break. Members of the Committee have received a copy of the Government's response to the consultation paper ``Breaking the logjam'', which was published on 22 February. The paper invited views on, among other topics, which exemptions from charges or other concessions should be specified nationally and which would be best left to local authorities in their design of individual schemes. Hon. Members who have read our response to the paper—they do not appear to include Conservative Members—will know that we propose to exempt emergency vehicles from both road user charges and workplace parking charges. We also propose to exempt disabled people from both charges, and we propose some exemption or concession from the workplace, parking levey for national health service hospitals.

<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): Has my hon. Friend considered exemption for rescue and recovery vehicles? Some motoring organisations are worried that there is currently no exemption. What is the likelihood of these vehicles being included?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. I find it fascinating that nowadays Labour Members form the most articulate and effective voice on behalf of motoring interests. It is another example of the way in which history has bypassed the Opposition. I am sure that we shall wish to consider my hon. Friend's point when we examine exemptions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I would rather not.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. How can Opposition Members articulate their beliefs if they are not allowed to speak in interventions?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can only repeat what I said to the hon. Member for North Wiltshire a short while ago. The hon. Gentleman has every opportunity to catch my eye if he wishes to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) has missed the point. He has had ample opportunity to voice the interests of the motoring organisations and has signally failed to do so, but I will take pity on him and allow him to intervene.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not dealt with the simple question that I asked earlier about rural motorists, for whom there is no alternative to the car. He blindly stated that this tax will get rid of congestion. My rural motorists drive into town from 98 villages. It is inconceivable that a rural transport system will replace the car.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman did not listen to my earlier response. I fully accept that the car remains an essential mode of transport for people in rural villages. The Government have sought massively to improve provision of rural transport services, notably through our rural bus grant initiative. We have provided £170 million for the rural bus grant initiative in the current three-year period. I was delighted to announce the continuation of that initiative for a further three years last week in Essex. I should tell the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) that the residents of his constituency who drive their cars into any urban area that has introduced a charging regime will benefit from the widespread advantages that will accrue, such as helping traffic movement, the environment and so on.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central) rose—

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me if I do not give way for a moment.

<P>
Before hon. Members become too excited, let me tell the hon. Member for North Shropshire that we do not expect the introduction of such charging regimes to be a universal phenomenon; they may not be imminent in his constituency. Furthermore, we would expect any authority introducing such a regime to be cognisant of the views of adjacent authorities. That is part of the Government's proposals. Moreover, we would expect adjacent authorities to be involved in considering the possiblity of using the proceeds of the charging regime to improve public transport services in areas outside the scheme. There is plenty on offer for his constituents.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Member for North Shropshire suggested that congestion charging is an urban tax. We face a choice: crude across-the-board taxes, such as fuel duties, or urban congestion duties. We are clearly moving towards congestion duties and taxes that help rural constituencies. The basic ideas behind such taxation regimes are clearly not understood by the hon. Member for Shrewsbury, or wherever it is.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I understand that it is pronounced Shrewsbury, which is, of course, in Salop.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) has not understood the point; he has not read table B9 on page 154 of the pre-Budget report, which shows that the take from fuel duties continues to increase. Our fuel duties are far higher than those of any other country in Europe, and road charging constitutes a further tax.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman should know that we are not debating fuel duty. The issue that he raises has already been dealt with more than adequately, as hon. members would know if they chose to remain in the Committee for a change.

<P>
The Government commissioned an independent group of experts—the Review of Charging Options for London—to estimate the implementation costs in central London. ROCOL reported at the end of last year and estimated that it would cost about £30 million to £50 million to set up a paper-based road charging scheme in central London, and a further £30 million to £50 million a year to operate and enforce it. If the daily charge to use roads in central London were £5, the total revenue from charges and penalties would be £260 Mr. Hillmillion to £320 million a year, so operating costs would be about 14 per cent. of gross revenue.

<P>
ROCOL estimated that setting up a workplace parking levy, covering central London and parts of inner London, would cost £5 million and that operating and enforcement costs would be £5 million a year. If the levy were set at £3,000 a year per place, which is feasible given the market rates for parking in central London, annual revenue would be about £90 million to £110 million a year, so operating costs would be 5 per cent. of revenue.

<P>
Let me make two points about those figures. First, they relate to central London, where, as we all know, prices are likely to be significantly higher than in the rest of the country. Secondly, if we simply wanted to impose a tax, we could do so with administrative costs of much less than 14 per cent. or indeed, 5 per cent. The point of the proposal is that it will act directly on congestion and provide a fund that can be reasonably hypothecated for transport use. I have sought to cover all the issues raised by the hon. Member for Poole, and I hope that I have satisfied him about most of them.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 607, in page 81, line 8, leave out ``and operated''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment Nos. 638, 666 to 668, 685, 686, 697 and 698.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Under these amendments, we shall make technical drafting changes to clarify the terminology used for different stages of the development and implementation of charging and licensing schemes. A local authority will decide whether it wants to introduce a charging or a licensing scheme and will include its proposals in its local transport plan. If it decides to proceed, the scheme will be made by order, thus the word ``making'' refers to the process of putting in place the orders for schemes. That is catered for in amendments Nos. 607 and 638.

<P>
When the order is in place, the scheme will be established. The word ``established'' refers to the process of setting up the scheme, including the installation and operation of equipment. It is made clear in amendment No. 667 that the word ``operation'' refers to the running of the scheme. The remaining amendments in the group will make the same distinction for London, by amending schedule 12. The purpose of the amendments is to make it absolutely clear what each clause covers, and I am sure that the Committee will agree that they are necessary.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 608, in page 81, line 17, at end insert—

<P>
(2A) In this Part references to a non-metropolitan local traffic authority are to a local traffic authority for an area outside Greater London.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 676.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The purpose of amendment No. 608 is to improve the drafting and clarity of part III. Under the amendment, we shall move the definition of the phrase ``non-metropolitan traffic authority'' from the relative obscurity of clause 174 and place it at the beginning of part III.

<P>
We want to make that change because some metropolitan boroughs have expressed concern that the term ``non-metropolitan traffic authorities'' might prevent traffic authorities in the former metropolitan areas from introducing a charging or licensing scheme. That concern shows that forward-thinking local authorities in metropolitan areas, such as the west midlands and Greater Manchester do not want to miss out on the benefits that road user charging and a levy on workplace parking can bring to their areas.

<P>
Therefore, under amendment No. 608, we shall make it clear at the outset that the charging and levy powers conferred on local authorities will encompass all traffic authorities outside Greater London, including those in former metropolitan areas. Amendment No. 676 is a consequential drafting amendment to clause No. 174.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I wish to put on the record the fact that an enormous number of Government amendments have been tabled, which shows that the policy is ill thought out and that part III is badly drafted. It is not as though the Bill is brand new; the Government have had a dry run—the Greater London Authority Act 1999. If they do not know how to draft such Bills, I have no confidence that they know what they are talking about now. Why have so many amendments been tabled to part III? Why was the Bill in such a bad state on Second Reading that part III requires about 1
<P>
<H5>00 amendments? That is extraordinary.</H5>
</P>


<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The truth is that no Government like having to amend draft legislationon a large scale. We obviously propose the amendments with some regret. Having said that, however, these are minor, technical and clarifactory amendments. The apparently large number results from consequential amendments that follow even from the minor technical amendments. It is tedious to the Committee and we regret that, but it does not reflect on the substance and major thrust of the Bill, which is crystal clear, well considered and broadly welcomed by the local authorities that will be called on to apply these measures.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Orders Nos. 68 and 89.

<P>
<B>Local charging schemes</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): I beg to move amendment No. 710, in page 81, line 34, at end add—

<P>
(3) A local traffic authority operating a local charging scheme shall not be prohibited from using part of the net receipts from that scheme to assist adjacent authorities in developing their local transport plans in a way that will meet the needs of persons living outside the authority's area, who visit or travel through the area operating the charging sheme.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:

<P>
No. 711, in Clause 141, page 81, line 39, at end add—

<P>
(3) A local traffic authority operating a joint local charging scheme shall not be prohibited from using part of the net receipts from that scheme to assist adjacent authorities in developing their local transport plans in a way that will meet the needs of persons living outside the authority's area, who visit or travel through the area operating the charging scheme.

<P>
No. 712, in Clause 142, page 82, line 13, at end add—

, and

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) ``joint scheme'', in relation to a relevant scheme means a scheme which is included in transport plans or policies, including local transport plans, of one or more authority, which may or may not be a ``relevant authority'' under (b) above.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Moore:</B> The amendments would ensure that money raised by congestion charging in one authority could be put to good use in another. I shall offer an example, Bath and Bristol, which might suggest who was originally going to speak to the amendments. Bristol is a popular place for people to work and Bath a popular place to escape to afterwards. Bristol could raise much more money under the proposals than Bath, which could raise none at all or very little. Part of the congestion problem in Bristol is clearly created by people from Bath. As we mentioned previously, Bath may have a good many open-top tour buses scuttling down the A4 on the way to Bristol, adding to the problems of congestion.

<P>
Research has already been done on congestion problems around Bristol and, in particular, on the prospects for congestion charging in an area such as Brislington. People who are reluctant to pay congestion charges will be even more unhappy if they have no alternative to getting from Bath to Bristol by car. The residents of Bath could be very upset and would have much to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster).

<P>
Earlier this morning, the Minister said that he was keen to see this proposal taking effect. We would like it to be built into the Bill, but I hope that the Minister will provide, at the very least, further assurances about how to develop these proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We are concerned because the whole tenor of debate has been hypothecation. In other words, people in one area pay charges that are invested in public services or spent to enhance the locality. However, once we start working on the principle that some of the money is not invested back into the particular area but goes next door or down the road, it detracts from hypothecation.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bath has an intricate knowledge of Brislington and other areas in Avon—and I know some of them too, as I went to school in Bristol. As I said, there is a real danger of detracting from the principle of hypothecation. If there were two adjacent highway authorities, one with congestion charging and the other without, the one could give cash to the other to implement a scheme under the amendments. I fear that one authority might try to buy another authority's permission to go ahead with a congestion scheme. The principle of moving money about to one's neighbours has a sensible side, but also a worrying one.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): The hon. Gentleman knows the area mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore), so he will be aware that someone wishing to travel from Keynsham to the centre of Bristol may well choose to use a car. It is enormously beneficial to people in Bristol if such a person can be persuaded not to travel by car. It makes sense for Bristol council to provide funds for Bath and for North East Somerset council to assist with providing a more adequate public transport service on the A4 corridor from Bath and Keynsham to Bristol. I would hope that the hon. Gentleman could see the merit in that opportunity. If not, he will have to answer to his hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire, who has made a big issue of this point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I note that he is thinking in terms of money coming from the authority next door to the Bath and North East Somerset council, in his constituency, rather than going the other way. Problems about the principle of hypothecation remain. Before a scheme is Mr. Symsintroduced, it will have to have been amended so that a local transport or highway authority can dispense money around, which will detract from that scheme, however sensible the reasons for it.

<P>
The Under-Secretary referred to the west midlands. At some stage, Sandwell said that it did not wish to participate in a scheme. It will cause problems if several local authorities in a conurbation such as the west midlands decide to impose congestion charging but one refuses to do so, which is its right. That could lead to the rest of the authorities trying to bribe the reluctant authority to go along with them to pursue the general interest. Such is my principal concern about the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith </B>(Vale of Glamorgan): I wish to speak briefly to the amendments. I sympathise with the propositions of the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and could not disagree more with the hon. Member for Poole. We must get the schemes right. I represent a constituency in Wales which, as I said earlier, has many smaller authorities, and it is important to ensure maximum co-operation and co-ordination between local authorities. It follows that the key to successful transport initiatives is a strategic approach. That means looking beyond single local authorities, be they Bristol, Bath or whatever.

<P>
I am unfamiliar with the research mentioned by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale about the impact of congestion charges in Bristol. I am familiar, however, with the research of Professor Stuart Cole, who examined that issue and concluded that if congestion charging were introduced in Bristol, the net beneficiaries could be Newport and Cardiff if we are not careful. That is a serious, not a facetious point. We must maximise co-operation and co-ordination when we introduce congestion charging and work place levies. There is a risk that they will not work and they could backfire. The obvious solution Wales would be for the National Assembly for Wales to take a co-ordinating role or even a statutory consultative role in assessing the local transport plans. Perhaps something similar should happen on the other side of the Severn bridge.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith), who has made a helpful and highly informed intervention. When schemes are implemented we must look for maximum co-operation and co-ordination between authorities. We are seeking a strategic approach that looks beyond single authorities. If local authorities in Wales consider going down that path, I hope that they will listen carefully to his words. I also hope that the National Assembly will bear in mind his suggestions about its contributions to the process. I am extremely grateful to him.

<P>
The hon. Member for Poole slightly took me aback with his contribution, as it was a powerful plea for the principle of hypothecation. I was not aware that the Conservative party was so committed to that principle. I cannot think when it has advocated it before. As the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale correctly observed, we have been inundated with requests for a wider distribution to non-residents of charging authorities' benefits, notably from the hon. Member for North Shropshire. I should have thought that what is contained in the amendments, even though I will ask the Committee to reject them, served his purpose. If he wants to demur and contradict himself it will be entirely open to him and not exactly a novelty in Committee.

<P>
I turn now to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. I entirely agree that there could well be a need for local authorities to spend charging revenues outside their local boundaries. That applies equally to local authorities that bring forward individual charging schemes and those that choose to introduce a joint charging scheme. For example, a local authority might want to support bus services or park-and-ride schemes to bring workers, shoppers and visitors from outside their area into a town or city where charging applies. That could be crucial to maintaining the vitality of that urban centre.

<P>
However, while agreeing with the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's amendments, I should also like to assure him that they are unnecessary. As the Committee is aware, the arrangements for the use of charging revenues to improve local transport are contained in schedule 11 rather than clauses 140, 141 and 142, at which all but one of these amendments are aimed. Paragraph 7 of schedule 11 deals with the application of the net revenues raised from new charges. In particular, paragraph 7(4) states that any share of charging revenues received by a local authority must be spent

<P>
in a way which will benefit the whole or any part of the area of the non-metropolitan local traffic authority whose share it is.
It will, quite rightly, be for a charging authority to decide whether it wishes to share the net proceeds from its charging scheme with one or more of its neighbours. It may want to share some of its revenues with a neighbour provided that its neighbour agrees to spend the moneys on transport improvements that promote accessibility into the area with charges. That can be achieved provided that the spending of the revenues also supports the local transport plan of the authority that receives a share of the charging money. I hope that the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale will be reassured that it is in the Bill. The intention is that that power should be exercised by a charging authority.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister drew our attention to paragraph 7(4) of schedule 11 and read out a passage from it. I have some difficulty distinguishing between that and subparagraph (3), which deals with the apportionment of moneys between relevant authorities. Does not subparagraph (4) refer to the same thing, which is the apportionment between a joint scheme as opposed to the passing on of money between an authority with a scheme and one that does not operate a scheme? Could the Minister make it absolutely clear that that is what it means?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman that the purpose of schedule 11 is to allow for the proceeds from a charging regime to go outside the charging regime area, be that a single or a joint charging regime. Paragraph 7(2)(b) gives the power to hand over money. I am assured that that is the purpose of that paragraph. Schedule 11 provides that charging revenues can be shared with neighbouring local authorities provided that the revenue is spent on improving transport in that area. That is the purpose of the schedule and to the extent that the provision appears in the schedule, I maintain that the amendments are unnecessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his assurances. Can he give me one final assurance? It would normally be outside the fiduciary duty of a local authority, raising revenues, by whatever means, including, for example, council tax moneys, to use that money outside its own authority area. Can the Minister assure me that there will not be challenges to the fiduciary duty responsibilities of a local authority by making such payments?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Yes, I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance. That will be the case if it is specifically authorised by statute, which it will when the Bill is enacted. Given the provisions that are already contained in paragraph 7 of schedule 11, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> We have had a useful short debate on this principle. I welcome the Minister's comments. A bit of light has been cast on a murky part of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 140 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 141</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Joint local charging schemes</B><P>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): To continue the debate on the previous clause, I wish to explore with the Minister the different relationships between local authorities. In clause 142 there are special provisions that define the relationship between the London boroughs, the traffic authorities, the mayor of London and the Greater London authority. I am not an expert on the Greater London Authority Act 1999, but as I recall it, the mayor will have some overarching powers over road transport in the city. I may be wrong about that, but if so, will the Minister explain?

<P>
In other metropolitan areas that are currently made up of individual boroughs and do not have a mayoral structure, a passenger transport executive is often the overarching body for public transport. I am curious to know why such executives do not feature in clause 141. They should have some claim on the transport plan and the funding of transport in their area. Today at the Department's Question Time there was much debate about regional authorities and the Deputy Prime Minister talked about the success of establishing regional assemblies. The regional assembly in the north of England may not be of the kind that is being campaigned for, but a joint local government structure has been set up there. The Deputy Prime Minister seemed to give it more importance than I thought it had, but why does that assembly not have a role to play in a joint scheme?

<P>
I am also interested to know what happens if authorities fall out. What will happen if a metropolitan authority wants a park-and-ride scheme, but puts the terminal in the leafy suburbs of a different authority, which says ``Not on your nelly, mate. We don't want that here, thank you very much. All your charging scheme does is tax our residents. Why should we have to put up with a park-and-ride scheme on our territory? Kindly take it away.''?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That is precisely what is happening with regard to Labour-controlled Swindon borough council, which is imposing a park-and-ride scheme on Liberal-controlled North Wiltshire district council. The only people who are opposing it both in Swindon and in North Wiltshire district council are the Conservatives, who are doing their best to preserve the green belt.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that example. There will often be conflict between authorities and although, again, I cannot pretend to be an expert on schedule 11, it is not clear how, even if an authority agreed to play host to a park-and-ride scheme, the revenue would be divvied up according to the rules of schedule 3.

<P>
The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, who is almost a neighbour of mine—I remember that we have talked about the Ettrick shepherd in the past—raised the question of the funding of a rural bus route passing through his constituency to a town. If the metropolitan authority where the bus terminates decides to use the funds for the projection charges for the route and it is extended into the rural area, what will happen if that area decides that it does not want it or is not prepared to fund it without a substantial contribution from the charging scheme? How would those involved determine how much should come out of the metropolitan borough's charging scheme kitty? Will the Minister help us with those technical questions?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) asks a number of questions, one of which was whether the proposed mayor of London had overarching powers over roads in London. The mayor will have powers under Transport for London for some roads, but the boroughs have powers for others. The hon. Gentleman asks why the role of the Greater London authority is not included in the Bill. To some extent he anticipates matters with which we will deal later, but in any charging regime in London, the mayor would have to signal approval. In the sort of case with which we are dealing here where a charging area is inside the Greater London authority boundaries, the Secretary of State also has to approve the application of a scheme in an adjacent non-metropolitan authority.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked what will happen if authorities fall out? He cited the example of a neighbouring authority opposing a park-and-ride scheme in its area and refusing to give planning permission. The simple fact is that that just will not happen, but in broader terms, if authorities were to fall Mr. Hillout, there are provisions for the modification and revocation of schemes. The only caveat that I would enter is that we would anticipate that in many circumstances, authorities entering into a joint charging regime would want to undertake funding commitments through investment in various kinds of transport projects. They will, of course, acquire a contractual nature and it would still fall to the authority which chose to withdraw from a scheme to finance it, which might be difficult in the absence of its own charging regime. That is a hypothetical situation, but it may assist our discussion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> On that point, did the Minister say in relation to a local authority that seeks to impose a park-and-ride scheme on a neighbouring local authority which is opposed to it: ``It just will not happen''? Can he confirm that if Swindon borough council tries to impose a scheme on North Wiltshire district council, ``it just will not happen''? Is that correct?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall be candid. I do not claim to be an authority on the planning process. I know that it is a convention of our parliamentary system that Ministers have to display omniscience in all matters, but I am not convinced that that is always sensible. I suspect that on occasion it leads Ministers into bigger messes than if they simply admitted their ignorance. I do not have direct responsibilities for planning in my compendious ministerial portfolio, but as I understand it, if a planning authority declines planning permission, the development simply will not happen—[
Interruption.] Indeed, it would be subject to appeal. I would have said that automatically, in any circumstances. There is always the possibility of an appeal, but at that moment I have to become mute in my quasi-judicial capacity.

<P>
Turning then to the purpose of clause 141, it is important to allow scope for joint schemes as congestion problems show no respect for local government boundaries. Clause 141 allows charging authorities outside London, if they wish, to work together to provide a single coherent scheme. The clause specifies that joint charging schemes may only include roads for which one or other of the authorities is the traffic authority and that such schemes must help to achieve policies in the charging authority's local transport plan.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hexham enticed me into a discussion of joint schemes in and immediately outwith London. It was a fascinating digression, but it did not relate to the immediate purpose of the clause. However, what I said about the London scene was true.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I apologise for returning to the matter.

<P>
I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for explaining the relationship between the Secretary of State and London's mayor and boroughs, although I am now slightly confused. The Under-Secretary surely knows London's exclusive areas and is no doubt familiar with Kensington and Chelsea, through which the M4/A4 passes. Under the Bill, that trunk road will be the responsibility of the Secretary of State, not the mayor. [
Interruption.] I shall keep up the good work while the Under-Secretary consults his officials. I do not expect an answer straight away. The Under-Secretary may wish to offer us an explanation later if he is not clear about the matter. I am happy for him to do that as I am making a genuine request for information and am not seeking to tie him in knots.

<P>
Suppose that the Secretary of State approves a proposal to put a toll gate on the A4 at the Kensington and Chelsea boundary. The borough of Kensington and Chelsea may be worried that people wishing to avoid the toll will avoid the main thoroughfare of Cromwell Road and that a rat run will develop in its side streets. Indeed, if that happens, the borough could disapprove of the congestion charge imposed by the Secretary of State on motorists using the main road, arguing that it would create rat runs. It would then have to implement anti-rat run schemes, such as traffic-calming measures and methods to obstruct rat runners, which would be costly.

<P>
Kensington and Chelsea therefore has no control over the road congestion charging system imposed on its main thoroughfare, and may have to confront the costs of implementing a vast traffic-calming measure and re-engineering the roads to stop rat running. Who will be responsible for paying for Kensington and Chelsea? Will the borough have any options? Can it choose to refuse to have congestion-charging toll booths on its main road, which is variously controlled by the Secretary of State and the mayor of London?

<P>
That is a technical matter, and I am happy for the Under-Secretary to respond later if he does not wish to address it now.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's first question, which concerns responsibilities for A roads and M roads. Generally, A roads are the mayor's responsibility and motorways in London—which, as I recently learned are known as stubs—are the Secretary of State's responsibility. Of course, I need not remind the hon. Gentleman that, with one or two clear exceptions, the Bill contains no provisions for the imposition of road user regimes on trunk roads. The exceptions relate to local authority proposals, and are designed to prevent impingement on the effectiveness of local road charging schemes.

<P>
The Bill contains nothing allowing toll gates on the A4, at least as introduced by the Secretary of State. Arrangements in London are different from those elsewhere. The Secretary of State would not have the power to toll the A4 in Kensington, although the mayor would. Under the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Bill, the mayor has the power to introduce a congestion charging regime in Kensington and Chelsea if he so wishes.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Trunk road charging schemes</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 747, in page 82, line 22, leave out from ``length'' to end of line 27.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 748, in Clause 144, page 82, line 32, leave out from ``Part'' to end of line 35.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Concern about clause 143 led us to table these amendments.

<P>
We tabled amendment No. 747 because we are not in favour of trunk roads. Amendment No. 748 deals with occasions on which a charging scheme needs to be altered by a charging authority without the delay that consultation would cause.

<P>
The Secretary of State could implement a charging scheme on a trunk road if requested to do so by the local traffic authority. That relates to a matter which we discussed in our last debate. Suppose a trunk road is covered by three traffic authorities, and that the authorities responsible for the end sections of the road press the Secretary of State for congestion charging, but the one responsible for the middle section does not want such charging. Presumably, the latter authority has a right of veto and would not be perfunctorily overruled.

<P>
It would be strange to drive along such a road, paying congestion charges one minute, then passing through a Tory borough, before finally paying more charges in a Labour borough. That would create confusion and difficulty. Of course, if two boroughs outweighed a third, powers would be shifted away from individual boroughs, which could not assume powers for their roads.

<P>
Subsection (2)(a) states that a trunk road charging scheme may be made only for a road which

<P>
is carried by a bridge, or passes through a tunnel, of at least 600 metres in length.
We are worried about that. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex sent a written question to the Under-Secretary, asking what would be affected. The Under-Secretary replied:

<P>
In England, there are 33 bridges and three tunnels with a length greater than 600 m, carrying 21 different trunk roads. This figure excludes trunk roads transferring to the Greater London Authority in July 2000 as these will be de-trunked.—[Official Report, House of Commons, 6 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 461W.]

<P>
Some schemes will be used on roads on which charges are not currently levied. However, others will apply to tolled thoroughfares, such as the Severn bridge, the second Severn crossing and the Queen Elizabeth II bridge on the A282 in Dartford. Most tolling schemes have a mechanism for consultation with users as raising tolls is not always easy. What protection will users have in a regime in which the Secretary of State may decide to have congestion charging on a tolled bridge? Is the consultation process specified in the Bill as extensive as it would be for an important bridge or tunnel that is currently tolled? How do those matters cut across one another?

<P>
A toll may be agreed for a period of years. However, the Secretary of State may take unilateral action and raise tolls before that period has elapsed by using congestion-charging powers. I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would respond to our concern about bridges and tunnels.

<P>
The amendments are principally probing amendments because it is important to tease out some of the issues. General concern is felt about the possibility that we are on a slippery slope towards increased charging for the trunk road system for which the British taxpayer has paid already and that, on the back of what were meant to be local charging schemes, we shall be presented with national charging schemes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> One aspect of Committee work that I have begun rather to enjoy is the ``What if?'' process—an important element of our scrutiny. Indeed, much of the Bill deals with ``What if?'' situations, although they may be improbable. The statute book should provide authorities with guidance on how to respond to occurrences that might appear improbable and hypothetical.

<P>
The latest ``What if?'' scenario, amusingly raised by the hon. Member for Poole, might, I suppose, happen. He asked what would happen if, of three authorities sharing a trunk road or part of a motorway, two were in agreement but the one in the middle said no. In this case the common-sense revolution has obviously triumphed. The charges would apply in the areas of the local schemes and not where there was no local scheme. That is perfectly reasonable—so reasonable that I am quite surprised to find that it is the case.

<P>
If the hon. Member for Poole will forgive me, I suggest it is appropriate to discuss in more detail the arrangements for bridges and tunnels 600 m in length, to which the next Opposition amendment relates. The Government have no proposals at this stage to impose charges on those parts of the infrastructure, but the hon. Gentleman asked about the consultation process should such a regime be proposed. It would be similar to the one used for local authority schemes—the order-making process. The Bill does not override the legislation pertaining to bridges that are already tolled. Therefore there could be no change in tolls without consultation.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 747 and 748 would remove the power that would allow the appropriate national authority to charge on trunk roads at the request of a charging authority. That is an important power solely for the support of local authority schemes. It could be used only at the request of a local authority, to complement a local scheme and make it more effective. It would not enable the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to introduce widespread charging on the trunk road network by the back door. A local authority would have to make a compelling case for the request to the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
The power that the amendments seek to remove is important. We foresee two circumstances in which that power may need to be used. First, if it was not possible to charge on trunk roads in a charged area, that alone could undermine the effectiveness of a local scheme. Secondly, if a local charging scheme created an unacceptable level of diversion of traffic on to the trunk road network, the application of charges could be appropriate.
Mr. Hill
<P>
I stress that the power to introduce charges on the trunk road network at the request of a charging authority will be used only as a last resort. It may be more appropriate to introduce other forms of traffic management on trunk roads before charges are introduced. Introducing a charging scheme on a trunk road at the request of a charging authority will be the last, rather than the first, option; but it is necessary in order to allow local charging authorities to deal effectively with local congestion.

<P>
I hope, in the light of my explanation and reassurances, that the hon. Member for Poole will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his ``What if?'' answers. They were useful. In effect, if there is no scheme, no money will be collected and charges will not be made. I understand that an A-road or a stretch of motorway would be peripheral because a scheme would involve mainly local roads. The local authority would not ask for congestion charging for a stretch of A-road without local roads being affected, even though the money would still flow to the Secretary of State. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 735, in page 82, line 30, at end insert

<P>
and shall be for a specified period.
The Minister mentioned the hypothetical questions put to him by Opposition Members. I shall pose a real question. I used to work in Merseyside and travelled twice a day through the Mersey tunnel. The old tunnel was completed in 1935, and it was thought that the collection of tolls would result in the debts being paid off after a fixed term. They were, but it was very convenient for the authorities to continue to charge those who used the tunnel every day on their way to and from work.

<P>
The names of the authorities on either side of the river have changed several times since then. Nevertheless, it is a good example of what I said this morning—that many motorists have no option. They could drive all the way round, using the Runcorn bridge, to make a protest, which would take at least an hour. It is a captive market. Those who work on the other side of the Mersey have to use the tunnel, and it is a most satisfactory way for the local authorities to raise revenue. That empirical example proves that a finite limit should be set to any such charging scheme.

<P>
I revert to my earlier theme that the interests of rural motorists should cause an interesting balance for many local authorities. We heard this morning about Lib-Lab pacts. We had a satisfactory result in Shropshire last year, when we threw out the Lib-Lab regime—a change that was to the enormous benefit of the council tax payers of Shropshire. Should local authorities change, a finite limit should be set on charging schemes—[
Interruption.] I shall continue my speech, so that the Minister can gather his thoughts, and the thoughts of those who might be whispering in his ear. I would like to know the Government's common-sense objections to amendment No. 735, which, from my Merseyside and Shropshire experience, seems eminently sensible.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Up to a point, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation. His case seems more specific than general; notwithstanding the inconveniences, the payment of the toll at the Mersey tunnel is a matter for the local authority that maintains and operates the tunnel. There is no reason for central Government to impose limits on the duration of the application of a tolling regime.

<P>
We do not share the centralising bent of the Conservatives. We recall that, when in power, they introduced 60 Acts that encroached on local authorities' powers. When we speak about local people finding local solutions to local problems, that is what we mean. We intend to implement such solutions and that is what we are doing through our local transport plans and our proposals regarding congestion charging.

<P>
I do not agree that requiring a specified period for an order would add to the provisions. What should the specified period be—five years, 50 years, 500 years?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth </B>(Aldershot): In answer to the Minister's question, I should say that my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire made the length of the period clear. A proposal was put to local people in the 1930s that a system of charges should run for a set period to finance the running of the tunnel. People understood the deal to have been done on that basis. According to my hon. Friend, the charges became a permanent source of revenue, a different proposition from that originally put to the people. That was why my hon. Friend suggested that there should be a specified time limit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We cherish the fleeting appearances of the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth); he regularly graces the Committee with his interventions. Labour Members would like to see more of him. Having softened him with that blandishment—

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I said see, not hear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I thank the Minister for his warm welcome. I must rearrange my timetable so that I may spend more time complying with his request that I be in Committee more often.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We would all be charmed if the proposition proved practical, given the hon. Gentleman's obviously extremely busy life.

<P>
It is well within the local authority's powers to continue a tolling regime in the Mersey tunnel. It is accountable to local people and, if it fails to discharge its responsibilities, they will sling it out. That is the nature of the democratic process, as the Opposition know only too well.

<P>
The Bill will allow charging authorities the flexibility to decide whether to have an order with a time limit or one that would be in force indefinitely. It will be for the authority to decide the best approach, following consultation. If the local community feels strongly that a charging scheme should be only for a specific period, it can make its feelings known during consultation.

<P>
Opposition Members are wrong if they think that that detracts from accountability or hampers the ability of a charging authority to discontinue a scheme. A charging authority can revoke even an order that could have enforced a scheme indefinitely. A major variation to a charging scheme would require a new order to be made; that would have to be consulted on, just as an order making a scheme would. If a scheme is well established, is doing the job expected of it and requires no changes, it is not necessary to require authorities to undertake a costly and time-consuming formal consultation exercise and to resubmit an order.

<P>
Continuing consultation is important, but it will be catered for through the local transport plans, for which local authorities will have to prepare detailed expenditure plans every five years. Consultation on the expenditure and local transport plans, on which we place great importance, will provide a natural point at which to review the operation of a charging scheme and its continuation. Local authorities and, indeed, Governments, will be accountable to their electors. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment, given those reassurances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Our stone age ancestors must have set traps for woolly mammoths and waited hungrily to see whether a great beast would go plop into it. Sometimes, they must have waited for days; at other times, they must have been lucky and, minutes after they set the trap, one would have gone wallop on to the spiky stakes below. We have just seen a wonderful parallel.

<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the purpose of road charging was that the money would be dedicated to transport. He cited Oslo and I cited Bergen. We were told that Opposition hysteria was exaggerated and that money would be dedicated to fresh transport projects and to public transport. I gave him a specific example of a transport project that had been running since the 1930s. Its costs were paid within decades of completion. The tolls are clearly being levied as revenue for the local authority. It is having no impact on local congestion because people's only alternative to the tunnel is the Runcorn bridge. That disproves what the Under-Secretary said this morning.

<P>
The Under-Secretary has plopped perfectly into the trap. He has not got the point—there is no alternative. Money is being raised purely as local taxation. There must be an end—it must be made incumbent on local authorities to put a limit on the charging period; otherwise, the money will be levied for other worthy local causes. We might come across the conundrum later and I am therefore happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 647 and 648.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We place great importance on the fact that the decision to introduce a road user charging regime or a workplace parking levy will be taken locally by local authorities in the light of local needs and circumstances. We all recognise the importance of ensuring that the scheme which is introduced is successful and acceptable to the public. The appropriate national authority will be required to approve the introduction of or any variation to a scheme. That important safeguard will ensure that there will first be proper consultation with local people and businesses, for example.

<P>
A local authority should be able to withdraw quickly and easily from a joint charging or licensing scheme. That is the purpose of Government amendments Nos. 609 and 640. They will allow the revocation of a joint charging or licensing scheme by a single local authority in addition to revocation by all the authorities participating in a joint scheme. That rules out the possibility of a local authority being held as an unwilling partner in a joint charging or licensing scheme that is no longer in the interests of its local community.

<P>
We want to make it clear that a local authority that wants to terminate a charging or licensing scheme quickly will not be subject to any obstacles put in place Mr. Hillby the Secretary of State or by the National Assembly for Wales. Consequently, amendments Nos. 610 and 641 remove the power of the appropriate national authority to specify the publication arrangements for orders to revoke a charging or licensing scheme. Amendments Nos. 614, 616, 645 and 646 remove the power of the appropriate national authority to require consultation on the revocation of a scheme. Amendments Nos. 618, 619, 647 and 648 remove the power of the appropriate national authority to require a public inquiry to be held before a scheme is revoked.

<P>

</P>


<P>
Amendments Nos. 613 and 644 make it explicit that a charging or licensing authority or authorities have power to consult on their own schemes or hold an inquiry into them at any time. Amendments Nos. 615 and 617 are consequential to that, as the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales are the traffic authorities for trunk roads in England and Wales respectively and will not need additional powers to those already specified. It will be open to charging and licensing authorities to consult or to hold an inquiry before the revocation of a scheme. The amendments provide that the appropriate national authority cannot require consultation or an inquiry where a scheme is to be revoked because they could hinder or delay the discontinuation of a scheme.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 612 and 643 set out the process for confirming an order to give effect to a joint charging or licensing scheme involving London's mayor or one or more boroughs. They provide that if the Secretary of State modifies an order that has been previously approved by the major, the major must confirm the modified order before the Secretary of State can give final confirmation. That will guarantee that London's mayor as well as the Secretary of State is content with any proposals for a joint charging or licensing scheme that includes any part of Greater London. That is in line with our policy of making London's mayor responsible for transport in London. Amendments Nos. 611 and 642 are consequential drafting amendments.

<P>
I believe that the amendments will make charging an even more attractive option for local authorities, especially those which might be considering participating in a joint road user charging or workplace parking levy scheme.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> If a scheme involves a form of season ticket or people proceed on the basis that they must purchase tickets or equipment to comply, how will they be compensated if a local authority does not proceed with the scheme? Local people or businesses could make small investments to comply with schemes. An authority might pursue a scheme but suddenly decide to pull out, perhaps because it was not working as intended or because it was not sufficiently profitable. What compensation will be awarded to people who have spent money to comply with such schemes?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I should like to comment briefly on the amendments tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bath. Will the Minister further explain the scope of the inquiries? It is curious that a matter such as user charging, which would be a key part of any local transport plan and would be widely consulted on, might be subject to an inquiry after the system is established. That raised in our minds the prospect of a bureaucratic process. I am sure that the Under-Secretary does not have such a process in mind, so perhaps he could explain the proposal in more detail.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale asked about the scope of an inquiry. He is concerned that we are creating a bureaucratic process. The thrust of the Government's amendments is to ensure that bureaucracy is limited so that there is little impediment to the process to revoke a scheme. We would expect an inquiry to be held to satisfy the scheme's local stakeholders—the business community, the local community, groups of organisations and residents—whose views will be relevant. We are anxious to ensure that, in changing circumstances, an authority—perhaps a new authority—is able to move with reasonable swiftness to end a scheme, but it should at least satisfy stakeholders that it has properly examined and exposed its decisions.

<P>
The hon. Member for Poole asked about revoking a scheme that involves season ticket holders. As I said to the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, we do not want revocation and associated inquiries to be unduly bureaucratic. We are also anxious that there should not be ``sudden''—to quote the hon. Member for Poole—termination of a scheme. The issue of compensating a season ticket holder would be a matter for the local authority. Presumably, there would be a number of season ticket holders in a local authority area and the local authority would want to act responsibly with regard to their interests. Season tickets tend to operate for a maximum of a year—I cannot think of many that run for longer—and I would expect local authorities to give proper notice and employ an adequate process for the natural rolling out and conclusion of a season ticket.

</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Syms:</B> I was almost tempted not to move the amendment.

<P>
The key point is that there should be wide-ranging consultation of the people who will be affected by a charging scheme—road users, local residents, local businesses, neighbouring authorities and others. That is the tenor of the amendments. The Under-Secretary alluded to amendment No. 750, which stipulates that support for a scheme should

<P>
include no fewer than half the regular users of the roads
that are covered by the scheme. It is not beyond the wit of local authorities to find out what drivers think of a proposed scheme. They may say to motorists who are driving into town, ``Honk if you support congestion charging.'' People who are affected by the scheme—those whose business decisions or patterns of work might be affected—need to be consulted at an early stage. Will the Minister reassure us that the public will be consulted when schemes are undertaken?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I hope to approach the subject in a reasonable way. The last think I want to do is to provoke a split in the official Opposition. I know that, on this matter, I have the support of the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, who, much earlier in our proceedings, supported my reluctance to become involved in the developing kitchen sink tendency. I value the hon. Gentleman's views on the matter so much that I am forced to resist the amendments. However, I hope that I can offer the hon. Member for Poole the reassurances that he sought.

<P>
I listened with some sympathy to the reasoning behind this large group of amendments. Although I am unable to accept them, I hope that I can at least provide some reassurance. We believe that effective consultation should be a central aspect of charging or levy schemes, and the Government attach considerable importance to consultation. Indeed, that sentiment has been expressed in all our responses and observations.

<P>
In February, Mr. Gale, I sent you, and all members of the Committee, copies of our response to ``Breaking the Logjam''. That document makes it clear that full and effective consultation will be essential before charging and workplace parking schemes are introduced. Indeed, in the foreword to our response, we stated that consultation with local people and Mr. Hillbusinesses would have to be one of the four core elements of a proposal before it could be approved by the Secretary of State. I assure the Committee that the National Assembly for Wales attaches similar importance to consultation. As every road user or workplace parking scheme will contain much detail and will have a direct impact on the interests of many sections of the local community, these schemes must therefore be subject to separate and detailed public scrutiny and consultation.

<P>
We have already debated Government amendments Nos. 613 and 644, which make it explicit that a charging or licensing authority or authorities have the power to consult on, or hold an inquiry about, their own schemes. To ensure that that happens, we will be issuing non-statutory guidance for the first schemes and in due course, through regulations, using the powers in clause 145(2). In the Government's response to ``Breaking the Logjam'', we propose to require authorities to consult certain bodies. For road user charging, a similar list of consultees to those in traffic orders would be appropriate. We propose adding to that list the chief police officer for the area, the Highways Agency, non-traffic authorities, such as district councils in two-tier authorities, the relevant national park authority and the appropriate regional development agency.

<P>
For workplace parking schemes, which do not affect such a wide group of people, we believe that a simpler list of statutory consultees will be appropriate. We propose including neighbouring authorities that are likely to be affected, public transport operators, the Highways Agency, non-traffic authorities and the appropriate regional development agency.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I forgot to mention the Isle of Wight. I think that the Minister may have covered this matter when he mentioned neighbouring authorities. Most of the citizens of the Isle of Wight have to use a ferry to the mainland, principally to Portsmouth and Southampton. They are anxious to be consulted. Isle of Wight residents are likely suddenly to face congestion charging when they drive off the ferry, and it may affect their ability to travel between the island and the mainland.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point. Perhaps I could add, ex cathedra, that I would certainly want the Isle of Wight to be consulted about any proposed charging schemes by adjacent authorities.

<P>
The lists that I have cited are not exclusive. Local authorities will be expected to consult and actively involve local people, local business, transport users, representative groups—for example, those for disbaled people—and such other organisations that they think are appropriate. Of course, we will consult further in drawing up regulations or guidance.

<P>
We do not intend to specify all the public consultation arrangements that must be followed. Local authorities should have regard to the guidance on provisional local transport plans that we issued last year and to our circular 10/99 relating to best value and consultation.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
Amendment No. 750, which might be described as the ``honk'' option, deserves particular attention, as it would require the charging authority to consult at least half the regular users of a road that might be subject to a charging scheme. The amendment is clearly unworkable. The costs of undertaking such an exercise would, in all likelihood, be prohibitive, and the logistics of interviewing 50 per cent. of road users to find out who they are, presumably on the road they are using, could in itself lead to lengthy delays and heavy congestion. Therefore, we cannot contemplate including such a provision in the Bill, although there is nothing to prevent an initiative such as that described by the hon. Member for Poole from being pursued by the local authority.

<P>
In the light of those reassurances about the importance that we attach to effective consultation, I hope that the hon. Member for North Essex will appreciate that the amendments tabled in his name are unnecessary, as they are already catered for in the Bill. However, I am grateful to him for the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to effective consultation. I trust that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for that explanation, in particular for his comments about the Isle of Wight. There are several other communities that must use ports or airports, for which charging schemes might make a difference. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Amendment made: No. 610, in page 82, line 40, after ``orders'' insert—

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 740, in page 82, line 45, at end add—

<P>
(4A) A local charging scheme (or a joint local charging scheme) may only come into force if the charging authority or authorities (acting jointly) publish a report on the objectives of the proposed scheme, taking account of—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the estimated economic and social costs of congestion within the charging authority or authorities (acting jointly);

<P>
(b) the estimated economic and social costs of congestion in surrounding areas;

<P>
(c) any alternative solutions to deal with this problem considered by the local authority or authorities, using the government's new approach to appraisal;

<P>
(d) the qualitative and quantitative benefits of a charging scheme over other alternative solutions using appraisal summary tables;

<P>
(e) the potential impact of economic and traffic diversion on the economic activity in the charging area and on the local and surrounding roads;

<P>
(f) use of revenues generated by the charging scheme;

<P>
(g) any broader benefits of the proposed charging scheme for the local and surrounding areas.

<P>
(4B) At the end of each financial year, the charging authority or authorities (acting jointly) must provide for the scheme to be audited independently in order to report on the performance of the scheme in relation to the objectives set out in the report referred to in subsection (4A) above.
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We tabled the amendment principally so that those local transport authorities that decide to implement a scheme fully weigh up all the issues, including the economic and social costs of congestion in their charging area, alternative solutions, the qualitative and quantitative benefits of the charging scheme over the alternatives, and the potential impact on economic and traffic diversion. The amendment would ensure that there is transparency in the decision-making process for establishing a charging scheme. The idea has been promoted by the British Road Federation, which is keen that, when local authorities proceed with a scheme, they should state not only what economic benefit they expect to derive but how that benefit will be spent. If the principle of hypothecation means anything, people must know exactly what authorities will do with the proceeds.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am afraid that I must resist the amendment, which is too prescriptive. I am certainly willing to give the hon. Gentleman the benefit of the doubt and say that the amendment is well intentioned, rather than that it is maliciously designed to overburden local authorities in a bid to discourage them from introducing charging schemes. The amendment is too centralising and too Stalinist, in the words of the hon. Member for North Shropshire.

<P>
The Bill already requires any local authority road user charging scheme directly or indirectly to help achieve the objectives of the local authority's local transport plan. As the Committee will recall from part II of the Bill, a local transport plan would set up proposals to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services. Consequently, a local authority would already have considered many of the issues raised in amendment No. 740, such as the costs of traffic congestion and the relative benefits of the charging regime. It would be for individual local authorities to decide what additional analysis they wanted—and in what depth—of the detailed working of their scheme. However, the appropriate national authority would have to approve the order giving effect to individual charging schemes before a scheme could begin to operate.

<P>
We have made it clear that we will not approve a scheme unless it is fair and makes a real contribution to integrated transport at local level; local people and businesses have been fully consulted; and all the revenues raised will be put towards real improvements to local transport services and facilities. I give the hon. Member for Poole the precise assurance that the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales will want to examine a scheme in detail to be satisfied that its proceeds will be applied specifically to appropriate local transport projects and improvements.

<P>
We believe that the detailed arrangements and procedures for assessing the case for a local charging scheme should be left to local authorities. That applies also to arrangements for monitoring schemes. Also, I have no doubt that every local authority will want regularly to review the performance of its charging scheme, to check that it is still meeting local transport plan objectives.

<P>
The Bill strikes the right balance between local decision making and accountability and the need to provide safeguards to ensure that any charging scheme will contribute to local transport objectives. The amendment would upset that balance and is too prescriptive. I implore the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am disappointed with that reply but will no doubt get over it. The Minister made a good point about local authorities keeping schemes under review. Another point that has been raised is whether there should be any facility for independent audit of whether schemes meet their objectives. I do not think it would be a bad thing, and perhaps the Minister should think about that. Schemes around the country will be set up and implemented and money will be raised and spent. Suspicion might arise in some quarters that money was not being spent as people had anticipated. The Audit Commission might be the appropriate body to deal with the matter. Perhaps we should return to the issue on Report, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
(3A) The appropriate national authority shall publish its decision arising from any inquiry held under this Part within 28 days of the report of the person or persons holding the inquiry being received by it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The amendments are intended to impose a time limit on the inquiry so that the process can at least be seen to be speedy and does not become bureaucratic. The Under-Secretary has been at pains to say that he has taken steps to reduce any potential bureaucracy in the inquiry system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I understand and sympathise with the thrust of the amendments. Although I am unable to accept them, which will not come as a surprise to the hon. Gentleman, I hope that I can at least provide the reassurance that he is seeking. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that it is crucial that the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales have adequate opportunity to consider carefully the inspector's report following an inquiry before publishing a decision. It goes without saying that the decision reached must be sound and carefully considered in the light of the inspector's report and recommendations. We agree that we do not want local authorities to wait unnecessarily for decisions to be taken by the appropriate national authority once a report on an inquiry has been received. However, the complexity of cases that come to inquiry is likely to vary, so the length of the inquiries will also differ. These factors will be reflected in the range of issues reported on and in recommendations made by the inspector.

<P>
It may be possible to reach a fairly quick decision on more straightforward cases. However, more time will be needed to reach decisions on complex cases. That is why a single statutory catch-all deadline is not the right way to achieve the desired end. Rushing a decision to meet a statutory deadline could mean that issues are not properly considered and that decisions are flawed, which could lead in turn to legal challenge in the courts. Although existing legislation on public inquiries does not impose statutory time limits for reaching decisions, we have, as a matter of good practice, set administrative targets for dealing with cases. For example, when a public inquiry has been made into confirmation of orders for a local authority road scheme, the objective is to reach a decision within 16 to 20 weeks of receipt of the inspector's report. For planning cases called in by the Secretary of State, the objective is to reach a decision in 80 per cent. of cases within 13 weeks of receipt of the inspector's report and in 100 per cent. of cases within 20 weeks.

<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that when it is necessary to hold inquiries into road user or workplace parking charging schemes, the objective will be to reach timely decisions. However, I hope that he will agree in the light of my comments that a statutory time limit for reaching decisions is not appropriate and that he will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> There is a discrepancy between our proposed statutory limit and the provisions set out by the Under-Secretary. His target is reasonably large, but perhaps his figures are more realistic than ours. I am glad that that point is on record. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
