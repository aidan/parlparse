<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary of State, Lord Chancellor's Department </B>(Mr. David Lock): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Trustee Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Adams, for what I hope will be a reasonably brief Committee stage, given the cross-party support that this important Bill received in the Second Reading Committee. The Bill is the product of the excellent work of the Law Commission. As a former Member of the Select Committee on Deregulation, I am pleased to report that the Bill is almost entirely deregulatory in character and gives trustees a wide range of powers in relation to investment of trust assets and the employment of agents, nominees and custodians.
<P>
Hon. Members may remember the constructive and helpful Second Reading debate, which mirrored the spirit in which the Bill passed through the other place. I hope that this stage can be completed with the same good will and dispatch to allow the final stages of this widely welcomed Bill to be completed in time for it to receive Royal Assent by the end of the Session. However, in case there are troubled waters ahead that I have not foreseen, the sittings motion provides for additional sittings of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): Thank you, Mrs. Adams, for inviting me to speak to the sittings motion. I entirely agree with what the Parliamentary Secretary said about the manner in which we conducted our deliberations at Second Reading on 11 July. Looking at the Official Report of the debate, I find that we made good progress on that occasion, and I trust that we will do so again today. Three amendments to the Bill have been tabled&#151;I am unsure whether they have been selected&#151;but, in any event, I am sure that our discussions will be conducted speedily and reasonably.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon):</B> I would like also to welcome you, Mrs. Adams, and reiterate the comments made by the Minister and by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier).
<P>
The Bill is important, and the Minister is right to pay tribute to the Law Commission. I must also mention Mr. Charles Harpum, whose work on these matters has been extremely helpful. This is not the comprehensive Bill for which some of us were hoping, but what it contains is beneficial. Nevertheless, there are some serious omissions which were referred to in the other place and which we wish to tease out in Committee. However, there is all-party support for the Bill, and we wish it speedy progress.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should like to remind hon. Members that adequate notice must be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
Clauses 1 to 29 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 30</center></H4>
<H4><center>Remuneration of trustees of charitable trusts</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien </B>(Eddisbury): I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 11, line 23, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) Regulations under this section shall not make provision for any payment which the Charity Commission has no power to authorise.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time but I should like to start by setting the scene and putting the amendments in context. The purpose of the Bill is to update the powers of trustees and make them more appropriate to the complexity of modern trusts. The Bill deals with the current limitations on trustees in relation to delegation and investment, which is welcomed by Opposition Members. However, the Bill raises certain concerns in the not-for-profit sector, some of which were discussed in the House of Lords at Second Reading and on Report. In particular, the powers to remunerate trustees have caused what little debate there has been on the Bill and I wish to raise a couple of issues on that matter.
<P>
Amendments made in the Lords Grand Committee on 7 June have made the Bill's provisions more acceptable to the not-for-profit sector, but a serious concern remains. It is appropriate to raise this in Committee because we are all seeking to implement the best possible legislation, albeit that it is somewhat inchoate in scope, as the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) said. I hope that we will be able to avoid revising it too much in the short term.
<P>
Although we are discussing an amendment to clause 30, the matter partly relates to clauses 28 and 29, which we passed over. The powers included in clauses 28, 29 and 30 relate to remuneration. Indeed, clause 28 provides for the trust instrument to entitle corporate trustees and trustees acting in a professional capacity to payment from trust funds for services to the trust. Trustees acting in a professional capacity are those whose profession or business involves the management or administration of trusts. The clause provides for professional trustees to be paid for such services to the trust, even if these could have been provided by a lay trustee.
<P>
Clause 29 deals with exclusions for charitable trusts and requires that payment to professional trustees must have the support of the whole board. Payments may then be made for any services provided.
<P>
The position for charities is set out in clause 30. Before I concluded that it was appropriate to table an amendment, I read with some care the contribution of Lord Phillips of Sudbury at Second Reading in the other place, where he discussed the matter at some length. Clause 30, as amended, provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations for the remuneration of professional trustees and trust corporations who are charity trustees. The clause allows for different provision to be made for different cases and types of charity, which is crucial given the enormous range of charitable purposes and charitable trusts that now exist. It requires the power to be created by statutory instrument, which must be laid before Parliament and approved by each House.
<P>
The Bill as originally drafted caused concern in the not-for-profit sector and contradicted the responses of the recent Charity Commission consultation exercise on the payment of charity trustees. Charities are governed by voluntary trustees, who have an obligation to act in the charity's best interests and to put those interests first. They are not to benefit from the trust, and the principle of voluntary trusteeship has helped to reduce the risk of trustees using charity funds to their own advantage. Trustees are often faced with conflicts of interest and the voluntary principle provides the context in which difficult decisions must be made.
<P>
Changes in the charity environment have caused some to question the voluntary principle. Charities have become significant providers of public services on behalf of the Government and operate under complex funding arrangements. That has encouraged many charities to seek trustees who have professional skills. In addition, the beneficiaries or users of charities are becoming increasingly involved in charity governance. Many of those trustees will be on low incomes and may suffer a loss of earnings due to their commitments as trustees. To a high degree, that becomes the nub of the issue.
<P>
It has also been argued that financial inducements would address difficulties in recruiting high-quality trustees. We cannot divorce ourselves from the effects of the Bill on the quality of future charitable trustees. The Charity Commission already has the authority to allow the payment of trustees and has dealt with questions of payment on a case-by-case basis. There has been an increase in the number of requests for permission to pay trustees, which is what led to the consultation exercise. Most applications related to the payment of trustees for professional work undertaken separately from the trusteeship.
<P>
The classic example is the solicitor who charges for legal services such as conveyancing or contract negotiation. At this point, I must declare an interest in that I remain on the roll of solicitors. However, I have not practised in 12 years and I would not ask anyone to trust my advice at a stage in my career that is so distant from my professional practice. The commission&#151;this important point goes to heart of the amendment&#151;also includes blue-collar professions in that category.
<P>
For example, a builder who sits on the board of a charitable community centre may receive payment for building an extension to it. The commission recommends that the potential conflicts of interest presented by such cases be managed properly by an open and fair process of awarding contracts for professional work.
<P>
It is worth looking at the commission's submission to the consultation document. Views are sought on the payment of trustees for professional services, the payment of trustees as members of staff&#151;traditionally, members of a charity's staff cannot serve on its board&#151;and reimbursement for loss of earnings. Respondents to that document supported the continuation of the voluntary principle and favoured the status quo. No doubt the commission will continue to consider applications case by case, and I understand that it is due to issue new guidance shortly.
<P>
The Bill is causing potential conflicts&#151;some would argue that they are interesting, but I would describe them as challenging&#151;to emerge. There was a strong presumption in the responses to the commission's consultation against the payment of charity trustees, yet clause 30 proposes to empower the Secretary of State to create a statutory instrument to that effect. The wording of clause 30 has been amended from the original Law Commission draft, which applied to all charity trustees, to restrict its application to corporate trustees and trustees working in a professional capacity. It also requires that each House approve any statutory instruments, whereas the original draft said that either House could annul them.
<P>
Those amendments are welcome, but they also pose the question; what would a statutory instrument add to the commission's existing power, and indeed its willingness, to authorise the payment of professional trustees on an individual basis? It is difficult to foresee how wider powers to pay charity trustees might be developed without altering the nature of charity trusteeship.
<P>
With my right hon. and hon. Friends, I have tabled an amendment to limit the role of the Secretary of State to the degree of discretion currently enjoyed by the Charity Commission. To go beyond that would take away the proper and objective role, and indeed the experience, of the commission, which most, if not all, would admit has conducted itself in a thoroughly objective and even-handed manner.
<P>
I do not want to take up the Committee's time by reading the relevant parts of the Second Reading debate in the other place, but I draw the attention of the Minister and the Committee to the views expressed by Lord Phillips of Sudbury, who was supported, to some degree, by Lord Dahrendorf. We need to bear in mind the words of the Lord Chancellor when he opened that debate. He said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>trust law governing the powers and duties of trustees has not kept pace with the evolving social and economic role trusts now fulfil.&#151;[Official Report, House of Lords, 14 April 2000; Vol. 612, c. 373.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I pray that in aid in seeking the Minister's acceptance of the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I want to intervene briefly in this debate. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) for drawing attention to the points that he raised. I want to draw attention to a hobby-horse of mine relating to secondary legislation, which I have drawn to the attention of this Government&#151;and, indeed, the previous one&#151;on a number of occasions.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 30(4) enables the Secretary of State to make regulations. Indeed, clause 30(1) begins with the phrase:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I want to use this opportunity to illustrate my concern that, increasingly, Governments&#151;I appreciate that this is, by derivation, a Law Commission Bill, but it comes before us thanks to the Government&#151;are using primary legislation not to set on the record the powers given to any particular Minister or agency by that legislation, but simply to create powers to draft secondary legislation.
<P>
In the Access to Justice Act 1999, about 27 additional powers were given to the relevant Minister to draft and create secondary legislation. I can understand the administrative need to do this. I simply ask the Minister and other Members of Parliament who are elected to check the Executive to bear in mind that the more we build into our primary legislation powers to create secondary legislation, which often goes through the House without much scrutiny, the more we open ourselves up to the criticism that we are not doing our jobs properly.
<P>
I am pleased that I have had this brief opportunity to set out again my concerns about the increasing use of power-making clauses. I trust that when the Minister comes to deal with my hon. Friend's substantive points, which were cogently put, he will note&#151;even if he does nothing about it&#151;my growing alarm about the use of secondary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The hon. Member for Eddisbury has quite rightly described the interesting conundrum at the heart of clause 30: is it right, in today's environment, for professional trustees who take up their professional time to serve as charitable trustees to be remunerated and if so, at what rate and in what circumstances? This is not about the remuneration of lay trustees but is purely concerned with professional trustees. His example of a solicitor is perhaps at the core of the issue.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is also right that the Charity Commissioners have consulted on this and the response was mixed. It would not be right in this Bill, therefore, to say that there is a settled view as to the precise circumstances in which it is right or not right to provide that professional charitable trustees should be remunerated. In those circumstances, the drafters of the Bill adopted the form in clause 30 to provide secondary legislation and to provide that that is made by affirmative resolution. Obviously, there would be consultation before any regulations were brought before the House.
<P>
The amendment is designed to limit the power, so that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>  Regulations under this section shall not make provision for any payment which the Charity Commission has no power to authorise.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Eddisbury for raising his concerns, but the aim of the amendment is not clear. If he is trying to constrain the Secretary of State's power to regulate, simply on the basis of the Charity Commissioners' authorisation powers in section 26 of the Charities Act 1993, I regret that he has only half the story. It might be helpful if I explain. Those powers cannot be used to authorise trustees to do anything expressly forbidden by, or for which other explicit arrangements are made in, any constitutional provision in the trust documents.
<P>
However, the commission also has the power by scheme under section 16 to remove or modify any such constitutional provision and can therefore, as a matter of vires, confer the relevant remuneration authority, even in the face of existing constitutional incompatibility. To speak of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>payments which the Charity Commission has no power to authorise<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is meaningless, because the commission has, by its constitution under the Act, the power to authorise any payment. In practice, the commission's power is not limited, so the category of occasions that the hon. Gentleman wants to exclude is a category with no occasions.
<P>
Clause 30 enables the Secretary of State to make different provision for different cases. Whatever else he might do, I find it hard to credit that, if the clause were ever considered for implementation, a Secretary of State would be tempted to give charitable trustees default powers that went far beyond those provided for non-charitable trustees. In any event, the safeguard against the possibility of the inappropriate use of clause 30 lies in the parliamentary control of the power by affirmative resolution.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eddisbury mentioned the Charity Commissioners' power in individual cases. Clearly, the charity would incur an administrative expense. If a category can be defined, it will be better to do that in secondary legislation, so that both the charity and the commission do not incur the expense of considering each case individually. Their money is provided for a charitable purpose and is not necessarily for administration.
<P>
I appreciate the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, but it is the job of the House&#151;as we heard repeatedly in yesterday's debate on the election of the Speaker&#151;to hold the Executive to account and scrutinise legislation. That applies as much to secondary as to primary legislation. It is perhaps the role of the Opposition, above all, to ensure that that is done&#151;so the answer lies, to some extent, in the hon. and learned Gentleman's own hands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way. I do not want to have a controversial discussion or an argument with him, but this is a two-way street. Of course the Opposition and all other parties must hold the Government to account. In that light, I inform the Committee that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) regrets that he cannot be here, as he has been double-booked and is serving on the Welsh Affairs Committee.
<P>
I agree that it is the job of Opposition parties to hold the Government to account, but equally it is the Government's job to allow themselves to be held to account, and not only by requiring Ministers to attend Parliament and Committees. This Minister is a good example of how to conduct ministerial life in Parliament. It is also the job of Government-supporting Members of Parliament to hold the Government to account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have no problem with being held to account by my own Back Benchers, who are often assiduous in promoting the causes in which they believe.
<P>
The amendment will, in practice, do nothing. I understand the point raised by the hon. Member for Eddisbury but, should a regulation be passed under this statute, it would be better for him to pursue his concerns later in a Committee of this House or of the other place rather than to press his amendment here today. I invite him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): The concern felt on this side of the Committee is well expressed in the explanatory notes to clause 30, which state that it would be ``inconvenient'' to introduce primary legislation. The notes also state that the Law Commission
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>recognised that further consultation was ... necessary before a decision could be taken. If the outcome of such a consultation were to be that charitable trustees should be able to be paid in like manner... it would be inconvenient if primary legislation was necessary.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The fact remains that the Bill is incomplete. If the Government had gone through the proper consultation process, the clause would have been unnecessary. That is the essence of our objection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I understand that concern. The last time that trustee provisions were put into statute was 1925. As the hon. Member for Eddisbury rightly said, trust law needs to keep pace with modern conditions. However, such conditions change over time, so fixing in stone the provisions that are appropriate for today without being able to make amendments other than through further primary legislation would be to fossilise trust law in the year 2000 in the same way as it was fossilised in 1925. The hon. Member for Eddisbury said that trust law should be adapted in order to keep pace with modern conditions. Because of its flexibility, clause 30&#151;which allows for proper consultation through the Charity Commissioners&#151;is viewed by the Law Commission as providing the best way forward. It will help to keep the law relevant and up to date. On that basis, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I thank the Minister for dealing with the issues raised by myself, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough and my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson). I remain concerned. It was Churchill who said that advisers should be on tap, not on top. I have the highest regard for the Law Commission and other bodies that advise Governments of all political hues on legally intricate issues. The Minister would, however, accept that it is our role to ensure that Parliament takes its own view to advance the best interests of all those affected by legislation.
<P>
The Minister said that the issues covered by clause 30 were not settled. It is common ground that this aspect of the Bill is not yet conclusive or settled. The Minister also said, however, that my amendment would not work. He said that we could not constrain the powers and discretion of the Secretary of State to those held by the Charity Commissioners at any particular time. Perhaps the old doctrine of uncertainty is creeping in.
<P>
The amendment could be considered a probing one. If the powers are needed by the Secretary of State, it implies an intention to use them and that they will be beyond those available to the Charity Commissioners.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If it is not intended that the Secretary of State should take decisions and make regulations by secondary legislation that go beyond the powers of the Charity Commission, it begs the question, most forcefully, why such a power is needed. That goes to the heart of the argument of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough that our job is to introduce the best possible legislation, and in that respect, I chime with the Lord Chancellor's aspirations, expressed on Second Reading in another place. Our job is to set a framework, not to provide an opportunity to make further inroads in this important aspect of the law.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham exemplified in quoting from the explanatory memorandum, the Government would prefer to be able to introduce regulations by secondary legislation rather than waiting for further consultations to come to fruition; it would be more appropriate, however, to amend the law by primary legislation, when we could have a proper argument about whether I can be accused of trying to fossilise the law, which the Minister seemed to suggest. On the contrary, we are trying to bring the law up to date, but because this is an area that the Government suspect will not capture the headlines on either side of the argument, they are trying to relegate it to secondary legislation.
<P>
This country is fortunate to have the important concept of trust law, which underpins our confidence in our well-funded pension schemes, and we owe it to our constituents to focus on primary legislation. Of course, we have a role in scrutinising secondary legislation, but it does not have the same accountability as primary legislation. Although this is a probing amendment, I hope that the Minister will accept my legitimate concern about a matter of less than complete clarity, certainty and completeness in the Bill and will therefore consider tabling an amendment on Report. With that assumption, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> *Clause 30, page 11, line 31, at end add&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5) For the purposes of this section, ``trustees of charitable trusts who act in a professional capacity'' shall mean trustees whose experience and skills are such that they are relevant to, required by, and offered by the charitable trustee to, the charitable trust.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a relief to know that we are to discuss a new clause, so I shall not be the only one on my feet today.
<P>
The context of the previous amendment applies equally to this one. The trustees of charitable trusts are not only accountants, solicitors and bankers and those who might, in the more common use of the word, be regarded as professionals; that is, with an expectation that they earn their living by applying the professional skills and experience that they have acquired over time to do what is required by a trust.
<P>
I am worried about the use of the word ``professional'' in the clause. I could wax lyrical about elitism, special interest and even special pleading, but that will not help. The Bill defines trustees acting in a professional capacity as those trustees whose business involves the administration of trusts. We know from our discussion on a previous amendment that the Charity Commission applies the term in a much wider context. The diversity of charities and the breadth of their work means that a builder, a gardener, a nurse, a doctor, a theatre director or a social worker may have as many marketable skills to offer a trustee board as a solicitor, an accountant or a banker.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> Or a Member of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We should draw the line somewhere. Members of Parliament, however honourable, do not come into the same category, but that is a matter of judgment.
<P>
If the statutory instruments that may be implemented by clause 30 are to be consistent with clauses 28 and 29, they will contradict the commission's current position on the issue. That is why I tabled amendment No. 2, with the support of my right hon. and hon. Friends. I struggled to get the wording right so that it encompassed what was intended. ``In a professional capacity'' should mean trustees who have the experience and the skills that are relevant to the charitable trust and that must be offered by the charitable trustee. I want the definition of ``professional'' extended to include not only those who earn their living in the traditional professional capacity but nurses, builders and social workers, who may have the skills required and who would properly regard themselves as professionals in offering their services to charitable trusts.
<P>
A tendentious distinction has been drawn between a professional and a lay trustee, which acts against those who may be on a low income but who, none the less, from the very best intentions, want to act as a trustee. If the Minister genuinely wants the Bill to move with the times he should give the amendment due weight and consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this matter. I now understand his point, which was not clear from the amendment.
<P>
There is, however, an inherent problem. Clause 28(5) defines a trustee who acts in a professional capacity, and I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to it. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> For the purposes of this Part, a trustee acts in a professional capacity if he acts in the course of a profession or business which consists of or includes the provision of services in connection with
<P>
 (a) the management or administration of trusts generally or a particular kind of trust, or&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it is not accumulative&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (b) any particular aspect of the management or administration of trusts generally or a particular kind of trust,
<P>
and the services that he provides to or on behalf of the trust fall within that description.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not good law to have two separate definitions of a professional trustee&#151;of what is meant by acting in a professional capacity. It is a recipe for confusion and endless litigation as learned friends debate the differences. In fact, the hon. Gentleman has already made the point that there should be contractual agreements between the trusts and any trustee who provides services. The Bill is about default powers for a relatively restricted range and nothing stops special arrangements being made for others. It is a default power, which, as I pointed out, is both general and specific, depending on the type of trust.
<P>
Many of the categories that the hon. Gentleman proposes would not necessarily be outside the default power set out in clause 28(5). That would depend on the circumstances of the trust. I do not accept that the default power is quite as limited or narrow as he suggests. In any event, we are concerned here not with a trust that enters into a one-off contract with a trustee for a particular service&#151;that of a builder, perhaps&#151;but with the general right of trustees to be remunerated for work that they do on an on-going basis for the trust. The Bill is built on the concept of default powers, with the trust being able to build on those default powers.
<P>
I do not see the problem in the stark way in which the hon. Gentleman has outlined it. In any event, I do not think that the amendment necessarily applies in the way that he proposes, and it is a recipe for chaos to have two separate and potentially contradictory definitions, in clauses 28 and 30, of what is meant by a trustee acting in a professional capacity. I shall certainly reflect on the points that he has made and on that basis I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I listened carefully to my hon. Friend's arguments and I seek clarification from the Minister. Let us pursue the example of a gardener, an expert in horticulture who is appointed to a trust as a trustee because he knows how to manage the wonderful garden or piece of land that the trust owns. Would my hon. Friend's concerns be catered for by the marriage of clauses 28(5) and 30 without the need for what we have proposed in amendment No. 2?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Clearly, it would depend on the individual circumstances of the case but in principle there would be a case to be made that that individual acts in the course of a business&#151;horticulture&#151;that includes the provision of services such as advice on horticulture, which relate to the management of a particular kind of trust, namely a trust involved in horticulture or managing gardens. In principle, he would have professional skills that are relevant to the particular needs of that trust and therefore, prima facie, depending on the exact circumstances, he would fall within the scope of clause 28(5). The provision is not limited to white collar. It can include blue collar, provided that the individual has particular business or professional skills to bring to the trust. Without particular business skills or acumen, the principle of voluntaryism is appropriate. Clause 30 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations to provide that charitable trustees&#151;the clause deals only with them&#151;are properly remunerated.

I hope that that deals with the point raised by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough and that it helps the hon. Member for Eddisbury to understand how clause 28(5) is structured and why a contradictory definition would be unhelpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for attempting to shed light on an interesting tension between the clauses. I recognise that the amendment would throw up a contradictory definition, but I would like clause 28 to be amended in line with clause 30. More importantly, however, he said that he and Government advisers would reflect further on the matter.
<P>
I provided examples to tease out the serious issues. We, as legislators, must keep in mind the serious issue in the Law Commission's report&#151;that the Bill emanates, to a degree, from the legal and accountancy professions and the City of London. As a former City of London solicitor, I would not cast aspersions, but we want to reach out to charitable trustees from all walks of life, so it is important that the Bill is not perceived as narrowly based on the views of those who earn their livings from the businesses involved.
<P>
The Minister directed me to clause 28(5), which deals with the issue of acting
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the course of a profession or business.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He picked up my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough's example of a gardener. Perhaps a nurse is another good example. I declare an interest because my wife and mother are nurses who both worked in the voluntary sector and would never dream of charging for services rendered in that regard, but some people on low incomes might want as well as need remuneration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> My mother and sister are nurses, too, so I join the hon. Gentleman in declaring an interest. Everything that I said in respect of a gardener would also apply to a nurse, who would provide particular skills in the business of nursing, which could be brought to the administration of the charitable trust. Potentially, and depending on regulations and procedure, nurses could be brought within the scope of clause 28(5).
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful&#151;and hope that the courts will agree with the Minister's definition of a business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I am pondering the example of a trustee who does the grass cutting for a charity that runs children's playgrounds. He might wish to claim for fuel expenses and repairs to the lawnmower. In the light of the Minister's previous comments, how would that be viewed?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I suspect that the Minister may want to intervene and say that such expenses would be covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> It is in clause 31.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for specifying the precise clause. I could not put my finger on it, although I knew that I had read it somewhere.
<P>
At what point does an expense become remuneration? Traditionally, some areas of skill might have been regarded as somewhat menial, but as mechanisation takes over, gardeners and others could become an important part of the overall coverage. It is important that the Minister has made a fairly bold assertion&#151;I do not doubt for a moment his legal expertise&#151;that a nurse's skills and experience could be described as a business.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> A profession.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Or a profession. Some people have cast doubt on that, but I would not wish to join them. It is important to ensure that the wording encompasses people who might not have been foremost in the minds of the draftsmen, who were probably thinking principally of lawyers, accountants and bankers. That is not a criticism, but it will be helpful to include builders, gardeners, nurses, social workers and even theatre directors. Why not? Clearly, they could all bring great skills and experience to a trust as trustees. In some circumstances, therefore, it might be appropriate to extend the definition, and, as the Minister said, clause 28(5) provides an opportunity to include such people. There is an interplay with clause 30.
<P>
Given the Minister's assurance that he and his advisers will reflect carefully on the points raised, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I rise simply to give my hobby-horse another trot around the paddock. Under the clause,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> A Minister of the Crown may by order make such amendments of any Act, including an Act extending to places outside England and Wales, as appear to him appropriate in consequence of or in connection with Part II or III.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not take the Committee back to parts II and III to specify the Acts of Parliament mentioned, but this is another example of the House and Parliament as a whole giving Ministers powers to amend primary legislation by secondary legislation.
<P>
All I ask the Minister today is to write to me with a list of the Acts of Parliament that have come into force in the past 50 years&#151;I pick that figure at random&#151;that use the wording in this clause. I dare say that the draftsmen for this Bill have taken it from precedent by finding a similar expression in previous Acts of Parliament, but I am increasingly worried about the way in which Parliament hands powers to the Executive without keeping a close eye on things. I should like the Minister, in due course, to give me a list of those Acts of Parliament that contain the same&#151;or similar&#151;words as clause 41.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I rise to support the hon. and learned Member for Harborough in saying that the clauses are far too wide; we deprecate the fact that far too much power is arrogated by Ministers. I cannot understand why such clauses continue to appear in our legislation, especially in view of yesterday's debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Occasionally, an explanation might help to allay any criticism. I refer hon. Members to schedule 2, which contains several consequential amendments to enactments arising principally from the superseding of the power to invest defined in the Trustee Investments Act 1961 by the application of the general power of investment and/or the power to invest in land granted by parts II and III of the Bill.
<P>
Over many years, the statutory investment powers of many organisations that are not trusts have none the less been defined in terms of the default powers contained in the 1961 Act. I refer hon. Members to the Places of Worship Sites Act 1873, the Settled Land Act 1925, the House of Commons Members' Fund Act 1962, the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 and important matters such as the Clergy Pensions Measure 1961 (No. 3). The problem is that those set out are the ones that we have been able to discover, many of which are thought to be governed by local, personal or private Acts; thus not all are amenable to identification by the usual methods, such as Lexis and research undertaken by the Law Commission. The power will allow those whose investment powers are governed by the 1961 Act, but who wish to take advantage of the new powers granted by the Bill, to apply to the Minister to be enabled to do so by amendment of their governing statute. Of course, the Minister will be required to consult anyone who seems to him likely to be affected by the proposed amendment of a local, personal or private Act.
<P>
Those who criticise the Government say that personal Acts or statutes of private Acts of Parliament that we have not been able to identify, but whose investment powers are limited by reference to the 1961 Act, should for ever remain that way because at present they are lost and obscured; but to assist those who are governed by private Acts of Parliament we have enabled them to apply to the Minister to extend their powers so that their trust can benefit in the same way as other trusts that are set up under the proposal.
<P>
The criticism has come out of the blocks a little too fast in this case; if hon. Gentlemen understand the reasons for the measure, there may be less criticism of the Government and more understanding that we are trying to spread the benefits of the proposal, not to extend our powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The Minister misunderstands my criticism. Clause 40 contains the statutory power that gives rise to amendments in the schedules. However, I refer to clause 41; I appreciate that there may be a good administrative reason for giving a Minister of the Crown the power to make such amendments, but it is vague and general. I am assuming in the Minister's favour that the clause has not been simply pulled off the shelf by the Law Commission or by departmental draftsmen, that it has some parliamentary history and that the same wording is to be found in other Bills that have been enacted in the past 50 years. It is not beyond the wit of man to press a computer key and to match up the words in clause 41 with those to be found in earlier Acts. I want to know the history of the clause so that I can judge whether it is in the public interest or whether there should be another procedure by which we consider such wholesale administrative amendments to primary legislation.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not making an aggressive point, but one of clarification, which the Minister can deal with without referring to clause 40 or to the schedules referred to in that clause. I should be most grateful for his assistance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I understand the point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman, but to understand clause 41, one must also understand clause 40. He asked whether clause 41 was based on precedent; with the greatest respect, he can go to the House of Commons Library and ask the questions himself. I shall endeavour to provide him with such information as I can without asking my officials to labour unduly in a very pressured timetable. He recognised the expertise of Mr Charles Harpum, the principal draftsman of the Bill, and I shall endeavour to give him such information as can reasonably be obtained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> We have reached a pretty pass if a Minister who, not long ago, rightly praised himself for being amenable to the legislature, tells a member of the Opposition to jolly along to the Library to find out the information. I am quite capable of doing so, but the Minister represents the Government, who are trying to get a measure through the House. My job is to ensure that the Government account for their activities to the House of Commons. I did not intend to develop this argument, but if the Minister is embarrassed or inconvenienced by a request for information, he must do the best he can and I shall comment on the information when he provides it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that the Minister will send me a copy of the correspondence, as I was interested in his restrictive interpretation of the clause, which I hope will be included in the information provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have stated the purpose behind the clause and I shall provide such information as I can after making reasonable inquiries. I shall, of course, send a copy to any hon. Member who wishes to receive the correspondence.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I should declare that I am a lawyer&#151;a solicitor&#151;although I have not practised as a solicitor for more than a year. I could describe the new clause as a probing amendment, and I stress that most, although unfortunately not all, trustees and executors act scrupulously and fairly. The new clause is designed to give beneficiaries the right to challenge the bills and disbursements of executors and trustees and the bills and disbursements of others that are payable out of an estate or trust.
<P>
I do not claim that the new clause is perfect, and it is extremely wide. It does not contain any de minimis provisions, but it is there to highlight the public concern that trustees and executors can fleece the assets of a trust with very few checks. The playing field, if hon. Members will forgive the cliche, is not exactly level. I searched in my memory earlier this morning and I believe that the Law Society introduced provisions to enable beneficiaries to challenge solicitors' bills in certain circumstances. Beneficiaries certainly do not have that ability to challenge the bills or disbursements of others, including banks and accountants. Banks in particular do a great deal of trust work. I do not believe that I am alone here in thinking that some of the bills, fees and disbursements of banks can be outrageously high. The clause offers a chance to highlight this matter and to hear what the Government have to say about it.
<P>
It is not only a matter of bills: there are also outrageous disbursements. I am thinking particularly of the unnecessary buying and selling of shares to garner large commissions. I am anxious to hear the Government's views on this. Does the Law Commission believe that the checks and balances are adequate? Do the Law Commission and the Government believe that it is fair that the beneficiary of an estate or a trust can be met by outrageously high costs and disbursements, often with no recourse whatsoever.
<P>
I have been a trust lawyer for some time. Trusts are a remarkably useful instrument. We lead the world in this matter and it is good for our balance of payments and our international standing. I am thinking of pension funds and overseas trusts&#151;although perhaps I should leave out the latter, as the former Paymaster General is not with us. Trusts are an extremely important part of our economy and they are useful to individuals. I do not want to fetter their growth with this new clause but I seek fair play for beneficiaries. Do the Government propose to introduce the right for beneficiaries to challenge bills from professionals and from banks? How do they propose that such rights should be exercised?

<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Hurst </B>(Braintree): I declare an interest, unusually, as a practising solicitor. Most people seem to want to deny being that at every opportunity. I have no known relatives who are nurses.
<P>
I fully understand the evil that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon seeks to remedy. It may well be pertinent with regard to the accounts of trustees, professional or otherwise, that there should be an easier and more speedy mechanism of taxation or assessment for the beneficiaries. I will not use the word ``transparent'' because most people do not understand what it means, but it should be more obvious than it is now so that they can see what their remedy is. I am concerned with the needless and expensive bureaucracy that could be established by the new clause as it stands: the hon. Gentleman is already alive to that.
<P>
I return to the horticultural example that seems to be favoured by Opposition Members. Is it seriously proposed that if a horticultural trust purchases a bag of manure, each beneficiary should be notified beforehand of the cost?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for acknowledging that I recognise that the draft new clause is very wide. I have used the blunderbuss approach, but I hope that he will agree that the object of the exercise is to highlight a problem of grave public concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hurst:</B> I fully understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I did not wish to belittle his sentiments by references to these horticultural matters. As it now stands, the new clause could be far too heavy a mechanism to deal with the problem. My other objection to many aspects of new legislation that seeks to regulate in the public interest is that the public find it incomprehensible. The new clause states that every time a disbursement is paid, notice must be given of the rights of taxation; most beneficiaries would not have a clue what is meant by ``taxation''. They would think that it would cost them even more than the wretched trustees were already charging them. Perhaps we should describe it as an assessment of the right value of the bill or whatever so that they understand the position.
<P>
Those of us who practise law, or did so in the past, know that solicitors have a habit of putting in extremely small print on the backs of their bills a right to taxation of those bills or a remuneration certificate so small and in language so obscure that few people can understand what it means. Solicitors are not the only people to make that error. There was a phase when the financial institutions were supposed to be regulated, above board and fair. Every radio or television advertisement would be followed by a string of gobbledegook that shares may go up and down and that investments may not always be secure. It was spoken ever faster so that it became meaningless in terms of protecting the public.
<P>
We must stand back and ask what we are trying to resolve here. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon was right to highlight the fact that banks have a scale of small-printed charges that are grossly in excess of what would be contemplated by provincial solicitors and yet they are taken on board because they are well-known trust corporations or known trustee companies. There needs to be protection here. The hon. Gentleman is looking in the right direction, but I hope that he will agree that, as it stands, his new clause is not perfect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on this important issue. To some extent the issue also elides with his amendment that is concerned with the removal of the right for trustees to take away their own liability for breach of trust. Leaving aside that issue and dealing with the related issue, the whole purpose of the Bill is to set out clearly the default powers for trustees. I refer him to clause 1 where the duty of care is set out for trustees. That duty of care applies to all his concerns.
<P>
I refer him also to clause 15 and the requirements for the trustees to set out in writing their asset management functions if they delegate them to an agent. Clause 15 also sets out a structure of accountability for trustees that should make it clear that a trust corporation that seeks unreasonably to puts its own interests above those of the beneficiaries is not charging reasonable remuneration, but acting in breach of trust. The beneficiaries should point to that breach of trust and demand remedy. In default of proper remedial action by the trustees, the trust beneficiaries will have a legal course of action against them.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> With your leave, Mrs. Adams, we will debate schedule 1 later. I would argue that clause 1 is inadequate because of paragraph 7 in schedule 1. I hear the Minister's argument about clause 15 and I should like him to clarify two further points&#151;how will beneficiaries know their rights and how will they exercise them, especially when a bank, secondary bank or other profession is intent on fleecing them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Regarding how people will know about their rights, the trustees are always under a duty to act in the best interests of the trust. They are also expected to achieve good value for money and they have a duty to render their accounts. If they have signed up contracts with agents without fulfilling their duties, they will be in breach of their duty under clause 15 and will be accountable as such. The provision of accounts is part of the duty of being a trustee. The excessive charges mentioned by the hon. Gentleman and by my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Hurst) amount to a prima facie breach of trust. As a distinguished trust lawyer, the hon. Gentleman will know that beneficiaries have the right to bring the matter before the courts&#151;and it will be for the courts to determine.
<P>
Beneficiaries who feel that they are being fleeced by well-known banks or financial institutions may have alternative means of drawing the matter to the attention of the public. Intent on preserving their good name, such institutions might be prepared to respond to legitimate criticism, avoiding the risks, costs and delay inherent in court proceedings. It will be for individual beneficiaries to determine; ultimately, the trustees are entitled to charge only what is reasonable. There is some flexibility in the system, but if charges are unreasonable, it will be a breach of trust and action may follow at the suit of the beneficiaries.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree mentioned the blunderbuss approach and I shall refer to his example of manure to show that the new clause will not work. We should recall that the Bill applies to a wide variety of people, including those who may not intend to be trustees, and to the administration of estates, wills and so forth. The new clause would prevent any trust from paying any bills in the relevant period prescribed by an Act whose name escapes me. The new clause would result in all trusts having to pay interest involuntarily on all bills&#151;not the best way forward.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt with the understandable concern about trusts charging unreasonably. The structure in the Bill is reasonably clear and any beneficiary who is subjected to unreasonable charging can pursue various remedies, which I hope will be adopted. On that basis, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that the Minister will consider introducing a simple mechanism by which beneficiaries can challenge excessive costs. I am grateful to him for his comments. As I conceded several times, the new clause is widely drafted, and I referred to the blunderbuss approach&#151;apposite in this instance. I do not want to fetter the use of trusts, which are so important. I hope that the Minister will consider introducing in due course a simple method for a beneficiary to challenge excessive costs. In the light of his comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Application of Duty of Care</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in schedule 1, page 18, line 12, leave out paragraph 7.
<P>
The Bill provides for a duty of care to be imposed on trustees and executors for their acts and omissions. That is good and welcome. However, paragraph 7 of the schedule, which I want to delete, effectively takes away the duty of care. Nearly all wills and trusts contain clauses that exculpate solicitors and other professionals. The few words in paragraph 7 effectively negate a significant part of the Bill.
<P>
The Law Commission considered making changes in the law where a will or trust deed contains a trustee exclusion clause, but proposals to curtail their use were not contained in the 1997 paper, ``Trustees' Powers and Duties''. The Law Commission decided against it because it believed that such action would be highly contentious. I do not accept that that should be an excuse for inaction on this matter. The provisions could operate in a scandalous way, depriving beneficiaries of proper protection and excluding the liability of trustees and executors for negligence.
<P>
I recognise that it is not an entirely simple matter. It would be unfair to penalise an unpaid family friend who was acting as an executor or trustee. It would be unfair if such a person incurred anything like the same liability as a paid professional trustee. Yet such problems, I submit, are not so difficult to overcome. The fact that professional executors and trustees can, in actions taken by beneficiaries, be protected by exclusion clauses from any liability for anything except personal and individual fraud is a major flaw in the Bill.
<P>
I wish to associate myself wholeheartedly with the comments of my noble Friend Lord Goodhart who spoke in another place on 14 April this year&#151;as reported in column 383&#151;about the inadequacy of the Bill. I raised similar issues in written parliamentary questions and I refer the Minister to his predecessor's reply to my question of 30 January 1998. I asked the then Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, if he would request from the Law Society a report on exclusion clauses that limited solicitors' liabilities when acting as a trustee. I also asked if he would make a statement. The Minister's predecessor replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> I have no plans to do so. This is a matter for the Law Society. I am advised that the Law Society will be reviewing the issue of liability exclusion clauses shortly.&#151;[Official Report, 30 January 1998; Vol. 305, c. 394.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>However, nothing has happened, and it is incumbent on me and others in the House to ensure that the public are properly protected. Furthermore, I do not believe that it is a matter for the Law Society. The Court of Appeal has clearly said that if the clauses are to be denied effect, we must do it in Parliament.
<P>
The amendment would bring into effect the duty of care that the Government have rightly put into the Bill. Paragraph 7 emasculates a major and important part of the Bill and it should go. It is time for Parliament to sweep away that glaring abuse.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the subject of trustee exclusion clauses is not straightforward. It requires proper research into what happens in practice and the extent to which such clauses are used and, if used, relied on by professional trustees. My limited knowledge of the subject tends to confirm his impression of the widespread use of some exclusion clauses.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will have gathered that my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor and I have more than some sympathy with the view expressed in this probing amendment, as we believe that there are serious issues to be decided, with principled arguments on both sides. During debate in another place, the Lord Chancellor undertook to refer the whole subject of trustee exclusion clauses to the Law Commission. Interested parties have been invited to comment on draft terms of reference, which will shortly be submitted to the Lord Chancellor for approval, before being forwarded to the Law Commission. I am confident that we can rely on it to undertake a thorough and, I hope, expeditious research project on the whole subject.
<P>
The issue may simply be about who insures. Should a professional trustee not have the right to exclude liability, but none the less the right to insure? A number of complex issues arise, but we accept the need for the Law Commission to consider this issue carefully and report to the Government. I pay tribute to the important work done by Lord Goodhart in another place.
<P>
The amendment seems to be open to a specific objection. Under schedule 1, the duty of care applies not only to the powers under the Bill, but to equivalent powers conferred in another way. If, therefore, trustees of an existing trust were protected from liability under its terms, the amendment would upset a settled arrangement.
<P>
Whether the duty of care is excluded depends on the settlor's wishes. The hon. Gentleman mentioned one occasion on which it might be perfectly appropriate for a settlor to decide to exclude liability. There is an assumption that some settlors will willingly exclude liability. However, at the annual London conference of the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, held last Tuesday, Mr. Mark Herbert QC, a very experienced Chancery practitioner who is well known for his trust work, said that he thought that such exclusions were unlikely. That is also my assessment, subject to the standard terms on which some professional trustees call themselves open to act. The most likely circumstances in which the settlor might wish to have the duty excluded would be when he wanted the services of a particular trustee, and that trustee was willing to act only on such a basis.
<P>
Let us take a not uncommon situation: a settlor wants a specific person to act as a trustee. That person would not be acting in a professional capacity; let us assume that she is a wise and trusted family friend. She will undoubtedly discharge the duties of care that the Bill imposes, but she does not want to run the risk of her conduct being challenged by a disgruntled beneficiary at a later date, so she agrees to act only if her liability is excluded. That may be thought to be not unreasonable. The woman is agreeing to undertake the onerous duties of trustee without reward and, like many potential trustees, is worried about the risks of doing so.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
These are serious issues and without wishing to pre-empt the work of the Law Commission, to exclude the possibility of disapplying the duty of care in appropriate circumstances would be to run the risk of seriously depleting the stock of competent and willing trustees, many of whom act for nothing.
<P>
On the basis that the matter will go to the Law Commission, which will be asked to report expeditiously, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am extremely grateful to the Minister for what he said, which is on the record. I am also encouraged by the fact that the Law Commission will be asked to act expeditiously in this matter. I trust that I am not being too optimistic in hoping that in less than two years there will be a sensible, well-thought-out measure on the statute book that does not fetter the use of trusts but will remedy a glaring defect. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
