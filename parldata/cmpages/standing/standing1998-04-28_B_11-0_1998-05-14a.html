<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison (Hertsmere):</B> I resume our earlier debate about time limits. I want to be fair to the Minister on this extremely technical and difficult subject. I have asked him for details about how long the procedures might take, and I know that, with the best will in the world and working as hard as he can, he will be unable to give me an answer in Committee. It is the wish of Conservative Members to make progress as quickly as possible, and our amendment was tabled with that end in mind. If the Minister would be kind enough to write to me, therefore, stating the likely length of time for the reinstatement of proceedings after they have been stayed, I might be persuaded to seek leave to withdraw my amendment.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> That comes into the category of offers that no Minister could possibly refuse.
<P>
The Government's purpose is not to introduce time limits that would result in the removal of a case from consideration and allow people to get off, or would make it difficult for proceedings to be reinstated.
<P>
We are confident that proceedings can be reinstated within a short time scale and that the problems highlighted by the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) can be solved. We do not want to set average targets that can be met only some of the time; we want targets that can be met on virtually all occasions. However, we must ensure that there are arrangements to cover exceptional circumstances, so that cases can be reinstated when there is a good reason to exceed the time limits.
<P>
We share the concern of the hon. Member for Hertsmere that there should be appropriate arrangements. I hope that I can give a satisfactory answer to the points that he has raised and shall be happy to write to him setting out an explanation. Perhaps, in fairness, I should copy that letter to all other members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that response, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 40 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 41
<P>
Additional time limits for persons under 18
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 31, line 39, leave out `arrest in connection' and insert `being charged'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 167, in page 31, line 41, leave out `arrest' and insert `being charged'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendments relate to the point at which time limits should begin to run. The present framework of time limits under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 sets the time at which the defendant is charged as the point at which time begins to run for the purpose of the time limits. The Government wish to take the time of arrest as that point in the case of young offenders.
<P>
Conservative Members believe that it is a worthy objective that police officers should make swift decisions about whether to charge a person. However, we have some anxieties that we wish to put before the Committee.
<P>
Arrest is a step in the process of an investigation; it is not the completion of that investigation. That is an important point to remember. When a police officer has a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed an offence, he arrests the person so that an investigation can proceed.
<P>
To put the matter simply, we need to cater for cases in which a little time might be needed, after arrest, to gather enough evidence for a charge to be brought: for example, if a person is arrested and it becomes clear after arrest that scientific evidence is needed before the police can decide whether to bring a charge. Such circumstances must be accommodated. DNA tests have been useful in important cases. Such tests can take a long time. If an officer makes an arrest and a DNA test is required, will the time that is spent waiting for the results count as part of the time limits on the proceedings? Will all the time tick away in that period?
<P>
Will a defendant's release after arrest affect the time limits? Does the time limit begin at the point of first arrest and run until the next stage, when the defendant is charged? If a defendant is arrested and released on bail without charge, pending further inquiries, and is rearrested, does the time between the first and second arrest count?
<P>
The provision applies only to younger offenders--those of 17 years or younger. Do the Government intend to extend the use of time limits to older offenders? Perhaps our understanding of the way in which the time limits will operate is incorrect. If so, I am sure that we will be corrected.
<P>
We ask the Government to take account of the pressure that time limits may put on police officers. Swift decisions by police officers about whether to charge are a worthy objective, but the police should not be under too much pressure to complete a time-limit stage. They should make as full an investigation as possible without feeling pressurised to bring a charge. The Times today contains a report about the senior officer in charge of the Stephen Lawrence case. The article states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The senior officer in charge of the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry admitted yesterday that he made a critical mistake in not arresting up to five suspects at the earliest opportunity.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We do not want police officers to delay arrest in future simply because they are worried that that will set the time limits ticking. Ministers must consider that carefully.
<P>
The police should not be under pressure to take short cuts or to ignore some lines of inquiry in case they turn out to be too lengthy. Police officers should be able to complete their investigations thoroughly. Investigations should be timely, but thorough.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): The hon. Member for Hertsmere has made legitimate points, which I hope that I can answer satisfactorily. Clause 41 provides for the introduction of a statutory time limit for the period between arrest and first listing, and conviction and sentence. The amendment would alter the definition of the time limit in paragraph (a) so that it would run from charge to first listing instead of from arrest to first listing. The decision to use the arrest as the starting point was made with reference to our key pledge to halve the time between arrest and sentencing for persistent young offenders. The amendment would undermine our wish to administer justice expeditiously, particularly for young offenders; it is very important in their case.
<P>
Our plans for statutory time limits tackle the need for a speedy response to offending by young people. Delays can impede justice and frustrate the victims of crime. It is important that a clear link should be established in the mind of offenders between their behaviour and the sentence. All parts of the youth justice system must therefore work as quickly as possible. Swift police decisions about whether to charge are an important part of that process. 
<P>
In some parts of the country the interval between arrest and charge is several weeks and there have been complaints about delays and the approach that the police sometimes take to investigating cases. I appreciate that it is not desirable to put improper pressure on the police to progress quickly. However, it is proper to put pressure on them to recognise the imperative to forge a link in a young person's mind between offending and its outcome. Setting the time limits to begin with charge rather than arrest would undermine our attempts to speed up the youth justice system.
<P>
The Government accept that several factors can be outside the control of the police in determining the length of an investigation prior to charging a suspect. However, the police can take some measures to manage the process and resolve it more speedily. Currently the main cause of delay between charge and arrest is the practice, which in some instances has become almost routine, of referring a case to a multi-agency panel before deciding whether a charge or a caution is appropriate. The Government have issued guidance that such referrals should be avoided. The new final warnings scheme should end the practice. The guidance on that scheme will be issued in due course and will allow the police to take decisions in those matters swiftly, without needing to consult others.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere rightly raised such issues as the obtaining of scientific, and particularly DNA, information. The time taken to collect DNA information and get test results would count in the time limits, but it would be possible to extend the limit by making an application, so that the courts were aware of what was happening. As to the question of re-arrest, the time limit would not be affected by release following arrest.
<P>
Under the provision the police would have the scope to minimise the time between arrest and charge, by taking decisions swiftly without consulting too many other agencies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his considered response. He has confirmed my original assumptions about how the measure would operate. I also anticipated his point about applying for extensions. That would happen within the existing framework of critieria set out under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. Is the Minister aware that the courts have taken what some might call a fairly restrictive approach to the granting of extensions? Will he consider the matter carefully and, if necessary, draft amendments later, to accommodate, for instance, the DNA arrangements?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall carefully consider the issues that the hon. Gentleman raises, but the courts are right not to grant applications for extensions of time too freely. That should be done only in appropriate cases. We want to ensure the link between the arrest and its outcome, so that young offenders realise the connection. I am sure that members of the Committee have seen cases--I certainly saw them when I was in practice--in which a young offender has been delayed in the court system for far too long. We are trying to deal with that problem, but, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere suggested, we must ensure that the provision copes with all the pressures on an investigation. However, there is room in the way in which the police deal with such matters for them to improve their record as well.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I know that the courts have taken a fairly restrictive attitude, and I hear what the Minister says about the need to grant extensions only in proper cases. However, he may find that the criteria are limited.
<P>
I do not want to reach a considered conclusion at this stage, but I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter so that the police are able to apply for an extension and have it granted if they are waiting for the results of DNA testing. I am sorry to ask for another letter from Ministers, but I would be grateful if he would write to me on such an important point. We want to ensure that such cases are accommodated within the framework of time limits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am happy to reconsider the issue. We do not want to create circumstances in which the police are put under undue pressure or to cause cases to collapse because evidence is not available. However, we also want to ensure that we do not have any unnecessary delays. We think that we have reached the right balance, but the hon. Gentleman asks me to re-examine the issue. I am happy to do that to satisfy myself that the clause will deliver what we want. If I think that the clause will not do that, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman. If he feels that it is necessary to raise the issue in correspondence or in discussions with the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) and me, I am sure that we shall discuss the matter with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that response, but I hope that he will write to me in any event. If he is satisfied that things are okay, will he write to let me know why? If he is not satisfied, will he write to tell me what he is going to do about it? I might just think of withdrawing the amendment if the Minister is so kind as to accede to that request.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> How can I refuse such a well and politely put request?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I again crave the indulgence of the Committee because the amendment was tabled on the assumption that it relates to what the clause tries to do. I have been lucky so far this afternoon, but I am not sure that my luck will continue.
<P>
When I read the clause, and particularly subsection (2), I thought that it related to the case of Khan. The Minister nods and I am grateful to him. That makes life simple.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The intention is to reverse the Court of Appeal's decision in the Khan case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for that explanation, but to which Khan case does the clause refer? Many cases involve the name of Khan. I think that we are dealing with the case that came before the Court of Appeal on 14 February 1995. Having referred to the various cases involving Khans in the textbooks, it is my understanding that that is the closest to the rule described in the Khan case. I do not want to be too partisan--we have not been partisan so far this afternoon--but the rule in the textbooks is not the same as the rule described by the Home Secretary. It is a different case altogether from the one that he described.
<P>
The Home Secretary described the ruling in the Khan case as extraordinary and said that the courts were required to deal with such cases in time order. He also viewed the doctrine of doli incapax as extraordinary. I studied the Court of Appeal case but the rule in that Khan case is not what it was represented as being by the Home Secretary. The transcript that I received from the courts makes it clear, regarding the Khan case decision, that save in exceptional circumstances, a youth court committing a young person for trial at the Crown court should postpone passing sentence in respect of other, ex hypothesi, less serious offences, until after the Crown court's proceedings.
<P>
That is not what the Home Secretary said on Second Reading, which was that a court was required to postpone dealing with the first case until the last case was ready to be dealt with. It is nothing to do with the timing of cases but with committals from magistrates or youth courts to the Crown courts and with the need to deal with less serious offences together with the more serious offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Let me quote from the same source as the hon. Gentleman:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``save in exceptional circumstances, the youth court which sends a young person for trial at the Crown Court should postpone sentence in respect of other, ex hypothesi, less serious offences, until after the more serious matter has been dealt with.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thus sentencing for less serious cases that are not to be committed to the Crown court will have to be delayed until more serious cases that are to come before the Crown court are dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On Second Reading, this is what the Home Secretary said about the Khan case, and I read it verbatim:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Rules such as doli incapax and the extraordinary rule in the Khan case, which insists that the first case involving a persistent offender should not be dealt with by the court until the last case in time is ready, create a moving target before the offender is dealt with.''--[Official Report, 8 April 1998; Vol. 377, c. 373.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is different from the rule in the Khan case, which deals with less and more serious offences. It could be that the less serious offence took place after the more serious one. The Khan case is about committal of offences according to seriousness, not according to time.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not seeking to make too much of a party political point because he would be digging a hole for himself if he did. When my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made that reference he was talking about proposed subsection (3A)(a). The hon. Gentleman is confusing a matter on which we consulted which has now been placed in two separate clauses. Mr right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is effectively able to deal with both issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That it what the Home Secretary described as being the rule in the Khan case, but it is not. As I have just described it, the decision came from the Court of Appeal, which is why proposed subsection (3A)(a) appears in the clause. The two are quite different. I am not being too partisan. My fairly small point is that if we are to describe doctrines such as doli incapax and the Khan ruling as extraordinary, it would be better if there was more accuracy in the description. In the case of doli incapax, more research should be done. The question of the Khan ruling is rather a wild goose chase.
<P>
I am not going to comment on any members of the Committee after the comments that were made this morning, but some are looking puzzled. The rule in the case R. v. Khan was not some dramatic innovation in sentencing policy or a radical departure from what had happened previously. It was a restatement of what was often regarded as being accepted practice in both the youth and Crown courts.
<P>
When a more serious offence was being committed by the youth court to the Crown court because it was thought that the seriousness of the case warranted a longer sentence than the youth court could pass, other less serious offences were committed at the same time so that the court could take an overall view of the offender's offending and piecemeal sentencing and duplication could be avoided. That has been going on in the courts for rather a long time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department will deal with the issues regarding the courts, but as someone who worked with young people before entering Parliament, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the effect of delaying decisions because a more serious case awaited a decision, so that nothing much happened in respect of a youngster who was offending, was pernicious. It is a doctrine that causes all sorts of problems and fails quite seriously in its objective of preventing reoffending. I understand the heirarchy of seriousness to which the hon. Gentleman refers but the effect of the queueing system is appalling practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I agree with the Minister about that. It is important that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible. Any impediments that prevent that happening should be removed. As I think he possibly just accepted in his comments, when, as happened in the case of Khan, a more serious case is being committed from the youth court to the Crown court, it generally makes sense for the less serious offences to be committed at the same time.
<P>
I think the Minister would agree that it would make sense if it was a very serious case for the less serious offences to be committed at the same time. I think he would agree that if someone was charged with a serious offence like rape or wounding with intent, it would not make sense for the magistrates court to commit him to the Crown court and then start sentencing him for shoplifting or a bit of criminal damage in the youth court. He could start a sentence on that and then get a completely different and more serious sentence when he eventually arrives at the Crown court. I think the Minister would agree with me on that point.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No, I would not. Sometimes youngsters go through a pattern of offending which may have two or three roots, and different bits of the offending may be quite separate. What sometimes happens is that there is a committal on a charge that may be more serious. The outcome may be in doubt. The time scale may be longer and the whole situation becomes uncertain. Dealing with the lesser case more quickly can mean that some intervention and help to prevent reoffending can take place while the other case is waiting to be dealt with. I am dealing purely with the practicalities. Freezing the situation because the more serious case is going forward can result in spree offending by youngsters because no one is able to do anything. It is pernicious in its effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In the cases I have been talking about, serious cases of murder, rape, wounding with intent--
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> He would not be free.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> He is highly likely to have been remanded in custody. The Minister is thinking that if someone is being committed to the Crown court for burglary and there are other burglaries that can be dealt with earlier in the magistrates court they should be dealt with there. The Minister nods his head and I think that is what he thinks the clause is getting at.
<P>
If my understanding is correct, that is why we are going on a wild goose chase with the rule in the case of Khan. The Government are seeking to repeal section 37 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 which allowed youth courts to commit young offenders to the Crown court. If that is so, it will no longer be possible for a youth court to commit a young offender to the Crown court on an offence which is triable either way. Only the offences that are triable on indictment--the really serious offences such as rape, murder and so on--will be required to be committed to the Crown court.
<P>
I refer the Minister to schedule 10; there are looks of puzzlement in certain quarters, but my understanding is that the Government want to repeal section 37 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, which gives the youth court the power to commit to the Crown court. The clauses relating to detention and training orders give magistrates courts the power to sentence any young offender aged 17 or under to up to two years' detention. That being the case, it will not be possible for a youth court to commit an offender to the Crown court. There is therefore no point in the provision, except in cases which are indictable only, and in such serious, and rare, cases, as the Minister said, the young offender will be locked up anyway. In the run-of-the-mill case, it will no longer be possible to commit to the Crown court. We have gone on an extraordinary wild goose chase in discussing the provision.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I look to the Minister for confirmation that my understanding is wrong, because it will affect my view of the clause. I may have got it wrong, and misread the schedule and the clauses relating to detention and training orders, but if so the Minister will now correct me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The repeal of section 37 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 is purely consequential on our detention and training order, which will replace detention in a young offenders institution for 15 to 17-year-olds. In those circumstances it will be dealt with by means of the clauses relating to the detention and training order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is right; it therefore follows that the effect of repealing section 37 is that it will not be possible for the youth court to commit young offenders to the Crown court for offences because the power to do so is to be removed, as the Minister described. That is the effect, is it not?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let us consider what the clause does. Under subsection (2), when a case is committed to the Crown court for trial and there is an assumption that it is able to be committed, related matters can be committed to the Crown court at the same time. Unrelated matters can be dealt with in the youth court without delay, effectively, thereby--I hear what the hon. Gentleman says--reversing the Court of Appeal's decision in the Khan case.
<P>
The proposal also clarifies the fact that there is no obligation for the youth court to adjourn simply to tie up all outstanding cases against the young person that are before the court that can usually be dealt with immediately. The aim is to prevent the sort of circumstances in which the magistrates court could deal with some of these cases quickly but has to refer one of the matters to the Crown court. I hope that the proposal will enable some of the issues to be dealt with in the magistrates court at the earliest possible opportunity.
<P>
The amendment would put into the Bill the provision that although the court does not have to adjourn cases in those circumstances, it may do so if it is in the interests of justice. As drafted, the subsection does not limit the discretion of the court to adjourn in those circumstances; it merely removes the existing requirement to do so. In order to avoid unnecessary delay, adjournment must be limited to the circumstances in which it can be properly justified. That would, of course, include cases in which it is in the interests of justice to do so, so the amendment is unnecessary. We will examine the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman and consider the circumstances in which he has suggested that section 37 would apply.
<P>
We think that there can be a committal for trial. The clause is needed to deal with issues relating to Khan. We will examine the matter and other circumstances in which a young person might be committed to the Crown court. The aim is not to remove all the circumstances in which that might happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's considered and courteous response. He describes the amendment as unnecessary. However, not for the first time in history, an amendment has been described as such by a Minister when it matches what he seeks to achieve.
<P>
The Minister's answer was sensible--flexibility is important in these matters. The issue has nothing to do with the so-called rule in the case of Khan. Secretaries of State must be careful in passing comment on cases which come before the courts. They should not demonise those cases, but should do more research to discover what they involved. A Secretary of State should do that instead of introducing a clause that I believe is unnecessary.
<P>
We will have an opportunity to debate these matters further when we discuss clause 69(6). The subsection will enable youth courts to pass sentences of up to two years on offenders under the age of 17. The repeal of section 37 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 removes the power to commit offenders in that age group to Crown court. Therefore we are engaged in a wild-goose chase and the clause is redundant.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No, it is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister tell me whether my interpretation of subsection (6) of clause 69 is correct? Will magistrates courts be able to sentence young people for up to two years? Will they no longer have the power to commit to Crown court cases that are triable in either court?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> What I said previously was right. The clause deals with committal for trial, not sentencing. The hon. Gentleman's point is therefore not a good one. Has the hon. Gentleman given way or has he concluded his speech?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is offering an explanation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister has the Floor.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman chastised the Home Secretary for the way in which he put the matter. I have told him why the Home Secretary did that and I have explained how the clause deals with the issues. The clause will ensure that there are circumstances in which cases involving young people who have been charged with serious offences can be committed to the Crown court.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman makes heavy weather of the matter. He suggests that the Home Secretary has said things which he has not. He goes on to accuse the Home Secretary of getting things wrong. The amendment is unnecessary: it does not go to the heart of the issues that the Bill needs to address.
<P>
Our debate risks becoming all smoke and mirrors. Let us get to the point. We want to ensure that the courts have adequate powers to deal with young offenders. We want to ensure that the courts can commit young offenders to the Crown court, when that is necessary. We also want to ensure that youth courts can deal with young offenders at the earliest possible opportunity, when that is appropriate. The Bill will deliver those commitments and clause 44 is part of that delivery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Home Secretary made his speech, which is on the record in Hansard, as is the case of Khan. The two things are completely different. The Minister made a mistake in trying to put a gloss on the Home Secretary's remarks. A moment ago he said that clause 44(2) related to committals for trial. However, subsection (2) inserts a new section 3A into the 1980 Act. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A youth court shall not be required to adjourn any proceedings for an offence at any stage''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It refers to any type of proceedings. I shall not take the matter further because my amendment is trying to achieve the same end as the Government. I am pointing out to the Government--as Opposition Members are entitled to do--that Ministers should be careful what they say.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman and the Committee are in danger of trying to work out how many angels are dancing on a pin head. The best thing for the Committee to do is to move on. The hon. Gentleman's points are not dealing with the issue with which my constituents and those of my hon. Friends want us to deal which is how the Government are going to tackle youth offenders. His constituents are also concerned with such issues, so perhaps he should address himself to what we are really trying to do in the Committee and we shall progress further.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am talking about the contents of the Bill. It is not my fault if Ministers do not understand what is in the Bill. We had a multi-purpose answer and the Minister has made his points; I shall not make it more partisan. However, I ask the Minister to read the points carefully before we reach clause 69(6). The length of sentences passed on young offenders by youth courts is an important issue which should be fully debated, not covered up and pushed away in a schedule.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Powers of magistrates' courts exercisable by single justice etc</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 35, line 25, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 171, in page 35, line 26, after `peace' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`who is approved by the bench chairmanship committee'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Clause 46 authorises several powers of the magistrates' court to be exercised by a single magistrate and allows the Lord Chancellor to make provision--following consultation with the justices and justices' clerks for an area--for any of the listed powers to be exercised by justices' clerks in that area.
<P>
We accept the need for flexibility. The Government and the Committee will be aware of the work done by the Narey committee. If the Government have concluded that introducing greater flexibility will help to make the system more efficient and quicker, we must study any such proposal constructively. We also need to pay attention to the maintenance of standards and to ensure that change does not bring about any lowering of standards. That is an important consideration for us to consider properly.
<P>
Amendment No. 171 requires that a single justice of the peace exercising the powers set out in clause 46 should be approved by the bench chairmanship committee. Given that the justice of the peace will be exercising such important responsibilities on his or her own, as an individual rather than as part of the bench, we think that it is important that he or she should be an experienced justice of the peace in whom the bench chairmanship committee has confidence. We wish to explore that issue. I know that many magistrates are interested in the issue and are looking to the Government for an illuminating response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): I should like to add my support for amendment No. 171. As I understand my hon. Friend's comments, he is saying that in relation to the powers exercised by a single justice of the peace, the justice of the peace should be approved by the bench chairmanship committee. There is strength to his argument.
<P>
The Minister will know that one of the strengths of the lay justice system in this country is that, normally, three--sometimes two--justices from different backgrounds work together. Their strength comes from being three together. I do not mean to be unkind to the lay bench, but often the chairman on the day of a case is a strong personality and is very able, while the two wingers are less experienced. The stipendiary bench is different.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is a variety of strength on the lay bench, and strength and ability repose mainly in the chairman of the day. A chairman is chosen for his experience and ability, and is a person in whom one has great confidence. The wingers may have much less experience. The single justice who exercises the powers that are set out in the clause should be someone who not only inspires confidence but who is experienced and has some seniority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere rightly said that our proposals arose from the Narey review of delay in the criminal justice system. The clause intends to reduce delay and enable magistrates courts to operate more efficiently.
<P>
The clause would allow a single justice to exercise the listed powers of a magistrates court. Amendment No. 247 would require the powers to be exercised by a single justice, not a full court. Occasions will often arise for a full bench to use those powers, and it cannot be right to prevent a court from doing that. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Members for Hertsmere and for Woking (Mr. Malins) talked about amendment No. 171. The Government agree that only justices or, when appropriate, clerks, are suitably experienced. However, we do not believe that a statutory approval system for justices is necessary. No such requirement exists for the wide powers that can already be exercised by a justice sitting alone. We must consider the way in which courts operate in practice. The amendment is unnecessary, and I ask the Opposition to consider whether we can allow the good sense of the courts to ensure that the Bill is effected properly. We do not want to establish new mechanisms for approval. We think that the system can work efficiently without them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. I am sure that he appreciates our reasons for tabling the amendment. We do not wish to introduce any unnecessary bureaucracy or inflexibility into the Bill. I hope that those who administer the system will take the point. I have heard the amendment described as a proposal for quality control. I would not go that far. All our magistrates are of high quality, but those with experience and expertise should take on the important role for which the clause provides.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Woking is more experienced than me, and his comments were apt. I simply remind the Committee that some of the best goals are scored by wingers.
<P>
It has been worth exploring the points that we raised, and I hope that they will be borne in mind. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 399, in page 35, leave out lines 38 and 39.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 173, in page 35, line 42, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`with the consent of the accused'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is important that the arrangements by which youth courts operate are adequate to deal with the issues before us. We have concluded that the provisions in the clause are inadequate and we do not want to introduce legislation that deals improperly with the cases involved. Rather belatedly, we have concluded that paragraph (h) of subsection (1) serves no useful purpose. Therefore, amendment No. 399 will remove it.
<P>
The paragraph takes no account of the ``plea before venue'' provision introduced by section 49 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. It is impossible to proceed to deal with mode of trial on a fresh charge without first going through that procedure. The limited power that the paragraph confers is already enjoyed by single justices by virtue of section 18(5) of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980. It therefore follows that nothing is lost by removing it.
<P>
Amendment No. 173 would remove the condition that the defendant should consent to the extension of a custody time limit. It is true that the accused's consent is not a requirement for such an extension, but as the extension has the effect of keeping him in custody, we took the view that only a full court should decide whether a contested application for extension should be granted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am pleased to speak to amendment No. 173 after having had the benefit of the Minister's remarks. They make my task much easier. I was going to ask him whether it was not necessary for an accused to give his consent to a custody time limit being extended when applications are made before other courts. I think that the answer to that is yes, so I wondered why it should be different in cases before a single magistrates.
<P>
The Minister has answered my questions, and I am relatively satisfied with the answers. Therefore, I shall not seek to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> In the past day or two, I have had little chat about the clause with a clerk to the justices and with a metropolitan stipendiary magistrate. The clerk to the justices told me that he understood that the Government would remove paragraph (h) from subsection (1), and the Minister has just moved an amendment to do that. The clerk to the justices was disappointed by that because he thought that it would cause inconvenience if the prosecution altered the charge at the last moment. He thought that no injustice would be done by leaving the clause as it is. The Minister has answered that point by saying that paragraph (h) would add nothing to the existing power under section 18 of the Magistrates' Court Act.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere referred to custody time limits. The stipendiary magistrate told me that they were a matter for judicial decision and added--this is surely right--that some arguments are based on a misconception of the law. A defendant cannot consent to the extension of a custody time limit. Applications are often made on pragmatic grounds and that may lead to a short extension. However, the court must be satisfied that the Crown has acted with due expedition and that there is good and sufficient cause to allow the application. If the court is not satisified, it has the power to refuse the extension even though no objection is taken. I put that point to the Minister.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 175, in page 36, line 20, after `clerk', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`of at least five years' standing'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee will be aware that our discussions of clause 46 so far have centred on the powers that it would allow a single justice of the peace to exercise, which hitherto have been exercised collectively by a bench. Under subsection (2), rules could be made to allow a justices' clerk to do anything that the single justice of the peace could do under the new arrangements. Differing views have been expressed about whether a justices' clerk should be allowed to do all those things. Debates in the other place and elsewhere have focused on whether a distinction should be drawn between judicial and non-judicial acts. It would not be in order for me to pursue that line of thought too far at present, except to say that we think the Government would do well to listen to the views of the Lord Chief Justice on the subject.
<P>
The main thrust of amendment No. 175 is the need for experience on the part of the clerk who exercises the important responsibilities under the clause. The single justice of the peace in that position should be experienced and capable, and so should a clerk. Amendment No. 175 would simply require such a clerk to have five years' experience.
<P>
In exploring the issue by way of the amendment, we are not questioning the principle of extending the role of justices' clerks. The Narey report, to which I have adverted already, recommended that their powers should be clarified and extended, to give them non-judicial powers similar to those of their counterparts in family proceedings. The Committee will note the use of the word non-judicial.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I shall speak briefly. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Woking will, with his greater experience, speak with greater authority.
<P>
I was fortunate enough, when reading for the Bar in the late 1970s, to work closely with a fellow Bar student who was combining his Bar final studies with his period as the sabbatical president of the Justices' Clerks Society. I shall not embarrass him by naming him. He is a good friend and a good laywer, and I have no doubt that he made an excellent justices' clerk. I remember discussing with him some of the problems that he had seen as a magistrates' court clerk, when things went wrong. Subsequently, in practice at the Bar, I witnessed occasions when clerks--and I have the utmost respect for the best clerks--were over-enthusiastic.
<P>
It is crucial that any important matter should be dealt with by someone with long experience. This morning, the Minister said that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere should not interpret or misinterpret the expressions that crossed his face. I was reminded of the time when a colleague in my chambers got into serious trouble after an over-enthusiastic magistrates' court clerk alleged that he had been pulling faces of amazement at the magistrates when the clerk expressed views on serious legal matters. That made the front page headline in the Coventry Evening Telegraph. Again, I shall not mention any names, but the member of the Bar is now a successful and eminent QC. I have no doubt that the rather junior court clerk's comments did not hold him back.
<P>
Despite the fact that that example is slightly trivial, serious matters are involved. All of us who have practised in the courts for a number of years have seen things go wrong, and we need to build in safeguards. I have no doubt that the Minister will take my comments in the serious spirit in which they intended.
<P>
I hope that, if not today, the Government may on Report be able to accommodate my concerns, those of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and those that we are no doubt about to hear from my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. We have raised serious points that need to be addressed.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I speak narrowly to amendment No. 175, which mentions a clerk ``of a least five year's standing.'' I seek clarification from the Minister of exactly what is meant by a justices' clerk in the clause. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```justices clerk' has the same meaning as in section 144 of the 1980 Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to be sure what we are talking about. As I understand it, a justices' clerk must be a barrister or solicitor of at least five years' standing whose appointment is confirmed and approved by the Lord Chancellor. It is important to distinguish the justice's clerk from the clerk who often sits in court.
<P>
For example, there are only two fully qualified justices' clerks in Surrey. Most courts are administered by deputies. I will no doubt be corrected if I am wrong, but I do not think that deputies have anything like the appropriate qualifications. I will be much happier if powers are to be operated by a qualified barrister or solicitor--because of the rigorous process required and standards imposed--of five years' standing. It is important to get this point clear, but I believe that one cannot be a justices' clerk without being a barrister or solicitor of five years' standing.
<P>
I know that there are only two justices' clerks in Surrey. What happens in the other courts? Who is sitting there? I do not know--perhaps deputy clerks and others on the career ladder. Some of the powers are important. Will the Minister tell me exactly what is meant by a justices' clerk in the clause, and assure me that for the purposes of exercising any of the powers in the clause he will be only someone of five years' call, and so on?
<P>
I should like to raise other matters in relation to the clause that have not yet been debated, but perhaps they would be best raised under the clause stand part debate, Mr. O'Hara. I see that you are nodding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The Government believe that all clerks to justices would be suitable people to exercise the powers in the clause. We do not consider it necessary to impose a five years' standing rule on the justices' clerk. I hear what the hon. Member for Surrey Heath says--sometimes individuals may not be appropriate people to hold such powers. In his practice in court, as in mine, we come across individuals who ought to be subject to proper control by their professional organisation; that is how such professional control should be exercised. I accept that nobody appearing before a court wants to see the sort of trivial--to use the hon. Gentleman's word--behaviour that he described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the serious way in which he is considering the matter. May I ask him to comment on two quick points? I am sure that he will come to deal with the specific and important technical points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. Anyone with experience of the courts is always concerned about whoever is sitting as the clerk to the justices because of the enormous power that justices' clerks wield. They may be there simply to advise their justices on the law, but we all know that in practice they have a hugely important and influential role. In cannot accept that when things go wrong it can be left to the professional body, as the Minister argues. There are times when the restriction of someone experienced is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I agree that it is necessary to have someone who can properly exercise such powers. However, requirements such as the amendment proposes are unnecessary. Moreover, not all court clerks are suitable to exercise the powers in the clause. We considered whether to impose restrictions in addition to those already provided for in rule 4 of the justices' clerks rules of 1970. Factors such a professional qualifications, experience as a clerk or experience of working in court in another capacity could, perhaps be used as criteria for deciding whether court clerks are suitable. We need to preserve local discretion, which in many ways defines magistrates courts. We are not convinced of the merits of including prescriptive restriction in the Bill.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Woking has already said, subsection (5) refers to section 144 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. Section 43 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 specifies that five years' standing as a lawyer is required to be appointed as a justices' clerk. Section 45 specifies that some powers may be delegated in some circumstances. The functions of the justices' clerk, including, for example, giving advice to justices at their request, would be delegated only to people who were properly qualified to perform those functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The Minister is saying that the person who is to be given powers under that section--the justices' clerk--does not have to have the qualifications required to be a justices' clerk, namely five years' standing as a qualified lawyer. Such a person may be no more and no less than a trainee clerk who sits in court on that occasion. That trainee clerk has the power to go to the magistrate's retiring room with a copy of Stone's to advise the magistrate, who, having buzzed once, wants to know the law according to Stone's. In Surrey, there are only two justices' clerks; eight or nine courts will probably sit in one day, and each court might have two or three sittings. Even if both justices' clerks sit, they may cover only about one-fifth of the courts. The problem is that the quality of those who sit in the other courts may be variable: they are not qualified lawyers. Can people who will have some important powers under the clause be unqualified and of limited experience? If so, what requirement will be made of them?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No unqualified person of little experience will exercise those powers. The circumstances under which the powers would be exercised are amply covered by the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. I have already explained to the hon. Gentleman how that would operate. Section 45(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Such rules may also make provision to enable things authorised to be done by, to or before a justices' clerk . . . to be done instead by, to, or before a person appointed by a magistrates' courts committee to assist him.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The courts will not appoint a person with no experience or qualifications to do such a job. However, we do not want to impose restrictions such that a person would have to be in that job for five years before he or she could exercise that power.
<P>
It is necessary that the clerk to the justices should be satisfied that the person exercising the powers under the 1997 Act is competent, proper, professional and qualified. The hon. Member for Hertsmere appears to be worried that someone who is completely inexperienced and unqualified could exercise the powers. That will not happen. It would not happen in our courts today and it will not happen as a result of the Bill. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that a completely unqualified person will not be put in that position of responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Woking touched on some important points. The Minister referred to the need for the clerk to be satisfied about the person's experience, but we have to consider the question of how much experience would be necessary. However, although I still have some anxieties on the matter, in view of the lateness of the hour, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 36, line 20, leave out from `area' to end of line 23.
<P>
I can dispatch the amendment quickly. It relates to subsection 2(b), which allows different things to be done in different areas. I was intrigued by the subsection, but I am not satisfied with it and would like some further details about it. Will the Minister assure the Committee that high standards will apply in all areas?

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I should like to make a few general observations. As originally drafted, the Bill gave substantial powers to justices' clerks--we now know that that means unqualified persons. The Bill has been altered and it is now much better. During its passage through the House of Lords, many people contacted me, making the point that judicial functions should be judicially exercised. They should not be given over to clerks of the court. That provision has now been improved. I was told by one clerk that there had been rather a brouhaha--not his expression, but mine--about the whole issue and that the controversy over clerks conducting early administrative hearings was unnecessary.
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)--he is not a member of the Committee but was perfectly entitled to table new clause 10 with other of my hon. Friends--that some press reports in The Times two days ago and in The Daily Telegraph yesterday suggested that the Government may be minded to accept the amendment tabled by Lord Carnarvon in another place, which is similar to my hon. Friend's new clause 10, albeit slightly narrower. Have you heard, Mr. O'Hara, from the Ministers whether they intend to make any statement about that matter? If not, purely as matter of courtesy, will the Minister look into the matter and let the Committee know next Tuesday?
<P>
I should also like to investigate with the Committee Clerk the fact that I told the Table Office over a week ago that I wanted my name added to those of other hon. Members already recorded as proposing new clause 10. I do not know how long it takes for such matters to be attended to. Could the Clerk advise you, Mr. O'Hara, whether my name will appear as a proposer of that new clause?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That was a point made rather than a point of order, but I have been patient with the hon. Gentleman in hearing his point before making that ruling. Does the Minister wish to comment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. It may help to place the hon. Gentleman's remarks in context. I made it clear previously that we intended to keep the Committee informed of amendments. I have done so and have written as early as possible on every occasion. I also said on a previous occasion that we were considering what amendments might be tabled as a result of the undertaking given in another place. We are about to inform members of Committee on that matter, as I undertook to do.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have had enough on the dubious point of order. However, I can refer the hon. Gentleman to page 1095 of the amendment paper on which his name appears, but not in the first six.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I shall not detain the Committee too long.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Cran: </B>(Beverley and Holderness): Oh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend the Whip expresses disquiet at my previous comment, so I had better take a little longer for the sake of my career.
<P>
My friend the magistrates' clerk told me that the controversy over clerks conducting early administrative hearings was unnecessary, and he pointed out that that has been going on in several courts in the country--Bexley in particular--for several years without any criticism. The Bill puts them on to a proper footing. However, my friend the stipendiary magistrate expressed doubt--and I agree with him--about the provision dealing with the payment of costs out of central funds. I understand that that can still be dealt with by a justices' clerk.
<P>
My friend pointed out a long line of judicial decisions regarding payment out of central funds. In relation to the end of a trial, the only tribunal able to deal with the matter is the bench that acquitted the defendant in the first place, as reasons may have emerged during the trial that would make the award inappropriate. It would be right for the Minister to acknowledge that point.
<P>
Finally, subsection (4) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Lord Chancellor shall consult justices of the peace''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for a particular area. I hope that there is no prospect of the provisions being implemented differently in different areas. It cannot be right that the law would work one way in my constituency in Woking, but not in my neightbour's constituency in Guildford. There could be such variety of practice, which would be extremely disappointing. If Parliament decides that the law should be as proposed in the Bill, it is not acceptable for justices of the peace to vary it, so to speak, from area to area. The point about whether there will be uniform practice across the country is important, so I hope that the Minister will consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about different areas dealing with issues in different ways. There is an honourable tradition or magistrates' courts doing things in slightly different ways--always, it is hoped, within the law. I hope that they have been doing it properly and accordingy to the law in Bexleyheath or Bexley.
<P>
We want to see how the new powers will operate in practice, so we are piloting them. We also want to ensure that before introducing them in particular areas we consult, as subsection (4) states.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``justices of the peace and justices' clerks for that area.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said, to enable the smooth entry of such powers into the judicial process, we shall pilot them. I anticipate that if they are piloted properly, we shall merely refine the rules so that they operate much more effectively when they are expanded to other areas.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 178, in page 37, line 11, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(d) if the court for any reason is unable to determine the eligibility of the accused for legal aid the court shall appoint a date for the determination of the eligibility of the accused for legal aid which, unless the court directs otherwise, shall be not later than the first sitting of the court after the hearing''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 47 concerns the procedure for granting legal aid. We are aware that the question of legal aid is often a cause of delay. The Narey review, under the previous Government, which was published last year, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Legal aid is a significant cause of delay because the process of applying for it is complicated and bureaucratic, and because it fails to provide an incentive for the defendant not to waste time.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Members of the Committee have mentioned their visits to youth courts and their experience of youth justice. My experience is not so extensive, but I visited a youth court fairly recently in one of our major cities and spoke to an experienced clerk, who expressed the same view as that set out in the Narey review, that there are often problems with granting legal aid, which can lead to delay. We welcome any steps that are taken to improve that position.
<P>
The Narey review made proposals and we are sympathetic to attempts to tackle the problem. The amendment simply requires that when there is a problem with legal aid, the issue should come back to the court at the earliest possible opportunity. We want the question to be resolved quickly so that it does not hold up the rest of the proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My concern about the amendment is that it will create not the opportunity for speed but further delay because it is often in the interests of defendants to seek to delay the time when justice will be done. If opportunities are provided for them to seek a further hearing and the court has to find the opportunities for that hearing, it is a good excuse for them to seek to postpone the evil day--or the just day as we might describe it--when they will have to come before the court to have their case heard and, if they are found guilty, to be sentenced.
<P>
The amendment appears to give the opportunity for further delay. I understand perfectly why the hon. Gentleman is concerned that legal aid issues sometimes produce problems for the courts. The court may not be able to determine legal aid at the first hearing as at that stage the defendant may well not have produced the means of providing evidence of his income and so on. The intention is that eligibility should have been sorted out by the time the defendant next appears and when he should have seen a lawyer.
<P>
We are not persuaded that there would be any advantage in arranging an additional hearing, putting extra pressure on court time and making it more difficult for the courts to deliver justice speedily, merely for the purpose of determining issues relating to legal aid. These matters are normally dealt with fairly quickly by the court at the first hearing. The evidence in relation to the income is dealt with subsequently by the administrative procedures in the court.
<P>
It is better that it is done in that way. If there are problems and the defendant has not secured legal aid, it might be right to bring the matter to the notice of the court. The prime objective should be to ensure that these cases are heard speedily and that justice is delivered as quickly as is proper. I cannot see anything other than delay resulting from the amendment. I accept that it is put forward for good reasons but in practice it would cause us substantial problems.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> There is common ground between us on this issue. We all want to avoid unnecessary delay. Without arguing the point at any length, I have to say that I was not convinced by the Minister's interpretation of the amendment. The amendment applies in cases where
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the court for any reason is unable to determine the eligibility of the accused for legal aid.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was simply to prevent legal aid applications being kicked off into the long grass and causing delays. The amendment provides that if there is such a problem the matter should come back to the courts at the first possible opportunty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> It is for the defendant to show that he is eligible for legal aid, not the court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is not what the amendment states. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the court for any reason is unable to determine the eligibility of the accused for legal aid''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is designed as an assistance, and we hope that courts will determine matters speedily, as the Minister says, and that if there is a problem it will be dealt with at the next available opportunity. I would have thought that was a reasonably commonsense proposition. I do not want to argue the case at this late stage. The Minister knows what I am getting at. We share the Government's objectives on this, which are in common with the objectives which were set out in the Narey report of February last year. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>No commital proceedings for indictable-only offences</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): I beg to move amendment No. 419, in page 38, line 43, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(11A) This section applies only if a person is legally represented unless--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) he applied for legal aid and has not given a reasonable explanation for why documentation supporting his statement of means cannot be provided and the application was refused on the ground that it did not appear his means were such that he required assistance; or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) having been informed of his right to apply for legal aid and had the opportunity to do so, he refused or failed to apply.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister may outline it for us, but my understanding is that at present if someone is unrepresented in a magistrates' court the magistrates would have to satisfy themselves that there was a case to answer before referring it on. Under the new fast-track procedure, the case would go straight to court. The onus would then be on the defendant to apply to the court to have the case dismissed for lack of evidence.
<P>
Such people would be well advised to take legal advice. Indeed, they will be in need of legal advice unless they practise themselves, or represent themselves, or are capable of informing themselves on how the process operates. However, the process will be complex and most people will be better off being represented. That will ensure that their legal rights are protected and that they achieve what they want from the courts.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Before using the fast-track procedure, the courts should be satisfied that people have not taken legal advice for want of means. The courts should be certain that people have gone through the proper processes to claim legal aid and that they have been found not to be in need of it. They might have enough money, and, therefore, can afford their own legal representation but have chosen not to seek it. Those who do not have the means to employ legal representation must not be denied the chance to have their case struck out at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The amendment would prevent a defendant from being sent to trial to the Crown court under clause 48 if he is unrepresented, unless he is, in effect, unrepresented by choice. It is in everyone's interest that a defendant facing an indictable only charge should have access to legal advice, but delaying sending a case to the Crown court until means inquiries have been carried out would be inconsistent with the objective of clause 48.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the purpose of clause 48. It is not a matter for the magistrates court to assess the prima facie nature of the case, but merely to commit the indictable only charge to the Crown court at the first proper opportunity. The aim is to get indictable only cases into the Crown court as quickly as possible and to ensure that defendants are dealt with more quickly than now.
<P>
The amendment would provide defendants who wish to delay the progress of their case with substantial extra opportunities to do so--and, all too often, defendants wish to do so.
<P>
The solution is to enable the magistrates court to deal with the grant of legal aid on the basis of a preliminary assessment of means, where appropriate, and then to send the case straight to the Crown court. The magistrates court will then conduct a full assessment of needs. Paving amendments to the Legal Aid Act 1988 have been drafted to that end.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith Is it the Minister's contention that, under the current system, magistrates do not consider whether there is a case to be answered before referring the case if someone has no legal representation?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Under the current system, they can do that. Under the Bill, such matters will be transferred to the Crown court.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> That is precisely why I moved the amendment. Under the current system, those who do not have the means to take legal advice will be denied the same access to justice as those who have the means because magistrates can strike out such cases. They have the legal training necessary to consider the evidence and take that decision.
<P>
The clause will change the system, so that the onus will be on the defendant to establish that the case need go no further and to have it struck out by the court at the earliest opportunity. That normally requires legal expertise. Therefore, if the provisions of the clause are invoked, people will have to wait until they can find the means before they can have the charge taken off them. The court case of bail conditions will hang over them until they can find the means to have them removed.
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, the clause would not apply to such people until they obtained legal aid. Therefore, the current system would apply and the magistrates would consider the evidence to determine whether the case should go to the Crown court.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the purpose of the regime. At the first hearing, the magistrates' court will transfer to the Crown court the indictable only case. Whether there is a prima facie case is not decided at that stage. That may or may not be an issue for the Crown court at a later stage; it depends on the way in which the procedures operate. The aim of the provision is that indictable only cases should be transferred, when possible, into the Crown court at the first hearing.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I am still concerned that the Minister has not accepted that the provision would change the nature of the law that is available to people, depending on their means. Under the present system, if people do not have the means, they benefit from the magistrates looking at the evidence. We want to protect people by allowing that to continue. Under the new system, if people have the means, they can use the legal process by applying to the courts to have the case struck out.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman still misunderstands the system. Whether or not someone is represented legally, the case will be transferred to the Crown court. The issue of whether the circumstances of legal representation would put them in a stronger position to prevent that from happening does not arise. People will be in exactly the same position whether or not they have legal representation.
<P>
There may be other reasons why a person may want legal representation, such as bail and so on, but, on the issue of a case being transferred to a Crown court, I am at a loss to understand why the hon. Gentleman's argument would make much difference.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Because someone with the means could use legal processes to apply to the Crown court to have the case struck out at the earliest opportunity, so that it was no longer hanging over him.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If someone has the means, he may make such an application in due course in the Crown court. When the case comes before the magistrates court at the first hearing, the court will make the procedural decision that the matter is an indictable only matter and transfer it to the Crown court. The issue is straightforward; it is not a matter for great debate or for hearings that might involve lawyers.
<P>
When the case is transferred to the Crown Court, the question whether or not there was a prima facie case could be raised. At that point there may be a reason for the person to have a lawyer, but that will not interfere with the issues raised at the first hearing. The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the purpose of the Bill. It merely administratively transfers the indictable only case to the Crown court. It is not a matter for debate whether it should be transferred. It is not a matter for the defendant's lawyer to argue against. Nor is it a matter for prima facie issues or for evidence in the case to be challenged or debated. The issue is administrative.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The Minister has failed to understand the purpose behind our amendment. I am disappointed that there will be a change from the current system, whereby if people are unrepresented at the second hearing at the magistrates' court, the evidence will be looked at by the magistrate to see if there were a case to be answered.
<P>
Under the clause, all cases will go to the Crown Court. However, someone with means could seek to use his legal representation to attempt to remove it quickly from the Crown court and stop it hanging over him. Perhaps the Minister could correspond with us on how he envisages such procedures working. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I want to explore one or two matters relating to schedule 3. Clause 48, to which schedule 3 relates, provides that an adult who is charged with an offence triable only on indictment shall be sent by the magistrates court to the Crown court forthwith, without committal proceedings. That means that the defendant will not have the opportunity to test the prosecution case in committal proceedings in a magistrates court to discover whether there is a case to answer. That is all well and good, and I do not seek to challenge it. But schedule 3 gives the defendant the opportunity to apply to a Crown court judge for the case to be dismissed after it has been sent to the Crown court. I am particularly interested in the procedure that will be followed in such cases.
<P>
Paragraph 2 of schedule 3 allows such a person to challenge the charges on which he has been sent to the Crown court. Sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) set out the procedure to be followed. The important point is what will happen as a result of paragraph 2(4) and I should be grateful for the Minister's guidance on the matter. Paragraph 2(4) states that oral evidence--
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman please state precisely which part of the schedule he is referring to?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am referring to paragraph 2(4) of schedule 3, which states the procedure that is followed when a defendant applies to the Crown court to have dismissed the charges for which he has been sent to the magistrates court. Paragraph 2(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Oral evidence may be given on such an application only with the leave of the judge or by his order; and the judge shall give leave or make an order only if it appears to him, having regard to any matters stated in the application for leave, that the interests of justice require him to do so.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to know what evidence may be given. Is it the evidence of the defendant, or of the prosecution? Can the defendant require prosecution witnesses to attend, if the judge gives his permission? If the defendent challenges the prosecution evidence, will it be possible for the judge to require prosecution witnesses to attend on such an application if the judge thinks that it is in the interests of justice to do so? I assume that that is what the proposal means, because in this sort of case there is not much point in the defendant giving evidence unless the prosecution can be called too. What is the Minister's view? He is nodding his head, so I take it that it will be possible in theory for prosecution witnesses to be called to give evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is a possibility if it is in the interests of justice for the judge to require it. I shall explain the matter at greater length in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is my understanding of the proposal. I accept entirely what the Minister said. He is right to emphasise the concept of ``in the interests of justice''. What I am talking about is probably unlikely, but we must always deal with what is possible when discussing the provisions because they have important implications.
<P>
It is possible when a defendant challenges a case that has been sent to the Crown court that prosecution witnesses can be required to attend in front of a judge. Their evidence may be challenged if the judge thinks that it is in the interests of justice to do so and he gives his leave. I imagine that the provision applies to any type of case. If that is so, I have some concerns about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Just to let the hon. Gentleman know, the proposal is modeleld on the serious fraud trials. We are simply transferring the issues relating to section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 to these provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I suspect that that might be true. It was part of the basis of my original assumption that it would be possible for prosecution witnesses to be required to attend court, with the leave of judge, if the judge thought it was in the interests of justice to do so. I imagine that the judge will read the papers in the case and the defendant may make his submissions and possibly give evidence. It would be rather meaningless unless the defendant had the opportunity to test the prosecution case if, in the judge's decision, it was in the interests of justice to do so.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am thinking not of serious fraud cases, but of sexual cases. It is important that we consider how many times it is possible for a complainant to be required to give evidence. It is probably very unlikely that any judge would give leave or consider it to be in the interests of justice for such a complainant to give evidence, but we do not know. Also, we do not know what the judge will hear from the defendant. The defendant might say that it would be in the interests of justice for the complainant to be required to give evidence.
<P>
We know of some defendants--there are not many, but there have been cases--who are extremely resourceful and devious people and who will go to any lengths to drag the complainant through the court. Such people could put up a convincing case as to why it would be necessary--or fair, as they would have it--for the complainant to be required to attend at court to give evidence at such proceedings.
<P>
The Minister will probably tell me that it would be very unlikely and would be in the realms of possibility only. However, we must cater for every possibility. Whether any such case materialises, it is important to recognise that there is such a possibility. Complainants often ask, first, whether it will be necessary for them to give evidence in court. If it will be necessary, they then ask how many times they will have to give evidence. If a complainant asks that question of a relevant person dealing with the case, such as a police officer, that person will have to say truthfully that it is unlikely, but possible, that the complainant could appear twice. Such an answer might have a material effect on many complainants.
<P>
It is all in the realms of possibility, but the sort of men whom we are discussing can be very devious and resourceful, and will go to great lengths to get at the complainant. If those men knew of a procedure such as that which is proposed, I suspect that some might relish the opportunity to bring the complainants to the court, give them a dress rehearsal before the main event and try to deter them from giving evidence at the main event, when the case is due to come for trial. That was my concern when I read the clause, and I ask the Minister to examine the issue.
<P>
The Minister will tell me that it is all in the realms of possibility, but, unless he can tell me that it is legally impossible for the complainant in a serious sexual case--especially a rape case--to be required to give evidence in this context, my concerns will persist.
<P>
I hope that I have put my point sufficiently clearly. I feel strongly about it. The Committee knows the general background and we shall be returning to the matter in other forms later on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My concerns are slightly different. They relate to costs and time. We are saying that there will no longer be what we used to call the section 6(1) committal--the contested committal at magistrates court level. It is goodbye to those. One must now have the same attack when one reaches the Crown court and have a similar procedure before a judge; I think that that is what is being said at the moment. If that is right, what about the cost implications? The average cost of the Crown court per day, as at December 1997 and as revealed to me in a parliamentary answer, was approximately &#163;7,800. The average cost of a magistrates court per day is considerably less.
<P>
It is well known that anything that takes 10 minutes in the magistrates court takes 10 hours in the Crown court. If we will be saying goodbye at the magistrates court level to contested committals on indicatable only offences--for example, section 18 offences--and hullo to the same thing in the Crown court before a judge sitting alone, in court rather than in chambers, will not that move more work to the Crown court and cost more and take more time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I shall deal first with the points raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, with which I have a degree of sympathy. The aim of the provision is severely to circumscribe the circumstances in which such hearings will take place. Paragraph 2(4) of the schedule requires that ``the interests of justice'' must always be paramount in the judge's consideration before he allows such a hearing to take place.
<P>
Lord Denning said, ``If we have to trust anyone, trust the judges.'' We put them into positions of authority to ensure that the interests of justice are served. They often have to take enormously difficult decisions in which they must balance the needs and interests of the victim with those of securing justice in our criminal courts.
<P>
It may sometimes--extremely rarely, I hope--be right that evidence should be given by a victim in such a hearing. The schedule 3 procedure is similar to that used in the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The hon. Member for Hertsmere did not enter the House of Commons until 1992, but the 1991 Act was passed by a Conservative Government. No doubt, some cases that fall under that provision will be sexual cases, and may even involve children, so section 53 and schedule 6 of the 1991 Act will be relevant to hearings in such cases.
<P>
We must ensure that the opportunities that the old-style committal, as it was called, provided to the defendant to cause great delays to cases are no longer available to him. That is why the judge must primarily consider the interests of justice. He should not allow hearings to take place if they are unnecessary--if they are merely a delaying tactic or to see whether the witnesses for the prosecution will turn up. Such delays, which involve setting aside a substantial amount of court time, should not occur.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking's concern about moving from old-style committals in the magistrates' court, which are less expensive hearing for hearing than those in the Crown court, is legitimate. The aim of the provisions of schedule 3 is to hold fewer such hearings, and to ensure that the opportunities for delay will be much more constrained. As we are giving the judge an obligation to consider the interests of justice before allowing such a hearing, it is right that that power be given to the Crown court, rather than the magistrates' court. I note that the hon. Gentleman is nodding at that.
<P>
We are circumscribing the opportunities and seeking to put the decision-making power in the right place. The aim is not to cause delays or extra cost; on the contrary, the provisions will save both costs and time, and meet the interests of justice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said; he has confirmed what I originally believed. What he has said is all perfectly sensible and all very well, but my concern has increased. I make no party point; on this issue, events have moved on, and we must all look for a way of dealing with the problem of defendants who seek to cross-examine their victims in person and to put them through a terrible ordeal. I may very well be wrong about this, because I have not researched it, so I hope that I will be corrected if I am wrong, but I believe that under current law witnesses are not called to give evidence in person in contested committals. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department is nodding. Prosecution witnesses are not required to go to court and they are not required to be cross-examined. The committals are carried out on the papers, by the examination of statements that have been tendered.
<P>
The Minister looks puzzled, but he agreed with me a moment ago. Will he make plain his disagreement if I am wrong about such an important proposition? It follows that under the current law a defendant in such a case has only one opportunity to cross-examine a complainant, and that is in the course of the full trial. The Minister is receiving further and better particulars about that.
<P>
Although the scenario that I have described may, as the Minister says, be in the realms of the unlikely, it is possible. Under this procedure it will be possible for the defendant to have a second opportunity. The Minister cannot tell me that it is impossible for a complainant to be required to give evidence under such a procedure.
<P>
The Minister was perfectly correct in what he said about the interests of justice. He knows that the judge must examine the interests of justice from both sides. He will have to consider the defendant's submission and what the defendant says about the prosecution's evidence. Earlier I described the sort of men who are involved in such cases, the defence that they are likely to put up, and the lengths to which some of them will go to put their victims through an ordeal. The Minister's point about the interests of justice only exacerbates my worries. The interests of justice oblige the judge to give the defendant a fair hearing. We know what some defendants will get up to.
<P>
Will the Minister examine the matter? There may be only one case which arises or one complainant who has to go through such an ordeal. In my view, such an eventuality is undesirable and it would be better if it were impossible.
<P>
The world would not come to an end if the Government were to examine paragraph 4(4) of schedule 3 and make it impossible for a complainant to give evidence. Once is quite enough for such a complainant to give evidence, in a full trial. I do not see what the Government will lose if they make a minor change that might spare some individuals a great deal of heartache. We would welcome a little flexibility from the Minister, and ask him to recognise these entirely legitimate concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know that we are anxious that the interests of justice should be served. Those interests cannot be served by putting the victims of serious sexual crimes through unnecessary questioning in the Crown court or elsewhere. Victims should be questioned only when it is absolutely necessary and in the interests of justice. We want to ensure that that rule will prevail. We have sought to get the balance right in schedule 3.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman seeks to create circumstances in which judges are not allowed to do what they believe is in the interests of justice. The schedule creates a balance which enables the judge to consider the issues and will allow such a hearing to take place only if it is necessary and in the interests of justice.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 421 and question the logic of the clause. In what circumstances do the Government envisage the new bail condition would be used?
<P>
How would it be enforced, and what benefits would it bring? What assessment have the Government made of its impact on the relationship between a person accused of an offence who has been placed on bail and his or her legal representative? I ask that question with particular reference to people who want to defend themselves, but who would be required to seek legal advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised some important points, which deserve consideration. Perhaps he would consider allowing me to write to him on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful for that offer and I shall take the Minister up on it. We shall explore the matter further in correspondence, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<UL>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 51 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>

<P>
Further consideration adjourned.--[Jane Kennedy.]
