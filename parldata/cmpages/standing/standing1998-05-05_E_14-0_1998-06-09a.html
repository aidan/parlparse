<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Last week, on clause 63, we debated the foreign earnings deduction to allow those people who were abroad for more than 365 days not to pay tax. The Government showed no interest in amending the provision. We have now received dramatic confirmation of our argument because the Rolling Stones have cancelled their British concerts. That has not gone down well in the entertainment world or among their many fans.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> What is the point of order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I want to give you the background to it because you did not attend all our debates.
<P>
Last week, we explained that the provision would be to the detriment not just of big-time entertainers but, more specifically, of those who work for them. In light of the dramatic confirmation of the validity of our argument, will it be in order for us to return to the matter on Report? I know that the selection of amendments on Report is in the hands of Madam Speaker, but obviously you, Mrs. Dunwoody, will have some influence. Will it enhance our cast to debate this further in light of subsequent events?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has been here a long time--indeed, members of his family served here before him--and he is well aware of the rules. He knows that, happily, on top of all the other problems faced by the Chairman of a Finance Committee, deciding what amendments to select on Report is not one of my duties, for which I thank God.
<P>
Clause 90 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Approved retirement benefits schemes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary of the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 184, in page 251, line 49, after "court;" insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"() by virtue of section 3, 4 or 29 of the Pensions Act 1995 or Article 3, 4 or 29 of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (prohibition, suspension or disqualification);".
<P>
</UL></FONT>I welcome you, Mrs. Dunwoody, to another week of the Finance Bill. I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) has not managed to get any satisfaction this morning.
<P>
The amendment is technical. It will put beyond doubt the ability of the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority to impose sanctions on Inland Revenue appointed independent trustees, commonly called pensioneer trustees. Indeed, pensioneer trustees who fail to carry out the requirements of the Pensions Acts 1995 will be the subject of a number of our debates this morning.
<P>
An important feature of our measures to prevent trust busting is that the managing trustees of a small self-administered pension scheme should not be able to force out the scheme's pensioneer trustee. Paragraph 7 of schedule 15 overrides the rules of existing approved schemes so that, with limited exceptions, a pensioneer trustee can be dismissed only if immediately replaced by another such trustee.
<P>
The existing exemptions are when a pensioneer trustee dies, acts in a fraudulent way or is released by a court order. To make it clear that OPRA's powers are not affected by the scheme rule override, the amendment adds a further exception to enable a pensioneer trustee to be removed when OPRA uses its powers to prohibit, suspend or disqualify a pensioneer trustee from acting as a trustee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): The Economic Secretary seemed to refer to pensioner trustees, but the explanatory notes say "pensioneer trustees". Perhaps her accent confused me, or perhaps the explanatory notes are wrong.
<P>
I think that we support the amendment. However, will the Economic Secretary clarify whether it will make trust busting more or less difficult? It appears again to widen the range of possible exemptions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> My understanding is that the amendment will make trust busting more difficult, and it will tidy up a particular aspect of the schedule that relates to the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, and I can assure him that we intend to limit the options for trust busting.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I beg to move amendment No. 211, in page 252, line 9, after "termination" insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(d) where the trustee whose appointment is terminated has resigned in circumstances when such trustee has secured the agreement of the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority to exercise its powers of appointment (and the terms thereof) in favour of another trustee and such appointment takes place within 30 days".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 210, in page 252, line 21, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7) In section 612(1) of the ICTA 1988, after `(b) in relation to any employer, includes a person who is to be or has been an employee' the words `and (c) provided that no person whose responsibilities and remuneration have substantially diminished shall be regarded as continuing as an employee by virtue of their remaining a director of the company'".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I shall speak first to amendment No. 211, which is distinct from No. 210.
<P>
As our support for the previous amendment should demonstrate, Opposition Members do not want to see so-called trust busting, whereby those who have used the advantages of this country's pensions savings system then take their savings abroad and do not pay any tax.
<P>
However, the Government have gone too far. As the notes on clauses explain, the Government are rightly targeting the directors of such companies, who are the prime movers behind trust-busting schemes. Typically, such a director initiates the moves that strip a company's assets, removes the outside pensioneer trustee, and then disappears without trace. We have no problem with the clause's impact on such directors. Even after leaving the country, they are likely to have some assets here. The Inland Revenue will be able to pursue such people and ensure that tax due is properly paid.
<P>
However, members of OPRA have drawn the Government's attention to a particular problem. The Government say that, where there is a lock on small, self-administered pension schemes, the pensioneer trustee may not resign. It is true that pensioneer trustees might want to resign for bogus reasons. They might attend a meeting with executives who intend to export their pension funds, feel insulted by that, and resign in protest. Nevertheless, they might resign for genuine reasons. They might find the behaviour of the company's directors and other trustees unacceptable. Cases may arise where a pensioneer trustee who is acting in a professional capacity is not in receipt of fees for a long time.
<P>
The right of pensioneer trustees to resign is fundamental. Otherwise, they may be put in a very awkward position. The amendment would create an additional mechanism whereby trustees could resign, and whereby the powers granted to OPRA by the Pensions Act 1995 to impose a professional pensioneer trustee of last resort could be exercised. When professionals in such a position felt unable to carry on, they could appoint through their own organisation such a trustee of last resort, and could line up OPRA to exercise its powers. That would enable them to resign from their post and the pensioneer trustee of last resort to be substituted.
<P>
That would not breach the Government's intentions, but the pensioneer trustees of those fairly small pension schemes would not feel that there is a ball and chain round their ankles with no way out even when they have legitimate reasons for wishing to get out of their responsibilities and resign from their post. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would deal with that matter before we discuss amendment No. 210.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The two amendments have been called together.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Amendment No. 210 covers different country and should not be a problem for the Economic Secretary. We have had a number of debates on the way in which the Government are using secondary legislation to get their way with barely a passing reference to the House. The amendment refers to cases in which even Ministers are not given a passing reference to what the Inland Revenue is doing.
<P>
The practice of the Revenue has changed by stealth since its office at Thames Ditton, which used to deal with small self-administered pension schemes, was moved to Newcastle. Few employees made the move to Newcastle so a virtually new team was set up to handle those pensions and the circumstances in which people could retire and take the benefits for which they had saved under the tax rules at the time.
<P>
The long-standing interpretation of the rules under which directors who had retired could legitimately take out a tax-free lump sum had been a standard part of pension schemes across the board and millions of pensioners had taken advantage of that over the years. A company director who had spent most of his life building up the company might have retired six years ago and taken a lump sum payment. One case that was brought to my attention by an actuary constituent involved a lump sum payment of £100,000, which is a substantial sum. The directors may have had residual borrowing from the setting up of the business and that lump sum may have been his last chance to clear his debts and look forward to retirement.
<P>
Lump sum payments typically comprise one third of the total pension fund. For that director in his early 60s the remaining £200,000 might generate an annuity of only £16,000 or £17,000 a year, which is less than average earnings. We are discussing not the mega-rich, but people who have paid their way in society, made long-term plans for their retirement while building up a business--both Government and Opposition want to encourage that--and perhaps created employment at the same time. Six years later, out of the blue, the director may receive a tax demand from the Inland Revenue for £40,000; but that demand would be not just for £40,000, but for £40,000 plus interest, so it would be for more than £60,000. They received no indication that that sum might be demanded of them and they have no immediate means of paying it. Some of the people affected are now in their late 60s and early 70s, and I am told that this has been a devastating blow for them.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Why has it happened? It happened because, when management and assessment of the schemes passed to a new office in the Inland Revenue, the wording of the statute was revisited by Inland Revenue officers, who chose to interpret the wording differently. Their decision affects people who have stopped working for a company because they have retired, who may no longer receive any remuneration from the company at all, but who, in order to assist and show faith in a company--for small companies, continuation of service in that sense can be very important--are persuaded to remain on the board. In return for making the decision to support those who run small companies, individuals are now told by the Inland Revenue office in Newcastle that they have not retired at all.
<P>
Despite years of consistent previous practice, which accepts that people in such a situation have retired, suddenly the Revenue decides, without any word, warning, debate or apparent reference to the Ministers responsible, to issue tax demands to those individuals. As a result, an injustice has occurred.
<P>
It is quite wrong for people to be taxed out of the blue; it is quite wrong for the Inland Revenue to introduce a complete change of tack, which has now affected only those who retired six years ago, but the implication is that the Revenue has gone back six years because it is not allowed to go back any further. However, some people who retired five, four or three years ago, right up until the new practice came to light, will be caught by the capricious decision of the Inland Revenue to reinterpret legislation, entirely off its own bat, to suit its own ends.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Is not this an example worse than secondary legislation, and even worse than tertiary legislation? Inland Revenue guidelines are almost a new concept--a fourth tier of legislation, about which Parliament has no say. In fact, nothing is written down for parliamentarians to consider. The only reason why by hon. Friend the Member for Guidlford (Mr. St. Aubyn) is aware of it is because of correspondence and case work undertaken in his constituency. But for that, no parliamentarian would have been aware of this change in tax policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> My hon. Friend make the point well. This is not law making, it is pure, naked Executive power, exercised by those who believe that they are totally unaccountable to the House. That is why we must debate amendment No. 210, so that the Ministers who are responsible for the actions of the Executive can justify how this can be allowed, and so that they can come to the House and correct this abuse by the Executive, which is, no doubt, a result of the over zealous nature of those involved, who are keen to raise tax revenue for the country. That is their job, but it is why they must be controlled, and why we have a legislative process. That is why it is quite wrong for us to allow legislation to come into force--as we fear that we are doing in other parts of the Bill--which is open to reinterpretation by Executive fiat, so that it is possible for individuals to be penalised and persecuted by the tax code without any reference to Parliament. Where are such people to find the money?
<P>
That process and that interpretation of the tax law has stood the test of time. Under that system, many former directors of companies carried on offering moral support to their companies and they quite rightly enjoyed the pension benefits which they had been led to expect and which they fully deserved. Why is it fair that suddenly--with effect from six years ago--that group of retirees should now be penalised on a massive scale?
<P>
The Government's proposal is a smash-and-grab raid. Directors who retire today will be told, "Do not take that risk, do not trust the Revenue to play fair with you and do not take as a guide the way the matter was dealt with previously. Do not, indeed, rely on the Inland Revenue's citizens charter, which states that that change should not be allowed to go ahead." The Bill contains a real threat to the livelihood and to the retirement arrangements of those who retired during that six-year period. If the Government fail to remove that threat, they will send the message to all of us that, whatever plans we make for the long term, the Government reserve the right to change the rules and to take that money away at any time they choose.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It may help the Committee if I explain what a pensioneer trustee is and why they are needed. Pensioneer trustees are actuaries, solicitors or other pension professionals who are approved by the Inland Revenue to be an independent trustee of small self-administered pension schemes. Under an SSAP scheme, the beneficiaries are normally the controlling directors of the company that sponsored the scheme. The directors also act as scheme trustees and they have control over the scheme's assets and investment policies.
<P>
Obvious conflicts of interests can occur because the same people are, in effect, wearing different hats. Substantial amounts of tax relief are usually involved. It has usually been a tax-approval condition that an SSAP scheme must have a pensioneer trustee who is familiar with the tax-approval conditions. The role is therefore taken be a specialist. The aim is simply to ensure that the SSAP scheme is managed properly. That protects taxpayers' interests in the scheme by ensuring that they are used for genuine retirement provision, which means that they are in keeping with the conditions under which tax approval has been given.
<P>
The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority may appoint trustees only in specified circumstances, namely when they are meant to replace a disqualified trustee or a person who is prohibited from being a trustee by OPRA; ensure that the trustees as a whole have the necessary specialist knowledge and skill; ensure that the number of trustees is sufficient for the scheme's proper administration; or ensure that the scheme's assets are properly used.
<P>
Amendment No. 211 would mean that the outgoing trustee should negotiate with OPRA about the replacement. However, OPRA does not have the power to replace a trustee who has not been disqualified or prohibited for one of the reasons that I described. Given the role and purpose of pensioneer trustees, it would not be appropriate for them to have that power. OPRA's responsibility for the supervision of pension schemes is laid out in the Pensions Act 1995. A pensioneer trustee is appointed by the scheme's other trustees as a condition of that tax approval, as I explained earlier. Unless that trustee has committed a breach of trust, a suspected breach of the Pensions Act or has acted in a manner that is not in keeping with the Pensions Act, it would not be appropriate for the authority to become involved, either in the appointment or replacement of the pensioneer trustee. There is a flaw at the heart of the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Economic Secretary's argument might well have been appropriate until now. But the Government are saying that pensioneer trustees must resign of their own volition, which changes everything. The pensioneer trustees' rights are being removed, even though they are not the ones involved in trust busting or the saving of tax. That is a fundamental change, which the Economic Secretary's argument must address.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> There is no reason why the other trustees should not co-operate with the resignation of a[Mrs. Liddell]
pensioneer trustee and the appointment of another. If the relationship between the pensioneer trustee and other trustees has broken down, it is difficult to imagine a situation in which other trustees would not want to find a replacement as quickly as possible.
<P>
Assurances have in the past been given that pensioneer trustees would always have the option of resignation; they will not be dragooned into performing the role. The Revenue and the Association of Pensioneer Trustees have discussed ways to combat trust busting, and any perception of an assurance on this matter would be, to some extent, a misunderstanding of the nature of previous discussions.
<P>
I see the hon. Gentleman's point: pensioneer trustees might find that they are locked into undesirable situations. For example, their clients might fail to answer letters, ignore advice or--worst of all--fail to pay their fees. Such a situation could cause a degree of tension between the pensioneer trustee and the fund's other trustees. If such a dispute were to arise, and the pensioneer trustee wished to resign but the scheme would not allow it, the legislation would open the way for the courts to facilitate such a resignation. Furthermore, recourse to the courts might be the only way for the pensioneer trustee to recover unpaid fees.
<P>
The potential costs to schemes will, in practice, preclude them from obstructing the resignation of a pensioneer trustee. It is extremely unlikely that other pensioneer trustees will want to take on a troublesome scheme or one that had a history of being troublesome; it would be masochistic in the extreme. If a pensioneer trustee cannot resign because nobody is willing to take over his role, the courts can facilitate that resignation. The courts would almost certainly take due cognisance of the reasons for the inability to find a replacement when awarding any costs.
<P>
I shall now turn to amendment No. 210. First, I shall deal with the hon. Member for Guildford's point about Inland Revenue staff lacking experience, which he alleges is due to the transfer to--not Newcastle, as he said--Nottingham. I understand that all those people who live north of Watford fall into one amorphous mass, but we will perhaps discuss that after 4.30 pm tomorrow. A third of the executives and senior grades in the Revenue moved with the office, so there has been no loss of experience in relation to pensions. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary offered to address the specific constituency issue raised by the hon. Gentleman on clause 58 and the situation remains the same. The Financial Secretary or I will be more than happy to see what we can do to assist the hon. Gentleman on specific constituency cases, but the amendment would not achieve what he has described.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful for the offer of assistance for a particular constituency problem, but I would not have tabled the amendment simply to deal with a constituency matter. The amendment goes much wider than that. Articles in the specialist press reflect the concern that the measure will affect a large number of people.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The amendment would not achieve what the hon. Gentleman is seeking. Existing tax approval rules for occupational schemes allow benefits to be paid to an employee who has retired on reaching the pension age set out in the scheme rules or who has left employment after reaching the age of 50 or because of ill health. Long-standing rules relating to that have been in effect since 1970. They apply to all types of scheme member. Every Member of Parliament regularly comes across such cases.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that there has been a change of Inland Revenue practice. He is alleging that some people are being taxed on lump sum benefits that they have received from pension schemes, but tax approval rules have not changed. There is no change of practice. As he said, there has been some speculation in the press, but the press is not uniform in its view.
<P>
The Inland Revenue is responsible for applying the law as it stands, not for how others think the law should be applied. If taxpayers believe that the Revenue has made a mistake, they can appeal against an assessment. All Members of Parliament have had to recommend that people appeal to the Revenue on specific cases that they bring to us. Clear appeals procedures are in place for dealing with disputes on the meaning of the law. It is sensible to follow those routes if a taxpayer disagrees with the Revenue.
<P>
The issue is more straightforward than the hon. Gentleman suggested. It is a matter of whether a scheme has paid a benefit as authorised by its trust deed and its rules. If it has, the normal rules, including the provision of a tax-free lump sum, apply. If it has not, the unauthorised lump sum benefit is taxable. Basically, if a lump sum is authorised, the normal procedures apply; if it is unauthorised, it is taxable. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would not achieve what he wants because it would alter the statutory definition of an employee within the tax approval code. We are not dealing with a matter of statute but an interpretation of a scheme's trust deeds and rules.
<P>
In addition, the hon. Gentleman's proposed alteration of the definition of an employee would not be needed to change tax approval rules. Indeed, we authorised the Revenue to consult pensions organisations earlier this year on a proposal to allow pensions to be paid to people who have not yet retired but who wish to cut back on the number of hours that they are working. The Revenue is consulting on responses to the consultation. We will consider those responses, perhaps with a view to introducing new tax approval rules later in the year. It should be possible to do that by changing tax approval practice without amending the primary legislation that governs pension schemes.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but his amendment is misconceived. It is unnecessary and would not achieve its intended aim.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am a disappointed man. We voiced pressing concerns about two matters and there was an element of doublespeak in the way in which the Economic Secretary dealt with them.
<P>
The Economic Secretary said that no one might want to take up the post on a pensioneer trust, which would put the trust in an invidious position. There has been talk in the industry of promoting the idea of a pensioneer trustee of last resort. The Economic Secretary's unwillingness to contemplate that route is unsatisfactory. To say that the matter can be resolved through the courts means that pensioneer trustees whose relationship with other trustees breaks down will have to incur all the additional expense and risk of a court case in the hope that they get back their fees and some of their legal costs. As anyone who has gone to court knows, one does not get back all of one's legal fees, even if one wins every round of the argument. This is a highly complex area of law, and it is likely that such court cases will be highly complex and expensive.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's refusal to consider a simple mechanism that could alleviate the problem means that the beneficiaries of all of the pension schemes that will be affected by the clause will end up paying more. Pensioneer trustees will do what anyone in that situation would do--they will take out insurance to cover the cost of that eventuality. That insurance will have to be paid for, and the vast majority of law-abiding pension schemes will pay a significant penalty. The Government should accept this modest amendment, which would make the management of pension funds easier. The fact that they will not is highly regrettable.
<P>
We also heard some doublespeak on amendment No. 210. It was put to me in words of one syllable that no change of statute was involved. That is exactly the point. There has been no change in statute, but there has been a change in the way in which tax is assessed. The same statute has been interpreted one way, but it is now being interpreted another way.
<P>
The Economic Secretary suggested that those who felt aggrieved could seek a remedy by going through the courts. Again, that process is very complicated. As we saw in relation to other tax matters that we have discussed, including the Willoughby case, the Revenue has a policy of pursuing cases all the way to the House of Lords because it does not like to be beaten. A court case could take many years, but we are dealing with people who retired six years ago and who could be in their early 70s. They may have to spend their entire retirement worrying about their situation.
<P>
I have also heard that the Revenue has told some people that unless they accept the tax demand and pay up, the entire scheme under which they received the benefits will be disapproved. The threat of a massive tax bill, which might affect many other people who participate in the scheme, is being used against those who do not pay up and do as they are told. That really is the Executive leaning on the individual.
<P>
I have presented a perfectly acceptable--and proven--alternative route, which would save the taxpayer and avoid the need to go through the courts. The Government should cooperate and exercise their power to resolve the problem fairly. Does the Economic Secretary think it fair that a group of people who have retired during a six-year period should be treated differently in respect of their lump sum payments just because they remain nominally on the board of their companies? Is that fair when previously such people were not taxed?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> As I said earlier, the issue is whether the lump sum payments were authorised or unauthorised, and what is stated in the trust deeds and rules of the scheme. I do not think that I can say that more clearly.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am afraid that the matter goes further to those who are not in breach of the rules of their own scheme. The relevant sections of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and the definitions of "employee" and "director" are now being interpreted differently.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am trying to be helpful, but it is beginning to sound as though the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that trustees are entitled to ignore the rules of the pension scheme by paying out what benefits they like, when they like. Is that what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have not for a moment suggested that. I have suggested that in some cases trustees have made lump sum payments in the belief that they were entitled to do so under the trust deed and have then been told that the way in which the Inland Revenue interpreted the trust deed and the legislation meant that those lump sum payments were outside the terms of the scheme. It is open to the hon. Lady to answer the question about someone who is assessed for tax because he remains a nominal member of the board of the company. Should such a person be considered an employee under tax legislation?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Frankly, I can only tell the hon. Gentleman again that if trustees are not in breach of the scheme rules, no tax will be charged on the lump sum. The charge is made only if there has been a breach of the rules of the scheme. There has been no change in the interpretation of the rules and I would have thought that that was self evident.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I note that the Economic Secretary is not prepared to answer the simple point about the meaning of "employee". The Revenue claims to be the judge of whether there has been a breach of the scheme rules. I am not aware of any cases in which trustees have said that they have breached the scheme rules. They have been told by the Inland Revenue that they have breached the rules because the Inland Revenue decided that they had breached them. It is open to the Economic Secretary and her colleagues to rectify the position by giving clear guidance to the Inland Revenue on when and how it should interpret the rules of such schemes. It seems unjust that someone should be penalised for lending support to a company for which he worked for a long time and from which he has, de facto, retired. I invite the hon. Lady to say whether she agrees that it would be unjust for someone to be taxed in such a situation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman can invite to his heart's content. He is trying to arrange for people to be paid unauthorised lump sums and to avoid paying tax on them. If someone has a specific difficulty with an Inland Revenue ruling, there are appeal procedures. I venture to suggest that every Member of the House has[Mrs. Liddell]
recommended to a constituent at some point that those appeal procedures be used. Regardless of how many times the hon. Gentleman tries to ask a question, I hope that he is not suggesting that people should be able to make up the rules as they go along with a view to avoiding the tax to which they are liable if they breach the rules of the scheme of which they are a member.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I regret to say that the Inland Revenue has been accussed of making up the rules as it goes along. That is why the matter must be clarified. A letter from one of my constituents says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There must be hundreds of directors of plcs who have taken early retirement but who remain on the boards of their companies to give continuity at board level. Their retirement lump sums are at risk".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Economic Secretary has done nothing to reassure such people. On retirement, many company directors will cut all ties with their companies because she and her colleagues and executive officers would otherwise probably pursue them for sums unjustifiably demanded of others in the same position.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman persisting in his made?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I will beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If it helps the hon. Gentleman, I will allow a formal vote on amendment No. 210.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We would like that.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): We strongly support the Government's efforts to counter fraud and abuse, and to close tax loopholes. However, the severe penalties that schedule 15 will impose should be limited to cases of genuine abuse, and should not cover cases of what might be termed innocent error. For example, a director who retires early but who continues as a non-executive director would technically contravene pension scheme rules. Can the Economic Secretary confirm that, in such a circumstance, the draconian penalties will not apply?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> As I said to the hon. Member for Guildford, appeals procedures exist that cover cases where the rules have perhaps been misinterpreted. As the hon. Gentleman will know, it would be wrong of me to anticipate the conclusions of such procedures.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Let us be clear: is the hon. Gentleman moving both amendments? Does he wish to persist in amendment No. 211, and to take a formal vote on amendment No. 210?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We have gone as far as we can hope to--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not with to go over the debate. Is the hon. Gentleman moving or withdrawing amendment No. 211?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Benefits received under non-approved retirement benefits scheme</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Members of the Committee must not pass between the Member who has the Floor and the Chairman. I do hope that they remember that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I beg to move amendment No. 172, in page 74, line 41, leave out from "benefit" to first "the" in line 1 on page 75.
<P>
I fear that the excitement of debating my amendment is not enough for some members of the Committee.
<P>
The clause deals with the funded unapproved retirement benefits scheme, or FURBS for short--yet another acronym. In 1989, an earnings cap was placed on pension contributions. To facilitate the making of unapproved top-up schemes, the schedule E charge on employers' contributions was removed. The Government are trying to mess around with that.
<P>
A further effect of the clause is to raise the rate of income and gains on investments held by the trustees of a FURB from 23 per cent. to 34 per cent. There was no mention of that in the Budget announcement or press releases. Indeed, the change was sneaked out surreptitiously. Further to that, the change seems to be an accident. Some qualified expert tax accountants, in their inquiries to the Inland Revenue about the implications of the changes, were met with the response from senior Treasury officials of, "Oh, well I suppose it does do that, doesn't it?" It strikes me--the Minister's comment on this would be appreciated--that yet another possible effect of a clause in this Finance Bill has not been properly thought through.
<P>
FURBS have legitimately been used as a tax efficient way to reward senior employees who are approaching retirement. They have become increasingly widely used as goalposts have moved. When FURBS were introduced in 1989, the amount of pension contribution was increased on an annual basis in line with the retail price index. Of course, wage inflation has exceeded that for some time. In addition, employee mobility has also affected the number of people using the schemes. Initially, the pensions cap did not apply to employees who remained with the same firm. Ten years on, the number of employees who have moved firms is considerably greater and FURBS are an appropriate vehicle for those people.
<P>
As a result of the clause, companies will have to increase their contributions rapidly to avoid employees being substantially disadvantaged. KPMG, the expert firm of accountants that employed my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), calculates that the 44-year-old employee whose company contributed £15,000 per annum until his retirement at the age of 60, will now be at least £48,000 less well off on retirement.
<P>
Pension contributions are charged to tax under schedule E in the ordinary way--as a benefit in kind, as if the employee had benefited from the use of a company car. Lump sum payments attributable to employer contributions, on which tax has already been paid when payments were made into the fund, are not taxable. The clause--and my amendment--deals with non-cash benefits provided by FURBS and the way in which they are valued for tax purposes.
<P>
Section 596B of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 makes special provision for charging these non-cash benefits to tax and for their valuation. Clause 91 provides that the valuation basis should be the greater of the section 596B charge or the schedule E benefits in kind. In tangling with these provisions, the Revenue is trying to have its cake and eat it. The amendment would delete the schedule E valuation basis, so that the section 596B valuation basis would continue as before.
<P>
Will the Economic Secretary answer two straightforward questions? First, what is the practical difference between the valuation of non-cash benefits provided by FURBS under schedule E and the valuation rules under section 596B? Secondly--if she is paying attention--what is the purpose of the special rules in section 596B if the taxation basis will be that of benefit in kind according to schedule E?
<P>
This is a half-baked clause. It makes tax legislation much more complex than necessary. The Government have missed an opportunity to simplify already complex legislation--especially in relation to pensions--despite the fact that they are always speaking of the need for simplicity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton), who has raised some legislative points on details and technical matters. I hope that the Economic Secretary will address those serious points. I should also like to make some general observations about FURBS--funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes.
<P>
As my hon. Friend said, we have become used to having this kind of debate about the Budget. When we began the Committee stage, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said that the hallmark of the Budget was that much of what was in it was not in the Finance Bill, and that a great deal of what was in the Finance Bill never appeared in the Budget. This clause is a prime example of that. As my hon. Friend said, neither the Budget speech nor the press releases issued by the Inland Revenue immediately afterwards made any mention of FURBS. At the most, there was a general reference to the change in the capital gains tax regime for trusts. Although Inland Revenue press release No. 7 referred to the increase in the cap on earnings for approved pensions schemes; it made no mention of the changes to FURBS, even though they were highly relevant. It is hardly surprising that one accountant referred to the changes as a surreptitious tax raid.
<P>
The Government are introducing substantial changes to the tax regime without giving proper notice; that is being shown throughout our debates in this Committee. The full scale of the changes only becomes apparent when we crawl through the detail of the Bill.
<P>
The use of the word "unapproved" to describe these schemes might lead people to believe that they are in some way illegitimate. It is perhaps unfortunate that the word "unapproved" is used in that way because, in this instance, "unapproved" does not mean "disapproved". As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made clear, when the earnings cap was introduced in the 1989 Budget, the then Chancellor made it clear that he did not wish to discourage people from making additional pension arrangements above and beyond the earnings limit, although those who did so would not be subject to the same favourable tax regime that applied to approved retirement benefit schemes. Nevertheless, there would be some tax advantages. FURBS are a sort of halfway house.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government have now imposed a double whammy on firms. In the past few months, they have changed the national insurance contributions regime for firms, although there was some confusion about its implementation. The Secretary of State for Social Security originally announced, in July last year, that employers' class I national insurance contributions would become payable on FURBS contributions with effect from 6 April 1999. Then, a few months later, the[Mr. Whittingdale]
Contributions Agency issued a press release in which it announced that they had always been payable, but that it expected employers to comply by no later than 6 April 1998.
<P>
That first change certainly reduced the attraction of FURBS. Then, on top of that, the Government have announced a second hit in this Finance Bill, which will raise the rate of CGT from 23 per cent. to 34 per cent. For very high earners, FURBS may continue to have some small attraction. Certain tax advantages will remain. In particular inheritance tax will still not be payable on a lump sum cash payment if the beneficiary is deceased. However, for many medium-sized businesses that have taken advantage of FURBS, any attraction is now wholly removed and, as a result, the market in FURBS has almost entirely dried up.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would tell the Committee how many such schemes are in existence. What is her estimate of the tax lost that will be regained as a result of the measure? Has she carried out any analysis of the number of people who contributed to FURBS who have earnings above the cap; and the number who contribute to FURBS, not because they are extremely high earners but because they can see other tax advantages in doing so? I should be grateful for a few more details of that sort.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made clear, as a consequence of the measure, companies will be likely to have to increase their contributions to take account of the tax disadvantage. The example quoted by my hon. Friend, cited by KPMG, of a cost of £48,000 to someone whose company has been contributing £15,000 a year, is an indication of the scale of the potential cost of the measure. In the longer term, there will be other consequences. Payments may no longer be taken in this form, but may be taken as higher salary. Some people will decide to move from funded schemes into unfunded schemes, which carry no tax liability until the payment is taken, but which carry considerably higher risk.
<P>
The measure is slighly curious because it will discourage people from making pension provision. It applies to only a small number of people, but it seems to fly in the face of the Government's so-called commitment to the idea of stakeholder pensions and encouraging individuals to make provision for their retirement. Taken with other measures in the Bill, it will introduce uncertainty about the Government's intentions regarding long-term pension provision.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham complained that I did not hang on his every word. I cannot make notes and gaze lovingly at him at the same time, but I work hard to keep my attention on what he says, difficult though that is at times.
<P>
We have heard much about FURBS, which are not tax approved and are not subject to a special tax regime. The Government have never disapproved of FURBS--they are a legitimate way for employers to reward their staff with relevant benefits that are in excess of those that are provided by a tax-approved scheme. However, there is no reason why FURBS should have additional tax benefits. To go back to first principles, the amendment would limit the tax charge on the recipient of a non-cash retirement benefit to the cost to the employer of acquiring the asset in question, rather than basing the tax charge on the benefit's value when it is received.
<P>
The clause is far from being an accident--it is a mirror of the changes that are contained in clause 58 and in schedule 9, which relate to benefits paid after the termination of employment. Those changes mean that benefits will be taxed on receipt; they will not be treated as income from the year of termination, as they were previously. In some cases, the non-cash benefit could be worth more than it was worth at the time of acquisition by the employer--for example, if it was a work of art it could appreciate or depreciate in value--and it seemed only fair that the recipient should be taxed on the full value of the benefit to him or her.
<P>
As a Government, we believe in fairness. We believe that all post-termination benefits should receive the same tax treatment. That is why the clause precisely reflects the provisions of schedule 9, to which, I remind the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), the Committee has already agreed.
<P>
There is no logical reason why a non-cash benefit that is provided as part of a redundancy package should be valued for tax purposes differently from a similar benefit that is received under a non-approved retirement benefit scheme. However, that would be the amendment's effect.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford talked about raising the rate from 23 per cent. to 34 per cent. The Bill does not contain those figures and it does not specify the scheme's rate; it deals only with the valuation of benefits.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham suggested that a section 19 charge might differ from a section 596A charge. Subsection (1) deals with non-cash benefits, and the tax charge under section 19 is on the benefit's worth, which involves its current worth. By contrast, the tax charge under section 596A is currently on the benefit's cash equivalent, which in general means the cost to the benefit's provider. That cost may be small in comparison with the benefit's current worth if it has increased in value since its accrual.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked why that definition should be extended. It should be for two reasons: first, it reproduces valuation rules that are contained in schedule 9 and, secondly, it involves fairness. Frankly, the current rules allow a taxpayer to be charged on the cost of a non-tax benefit, even if it appreciated in value before it was handed over. That route is not available to ordinary employees, and it is therefore an anomaly. It is in the interests of fairness that we deal with it.
<P>
The Budget did not mention changes to the taxation of FURBS because changes in the taxation of trusts were part of the overall reform of capital gains tax. It is merely incidental that FURBS were not specifically affected. The hon. Gentleman complained about the length of some of our documents, but his proposal would make them even longer.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked how many schemes exist. I do not have any figures on the number of FURBS, but I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are trying to ensure that fairness applies. Not everyone is in a position to obtain benefits in kind--a vehicle, a work of art and so on. Ordinary people receive the benefits specified in the schemes of which they are part; why should someone who receives an additional benefit be treated more generously than someone who receives a straightforward cash benefit? The provision is in the interests of fairness and in the interest of the many, not the few. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> In the interests of speeding the Committee's proceedings, the Opposition will not press the matter, but it is worth saying that it has taken more than four weeks for the great phrase, "of the many, not the few" to be said. It has been long coming. We must agree to disagree with the Economic Secretary.
<P>
I am pleased to note the hon. Lady's statement that FURBS are a legitimate way of rewarding staff. It has been a growing benefit, although the implications of the clause will be to curtail it greatly. I am not entirely convinced that the increase in the rate of tax to 34 per cent. was planned as part of the overall taxation postion; it seems, as the Revenue suggested, to have been an accidental measure on which the Government are not trying to put a new spin.
<P>
In the interests of brevity, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendent No. 173, in page 75, line 21, leave out from section 596(A)" to end of line 24 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"including relevant loan interest to which section 396 applies (mortgage interest relief payable under deduction of tax) but not so to make it income of the person making the loan.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
You will be glad to hear, Mrs. Dunwoody, that brevity will be the watchword of this amendment as I laid out my stall on the previous amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 173 refers to mortgate interest relief at source. If an interest-free loan is made from FURBS to a beneficiary, the interest forgone is regarded as a non-cash benefit. The clause seeks to ensure that the benefit is taxed on the basis that the interest forgone has been received, but specifically excludes MIRAS, which seems unfair and illogical. If a Worthing pensioner who receives benefits under FURBS obtains a mortgage from a building society at an interest rate of, say, 7 per cent.--that might have been the interest rate before the sixth interest rate rise under the Government--he would benefit from MIRAS. If he borrows from his or her own firm's scheme to fund the purchase of a house, he or she will be taxed as if the interest forgone was 7 per cent. and without the benefit of MIRAS. Solid home-owning pensioner citizens of Worthing who may be fortunate enough to benefit from FURBS will be penalised for borrowing from those schemes. The Government seem yet again to be attacking responsible pensioners who wish to own their property with the use of a mortgage and by reference to a sizeable FURBS scheme which they might have built up.
<P>
The amendment would simply provide a level playing field so that MIRAS may be included on the same basis as loans made from FURBS.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> There is a technical inaccurcy in the amendment, which is probably a typographical error. The amendment refers to section 396; it should refer to section 369. Notwithstanding that, the amendment would impose additional and unacceptable burdens on employers for little or no benefit to their former employees. I am surprised that Opposition Members would wish to increase the burden on employers instead of listening to what companies want.
<P>
New section 596C allows a former employee to claim mortgage interest relief on an interest free or low interest loan provided by their former employer. New subsection (3)(b) prevents that loan from being treated as a loan subject to the mortgage interest relief at source arrangements. Opposition Members should know that those are quite different. MIRAS arrangements, as they are known to those of us who operate in the normal world, allow a borrower to make loan repayments under deduction of tax relief. A lender can reclaim tax relief deducted from the Inland Revenue.
<P>
MIRAS is operated by most lenders, but not by employers in general and certainly not by pension scheme managers. I do not think that employers or pension scheme managers would welcome us imposing the various MIRAS compliance and reporting procedures on them when they choose to provide a beneficial loan. The fact that the taxable benefit arises on the notional interest not paid by the former employer means that it would be complex to operate MIRAS in its present form.
<P>
The mortgage interest relief that the former employee is entitled to is recognised in the PAYE codes or in an assessment. The point made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham is unnecessary. His suggestion would cause employers and pension scheme managers all sorts of problems, some of which I have outlined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> In the interest of speeding matters along, I shall not persist with the amendment. I am grateful for the Economic Secretary's explanation. I fear that we must hold up our hands to the transposition of the fgures 6 and 9. I would be grateful to receive a little more detail in writing on the various cases to which she referred. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

This simple amendment would delete new subsection (2)(d) which is absurdly widely drafted. It allows the restrictions to be imposed by regulation for "any other circumstances whatever." That casts a shadow of doubt[Mr. Fallon]
over new paragraphs (a) to (c). New paragraph (d) is far wider than is justified in the explanatory notes. They make it clear that any other matter must relate to the management of the scheme. That is why I suggest that the new paragraph is too widely drawn. I hope that the Economic Secretary will recognise that the simplest solution is to delete it. If she cannot do that, she could improve it on Report by adding the words "relating to the management of the scheme."

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, the conditions for tax approval of a personal pension scheme are subject to wide discretionary powers exercised by the Inland Revene. But the primary aim of clause 92 is to enable those powers to be restricted where desirable to create a greater certainty about what an approved personal pension scheme can and cannot do. I recognise that the words that the amendment seeks to remove are far reaching, but so are the discretionary powers.
<P>
It is important to remember that the Inland Revenue can already exercise discretion over any provision included in regulations. The clause therefore seeks not to widen the board's powers but to narrow them. However, it is impossible to predict all the circumstances where regulations may be needed.
<P>
The immediate intention of clause 92 is to issue regulations on the permissible investments of self-invested personal pension schemes. Currently, no plans exist for further regulations under the clause. However, given the present broad framework of the tax approval system, we must have a power that is flexible enough to cover a wide range of circumstances.
<P>
The phrase used in the clause mirrors the wording of equivalent provisions that were incorporated into the occupational pension rules in 1987. As with clauses 93 and 94, clause 92 aims to bring personal pension rules more into line with those that apply to occupational pension schemes. To omit a phrase that has caused no problem to the regulation of such schemes would be somewhat perverse.
<P>
Any regulations under the provisions will be the subject of full consultation with the personal pensions representative bodies, and they will be scrutinised by the House. Notwithstanding the understandable worry that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) expressed about the terms of the clause, I feel sure that hon. Members will agree that the amendment is unnecessary. I therefore urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I had hoped that the Economic Secretary would be a bit more reasonable about the matter; instead, she has made rather a meal of it. Like those outside the House, I realise that it is impossible to predict particular circumstances. I was simply trying to limit those circumstances to the management of the scheme. The retention of the phrase "any other circumstances" leaves the clause far too widely drawn. However, if she will not be more reasonable about the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 193, in page 86, line 11, leave out subsections (3) and (4).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 194, 195 and 196.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The amendments relate to the part of clause 99 that was put forward by the Government to simplify section 473 of the Taxes Act 1988. That section grants financial traders deferment of tax in certain circumstances on the exchange of shares and securities. The relief is the equivalent of the roll-over relief that is available to non-traders under capital gains legislation.
<P>
The scope of the relief has been reduced considerably by the loan relationships legislation that applies to corporate traders, and by the repeals in the earlier part of the clause. The Government therefore thought that it would be useful to clarify the statute to restate the circumstances in which the relief applies.
<P>
Those parts of the clause that will affect section 473 were drafted on the understanding that the proposed new wording would involve a simplification but not a change in the law. The Inland Revenue has since concluded that changing the section's wording would not simply restate the situation.
<P>
The point came to light as a result of a taxpayer's query about the interlinkage between the Bill and the capital gains tax legislation. The problem is that there is a class of deemed securities, called earn-outs, which are currently within the scope of that relief, but which are not shares. We do not want to remove earn-outs from the scope of the Bill by wording the provision so that it applies only to shares.
<P>
Rather than re-complicate the legislation by redrafting it again, we decided to withdraw the proposed change in wording. That will ensure that the position on earn-outs does not change. I am sorry for the consequential factual errors in our previous announcements, but I have put the record straight. I therefore commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> This is another offering from the Economic Secretary's tax law emergency re-write team, and we welcome it. I am delighted to hear that the corrections had to be made as a result of an individual taxpayer's representations. That shows that someone has managed to get through to the Government and to the Revenue about one of the many errors that litter the Bill. Last week--perhaps in your absence, Mrs. Dunwoody--we discussed the five defects in clause 82, and the necessary re-writing of schedule 5. The Government will also have to rewrite clause 99 substantially, because they did not realise that there are certain types of convertible security that are neither qualifying corporate bonds nor shares. That could have been spotted earlier, but I do not think that there is much point in rubbing further salt into this wound.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Clause 99, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clause 100 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 101</center></H4>
<H4><center>Restriction of relief on certain interest and dividends</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Three points need to be made about the clause. My first substantial point is about the transitional element. As I understand the clause, it will apply to foreign dividends and to interest paid before 1 January 1999, which will give no opportunity for arrangements that might be charaterised as offending to be dismantled. Will the Paymaster General either confirm that the Government's intention is that there should be no transitional element or explain whether there will be an opportunity for arrangements that will now offend to be dismantled?
<P>
The second point that I wish to raise is the drafting of proposed new section 798(5). As I understand it, paragraph (a) of that proposed new section does not refer to section 798B as well as 798A, although subsections (3) and (4) do. I do not know whether that is a deliberate omission; perhaps the Paymaster General will assist in confirming that.
<P>
Thirdly, will the Paymaster General explain the likely operation of section 798(5)? The Confederation of British Industry is not alone in wondering whether it will be used against non-financial groups that make loans to overseas subsidiaries, where the funding of the loan is raised through a group treasury company. That group treasury company is treated as a financial trader on the basis that the financial trader could have made the overseas loan directly. Will the Paymaster General reassure the Committee on that point?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> The clause, together with clauses 102 and 103, provides for amendments to the existing special rules, which expressly prevent banks and other financial traders getting excessive relief against United Kingdom tax for foreign tax paid on overseas interest earned in the course of a trade.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If the Minister will allow me to say so, he should raise his voice slightly. The words are being recorded, and he has been in the House for a long time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I apologise. I had not realised that I was not speaking loudly enough. I shall speak up.
<P>
The existing rules restrict the amount of relief that may be claimed against United Kingdom tax on the net profit made after deducting the financial expenditure incurred in earning the interest. We have decided to amend the rules because we have become aware of attempts by banks and other financial traders to avoid the existing law. They do so by arranging for one of the following: for the return from lending money to overseas borrowers to be in the form of dividends rather than interest, and to arrive in circumstances that give an additional entitlement to relief for foreign tax known as underlying tax, which may be in part what the hon. Member for Sevenoaks had in mind; for the interest to be received by an associate; or, for the financial expenditure to be incurred by an associate.
<P>
The new rules extend the existing restriction on relief for tax on foreign interest to cover the following elements: dividends attracting relief for underlying tax, which are received in the course of a trade; income of an associate of a financial trader, which is received in pursuance of arrangements intended to avoid the restrictions that would have applied had that income been received by the trader; and, expenditure attributable to the earning of the income and incurred by an associate of the recipient.
<P>
Clause 101 amends the existing section so that--as well as interest income--it will deal with certain dividend income of financial traders and, in some circumstances, similar income of their associates. I shall deal with those points in greater detail in due course. Clause 102 amends the rules for adjusting for foreign tax the amount of the income to which clause 101 applies, by taking account of extension to cover dividends. Clause 103 amends the existing definition of financial expenditure taken into account in calculating the limit of double taxation relief.
<P>
To give banks and other financial traders the opportunity to consider whether and how the existing arrangements will be affected, the new rules will only apply to payments in respect of pre-Budget day arrangements from 1 January 1999. If the hon. Member for Sevenoaks reflects on that specific point for a moment, I think that he will agree that that is an adequate amount of time.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): Perhaps Opposition Members have not followed the Paymaster General's specific point. New section 798(2) appears to state that if a payment is made after 17 March 1998 but before 1 January 1999 as part of an unwound arrangement it would not qualify for transitional relief. That seems clear, because an unwound arrangement would not satisfy the transitional requirements for being unaltered on or after 17 March. I should be grateful for elucidation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is right. It is unusual with measures aimed at prevention of specific tax avoidance schemes for any period of grace to be given. However, we wanted to be fair to the very small number of taxpayers who may have entered such arrangements for mainly commercial reasons by allowing any payments due before the end of the year to go ahead on the basis of the present law. That period of grace will allow all existing schemes to be reviewed with consideration of whether they need to be unwound. That should meet the hon. Gentleman's point. To grant even greater latitude would afford opportunities for unscrupulous taxpayers to counter the intended effect of the new rules--for example, by arranging for all future payments under the arrangements to be made before 1 January 1999. We have tried to strike a balance to give those who could be affected adequate time and latitude to make the arrangements, but we could not give a period of grace in which new arrangements could be made to take advantage of the avoidance that we are trying to close.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General. If arrangements are unwound after 17 March to prevent them from being offending arrangements and to conform with the spirit of new section 798, but there is a dividend payment after 17 March and before 1 January, that payment would not have the benefit of the transitional relief. If that is correct, it is unjust because it is an arrangement that is being unwound and is attempting to comply with the new legislation but will not be able to take advantage of the relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point and will come back to him, but at the moment I must remain with what has been agreed after consultation. I shall repeat what I said. We want to be fair to the very small number of taxpayers who may have entered into such arrangements for mainly commercial reasons by allowing any payments due before the end of this year to go ahead on the basis of the present law. I believe that that precisely covers the hon. Gentleman's point and I can assure him that he is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I may feel a bit more confused, but at least it is at a higher level and I am grateful to the Paymaster General.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I would not aspire to be as confused at as high a level as my hon. Friend, but our debate has been useful because it has shown that there is lack of understanding outside the Committee on the exact nature of the transitional arrangements. If the Paymaster General can give any further comfort, perhaps he will write to us.
<P>
Perhaps because the Paymaster General was generously explaining how the clause and the succeeding clauses would work, he did not touch on the two other points I raised and perhaps he would like this opportunity of doing so. The first was the drafting point that affects line 46 on page 89 on whether section 798B should be included as well as the original section 798A.
<P>
The second point concerned loans. The hon. Gentleman described various arrangements covering dividends, income avoidance and other expenditure, but I was not sure whether that would apply directly to a loan made by a group treasury company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will take the points in the order that they were raised.
<P>
New section 798(4) achieves the extension to associates. It explicitly refers to new section 798B. We do not need an additional reference in new subsection (5). Counsel gave us that advice when we took the matter to him.
<P>
Group treasury operations--the group treasurer's function--will be affected. But we do not expect them to be caught in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> One final point, Mrs. Dunwoody. Will the Paymaster General assure me that in subsection (2) the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"not altered on or after, 17th March 1998"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will be interpreted by the Revenue as not including de minimis or immaterial changes? Those who deal with the Revenue would like to know that. It is unreasonable for de minimis changes to put a company that wishes to take advantage of the relief outside the ambit of that relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a good point, albeit technical and relatively narrow. If he allows me to write to him on that, I will be able to cover the matter more fully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I would be most grateful.
<P>

<H4><center>Meaning of "financial expenditure"</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> There is one point that needs clarifying. New section 798B(1)(b)(ii) ought to make it easier for the committee to follow lines 30 and 31. However, I am not clear whether it refers to sums that would not be allowed against tax under 798(2)(a). If that is the case, it should have been reflected in the drafting. If it is not the case, I have to confess that I do not understand the wording of those two lines.
<P>
Finally, I assume that the word "qualifying" in line 37 applies to both gains and profits. The definition in new subsection (5) is of qualifying profits rather than of profits. Perhaps the Paymaster General can assist us with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> While I wait for some help and guidance, I compliment the hon. Gentleman on his point. As I am already writing to his hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds, may I also write to him? Meanwhile--[Laughter.] The wording in the clause is precise. I see no reason why I need to be more explicit. We should not pander to such nitpicking. I suspect that that might be known as a sweeper clause, and we shall be watching out for how sweepers perform in tomorrow night's match, Mrs. Dunwoody. It is clear to me what the clause means, but I shall confirm that in writing if the hon. Gentleman wants me to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I asked the Paymaster General to explain what the clause means. I think that it means sums that would not be allowed against tax. It is all very well to say that he will write, but he is bringing the clause before the Committee and he should know what it means. If it does not mean sums that would not be allowed against tax, I would like to know what it does mean.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is pushing a tiny, nitpicking point to undue lengths. We still have a great deal to cover and we will deal with his point. I understand that he has found a narrow point which he believes is of particular significance. However, the clause means what it says, not what he says it means.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I hope that I may be able to clarify the matter somewhat. My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks rightly probed the Paymaster General, who indicated to the Committee that he had no idea what the clause meant. After some explanation from his officials, he then said that the clause was perfectly clear. Both statements cannot be true. Perhaps he could explain a bit more clearly the meaning of this complex clause, which will affect considerably some international companies. The Committee has a right to know exactly what the clause means.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will very willingly give the hon. Gentleman the necessary background to the clause. Double taxation relief for financial traders and, where appropriate, their associates, is restricted to the net profit made from trading activities after deducting expenses incurred in earnings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Ministers must ensure that their words are capable of being recorded. To that end, Committee members should speak slowly and clearly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I regret that I must apologise to you a second time for the same reason. I was trying to make progress, but I shall speak more slowly for the Committee's benefit. It is necessary to provide rules that determine those expenses. The existing section 798 achieves that by defining at subsection (7) what is meant by financial expenditure. New section 798B replaces subsection (7) of existing section 798. The rules are essentially the same as the existing ones, but the opportunity has been taken both to fill some gaps and to update the rules specifically to cater for additional ways in which money is raised by financial institutions.
<P>
When subsection (7) was introduced, the need was recognised to make provision for the circumstance where a taxpayer sought to avoid the existing section 798 restriction by, for example, arranging for funds to be raised and related expenditure to be incurred by an associate who on-lent the funds to the taxpayer interest free.
<P>
Without specific rules to cover that circumstance, it would be possible for the recipient of the income to incur no expenditure on his own account, and thus to be subject to no restriction in respect of his entitlement to double taxation relief.
<P>
However, in practice that did not cover the circumstance in which instead of on-lending the funds interest free, the associate subscribed for shares in the recipient. That loophole has been closed by the new section 798B. The expenditure to be taken into account is anything that can be attributed to the earning of interest or dividends, whether incurred by the taxpayer or by one or more of his associates.
<P>
When subsection (7) was introduced, it was recognised that financial institutions finance overseas lending in ways other than by interest-bearing loans. Therefore, subsection (7) also covered sums similar to interest. However, it has been disputed that the subsection covers expenses and losses associated with foreign exchange and other financial instruments. New section 798B puts that issue beyond doubt by specifically including them. It also includes any other sum that can reasonably be regarded as attributable to the earning of the interest or dividends--for example, losses on the holding of bonds associated with interest or dividend income.
<P>
Subsection (7) of the existing section 798 gave the board of Inland Revenue the power to clarify how expenditure is to be arrived at where it is not readily ascertainable. The board has used those powers to produce regulations, which can be found in SI 1988/88. They will be updated to take account of the changes made by the clause and by clause 101.
<P>
Clause 103 is the third of three clauses that together provide for amendments to the existing special rules expressly preventing banks and other financial traders from getting excessive relief against United Kingdom tax for foreign tax paid on overseas interest earned by them in the course of a trade. The clause provides a definition of financial expenditure for the purposes of new section 798, which will be introduced by clause 101.
<P>
The clause introduces new section 798B which, in addition to modifying the definition to take account of the extension of the rules to cover certain foreign dividend income of financial traders, reflects more comprehensively the range of expenses associated with the ways in which money is raised by them and their associates. It also counters efforts made by taxpayers to minimise the effect of the existing rules.
<P>
As with clause 101, the amended rules will apply immediately to payments in respect of arrangements entered into on or after Budget day. That should also deal with the timing arrangements. If there are further questions about the clause it might be best to deal with them now, although we have had an adequate debate on it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I did not intend to discuss the clause, but it is clear to me that the Paymaster General did not understand what he was reading. These are important provisions. When the restrictions on banks were introduced in the Finance Act 1987, they had a big impact on the City of London. The amendments are[Mr. Gibb]
important to the City. I leave the Paymaster General with a question, to which I should like an answer. Has he read clause 103?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Yes, and I have nothing further to say to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 103 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 104</center></H4>
<H4><center>Underlying tax reflecting interest or dividends</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Perhaps we will have more luck with clause 104. The Paymaster General may have read this clause--he may even have written it--and he may be able to explain its meaning.
<P>
I have two questions. First, subsection (10) does not deal with the insurance business, although that is done in relation to proposed new section 798(4) in clause 101(1), which is the equivalent provision. Secondly, this may well be a minor point--subsection (10) contains a curious definition of "bank". It appears to define a bank as any kind of company. Might it not be simpler to use the phrase "the qualifying persons", or another phrase that is more appropriate? I have certainly never seen that definition of a bank before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall take this opportunity to explain the clause in some detail to the Committee. That is the only way to handle the matter, given the undue interest in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Undue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinsin:</B> Well, the clause has never been used, although it will be, and perfectly legitimate questions have been raised.
<P>
The clause is part of the package of measures amending the existing rules expressly preventing banks and other financial traders from getting excessive relief against United Kingdom tax for foreign tax paid on overseas interest earned by them in the course of a trade.
<P>
The clause will amend section 803 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The existing rules, which are in section 798 of that Act, restrict the relief that may be claimed to the United Kingdom tax on the net profit made after deduction of financial expenses that are incurred in earning the interest. Section 803 complements those rules by preventing financial traders from side-stepping that legislation by arranging for the interest to be received by an overseas subsidiary. The clause provides for consequential amendments to be made to section 803 to take account of the extension of the rules to cover certain dividends and associates of financial traders.
<P>
As with clause 101, the amended rules will apply immediately to payments in respect of arrangements entered into on or after Budget day, but will apply only to payments in respect of pre-Budget day arrangements from 1 January 1999.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked about the definitions of banks. Although it would have been possible to amend the existing section in the way that was suggested, the Inland Revenue is not aware of any case in which practice such an amendment would be required, and the Association of British insurers has not raised any concerns with it or with me.
<P>
I hope that puts the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest and gives him the reassurance that he needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, I hope that you share my disappointment with the answer, which was inadequate, for several reasons. First, vast chunks of the Bill refer provisions to secondary legislation. Now we are told that if we ask any questions at all about the primary legislation, we are expressing undue interest. This puts all Committee members in a difficult situation and simply confirms the arrogance of Ministers, who are not prepared to answer straightforward questions. However, the Paymaster General has satisfied me about subsection (10). I only hope that he will not be so arrogant when we ask questions about later clauses in the Bill.
<P>
Claue 104 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 105</center></H4>
<H4><center>Notification of foreign tax adjustment</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We shall try again. I hope that the Paymaster General will accept that there is substantial interst in this clause on foreign tax adjustment, and that he cannot brush aside our remarks as technical points. I want to put three major points to him on the operation of the clause.
<P>
The first is about penalties. I hope that the Paymaster General wil accept that there may be circumstances in which non-notification is purely innocent. For example, a taxpayer might not know that an adjustment has been made to the tax payable by a company in which he has shares. In those circumstances, it would be right for the penalty to be waived, or at least to have some period of notice before the penalty applies.
<P>
The second point is the discrepancy between the wording of the clause and the wording of the notes on clauses. The notes on clauses refer, at paragraph 9, to "foreign tax paid" and "subsequently repaid". The clause does not say that, but refers to "tax payable". That leaves open the circumstances in which foreign tax is overpaid and repayable, but has not been repaid, when the taxpayer's cash position will not have changed. I would, therefore, submit to the Paymaster General that neither the obligation nor the time limit should arise before the actual repayment of tax.
<P>
The third substantial point is the operation of the time limit. I suggest that the one-year time limit for notification under subsection (4) should run from the end of the accounting period of the United Kingdom company because such an adjustment may come to light only when consolidated accounts are prepared. Obviously, if the Revenue is concerned that that may result in the loss of income, it has the right to charge interest if corporation tax is paid late. So there should be no question of any loss arising.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I support the three questions asked by my hon. Friend. In addition, I want to ask the Paymaster General whether any consideration was given by officials and Ministers to a reasonable excuse test. The penalty seems draconian, and it is certainly something that practitioners in the City are surprised about, not least because the Revenue's position is protected. If corporation tax is owing as a result of an adjustment to foreign tax paid, interest will be charged on the adjustment that is made to mainstream corporation tax in this country. So the Revenue will be no worse off. The penalty will be draconian if an innocent judgment is made, for example, when underlying tax in a foreign jurisdiction--Italy is one such case--and the associated credits are moved around. That can be done over a long period and the notification procedure may be inadequate for a foreign subsidiary of a UK parent. In such circumstances, one year is not adequate. A reasonable excuse test with no penalty and interest charged on corporation tax, which would have to be paid in adjustments subsequently, is a better way of attacking the problem.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Of course, all the points made by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks are substantive, but some are more substantive than others and those that he raised on the clause are worth taking note of. I shall deal first with the question of innocence and reply to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) at the same time.
<P>
The penalties are high, but are intended to be high. It would not be correct to say that we can offer any particular new test in respect of the issues in question. The penalties will be subject to the general legislative and procedural processes applied by the Inland Revenue when it seeks to impose penalties. Penalties will be subject to abatement on the basis of public guidance and taxpayers will have a right of appeal to independent commissioners. That is the established position and we should not depart too far from it.
<P>
The penalties will also be subject to the general legislative and procedural processes applied by the Inland revenue when it seeks to impose penalties. They will be subject to the abatement if it can be proved that there are extenuating circumstances. Taxpayers will be expected to take reasonable action to ensure awareness of any adjustments to the foreign tax in respect of which relief has been claimed. There are difficulties with that, but it must be incumbent on taxpayers to make the general arrangements to keep themselves informed of the position in overseas countries.
<P>
I can be reassuring in the sense that, although the penalties are high, if all reasonable efforts have been made by the taxpayer to keep himself informed of what the tax changes may be and the amounts that he may have paid in overseas tax, the Inland Revenue will be reasonable in making an amendment in appropriate circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> There is one way of helping the reasonableness test, which was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds. The penalty regime is fairly difficult and if the overseas company is making tax claims on different subsidiaries in different tax regimes, it may be difficult for them sometimes to catch up with events until the end of the financial year of those subsidiaries. It would be helpful if the Paymaster General could keep an open mind on whether he is prepared to amend the Bill so that the one-year period during which the chargeable event takes place starts from the end of the financial year and not from the time of the chargeable event.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I always have an open mind; I am known for that in the Committee. Whether I can keep that open mind to the extent suggested by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, I am not sure.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks referred to the timing of the one-year requirement. If taxpayers have claimed excessive amounts of relief, a one year limit is adequate to deal with any administrative requirements. To allow those who have made excessive claims to wait longer before notifying the Inland Revenue would not be fair to the general body of taxpayers. If that is not the point that the hon. Gentleman raised. I shall give way to him so that he can make his point again.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Who knows, perhaps the Paymaster General's are not paying undue interest to the argument. The point at issue is not the period but when the period begins. As such adjustments may come to light only when consolidated accounts are prepared, it would be better to start the one-year time limit from the end of the accounting period. It is not the length of the period that is important, but when it starts under new subsection (4).
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That would give an undue advantage to the taxpayer concerned. I cannot see a reason to depart from what is in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> While the Paymaster General ponders on that, I wonder whether he will address my second point. It relates to circumstances in which foreign tax that has been overpaid and is repayable has not physically been repaid, so the taxpayer's position has not changed. The clause has been drafted in such a way that the obligation and the time limit will arise before the repayment is made. My two points are related.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think that the Bill is perfectly clear. I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman's point. The liability arises when the tax overpayment, underpayment or change has taken place. It is incumbent from that time for the taxpayer to make the necessary arrangements in his account. The date runs from that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I will have one more go. The obligation will arise before the repayment of tax. There may be circumstances in which that is unreasonable. If the time period began from the end of the accounting period, the[Mr. Fallon]
period would be lessened. In any case, if there is a fear about loss of revenue, the Paymaster General has the ability to charge interest on late payments of corporation tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I take the point and, although I do not think that it is substantial, I will reconsider it. We are discussing a timing matter. It may be possible for the Inland Revenue to recoup through an interest charge--it would not be a penalty charge because there is no question of misdemeanour. We have allowed the Inland Revenue to gain. The period by definition runs for less than a year. However, I can give the hon. Gentleman a little more detail.
<P>
Although adjustments will often involve repayment of tax to the person who has claimed the relief, that will not always be the case. For example, the foreign tax may not be repaid as such, but may be set off against another liability or, where a claim to relief has been made by a United Kingdom company in respect of underlying tax paid by a foreign subsidiary, tax may be repaid to the foreign company rather than the claimant. Those will both represent adjustments for the purposes of the clause.
<P>
Some representative bodies have expressed concerns. The Inland Revenue will publish guidance on how it intends to apply the legislation. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Inland Revenue will take a sensible and reasonable approach. I do not believe that his point is substantive, but if he has a substantive point, the Inland Revenue is open to consultation and I hope that we will be able to take it up with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I return to my first point, which was also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds. I thank the Paymaster General for his words of comfort, but I hope that he recognises that the penalty could be severe. We were hoping that he would accept a test of innocence so that where arrangements were obviously not fraudulent or negligent, he would be reasonable. He used the words "reasonable action". I think that he said that if companies had made reasonable efforts, the Revenue would take that into account. Those are important words.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"particular time if, and only if, he could be taken to be directly so participating or controlling at that time for the purposes of section 840.".<P>

<P>
This schedule deals with transfer pricing, which is an important concept in UK and worldwide tax legislation. It seeks to deter multinational groups of companies from buying products from an overseas subsidiary at below their market value or proper price, or selling goods to an overseas subsidiary for more than their proper price. The purpose of such activity is to shift profits out of the UK tax jurisdiction into other jurisdictions, which might be because of a more favourable tax regime, higher debt levels or other factors. Profits are shipped around the world simply by the manipulation by a group of companies of the price of goods and services acquired and sold. Transfer pricing legislation has been part of our tax code for many years, and in schedule 16 has become more extensive. Schedule 16 also incorporates the new self-assessment provisions.
<P>
I raise these issues because it is my perception, which is shared outside this House, that the Inland Revenue is increasingly not accountable to the House. When--as is apparent from our discussion of the past few clauses--Ministers clearly do not understand the proposed legislation, we should be concerned that we are living in an increasingly less democratic society. As legislation becomes more technical in an increasingly complex world, Ministers must have an increasingly vigilant role. It is also worrying--if I may deviate for a little longer--that Labour Members are not participating in the debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is supposed to be moving the amendment. I hope that he will rapidly come to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I will now turn to the amendment. I hope that Labour Members will also debate schedule 16, as there is concern about lack of accountability. If they have nothing to say--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have pointed out to the hon. Gentleman that he should be moving the amendment. If he does not wish to do so, I hope that he will make it clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The hon. Gentleman has made certain points about Labour Members. But the three points made by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks on the previous clause were raised by outside interests. There was nothing original about them.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Luckily, the originality of Members of Parliament is not a matter for the chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The pricing legislation was dealt with in section 770 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Indeed, a plethora of transfer pricing legislation was dealt with in one clause and three supplementary clauses. Schedule 16 maintains the same concept but translates it from four clauses into 11 pages of detailed legislation.
<P>
For example, starting on page 254 of the Bill, schedule 16 takes one and a half pages to define the concept of control. There are many established definitions of control within the current legislation, and two main definitions that are commonly used. Section 416 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 gives a definition of control for close company purposes. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a person shall be taken to have control of a company if he exercises, or is able to exercise or is entitled to acquire, direct or indirect control over the company's affairs."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government could easily have used that definition. A second widely-used definition appears in section 840 of the same Act; it is a much more civilised definition of control, which, broadly speaking, refers to controlling more than half of the ordinary shares of the company. The Government--or the Inland Revenue, as there is no guarantee that the Government will understand what they propose--have proposed a new definition of control for the purposes of the transfer pricing legislation.
<P>
The schedule is a muddled amalgam. Its definition falls somewhere between that contained in section 840 and that contained in section 416. The amendment would remove some of that confusion by introducing an element of simplification. It opts for one of the two definitions that the Act already contains. The Government should opt for the simpler of those definitions, namely that contained in section 840. That definition is already used in section 770, and there is no reason why the Government should extend that definition to the muddled amalgam that the schedule contains.
<P>
I hope that the Government will adopt the amendment or come forward with another amendment on Report that incorporates the section 840 definition of control. The industry outside the House has somehow got to get to grips with the muddled mess that the Bill contains.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I support my hon. Friend. In our debate on schedule 15, we discussed how a tax office in Nottingham exercised rights of interpretation. Previously, only the sheriff of Nottingham felt he could exercise powers in that way.
<P>
Our debate on that schedule related to the definition of "employ", and our debate on this schedule relates to the definition of "control". A new avenue is opening up, which will allow the Inland Revenue to build a new range of meanings and interpretations. The great advantage of sticking to current definitions such as those that are contained in section 840 is that they have been subject to long use and to rigorous examination in the courts and through case law. Taxpayers know where they stand. It is a requirement of the tax system that taxpayers should be taxed clearly and justly. If the new definitions are allowed to creep in at the Inland Revenue's whim--and, as my hon. Friend said, probably without the Paymaster General even realising what is happening--taxpayers will not know where they stand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> To judge by the benign language of the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Guildford, one would think that they had nothing more than simplification on their minds, but of course that is anything but the case. Rather uncharacteristically--I can still find it in the generosity of my heart to say this of them--they are both seeking to promote vested interests, which they do not normally do.
<P>
I should inform the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that, contrary to what he said, we will use the section 840 definition. If there is anyone who does not understand the Bill, I am afraid that it is the hon. Gentleman. He can look into the envelope in his hands if he wishes, but that was a simple error on his part.
<P>
I come to the heart of the amendment, which, I hasten to add, is not the heart of the schedule. I am sure that the Committee agrees that the schedule is very important--transfer pricing, which was first introduced in 1951, is an important matter that involves many large and small companies. During the Inland Revenue's consultation procedure, we took great trouble to get the process, and the redefinition, right.
<P>
With your permission, Mrs. Dunwoody, I shall make a more general comment on that matter in relation to a later amendment. At this stage I shall speak specifically to the amendment, which stands egregiously on its own in the pursuit of a vested interest.
<P>
The control provisions that are included in paragraph 4 of new schedule 28AA define the circumstances in which transactions fall within the scope of the transfer pricing legislation. They include two important features that would be lost if the amendment were carried. The first requires the rights and powers of certain other parties to be taken into account when considering whether a person fulfils the control requirements. The second applies the legislation to certain transactions involving a joint venture. The Government consider those features to be essential to tackling avoidance by means of transfer pricing abuse.
<P>
The attribution rules are necessary to prevent non-arm's length transactions from falling outside the legislation's scope through contrived control arrangements. They are needed to prevent the legislation being circumvented by the use of control structures that employ relatives, nominees and trusts.
<P>
The Government also believe that the joint venture provisions are necessary to prevent abuse through the circumvention of the transfer pricing rules by means of a joint venture. In such ventures, the opportunity exists to price or to structure transactions between the participants and the venture in such a way as to shift profits out of the UK to the mutal benefit of the participants. The Government wish to curtail such opportunities.
<P>
As Committee members know, applicability is typically defined by ownership of 51 per cent. of such a venture. However, the Inland Revenue has discovered that, for example, two parties who each own 40 per cent. of an overseas joint venture could use the transfer pricing mechanism to enhance their profits. The 40 per cent. indicative controlling feature has been introduced to cover just such a circumstance.
<P>
It should be pointed out that the basic control provisions remain essentially unchanged. In the vast majority of cases, the application of the provisions is straightforward and simple. The Government believe that the attribution nrules and the joint venture provisions will affect only a small proportion of transactions, and will not result in an increase in compliance costs to the vast majority of taxpayers. They will affect only those whose objective is the exploitation of tax avoidance by the use of the transfer pricing system.
[Mr. Geoffrey Robinson]
<P>
I have an important point to make, which is further to the points of principle that I explained to the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Guildford, who tabled the amendment. In the light of it, they will understand why we cannot accept the amendment. The legislation includes a transitional provision for any existing joint venture arrangements that would fall foul of the new definition. That provision is contained in clause 106 subsection (6) and serves to shelter existing joint ventures from the effects of the new rules for up to three years. The provision, which has been widely welcomed, was introduced as a result of representation made to the Inland Revenue during consultations on the new rules. Therefore, I see no need further to consider the amendment, which we shall resist should the Committee press it to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> At the beginning of the Paymaster General's speech he said that the Government were using section 840, and that no change was made to the definition of control. I was duly castigated for tabling the amendment. However, after the Paymaster General read his briefing, he said that changes were in fact made to the definition of control under section 840, and that the attribution rules had been changed. Indeed, the notes on clauses state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Paragraph 4 introduces a number of attribution rules that are not to be found in the control provisions in the existing legislation."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was therefore right to table an amendment to remove one and a half pages of detailed and complicated rules on a control definition that has been used to good effect in existing transfer pricing legislation for many years.
<P>
Paragraph 4 of schedule 16 further complicates the legislation. The Paymaster General must understand what is happening. At the beginning of his speech, he said that the definition of control was not being changed; at the end of his speech he said the opposite. That is a further demonstration of the Government's lack of understanding of their own legislation. As this is a technical amendment, I hope that the Government have taken on board my points and I--
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Conservative Members had no vested interests that led to the tabling of the amendment. However, we may have done the Paymaster General a disservice. Perhaps he speaks from a position of knowledge--knowledge of his own vested interests in transfer pricing and of selling products in this country to another jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point, which I hope the Paymaster General will address when he responds to my question about the definition of control.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman withdrawing the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I would like to reconsider that once I have heard the Paymaster General's response.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Whether or not the Minister speaks is a matter for the Minister. The hon. Gentleman started to say that he wanted to withdraw the amendment and then gave way to his hon. Friend. I need a clear indication of whether he is withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Not at the moment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The question is--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The position is clear.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 203, in page 255, line 42, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and
`(c) the further condition set out in sub-paragraph (7) below is satisfied in the case where one or more of those persons is an insurance company.'."
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 208, in page 256, line 23, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7) The further condition is satisfied where the potential advantage in 5(1) above is offset in full by any adjustments made by the profits of the disadvantaged person on the making of the claim by virtue of paragraph 6(2) below".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This is a very important schedule, and I hope that you will allow us to have a stand part debate, Mrs. Dunwoody, so that we can explore some of the more general issues touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.
<P>
We do not dispute the idea of updating and reforming the rules relating to transfer pricing. It has long been established--indeed, it has been a feature of previous Finance Bills--that the tax authorities take a legitimate interest in the issue of companies trading between different tax jurisdictions. Tax rules are necessary to regulate that, especially in the case of multinational companies. Indeed, it makes sense to align these rules from time to time with generally agreed international principles.
<P>
We are pleased that the Government consulted on their general approach, but there is some concern that they are using the reform of transfer pricing to bring within the new rules transactions between United Kingdom resident companies--even though the notes on clauses refer to a widening of the UK exemption--that is, transactions between companies based entirely in the UK. However, very unexpectedly, life insurance companies spotted that they had been drawn within the net, but there was no consultation on this.
<P>
The Paymaster General will undoubtedly make play of the fact that there has been extensive consultation, but in this case, the companies involved were given no opportunity to explore with the Inland Revenue or the Treasury other ways of dealing with any actual or potential mischief in the pricing arrangements between companies in the same group or associated with each other in some way. Those companies are not used to complying with transfer pricing requirements. Transfer pricing is a science on its own--and not an exact one. So suddenly to require companies to conform to the rules, even allowing for the gap between consideration of the Bill and the rules coming into effect, is onerous and conflicts with the Government's announced intention to deregulate. In fact, an element of deregulation is claimed in the notes on clauses, as is the general requirement to lift the compliance burden on British companies where possible.
<P>
The schedule goes clean in the other direction. It will bring new companies within the rules, but it is not at all clear how that will be done. In particular, we question its scope and extent, and wonder whether it might not at least be possible to exempt some companies, provided that there is no intention or motive to avoid tax.
<P>
The amendments were tabled following consultation with the industry and practitioners. Labour Members have suggested that there is something improper about representing British business and ensuring that its concerns are tackled in a Finance Bill Committee. That is the purpose of Parliament; Parliament is supposed to represent people and institutions, and it is the Government's professed aim to help British industry.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
<ul>Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.</ul>
