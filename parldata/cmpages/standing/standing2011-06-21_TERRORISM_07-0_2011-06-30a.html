Gerry Sutcliffe</strong> (Bradford South) (Lab):<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000226">&#160;</a>
                  </span> Good morning to
you, Mr Caton, and to Committee members on this bright and sunny day. I
have to say I feel a lot better than I did yesterday morning, so I hope
we will make progress in discussing the various measures in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000017">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause 6 and
some of the subsequent clauses are more or less direct lifts from the
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, and I am sure that the Minister will
tell us where they differ. The clause centres on the prior permission
needed from the courts in relation to the measures imposed on an
individual in keeping with condition E in clause 3.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am slightly
concerned that the Secretary of State can go to the court to ask for
measures to be imposed on an individual, without that individual being
aware of the measures. When we discussed overnight residence, it was
clear that people had to live in an agreed place. However, if people
have to stay in a particular agreed place, but they do not know that
the measures have been applied, how do they deal with that?<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As we know,
the courts have a great role to play. As my right hon. Friend the
Member for Salford and Eccles said, control orders are perhaps the most
scrutinised provision to have been legislated for. It is interesting to
see the courts’ impact on our legal system, and I am delighted
that the hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham is with
us. Perhaps the Minister would care to comment on a recent court
judgment in relation to police bail, which we discussed earlier, and on
the role that the courts play.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister also talk me through what will happen, given his wish for an
individual to lead a reasonable, near-normal life, and given that the
Secretary of State will go to court for measures, which could include
residency, but will not be able to discuss where an agreed locality is?
I hope that I have made that clear; I am sure the Minister will
understand what I am trying to say.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000021">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I welcome you
back to the Chair, Mr Caton. I want to start with my hon.
Friend’s observation that much of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 210<a class="bkMark" name="Column210">&#160;</a>
                  </div>this clause and subsequent clauses are similar to the 2005 Act. I hope
that the Minister will express his generous appreciation of former
Ministers, who did more than half his work for him by drafting that
earlier legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Mr Caton, you
would admonish me if I read extensively from the Bill and the 2005 Act,
but I want to give one example to explain what I am saying. Clause 6(3)
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
function of the court on the application is…to determine whether
the relevant decisions of the Secretary of State are obviously
flawed”.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000176">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>If
the Committee goes to section 3(3)(b) of the Act, it will find the
following words:<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the function of
the court on the reference is to consider whether the decision of the
Secretary of State to make the order he did was obviously
flawed.”<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is an absolute lift, and we see that time and time again. I hope,
therefore, that the Minister will give generous recognition to the
efforts of former Ministers.

Stewart</strong> (Beckenham) (Con):<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000228">&#160;</a>
                  </span> I hope the right hon. Gentleman
will forgive me, but I am not a lawyer—I am working class and
pretty simple. Why do we need the words “obviously
flawed”? Is not saying “flawed” in plain English
good enough? Is this some legalistic mumbo-jumbo? The words
“obviously flawed” seem unnecessary—the decision
is either flawed or it ain’t.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000026">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point,
and my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles, who had a
hand in the obvious flaw in 2005, might want to address it. The hon.
Member for Beckenham might want to make a long speech later to draw out
the point that he has cleverly made, and I am sure that the Minister
will
respond.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
suspect that the Minister will have to work even harder today than he
has in previous sittings, as he explains to us how all the clauses will
work. Few amendments have been tabled for debate today, so we will
depend on his explanation of the clauses. First, will he explain how
the process in clause 6 and in some later clauses will work? Paragraph
69 on page 13 of the explanatory notes states:<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Subsection
(4)<em> </em>provides that the court may consider the Secretary of
State’s application without the individual on whom the measures
would be imposed being aware or having the opportunity to make
representations.”<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
the clause states that that “may” happen, not that it
“must” happen, so a judgment clearly has to be made about
whether the suspect is told about it. I would appreciate if the
Minister explained in what circumstances the suspect would be made
aware of it before permission is sought from the court. In reality,
does he expect that a suspect would ever be made aware of it
beforehand? If not, why is the word “may” used rather
than the word
“must”?<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
on timing, we know from this and subsequent clauses that the directions
hearing must take place within seven days, unless the suspect objects,
in which case the period can be longer. We would all appreciate it if
the Minister confirmed that should the suspect delay the hearing beyond
seven days, the conditions imposed as a result of permission being
granted would be in place and enforced throughout that period. Although
the Bill states that it must be held within seven days, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 211<a class="bkMark" name="Column211">&#160;</a>
                  </div>how quickly will the directions hearing take place
in practice? When it states that a review hearing should be
held<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“as
soon as reasonably
practicable”,<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>how
soon will that be? On the radio this morning, there were discussions
about the possible appeal against the ruling on police bail which,
because the courts are in recess over the summer, might take many
months and, in that case, a hearing held as soon as reasonably
practicable” might be in November, which is a very long time
away. We want assurance from the Minister that<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“as soon as

want to substitute for the Minister, and I have a terrible feeling that
some of the points raised may come to rest with
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have compared the provisions in the 2005 Act with the provisions in the
Bill, and many of the measures have identical wording—for
example, that applies to schedules 2 to 4 in the Bill. Members,
including those who were not Members of Parliament when the 2005
legislation went through, will want an explanation from the Minister
about how the system will work. I particularly welcome an explanation
of any differences in the Bill’s language or intent. Certainly,
the subsections mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Wythenshawe and Sale East are directly taken—word for
word—from section 3(5) and (7) of the 2005 Act. Perhaps that is
an acknowledgment by the Minister that the drafting was sound, despite
the scrutiny of, and litigation over, some of the provisions that have
since been
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
also want the Minister to take us through the reasons for requiring the
prior permission of the court, and the circumstances in which it is
appropriate to make ex parte applications, which are heard in the
absence of someone subject to such an application. Clearly, there is
provision for ex parte applications to be heard fully, with the person
subject to the notice having access to at least the opening material
and the special advocate process. I would therefore welcome an
explanation of the safeguards in place to ensure that there is intense
scrutiny as the matter goes through the judicial process. Sometimes,
the legislation is seen as a kind of ex parte process almost in
principle, when in fact the ex parte part is a minor part of it. There
is full judicial scrutiny in the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
was talking to a group of international students at the Royal College
of Defence Studies yesterday. They were particularly interested in
looking at our legislation. Sometimes there are misperceptions about
our legal system and the intensity of our judicial scrutiny. It was
fascinating to hear from some delegates from France and other European
countries, as they have entirely different legal systems and do not
necessarily have the degree of judicial scrutiny that we have in our
system. Perhaps the Minister would assure Committee members,
particularly his Liberal Democrat colleagues, that there is a robust
system of judicial scrutiny for this
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000036">&#160;</a>

                  </span> Good morning, Mr Caton. I
want to raise the issue of the two words, “obviously
flawed”, which were touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for
Beckenham. I am not a lawyer— 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 212<a class="bkMark" name="Column212">&#160;</a>
                  </div>I started a law degree, but unfortunately
my first-year exams clashed with the elections in 2010, and I had to
make a choice between career options. I am interested in the
phraseology that has been used. I do not know whether there is a
hierarchy of options. If we look at levels of evidential understanding,
we know that there is a criminal standard, a civil standard, reasonable
belief and reasonable suspicion. We have settled on reasonable belief
for the Bill, but personally I would push it up towards a balance of
probabilities, because I generally believe that knowing that someone is
at least 50% likely to have done something is a good threshold. I am
simply unaware as to whether there is an equivalent set of positions in
such
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">“Obviously
flawed” strikes me as a strong term. It is possible for
something to be flawed or clearly wrong, but not obviously so. I am
sure that some of us would consider a number of pieces of legislation
from the previous Government, and from all Governments, to be flawed,
but I suspect that the Ministers who pushed them through would argue
that they are not obviously flawed—certainly not at the time. A
debate about flaws is not the same as a debate about obvious flaws. I
would therefore be grateful to understand the role of the phrase. Is it
the same thing as requiring the Secretary of State to behave
reasonably? What other options were considered? Why was
“obviously flawed” settled
on?<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000038">&#160;</a>

tribute to the work of my officials. I am sure that right hon. and hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee will wish to do so, too, as they
make so much effort and conduct so much activity behind the scenes.
While Ministers are engaged in the process by giving directions and
setting policy, I am sure that right hon. and hon. Members will
recognise that much of the wording and drafting is down to the skill,
expertise and knowledge of parliamentary counsel. I pay tribute to them
for the work that they do in drafting
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000041">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham asked about the term
“obviously flawed”. To be fair, that question was also
raised by Opposition Members. An appropriate test at the permission
stage acts as a check on the Secretary of State’s exercise of
his or her powers. At that stage, it is clearly not appropriate for the
court to make the final determination on the case, because it is likely
to be an ex parte process, as the right hon. Member for Salford and
Eccles indicated, and I will come back to that. The court cannot assess
a case fully without the individual’s evidence being
heard.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000042">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The
full review by the court takes place at a later stage after the
terrorism prevention and investigation measures notice has been served.
At that stage, the court fully reviews the decisions by the Secretary
of State. By that time, the test is well beyond “obviously
flawed” and beyond the traditional concept of judicial review.
The court makes its own determination on the facts in terms of
reasonable belief, and it exercises intense scrutiny of the decisions.
Such scrutiny in many ways reflects the Court of Appeal case of MB. In
considering and preparing the legislation, we have reflected on the
case law that has developed around the existing control orders
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
the issue of “may”, the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe
and Sale East asked about the knowledge of the process by the
individual who may be the subject of a TPIM. It is the case that
individuals will not usually know about the permission hearing, as the
right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles rightly stated because, for
example, there may be a flight risk. A TPIM might be sought because
information or intelligence indicates that someone might be about to
leave the country, so it is necessary to intervene. There may be a
situation or circumstances in which an individual might have
knowledge—for example, if they are already the subject of a TPIM
notice, but the court has quashed it on technical grounds,
and the Secretary of State seeks permission for a new TPIM notice to be
put in place. There are such circumstances but, as I think the right
hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East would accept, they are likely
to be narrow, given the preventive nature of the process, and given
that the ex parte process implies that it takes place without the
knowledge of the person to whom the notice is likely to be
issued. Such an arrangement is important and the court needs
to be able to consider it on that basis. The drafting
reflects
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
court will consider a range of material: the proposed TPIM notice; a
witness statement from the Secretary of State setting out the need for
the proposed measures and obligations, and the matters that are being
taken into account in determining them; a classified statement from the
Security Service setting out the intelligence case; and an assessment
of the risk posed by the individual and the need for a TPIM notice to
manage the risk in that context. I hope that that explains the
background and the basis for the way in which such notices are drawn up
and sought, and the fact that the court will need to
consider.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000045">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I find that reassuring, because the Secretary of
State will be under enough pressure in making decisions about what is
proportionate and necessary when going to court to seek permission.
Determining whether to tell the suspect in advance would be an
additional burden. If the court seeks to rule on whether that was
flawed, that would add to the burden. The Minister’s reassurance
that it would be wholly exceptional for the suspect to be notified in
advance is
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000046">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s comments. The permission hearing will be part of a
multi-layered approach to judicial scrutiny and a preliminary safeguard
to ensure that the decision to impose measures is not “obviously
flawed”. It does not replace the full, subsequent High Court
review, during which all the evidence and information will be
scrutinised. The decision that follows the High Court review will then
be assessed from a broader
perspective.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000047">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The Minister’s comments go back to my
point. I understand that the Secretary of State will go to the court to
apply for permission for the measures to be taken, but what about
overnight residency? If that is one of the permissions for which she
asks, could someone who received a notice claim that the process was
flawed if they had not been given the opportunity to talk about an
agreed locality? I am slightly worried that the Secretary of State will
go through all that for nothing. Judicial scrutiny is important, and as
my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles has said,
litigation has been evident in the process. Is that a weakness in the
provision?<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000048">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">

                     </span>
                  </strong> I understand the hon. Gentleman’s
point. It is not a weakness in the measure or an “obvious
flaw”, to use the term in the Bill. It is not intended that the
provision and the overall framework of the Bill cover only what may be
granted when the notice is issued at the outset. There must be
contemplation of possible subsequent variations, at which point people
may engage in discussions about arrangements, and consider the
appropriate locality. I am confident that the provision is well
considered, and I pay tribute to the work of the parliamentary counsel
in achieving that.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It will be
possible to agree the locality after the notice is served, which will
be part and parcel of the stepped approach. After initial permission is
granted, the process will move forward to the service of the notice and
the directions hearing, with the full hearing thereafter. Steps will be
taken and oversight will be applied, so the process will be very much
tiered and considered.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are
confident that the drafting achieves the end results. It is based on
previous legislation, so it reflects the careful drafting that was
previously undertaken and the judicial scrutiny to which that drafting
has been subjected. Lawyers on the Committee will understand that use
of precedent and the desire to apply drafting that has previously been
considered. The court will have oversight, and we recognise the work
that has gone into preparing for that. On the basis of my comments, I
hope that the Committee will be minded to agree to the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000051">&#160;</a>

period to go beyond seven days for whatever reason, such as to instruct
representatives, the conditions for which the Secretary of State sought
permission would remain firmly in place. We would not want the suspect
to be able to deploy delaying tactics to have the conditions loosened

process of considering the relevant steps. I talked about the exchange
of witness statements and disclosure bundles, which is the sort of
normal process that is undertaken. It is the court that might consider
delaying the hearing, so the matter is not totally in the
individual’s hands. Clearly, however, with regard to the balance
of where obligations lie and the restrictions that are put in place
under a TPIM notice, it would be in the individual’s interest,
in normal circumstances, to want to progress to the full hearing so
that the restrictions that might be imposed could be considered. The
court will need to look at matters very carefully—in the initial
directions hearing, and in any further proceedings, such as procedural
hearings, that might take place before the full
hearing—to ensure that evidence is supplied 
<div class="columnNumber">

either party or a determined delay to frustrate the process, the court

will proceed to the hearing. Ultimately, ensuring that there is no such

               <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(5)(c)(ii) states that it is possible for the court to vary the
measures specified in the TPIM notice. That is a necessary power; the
individual or their representatives may argue persuasively that a
particular measure is disproportionate, and the court may wish to
change it. Presumably, the court could also vary a condition upwards
and make it more severe, if it were concerned that the original
condition was too lax. I would like reassurance from the Minister that
the provision will work both ways and that, if necessary, the court
could make a condition more severe, rather than less.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000084">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If that is
the case, I have one concern, which relates back to an earlier debate
although it is relevant to this issue. A court might be concerned that
the conditions linked to the TPIM notice were inadequate, but it could
not order the relocation of the individual to another part of the
country because, at the moment, the Bill would not allow that. The
court is not in a position to impose a curfew during the
day—that has been ruled out because a person can be forced to
remain at home only overnight—and furthermore it could not
compel circumstances in which the individual could not have 
<div class="columnNumber">

has paid tribute to his officials, and I agree with him
wholeheartedly—indeed, there are one or two familiar faces from

advise him that there is merit in the argument being put forward, but
he has to listen to that advice if it is given. Perhaps different
advice has been provided, but I am sure the Minister will listen to it
carefully. Amendment 125, which we discussed during our consideration
of schedule 1, would have given the Secretary of State—and
therefore, I presume, the court—the power to impose an
additional condition if that was considered necessary and proportionate
in particular circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000086">&#160;</a>

review hearing at which the court will consider whether the conditions

foreseeing circumstances in the review hearing in which all
information, closed and open, is available to the court and, following
an exchange between the different parties, it becomes clear that one of
the conditions is not stringent enough. There would then be a choice.
The Home Secretary could start the whole process again and re-impose
new conditions, but a quicker solution would be for the court to impose
a more stringent condition. That would imply that the Secretary of
State had started to acknowledge that there was a need for something
more stringent, but such an approach might be a speedier way of
imposing a more stringent condition than going back to the start of the
process. I acknowledge that that is unlikely, but we have to consider

effective argument about to what might happen at a review hearing.
Subsection (5)(c) gives the court the power to give directions to the
Secretary of State, while sub-paragraph (ii) allows it to direct on the
variation of the measures. I would be keen to hear from the Minister
that “variation of measures” does not automatically mean
relaxation. Let us consider the interplay with clause 12. Paragraph (a)
of clause 12(1) states that the variation could consist of
“relaxation or removal”, but the variation under
paragraph (c) could consist of the Secretary of State saying that she
needs to vary upwards rather than downwards. The power in clause
9(5)(c)(ii) is interesting, because it reads as if the court would have
the power to order a variation that could involve a more stringent
condition, rather than a relaxation, so I would be interested in the
Minister’s view of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000097">&#160;</a>

of a—I was going to say white rabbit—red herring, I am
afraid. While it is true that, under subsection (5), the
court has the power to vary the measures specified in the TPIM notice,
the exercise in which the court is engaged, as set out in subsection
(2), is essentially a review of the decision that has been reached by
the Secretary of State, as it applies the principles applicable to
judicial review. The scope of the exercise in which the court is
involved is a consideration of whether the decision is
disproportionate, irrational or subject to challenge on some other
basis. Given that scope, it is unlikely that a court would vary a TPIM
notice by imposing more onerous conditions, and doing so it would also
be contrary to the clause, as properly construed.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000104">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It would be
wholly unacceptable for an unelected judge to impose more stringent
conditions than the Executive had asked for, subject to the review of
the court. The judge would not be answerable to anyone, and that would
undermine the entire spirit of what the Bill is intended to achieve. I
hope that we will hear whether the Minister agrees. The right hon.
Gentleman is right to raise the issue, but his clever position seems to
me to be, in fact, an
impossibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000105">&#160;</a>

be carrying out a review process rather than substituting its own
decision for the Secretary of State’s, but if his argument is to
hold true, is it not the case that the relevant word in subsection
(5)(c)(ii) should be not “variation” but
“relaxation”? The very fact that
“variation” is used gives the court enough leeway to vary

“Variation” is used by lawyers to indicate that the

down an order, but to change its terms. “Relaxation”

have been considered by the Secretary of State. There is a difference.
In my view, “variation” is a generic word that covers
varying the order to make the requirements more stringent, but there is
also a specific inclusion of the word “relaxation”. I
agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman that that word is seldom used
in legal drafting, but it is in that

Members have already drawn attention to the similarity in some clauses
to the structure, wording and drafting of the 2005 Act. That is the
case in clause 9 as well, as we have learned from the experience,
oversight and structure that was previously put in place. I am advised
that that is the case for clause 12, too, so no doubt the right hon.
Member for Salford and Eccles considered the point that she raised when
the 2005 Act was being drawn up. Under a provision with similar
structure and wording to that in clause 12, I am advised that a court
has never sought to impose more severe restrictions under a control
order.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000114">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of the State, not the court, makes the TPIM notice and has
the power to vary it. Judicial oversight protects the
individual’s rights, but the role of the Secretary of State is
to protect national security. Ultimately, there is distinction between
the roles, so it is right that the terms of the TPIM notice remain for
the Secretary of State to vary. As the right hon. Lady said, it is
possible to increase the severity of the measures pursuant to clause
12(1)(c), which we shall no doubt consider later in our
proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000115">&#160;</a>

court has the power to give directions to the Secretary of State
following a review hearing. The terminology reflects the fact that,
ultimately, it must always be appropriate for the Secretary of State to
frame the terms of the measure, given his or her role for national
security and the expertise in their Department. The directions made by
the court may, however, give guidance to the Secretary of State about
the factors that he or she must take into account when setting the
measures. I hope that that was helpful by framing the structure and

what directions may be given. I know from the right hon. Lady’s
previous contributions in Committee that she is well aware of some of
the directions that courts have given in the past on the control orders
regime with regard to appropriateness, reasonableness and
proportionality. They may give directions to the Secretary of State on

account. We believe that the structure will be effective. I make no

the court directs the Secretary of State to change the conditions to
make them less stringent than those originally imposed—if the
review varies it downward—but the Secretary of State receives
information a week later from the Security Service and the police that
the individual poses an ongoing and increasing risk, and therefore
believes that the conditions need to be made more stringent, will she
be able to re-impose the earlier conditions, given that intelligence
indicates that the risk has increased, without being in contempt of the
court that directed something different a few days earlier?<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000121">&#160;</a>

may cause some confusion, so it is important to hear what the

officer and goes through what is meant by “appropriate police
force”. It is my understanding that the Association of Chief
Police Officers terrorism and allied matters committee is principally
in charge of security issues across the country, working with the
different police forces, so there are issues about the relationships. I
should preface my remarks by saying that we all agree that prosecution
is the ideal way forward, that every attempt must be made to get to
that prosecution, and that control orders as they were, or TPIMs as
they will be, should be used only if we cannot get the
prosecution.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000129">&#160;</a>

officers? In many police forces, they are not the chief officer
responsible for counter-terrorism—that perhaps is usually an
assistant chief constable. In West Yorkshire, the deputy chief
constable has that responsibility. Will the Minister tell us about the
relationships between the individual police forces, the security

add potential confusion, we will have elected police commissioners in
the future. What will their role be? What terrorism issues will he or
she be entitled to be aware of? The Minister may say that it is nothing
to do with the elected representative, but these commissioners will
feel that they have to be involved because the resources that are
required for police forces to deal with everything like the extra
surveillance will reflect on those individuals when they are held to

asked Mr Osborne about this; I regret that I did not do
so—what discussions he has had with the police on this? What
were their views on the review process? The Bill says that the process
has to be kept under continual review by the Secretary of State and the
chief police officer. Will that hinder things or make them better? I am
not sure how the clause will work, so I will be grateful if the
Minister spends a bit of time going through it and explaining its
effects.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000132">&#160;</a>

make two points, one of which is a general point. I agree with the hon.
Member for Bradford South that the clause is important. Even if it is
not acted on by the security services and the police, the temptation
under the 2005 Act with the control order regime was to consider that
once a control order had been successfully imposed on a controlee, and
once it had been challenged unsuccessfully in the courts, with the
result that the controlee remained subject to it, the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 224<a class="bkMark" name="Column224">&#160;</a>
                  </div>problem had, effectively, been dealt with—the potential terrorist
had, in the words of the Act, been controlled and it was, therefore,
unnecessary to devote a great amount of resources to gathering the
evidence necessary to ensure that a prosecution took place. The problem
had been managed and dealt with and, in those circumstances, the
temptation for the police and the security services must have been to
devote their resources, limited as they are, to defending the country
from terrorism.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One of the
salutary things the Bill does is to make it clear that it is the strong
view of Parliament and, I think, of Members on both sides of the
Committee that those subject to certain measures in the context of
Executive control—subject to the oversight of the
courts—should be prosecuted where possible. The police and the
security services should therefore be under a duty, as they are in the
Bill, to continue to collect evidence so that prosecutions can be
brought in circumstances where, one rather suspects, they might not
have been under the 2005 Act, for the simple reason that no real effort
was directed at generating the evidence necessary for prosecutions to
take place.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000135">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. and learned Gentleman is making an
important point, which goes to the essence of earlier discussions.
Government Members have sought to conclude that the Bill puts greater
emphasis on collecting evidence and bringing people to prosecution.
However, I direct the hon. and learned Gentleman’s attention to
section 8(2) of the 2005 Act, which provides that, before a control
order is made or applied for, there must be a police consultation about
whether a prosecution can be brought. Section 8(4)—I will be
putting these points to the Minister directly—is absolutely key.
It says:<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“It
shall then be the duty of the chief officer to secure that the
investigation of the individual’s conduct with a view to his
prosecution for an offence relating to terrorism is kept under review
throughout the period during which the control order has
effect.”<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
provision is identical to the one in clause 10(5)(a) of the Bill. I
have been through the Bill with a fine-toothed comb, and clause 10 is
almost a mirror image of section 8. When I make my
contribution, I will press the Minister to go through those issues in
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. and
learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham is wrong. He expresses
his view in a very erudite way and with a degree of certainty but, on
this point, he is wrong. The previous legislation provided that matters
had to be kept under review with a view to prosecution and that they
had to be constantly scrutinised. That is a key message; the previous
Government were not about housing people under control orders, but
about continuing to investigate.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000138">&#160;</a>

for her contribution and for pointing out that I am wrong. The point I
was making was that the previous measure was called a control order,
and the temptation on the part of the security services and
the police was to think that once such measures had been imposed, the
controlee was being controlled, so it was not necessary to seek to
further a prosecution, with the result that resources would be deployed
elsewhere. Names are important, and one of the salutary things the Bill
will do if it becomes law is impose an investigation 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 225<a class="bkMark" name="Column225">&#160;</a>
                  </div>measure. It makes it crystal clear that the security services and the
police should redouble their efforts after a TPIM has been imposed, to
ensure that a successful prosecution takes place. That was the only
point I was seeking to make, although I am grateful for my education on
the 2005 Act, which I have of course
read.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000139">&#160;</a>

is possible to conceive of circumstances in which an individual who is

Public Prosecutions, the procurator fiscal or the DPP for Northern
Ireland. I invite the Minister to deal with that point and to suggest
whether the Government will consider adding to subsection (8) a new

prosecuted in a court martial, the Director of Service
Prosecutions.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000145">&#160;</a>

authorities to do everything in their power to ensure that where
possible people would be arrested, charged and brought through the
criminal justice system; for evidence to be presented and tested in

intelligence and the information available. In order to maximise the
number of prosecutions, the previous Government introduced legislation
related to a series of new offences, such as acts preparatory to
terrorism and acts facilitating, encouraging and glorifying terrorism.
That was an attempt to go upstream of the criminal regime to try to
catch as many people as possible in the conventional criminal justice
system. There may well be cases where the intelligence available is not
sufficient to formulate a criminal charge. The intelligence may be bits
of a jigsaw that come together, on which people then take an opinion
and make a recommendation, which may not constitute a criminal offence
even when we have gone as far upstream as we can with facilitating and
encouraging.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000154">&#160;</a>

currently stipulated, so there may well be such circumstances. I am not
aware that there ever were such circumstances, so that may be a
drafting point. The emphasis in section 8 is largely mirrored in
clause 10 of the Bill. For example, clause 10(2) is a repeat
of section 8(2) of the 2005 Act. Clause 10(5), other than paragraph

being the one investigating the offence. If there is an offence, there
will be an ongoing investigation and the Home Secretary will have to
continue to consult the chief officer of that area.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000163">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The chief
officer may not, however, be the chief constable of the area where the
individual resides when they are subject to the TPIM notice. I detect
the potential at least for a slight conflict. The chief constable who
is responsible for the ongoing investigation may want less stringent
conditions imposed to allow more flexibility and freedom to move, fewer
exclusions, and less barring on different associations. He may have an
interest in a more flexible approach to the conditions than is wanted
by the chief constable responsible for the surveillance and oversight
of the individual in the place where they are residing. Understandably,
that chief constable might want conditions, overnight residence, and
exclusions and associations conditions to be as strict and stringent as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have great
respect for chief officers of police and I am sure that they would have
ways of resolving many such issues, but the Minister must be able to
see the potential for a conflict of interests. If a chief constable who
is responsible for an ongoing investigation has a different view from
the chief constable in the area where the individual resides when
subject to the TPIM notice, how would that be resolved? Would it be the
responsibility of the Secretary of State to make a decision? I can
imagine some real difficulties, because that would begin to stray into
operational policing matters, and it would not, of course, be
appropriate for the Secretary of State to involve herself in those
kinds of decisions. I would be interested to hear the Minister’s
comments on how the Secretary of State would resolve a conflict of
interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000165">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I want to say how good the 2005 Act was in the
circumstances of the time. I supported it as a member of the public,
because it was introduced fast and properly to try to deal with a
specific situation. I do not have a problem with the fact that there is
replication of the 2005 Act in some of the clauses in the Bill, because
that is a compliment to the original drafters, the right hon. Member
for Salford and Eccles and other Members who were involved. I do not
have a problem with cribbing sections. As we go through the Bill, we
shall see that there are differences between it and the Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000166">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I think of
TPIMs as a slightly more sophisticated and measured way to build on the
2005 Act with the passage of time. I thank the Opposition for the way
in which they acted in 2005, which was entirely proper. I have no
difficulty whatever with taking little bits of the Act to put in the
Bill, because all of us in Committee and throughout Parliament are
trying to do our best to make good law. TPIMs are a step
change—they are different because of the different environment,
so I hope that they will be good law, building on the 2005
Act, which was excellent at the
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000167">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We have had a useful debate on clause 10,
which relates to criminal investigations into terrorism-related
activity. As I have said in previous sittings, we are absolutely
committed to the priority of investigating and prosecuting suspected
terrorists. The best place for a terrorist is a prison cell; I think we
all agree on that. The police and the security and intelligence 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 229<a class="bkMark" name="Column229">&#160;</a>
                  </div>agencies work tirelessly with the Crown Prosecution
Service to investigate and prosecute those whom they suspect of being
guilty of terror offences and to put them in prison if they
are convicted. Right hon. and hon. Members recognise that, and I
emphasise it once more.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We accept
that there are—and, sadly, will continue to be—dangerous
individuals whom, despite our best efforts, we can neither prosecute
nor, if they are foreign nationals, deport. That is a challenge with
which we and previous Governments have wrestled, which is why we
believe that there is a need for preventive measures to protect the
public from the threat posed by that small number of dangerous
individuals. We believe that the provisions in the Bill represent the
most appropriate, proportionate and effective powers for dealing with
that risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000169">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There should
be no doubt about our unwavering and absolute commitment to
investigation and prosecution where possible. The hon. Member for
Birmingham, Ladywood has commented on my focus on context and, again, I
apologise to her for discussing it. Investigation and assessment take
place before a TPIM is obtained, in the same way as for control orders.
A decision has to be made at a certain point about whether there is
sufficient admissible evidence to bring a prosecution, and of course we
will always apply that so that if the evidence is there, a prosecution
can be brought.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000170">&#160;</a>

motivation. Once a TPIM

			Column number: 230<a class="bkMark" name="Column230">&#160;</a>
                  </div>notice has been obtained, we must do all that we can to continue the
investigation of an individual’s conduct to see whether further
evidence or information can be obtained about previous or subsequent
activity. We must consider the context of what happens before the TPIM
notice and the context of what happens thereafter.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000172">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
similarities between the provisions in the Bill and those in the 2005
Act, and I make no apologies for that. What is important, however, is
the consultation that we envisage, and the requirement for the report
to the Secretary of State on the ongoing review of each investigation.
Such framing of the legislation is an important way of keeping
everyone’s mind focused on our continuing desire to bring people
to justice where appropriate; to bring people before the courts where
appropriate; and to do our utmost to prosecute individuals where there
is evidence that we can adduce and bring before the court. Clause 10
requires consultation with the police, before the imposition of a TPIM
notice, about the question of whether there is evidence available that
could realistically be used for the purposes of prosecuting the
individual for an offence relating to terrorism. That provision
reflects the 2005 Act. The police must consult the Crown Prosecution
Service on that matter before responding to the Secretary of State.
That provision will ensure that a TPIM notice is not imposed on an
individual when prosecution for a terrorism-related offence is
viable.<a class="bkMark" name="11063051000173">&#160;</a>
