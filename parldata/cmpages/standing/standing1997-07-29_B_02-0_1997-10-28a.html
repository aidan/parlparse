<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the benefit of the Committee I will repeat the advice that I gave at the end of the sitting before the recess: there are financial resolutions in connection with the Bill and copies are available in the Room; my co-Chairman and I would like adequate notice of amendments to be given and, as a general rule, we shall be reluctant to call starred amendments.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of functions to Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns </B>(West Chelmsford): I beg to move amendment No. 1 in page 1, line 18, at end insert--`;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and the Secretary of State shall report to Parliament on his exercise of those funcitons within twelve months of the date of their transfer.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 As we said prior to the summer recess, we intend to act as constructive but robust opposition in the Committee. It would be difficult for the Opposition to oppose much of the content of the Bill because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) said on Second Reading, it should be better known as the ``Peter Lilley memorial Bill''. The Bill will, however, make changes that cause the Opposition grave concern and we want to probe the Government further on their intentions.
<P>
	As we said on the first sitting, many of the changes will be made not by the Bill but through regulations, which I suspect we will not see in draft form during the proceedings of the Committee. We are being asked to approve a pig in a poke because we will not know the small print of those regulations or the detail of how the Government will seek to use their powers.
<P>
 Furthermore, as the Bill is being piloted by a new Government, who seem a little unsure of the detail of many issues involved in reforming the welfare state, it would have been appropriate for them to have conducted a consultation process, if not published a White Paper, so that the complicated and far-reaching provisions of the Bill could have been discussed further before rushing into legislation. I was interested to see that a significant number of Government amendments have already been tabled, which suggests that during the summer months the Government realised that the Bill was drafted in a hurry and they have had to table amendments to deal with points that they have missed or which have not properly been drafted. The Bill smacks of having been drafted in a hurry, which could imply that the Government are trying to rush it through Parliament, which in turns implies that it contains controversial clauses. As the Bill develops--I would not say unravels--I am sure that a number of interesting arguments will develop.
<P>
	Clause 1 appears to be symbolic of many of the clauses: it is vague and imprecise and raises several important questions about accountability which need to be examined in detail. The full significance of accountability did not hit me until I heard an interesting exchange on the ``Today'' programme last week with the Secretary of State, who was trying to steal a march by soundbite. It was not a soundbite based on careful research, but one in which she sought through disingenuous means to hoodwink the British public about the new deal for lone parents. The Government had not paid full attention to the facts, and the interview and the preamble by my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green showed just what risks they are prepared to take for a soundbite and some press coverage. The interview was a shambles and I was amazed by the fact that the Secretary of State was prepared to compound her pitiful performance on the ``Today'' programme by appearing on ``Newsnight'' later in the day. To err once is unfortunate; to err twice in the same day is downright unforgivable. That brings home to us the importance of holding the Government accountable for their actions. They will take any steps to produce a soundbite to persuade the British people of apparent policy successes that do not actually exist. That is why the clause, which seems so innocuous, is, in many ways, at the heart of part I of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 1 creates a single-status decision maker. The Opposition support the aim of streamlining the decision-making process and the proposal to introduce a single-status decision maker. By introducing those measures, the Bill abolishes the current distinction between the Secretary of State's decisions, which are largely administrative, and decisions that are taken at arm's length by independent adjudication officers, which are appealable to a tribunal. Several issues, which I want to explore further, are wrapped up in that arrangement.
<P>
Government agencies will take on the responsibility of adjudicating on disputes in which one of the parties will be a Government agency. In effect, therefore, the clause makes provision to extend greatly the power of agency chief executives. On one level, it could be argued that that represents a conflict of interest. How the new system deals with that argument and the new pressures that arise need to be monitored. That is the logic that underpins the amendment.
<P>
In the amendment, the Opposition ask that the transfer of functions should be subject to a report by the Secretary of State within 12 months of their transfer to detail how the new system operates. As Labour Members will appreciate and as the two Ministers will, I hope, accept, when the Government came to power on 1 May they made a great play of introducing a new wave of open government and of accountability to the people. If my memory serves me correctly, we are now the servants of the people. If we are accountable to the people, we must be truly accountable to them. I hope, therefore, that, in the new spirit of open government and accountability, Ministers will find the amendment attractive. I hope that they, too, will want to enhance the means of accountability governing the powers that they are taking in legislation and offering to the people.
<P>
Currently, the chief adjudication officer draws up guidance notes for the adjudicating officers under advisement from Department of Social Security solicitors. I believe that that function will be transferred to chief executives. The guidance notes will, however, need to be framed in exactly the same context as they are now and the chief executives will need to maintain total objectivity when they finalise the guidelines. If they are slightly distorted, that will be reflected in the outcome of some decisions.
<P>
Bringing responsibility for adjudication and guidelines in-house gives rise to the possibility of a conflict of interest. That possibility needs to be scrutinised to discover whether it might have an adverse effect on the decision-making process. As the system stands, there is a degree of independence between the two organisations involved. When the responsibilities of the adjudication service are absorbed by an agency, I would like to feel confident that none of the qualities that are associated with either organisation would be diluted. That means that the adjudication of disputes and subsequent decisions would still be taken objectively, free from the immediate political and managerial influences that may be a factor in taking a decision within an agency. In saying that, I am echoing the 1996 Green Paper ``Improving Decision Making and Appeals in Social Security'', which stated in paragraph 4.12:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In devising a new system, the strength of the current system--for example, the freedom from Ministerial influence on a day-to-day basis--will need to be maintained . . . If customers are to trust the new arrangements they must be satisfied that there can be no question of personal bias or patronage.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A concern was reflected in the response to the Green Paper of Roy Sainsbury who found:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The importance of independence for officers responsible for making decisions and for public confidence was stressed repeatedly in the submissions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Most decisions about benefit entitlement are taken by independent adjudication officers under the direction of the chief adjudication officer. The role and function of the CAO also extends to monitoring standards, resulting in written formal annual reports. It is essential for that monitoring process to continue--hence our amendment today.
<P>
As a minimum requirement it is imperative that the Secretary of State delivers a detailed report on the success or otherwise of changes to the system as prescribed in the clause. With such a report we could gauge whether the transfer was implemented well and whether the new system was operating successfully. Clearly, Members on both sides of the Committee want the system to operate as successfully as possible in the best interests of those who are affected by the decisions. That is why there should also be an appeal to Ministers to ensure accountability.
<P>
I know that the Labour party--certainly the Government--find Parliament to be an irritant which should be brushed aside whenever possible. However, Parliament is crucial--despite the views of the Prime Minister. Parliament must have the opportunity--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It has come to my attention that a member of the Committee is smoking, which is strictly against the rules. I am sure that he will cease smoking forthwith--[Interruption.] The honourable Gentleman must put his cigarette out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The amendment would give Parliament the opportunity to develop the monitoring procedure and to target specifically the role of agencies and chief executives. However, without a report, such a critical evaluation would be impossible. I am not making an obscure demand, but one that reflects common concerns among interested parties.
<P>
In the past few weeks, members of the Committee will have received a number of briefings from organisations such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which feel strongly that there should be accountability to Parliament and that the proposed system is accountable once the powers in the clause are exercised. It is crucial for the objectivity and accountability of decision making to have in place a system whereby the transfer of powers can be monitored and--most importantly--presented in a report to Parliament.
<P>
As I said earlier, the Government have made much of their intention to be an open government. On Second Reading, the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) made the important statement that the Government were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``seeking comprehensive ways of monitoring the system in the future to ensure that it is accountable to Parliament''.--[Official Report, 22 July; Vol. 298, c.851.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He has just reiterated his support by nodding, so I hope that he will find the amendment attractive and that he will be able to support it.
<P>
The Minister could say, probably with some justification, that, from a parliamentary draftsman's point of view, the amendment is not drafted as well as it could have been. But if he were prepared to accept the principle of our argument, I am sure that the draftsmen at the Department of Social Security would come up with a better drafted amendment which could be tabled on Report, or even in the other place.
<P>
Our amendment presents the Government with an ideal opportunity to show that they occasionally match rhetoric with reality. Failure to do so will not instill the public with any great confidence that the sweeping changes that the Secretary of State is making will improve decision making. Although the new Government appear to have an aversion to being cross-examined on the Floor of the House, it is important that they recognise that that is how a Government should behave--how they should be accountable to Parliament.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government owe a duty to the people to face examination of their decisions and policies. At the very least, the Secretary of State, whoever it may be in 12 months' time, should be prepared to face questions on the effectiveness of the single-status decision maker and, in particular, whether citizens' rights have been adversely affected by the sweeping transfer of power.
<P>
When the Minister has listened to the arguments put forward by the Opposition, I hope that he will be convinced that a genuine and overriding case has been made. I also hope that the Government will live up to their rhetoric on open government and accountability to the people and accept the merits of the amendment. Even if he will not accept the wording of the amendment--he may think that, from a drafting point of view, it could be improved--I hope that he will accept the principle and agree that the amendment is a constructive contribution to improving the Bill before it affects the lives of many people in this country.

<P>

<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): The Liberal Democrats broadly support the thinking behind the amendment. We have two principal worries about the clause and believe that the amendment goes some way towards addressing them, though we should like it to go further.
<P>
First, we are concerned about the clause's effects on the independence of social security decision making and the appeals process. As we understand it, decision making under the proposed regime will be the responsibility of the Secretary of State, delegated to the chief executives of the various agencies. Chief executives will, wearing one hat, be responsible for overseeing decision making and, wearing another, be responsible for meeting a business plan, performance targets, cutting costs and so forth.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) was right to point out the potential conflict of interest. That is why we tabled an amendment suggesting that an independent person oversee the adjudication service. We will table it again as a new clause.
<P>
We are grateful to the Minister for his letter to members of the Committee setting out explanatory notes on the independence of the appeals process and on the guidance that will be offered under the new regime. To some extent, it is reassuring. There are to be new safeguards--new processes--for ensuring that appeals and decision making are more effectively monitored. But those things could and should happen anyway. I am surprised that the agencies do not already do many of the things that they will be asked to do. The decision-making process does not need to be less independent for them to do so. So, although I am pleased that such things will happen, we are not reassured that adjudication and decision making will necessarily be as independent as we would wish.
<P>
Furthermore, and in particular, the Minister's letter refers to the guidance that will be given to adjudication officers. That is an issue of particular concern, as independence is crucial. Guidance is, by definition, for grey areas. If the matter were clear cut, we would not need guidance. Yet the guidance will come from the chief executive of the Benefits Agency or the Child Support Agency--the very person who has this conflict of interest. The note from the Minister provides very little reassurance that the guidance will be fair and independent, and will be seen to be independent.
<P>
We welcome the amendment, which would require the Secretary of State to report back after the first year of operation of the new system. However, we would like that exercise to go much further by requiring an annual report, for example.
<P>
Our second concern on clause 1--contracting out--is not dealt with by the amendment. We shall debate that point more substantively when we reach clause stand part.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that we should come on to that at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Okay, Mr. O'Hara. Our principle concern with large sections of this part of the Bill comes back to independence. I recently attended a conference on the appeals process organised by the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies. It was addressed by, among others, Roy Sainsbury, who reviewed the evidence given in response to the Government's Green Paper on appeals procedures. It would be unfair to name specific speakers at the conference, but it was the general consensus that the Bill contained inadequate safeguards for independence. Therefore, although we shall support the amendment, we believe that much greater safeguards are needed to preserve the independence of the decision-making process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): May I begin by saying what a pleasure it is to serve once again under your splendid chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara? I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford and also the amendment that stands in my name, among others.
<P>
This is an unobjectionable amendment, and I hope that the Government will have no difficulty in accepting it at the end of what I believe will be a short debate. We are simply asking for an extra safeguard in the form of a report to this House which would show how matters have developed once the legislation comes into force.
<P>
We all agree that the current distinction between adjudication officers and decisions made by officers acting in the name of the Secretary of State is, to use the word of the Law Society, ``insupportable''. The distinction makes no sense and serves no practical purpose. As the Law Society goes on to say in its brief, the Committee's job on this issue is to try its best to ensure that there is full and proper independence and accountability in respect of the decisions that will be made under the new procedures. There are some quite radical departures inherent in clause 1, and it is right that there should be a specific way of reporting to this House precisely how matters develop.
<P>
The Law Society also states that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``opposes any such change which would have the effect of reducing claimants' rights of appeal, or of compromising the independence, accountability and quality control of decision-making.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I endorse those words. Quality control is the key to the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford.
<P>
Lest Members of the Committee think that we draw support for our amendment from a narrow band of opinion, the Child Poverty Action Group also produced a detailed and excellent briefing on the Bill. It also supports the clear purpose of the previous Government, endorsed and taken forward by the new Government, to simplify the system. Nobody can quibble with that objective. However, it expresses its concern at the loss of independence, of which we have heard already. It also wants to ensure that the Bill has quality standards and methods by which those standards can be ensured in practice.
<P>
The briefing goes on to note that the chief adjudication officer currently issues annual reports on the quality of decision making, as the Minister mentioned on Second Reading. It states that the National Audit Office will also continue to have a role in monitoring and reporting to Parliament, and that the president of the tribunal service will report on the standard of decision making in cases that go to appeal.
<P>
We all know, however, that the National Audit Office has many calls on its time and resources. The Child Poverty Action Group points out that the NAO is unlikely to be able to do more than a few in-depth studies each year; it also talks about the president of the tribunal service having a ``valuable but limited insight'', because of course he or she will be able to be involved in only those cases that get to tribunals in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Child Poverty Action Group's briefing--which I think we would all agree is excellent--and talked about some of the safeguards therein mentioned as being annual. Why does not the amendment require an annual report instead of a one-off report?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The thinking behind the amendment stems from our desire to be reasonable and to make it likely to be accepted by the Minister. To impose the burden of a report every year for the rest of time would be excessive--that is why we have not suggested it. After 12 months of operation, it should be perfectly feasible to examine what has been going wrong--and right--in practice so that the House can hold a debate, but to impose such an obligation year after year is the sort of meddlesome, excessive and unnecessary bureaucracy of which the Liberal Democrats are so enamoured.
<P>
In conclusion, I endorse all the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford. The amendment is sensible, practical and designed to be constructive, and I hope that the Minister will see it in that light.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Keith Bradley): May I welcome you back to the Chair after the summer recess, Mr. O'Hara? Indeed, I welcome all hon. Members back to what should be an interesting few weeks in Committee while we scrutinise what the hon. Member for West Chelmsford predictably called the ``Peter Lilley memorial Bill'' and went on to describe as a pig in a poke.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Before the Minister starts to rewrite what I said in the hope that it will become fact, what I described as a pig in a poke were the unseen regulations that the Bill gives the Government power to produce. I called not the Bill but the regulations a pig in a poke; I assume that the Government will not produce them in draft form before the Bill has completed its passage through the House. We will thus be unable to see the fine detail of the considerable powers to be contained in those regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman has clarified his position with regard to the former Secretary of State. He also noted that the Government have already tabled a series of amendments to the Bill, which is in accordance with our wish to get the Bill into the public domain and to use the period between Second Reading and the Committee stage to listen to the views of interested parties and ensure that corrections and changes are made so that they can be properly debated in Committee.
<P>
I see it as a virtue that we have been able to table the amendments and to inform Opposition Members of them in good time, so that they have the opportunity to comment on them in Committee. We have not left them to be debated on Report and Third Reading, although in the past vast tranches of Government amendments were tabled at those late stages.
<P>
The amendment would require the Secretary of State to report to Parliament on the functions that clause 1 would transfer to her--all decisions on social security benefits, social fund payments and child support assessments.
<P>
Clause 1, which the hon. Member for West Chelmsford describes as vague, is very clear. It transfers the functions of independent adjudication officers, social fund officers and child support officers to the Secretary of State. The details of the new responsibilities flow through the remainder of the Bill. The Committee will have every opportunity to debate how the new responsibilities will work as it scrutinises the Bill's 77 clauses.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I partly accept the Minister's argument that the clause flows through the remainder of the Bill. He will be aware, however, as Conservative Members are, that many of the Bill's powers, and part of the flow-through process, will be contained in regulations that the Committee has not seen and presumably will not see. The Minister makes the valid point that he wishes hon. Members to be consulted and to have as much information as possible. Will he categorically assure the Committee that he will put before it the content of the draft regulations, to enhance its examination of the Bill, and to ensure that it has a better idea of the Government's intentions on the flow-through of powers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman protests too much. As I said in the first sitting, the previous Government's record on regulating power was absolutely appalling. I worked on many Bills when in opposition. The regulations introduced by the previous Government were always substantially longer than the primary legislation. The Jobseekers Bill had 164 pages--twice as many as this Bill. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford should be very careful about pressing his point on regulations too far. The Committee will be able to debate clauses that specifically propose regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> May I press the Minister to go a little further? It is no good attempting to rubbish the previous Government's record--that is all in the past. Despite the spin doctoring and perversion of news, the Labour party is meant to be the party of open government. Why will not the Minister answer the Opposition's serious worries, shared by organisations such as the Child Poverty Action Group, which has spoken of the ``skeletal nature of the Bill''?
<P>
That organisation and others have expressed anxieties about the Bill and a desire to see the regulations, at least in draft. We have had a very long summer break. I am surprised that the Minister and his civil servants have not been able to do their homework.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that, through the ad hoc committee that was set up to help the Government to ensure that the Bill is implemented effectively, and in which we have invited the Child Poverty Action Group to participate, there will be sufficient time to scrutinise the regulations that will flow from the primary legislation. That will be done, within Parliament and externally, under the normal delegated powers and through the Scrutiny Committee, which must always examine, in the first instance, regulations that flow from primary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister elaborate on what he means by the rather high-falutin' expression, ``in the appropriate manner''? Does he mean that there will be an opportunity after the passage of the Bill to discuss the regulations? In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson), he said there would be an opportunity to discuss the nature of the regulations when we reached the relevant parts of the Bill. Does that mean that, by that stage, he will know the content of the regulations? If so, the Committee should be able to see the draft regulations. We would then be able to discuss them in detail, instead of discussing what the Minister reveals in his speeches. Why cannot we see the draft regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I do not wish to labour the point, but regulations are always considered by the Scrutiny Committee. We will introduce the regulations at the appropriate time, to support the primary legislation. The hon. Gentleman's protestations may continue, but we will introduce the regulations in an orderly manner once the Bill is enacted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister keeps saying ``at the appropriate time''. I can only conclude that that means that the Committee cannot see draft regulations during its consideration of the Bill. He also says that that is what always happens. During consideration of the Asylum and Immigration Bill in 1996, the then Opposition pressed very hard for the Committee to see the draft regulations. They did so because of the far-reaching nature of the powers that the regulations proposed, and to allow the Committee to reach a proper view of the then Government's proposals. At that time, Ministers agreed to the wishes of the Opposition and produced those draft regulations.
<P>
This Bill's regulations will also be far reaching. I must ask the Minister again why we cannot see the draft regulations when we debate the relevant sections of the Bill. The Government pay a great deal of lip service to open government; in the spirit of open government, they should let us see the regulations. The Minister knows as well as I do that once the Bill is on the statute book it will not matter if people dislike some of the powers in the regulations. The Government will use their majority to steamroll the regulations through the House under the negative resolution procedure, unless they accept our amendments on statutory instrument powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> We intend to explain how we will use those regulations when we reach the clauses that specifically deal with them. The Committee will have the opportunity to debate and scrutinise the Government's intentions at that time. We will propose the draft regulations when it is possible to do so within the time available to the Committee. I will not say that that will be practical or possible for all the regulations that will flow from the primary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I suspect that we will return to this important point many times.
<P>
The Minister referred to the Scrutiny Committee, which I assume to be the Joint Committee of both Houses that considers statutory instruments. I spent most of the previous Parliament serving on that Committee, which is a kind of Devil's island of parliamentary procedure. It considers about 3,000 statutory instruments every year. The regulations do not permit it to consider the merits of any of those instruments--merely their form, whether they exceed their powers and whether their drafting is defective. From the point of view of the Minister, the Scrutiny Committee is not the right forum to consider the merits and demerits of regulations, which is why it is even more important that the regulations are available during the life of this Committee, at least in draft form; we appreciate that they may change later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I have made the Government's attitude clear. I am saying not that such draft regulations as are ready will not be available to the Committee but that there will be adequate opportunity to explore the intentions of the regulations. That is far more than was ever afforded to us by the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for having listened to our arguments. We have managed to tease out of him a concession, albeit a small one, but may I appeal to his generosity and ask him to go a little further? Will we see some of the regulations in draft form, and, if so, which ones? What proportion of the regulations does he anticipate will be at that stage? If he understands the intentions of the regulations during the Committee's consideration of the Bill, will he ensure that the draft regulations are as comprehensive as possible, so that the Committee can examine the Government's intentions in detail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman should have quit while he thought that he was winning, and accepted what I said. Those regulations that are available will be made available to the Committee. It is important that members of the Committee have the opportunity to debate the intentions of the regulations.
<P>
The intentions of the clause are clear. The law currently requires some decisions to be made by the Secretary of State, which in practice means officers acting on her behalf, and other decisions to be made by specified officers. Frequently, different aspects of the same claim must be handled differently.
<P>
Benefits Agency staff to whom I have spoken have told me that they find the split between independent decision makers and those acting on behalf of the Secretary of State completely irrelevant to their task. The provisions of the Bill are designed to modernise and streamline decision-making systems, enabling staff to provide a much-improved service. I welcome the comments of hon. Members who have supported that intention.
<P>
The proposed amendment appears to require the Secretary of State to report to Parliament on the new decision-making system in the first year of transfer. I assure the Committee that we fully intend to supervise the introduction of new systems and the quality of decision making. We want to evaluate the new system and, as an open Government, as the hon. Member for West Chelmsford said, we want to be open about our conclusions. The Secretary of State and agency chief executives will issue reports on quality standards and on the operation of the systems each year, and not only in the first year of operation.
<P>
It may help if I give a flavour of what those new reports may contain. The Secretary of State through chief executives, will be responsible for the quality of all agency procedures. The chief executives will monitor, for example, performance in difficult areas where the rules are complicated.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) said that guidance would apply only to grey areas. The Government, however, believe that guidance is important to ensure consistency, quality and efficiency in the decision-making process.
<P>
The chief executives will have clear performance and quality standards to achieve, and they will be held firmly to account by the Secretary of State. Their reports will include details of the quality standards achieved and of the operation of the scheme more generally.
<P>
In addition, there will be procedures in place to ensure that the monitoring process works effectively. First, there will be systems in place to double check a sample of initial decisions. There will also be central quality assurance teams within the agencies that will--as it were--check the checkers and report on the standards of the monitoring process to agency chief executives. Most importantly, the results of such checks will be reported to a high-level assurance committee established within each agency, which will ensure that remedial action is prompted when necessary. The results will be reported annually and publicly. The Government believe that such quality assurance committees, set up to meet the differing needs of each agency, will give confidence and reassurance to the public so that the decision-making process is efficient, and that the committees' reports will be made public and accountable to Parliament.

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the annual reports on the new regime will be subsections of the annual reports of the agencies, as distinct from the separate reports, going into great detail, that we currently receive from the chief adjudication officer? Will such reports have to be fitted in with all the other matters that agencies have to report on each year, or will they be major, detailed exercises in their own right?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The importance of the reports is that they will give the public confidence in the decision-making process, and that requires that firstly, they be published and, secondly, they be mentioned separately to enable them to be scrutinised properly.
<P>
There will be other reports apart from the ones that I have mentioned. The president of the appeals tribunal will supply reports to the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions in schedule 1, paragraph 9. The reports will include a section on the quality of the decisions made in the agencies.
<P>
In addition, the National Audit Office will continue to audit the accuracy of payments that flow from the agencies' decisions, and to report on any areas of weakness. The Government are discussing with the office how its role might be enhanced, especially in the early stages of the new scheme. The ad hoc committee on the implementation of the Bill will also examine the effectiveness of the monitoring in practice.
<P>
The measures that I have outlined will amount to a comprehensive library of reports, and I hope that the Committee will be assured of our determination to make information available. The Government do not see the need, however, to include such reporting arrangements in the Bill. They are administrative matters and are best dealt with as such.
<P>
I have outlined the procedures by which the reports will be produced and, given those assurances, I urge the hon. Member for West Chelmsford to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member for West Chelmsford responds, I advise the Committee that, given the extended debate on the amendment and its relationship to the clause as a whole, I am minded that the clause should stand part without further debate.
<P>
I have also received a request for the windows to be closed, as it is cold in the Room. I must, therefore, suspend the Committee for five minutes or for as long as it takes to close the windows. During that time the hon. Member for West Chelmsford may reflect on my ruling.
<P>
<H5>11.18 am</H5>

<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>11.25 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I trust that members of the Committee--particularly those who need the comfort of nicotine-- enjoyed that break.
<P>
I regret to announce that ladders are needed to reach the upper windows, so they cannot be closed until the end of the sitting. Perhaps those who are in shirt sleeves might find it more comfortable to put their jackets on, although that is a matter for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I understand your ruling on the clause 1 stand part debate. However, we will come to other more controversial clauses where we may wish to test your patience and generosity by asking for clause stand part debates. That will depend on how our debates unravel in future sittings.
<P>
I am genuinely grateful to the Minister for accepting the logic of the arguments behind the amendment made by all Members on the Opposition Benches who have spoken in its support and on the need for greater accountability. The Minister outlined in great detail the internal procedures that the Government propose to adopt to monitor and evaluate the workings of the transfer of power, and he described the variety of documents that will be produced to make public the results of the monitoring exercises. That is to be welcomed.
<P>
My disappointment derives from the fact that the Minister has not thought it fit to enshrine this small amendment in the Bill. Although I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister's assurances, in years to come different Ministers may take different views. Given the overwhelming strength of the argument that the Minister has accepted, it would be preferable to have a belt-and-braces operation to make sure that we had a statutory requirement and did not have to rely simply on the good will of the Government and on the Minister's assurances--assurances which I in no way belittle. The Minister has accepted our argument and is prepared to do something to meet it, so I had hoped that he would incorporate the amendment in the Bill.
<P>
I am also concerned by the Minister's point about the regulations. I know that he will not welcome my returning to the issue, but it is important to my hon. Friends and, I suspect, to the hon. Member for Newbury. We must see as much as possible of the Government's intentions in the regulations, but I am disappointed that the Minister cannot give a categorical assurance that we will be able to see the draft regulations provided for throughout the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> May I remind the hon. Gentleman of what I said? I said that we expect the intentions in the regulations to be made clear to the Committee. However, the detail of how the intentions will be implemented in regulations may not be available to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister has slightly anticipated my comments. I welcome his assurance that, when possible during our proceedings, he will try to produce draft regulations. If the Government know the intention of the regulations, why cannot they provide them in draft form? I fear that we shall get no further with that point.
<P>
The Minister has partly dealt with our anxieties. We look forward to examining the draft regulations that the Minister is able to produce and to learning the intentions behind other regulations. We shall study them with great care.
<P>
In the light of the Minister's comments--
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is about to withdraw the amendment, so I should like to make a further comment, partly in lieu of a stand part debate.
<P>
The amendment does not tackle the second problem with clause 1. The clause paves the way for privatisation of adjudication officers' functions. That is a major problem. The Bill should include safeguards, or there should be a discussion of the implications of such privatisation. Under clause 1, adjudication officers' activities could be contracted out to the private sector. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain the wider implications of that during the Bill's passage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> We welcome the Minister's assurance about the way in which he will make the clause's powers accountable. However, we are worried because the Minister is not prepared to go the whole hog and accept the amendment, even if its drafting is revised. We shall return to the subject later during the Bill's passage through the House, so I shall not press the amendment. With the caveat that we would like to raise the matter again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Use of Computers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 1, line 19, after `made', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or certificate falling to be issued'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> First, I should like to consider amendments Nos. 45, 47 and 48, which deal with the inclusion of the recovery of benefits scheme in clause 2.
<P>
It was always the intention that the powers in clause 2 would be comprehensive across the whole spread of the Department's operations. The amendments provide for the issue of a certificate under the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 to be included in clause 2. The provision will enable computers to be programmed to issue certificates of recoverable benefits, as well as to make decisions on social security, child support and war pensions issues.
<P>
The Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 provides for compensators to repay benefits paid because of an accident, injury or disease in cases where compensation is paid in respect of that accident, injury or disease. The person making the compensation payment must apply to the Secretary of State for a certificate of the amount of recoverable benefit prior to making the payment. That is a straightforward calculation of benefit received over a certain period of time and is best performed by computer.
<P>
Amendment No. 46 is essentially technical. It ensures that clause 2 will apply to the full range of decisions on social security issues. The current wording allows for any decision taken under a relevant enactment to be made by computer; that is, decisions on benefits and other social security matters taken under the various social security Acts. It is not, however, absolutely clear that decisions taken under regulations drawn up under the primary powers are also covered in the new provisions.
<P>
The addition of the words ``or by virtue of'' brings the wording of the clause into line with that of clause 9(1)(c). The amendment ensures that automated decision taking can apply not only to decisions taken directly under the primary powers but also to decisions taken under secondary legislation. The amendments ensure that the powers in clause 2 are sufficiently comprehensive and flexible and I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): First, I should like to thank you, Mr. O'Hara, for your efforts to make us warmer. Unfortunately, sitting here is like being in an aircraft hangar because of the increased noise of the heaters.
<P>
I shall try to speak generally about the use of computers in the next amendment, No. 30. I do not wish to comment on amendments Nos. 45, 47 and 48, but amendment No. 46, as the Minister said, substantially widens the effect of clause 2, which, for reasons that I shall expound in promoting amendment No. 30, is obnoxious to some of us.
<P>
As we heard in a previous discussion, the effect of amendment No. 46 will be that regulations that will not have been seen by the Committee, and may be passed by negative resolution, may have effects which will then be implemented by decisions taken by computers. Therefore we have not only the idea of a computer taking a decision but the idea of a computer taking a decision about things on which the Committee has not taken a view in advance. That will extend the role of the computer beyond tolerable limits, as I shall expound in our debate on amendment No. 30. Before we move in that direction, I hope that the Government will listen to my arguments on that amendment and, if they are satisfied by them, will not use computers to take decisions in the way permitted by amendment No. 46.

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I appreciate that the hon.

I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman's amendment by giving him as much detail as I can about how the measure will work in practice. It would be inappropriate to stray into that territory now. With that assurance, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments and move quickly to discuss amendment No. 30.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I apologise for detaining hon. Members possibly at some length on a subject which may appear to be an eccentric worry, as it did to some on Second Reading when a Labour Member and I raised the issue. However, I hope that by the end of my remarks I shall have succeeded in persuading the Government that these are not eccentric worries. They certainly are not partisan and would apply quite as much were the Government of a different hue. They relate to the role of Parliament which, above all, consists in seeing beyond the administrative convenience which often governs many propositions in statute, certainly this one, to the more general effects which a proposition encoded in statute law will have on administration and the law.
<P>
I hope that the Government may be willing to reconsider their position on this matter in the light of my remarks because if clause 2 remains in its current form they would be taking an action which neither this nor subsequent Governments of any political hue would regard as beneficial. If clause 2 is not changed I can envisage learned academics five or ten years from now writing articles of great astonishment pointing out that it was an extraordinary omission by Parliament not to consider the knock-on effects of the clause and accept the amendment. Those academics are all too likely to ignore the fact that the Opposition did try to amend it. I hope that at least the Government may avoid that outcome by paying attention now.
<P>
There are three reasons why the clause is deleterious and therefore three reasons why the amendment is advantageous. The first concerns the character of the administration of social security itself. All hon. Members will have been unwilling, or at any rate involuntary, participants in constituency cases where individuals are faced with the awesome might of the Department of Social Security. As everyone knows, and as is inevitable, the Department of Social Security is a remarkable monolith viewed from the perspective of an often not particularly well-equipped individual who has to deal with it and finds the whole experience daunting.
<P>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will also have seen that the usual practice of the Department in responding to much of its correspondence is to tick certain boxes in pre-established form letters explaining why, for example, a person has been denied severe disability allowance or living disability allowance in circumstances which are often puzzling, if not astonishing to the individual concerned. I have a constituent who has been granted severe disability allowance but denied living disability allowance. That perplexes the individual in question and is, to all intents and purposes, an irrational result. Attempts to get the Department to explain the position have resulted in successive form letters ticked in various places being issued to explain that a decision has again been made against the complainant.
<P>
No doubt computers lie behind the ticks. No doubt it would be administratively convenient to move yet further away from a personal approach towards a computer printout which avoids even the burdensome necessity for the poor clerk to tick items on the sheet. We understand the convenience of moving to the practice by which the computer issues the form.
<P>
What is important here is not the issuing of the form but the fact that the complainant feels even more strongly that he is not dealing with a group of human beings who in any sense understand the human problems that he may be experiencing. He will feel that he is dealing with a monolith that will take on the appearance of a large network of computers producing pieces of paper--sometimes correctly, sometimes not--with never a human hand behind them.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The long-term effects of this increasing depersonalisation of the Department of Social Security are, and will become, even greater than many imagine. Many individuals receiving or seeking benefit undoubtedly find that this impersonal approach, which contrasts strikingly with the way that they are dealt with by other Departments, including the national health service, or by commercial entities, makes them continue to feel that they are pawns. The ethic of all of us--including, I would have thought, the Minister for Welfare Reform, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who finds himself charged with the reform of social security generally--should be to re-integrate as fully as possible into the wider community individuals who receive benefit, by making them feel that they are not pawns in the hands of a monolith. Clause 2 moves significantly in the opposite direction, and runs counter to our perception of the proper way to proceed, as well as to Government policy.
<P>
If that were the only objection to the clause it would not be proper to waste the Committee's time introducing such an amendment. The second objection adds weight to our argument. It relates not to the administration of social security but to wider administration. This is an unprecedented clause. Research undertaken by a couple of barristers, and by the Library of the House of Commons through Lexis, produced multiple references to all sorts of phenomena but was unable to find a precedent in English law for a decision made by a computer.
<P>
This unprecedented change will, of course, be taken as a precedent for subsequent legislation in many other Departments. In some instances officials promoting such a change for reasons of administrative convenience have just as good a case in convenience as does the Department of Social Security. Many Departments' dealings are computerised, as are those of many other bodies. Officials examining these proposals, when enacted, will feel entitled to introduce similar legislation which will have similar effects in other contexts. There may be much less reason for such a shift; or the reason may be much more malign and dangerous, in the sense that, increasingly, it may be thought that administration by computer--with decisions being made by computers--relieves individuals of responsibility for actions taken by their Departments.
<P>
One can discern a situation--this is apparent not immediately, but over successive decades--in which the response to many complaints and inquiries from Members of Parliament and others is that the Department and individuals responsible for a particular case are not in fact responsible for it. Responsibility is traceable only to a vast unseen army of computer programmers many years back, and to a machine to which no appeal can be made. If that becomes a generalised phenomenon of British administration, much of the best of our tradition may be lost. That will, I repeat, happen not at once--I am not trying to be apocalyptic--but gradually and increasingly. I am talking about changes that people think count for nothing when they are introduced. Over the years, they gradually realise that they have had a profound effect on the nature of administration. It would be sad if British administration moved close to, rather than further away from, Kafka by virtue of officials being able to hide behind their computers.
<P>
It is, however, not my case that the two reasons that I have outlined--to do specifically with the DSS and to do with administration in general--would justify the amendment. The Opposition case is that there is a third and very strong reason that, together with the other two, makes it extraordinarily important that amendment No. 30 be accepted.
<P>
I want to emphasise what the Minister and his colleagues have already noticed: amendment No. 30 is scarcely a radical proposition. It merely removes the phrase that relates to the making of a decision by a computer and introduces one that allows a computer to be used by persons who are themselves responsible. The reason for that shift lies in the third, and most important, reason for the amendment.
<P>
Since its murky origins, English law has established--perhaps pre-eminently among all legal systems--the extraordinary importance of the concept of responsibility and the relationship between the concept of responsibility and the concept of decision. If one goes back to Maitland's ``Township and Borough'', for example, one sees the early strivings of the English legal system to identify and locate responsibility in the case of a corporate body. It is one of the proud achievements of English law to have found ways of dealing with decision and responsibility in such a way as always to identify the one with the other. Where a decision is made, there the responsibility lies. The fundamental concept of our criminal law is perhaps the idea of a guilty mind, which is a fundamental concept of decision making and responsibility. Where an action is not happenstance, but is taken by decision, there criminal responsibility may lie.
<P>
Clause 2, which is apparently innocuous in many ways, begins, entirely unconsciously--I cannot imagine that its drafters ever imagined that it would have such consequences--to drive a wedge between the concepts of decision and responsibility. Of course, a computer can, in an extended sense, make a decision. That is to say, a decision falls to be made and a computer can do things that will constitute the making of that decision. A computer cannot, however, be held responsible in any ordinary or important philosophical or legal sense. It cannot be imprisoned, sued or treated as the party that is responsible for the decision.
<P>
In clause 2, which is seemingly innocuous, we have the idea of an entity that is not responsible for making a decision. That divorce of responsibility from decision will ricochet through English law in ways that are entirely unforeseen and are probably regarded as unlikely to occur by those who are responsible for the clause. Surely, before introducing a change with such significant impacts across time, it would be appropriate for a body such as the Law Commission or a royal commission to investigate the question of decision and responsibility in relation to computers.
<P>
Finally, the clause is a harbinger of many other such clauses that are much wider in their implications--and perhaps even in their drafting--and which are likely to come about because of the changing nature of computers. With networking and artificial intelligence, the question of computers and their capacity to decide and their relationship to decisions and, indeed, to human beings is becoming one of the great issues of our age. To venture unwarily into that territory with an ill drafted and ill conceived attempt to solve a minor administrative problem, thereby creating a huge precedent that will be built upon in all sorts of unforeseen ways, without due consideration by the Law Commission or a royal commission, and without any serious investigations of the issues at stake, strikes Conservative Members as ill judged.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I accept that the contribution of the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) was most sincere, but the fears that he spoke of are not relevant to a move towards a modern, streamlined and efficient social security system. I hope that I can allay his fears.
<P>
Clause 2 introduces new powers on how decisions on social security benefits and other business areas are to be made. It allows decisions to be taken not only by officers acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, but also by computers for which such officers are responsible, as the hon. Gentleman recognises in his amendment. It also allows for decisions made by a private sector service provider to be similarly made by computers. Perhaps that issue will be explored in the stand part debate.
<P>
The Committee might find it helpful if I explain the importance of the clause and how we envisage it working. The ability to make decisions automatically is essential if we are to have a modern, streamlined welfare system that can make full use of future advances in information technology. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that the previous Government issued a Green Paper on the developments in the social security system, in which they recognised the importance of introducing more computers and of using them as a tool for streamlining the system. The vast majority of those who responded to the Green Paper welcomed a move in that direction.
<P>
Automated decision making is not unlawful and usually does not require specific legislation. Indeed, it is commonplace in the financial sector, where it was pioneered by credit reference agencies. However, existing social security legislation specifically states that social security and child support decisions must be made by particular officers or by the Secretary of State--it has been established legally that that may be by officers acting on her behalf--hence the clause.
<P>
I should like to reassure the Committee that decision making by computers will be effective only for certain purposes and only as long as certain safeguards are met. Where decisions are made by computers they will still be made in accordance with the facts and the law and, of course, whether a decision is taken by a computer or a person will not affect the right of appeal against that decision. Staff, not computers, will be used to make decisions which require the exercise of discretion or the exercise of judgment.
<P>
A legal, modern and streamlined welfare system must make use of advances in information technology. We have come a long way from the days when computers were no more than big adding machines. They are capable of far more, and in a modern society we must take advantage of that opportunity. The introduction of a single decision maker and outcome decisions is predicated on computer decision making. Previously, Conservative Members welcomed that single-tier decision-making process.
<P>
There are significant benefits to be had from greater automation. Computers--if they are programmed correctly--are not subject to human error, and can be relied upon to produce consistent decisions. This will lead to improvements in quality and will allow staff in agencies to refocus their efforts on making improvements in overall customer service. With regard to the hon. Gentleman's first point, we believe that using computers effectively will allow staff to be much more customer-oriented, giving them more time to explain decisions and help customers to understand the whole social security system. Instead of moving away from that position, as the hon. Member for West Dorset suggested, we believe that sensible use of new technology will help us to refocus the whole nature of the social security system on the customer rather than on the complexities of the current system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Will the Minister comment briefly on something which has come to my attention as a constituency Member and, I am sure, to the attention of many other Members? When the Child Support Agency sends out forms, several computerised forms or letters often appear on more or less the same day. It is sometimes difficult for the individuals concerned to know the relevant decision made by the computer to which they should pay attention. Are there any moves to do something about that problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's comments, and appreciate his point. On my visits to the Child Support Agency, I have worked through the claims procedure with an officer. The way the previous Government set up the system means that, because of the nature of the decision making and the requirement to inform the customer of that decision, and because that officer may be making several decisions on behalf of that customer in one day, the system generates the responses to each of those decisions and leads to exactly the confusion that the hon. Gentleman identified. Clearly, that must be addressed, and it is being addressed. I do not think that anything in the clause about the use of computers reinforces that problem in any way. We must use computers sensibly and efficiently to ensure that the decisions are effective and the customer understands them. That must apply not only to child support but across the board in the social security system.
<P>
There is nothing sinister in these proposals. Computers will be programmed to apply a series of tests to factual data, input by agency staff, to produce a consistent result. Clearly, the initial factual data need to be accurate and complete, and checks will be made to ensure that they are. With greater support from information technology, agency staff will be able to concentrate on ensuring that all the necessary information and evidence which the claimant has supplied is collated and checked efficiently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> So far in the Minister's speech which appears, if I am not mistaken, to be much guided by officials, he seems to be referring to the greater use of computers, the efficient use of computers and the liberation of staff time by such efficient use. Nothing in the amendment in any way militates against the greater use of computers; indeed, it specifically permits and encourages such use. The intent of the clause as drafted is not merely that there should be use of computers, but that decisions will be made by computers. The only purpose of that, in a rational world, must be to relieve the individual--the officer--of responsibility. It is not a question of how much computers are used and how streamlined they are, but of whether computers are making decisions as opposed to merely producing everything up to the moment when the officer signs off. The signing off procedure will disappear. So far, the Minister has not addressed the difference between the clause as drafted and the clause if it were amended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to believe that, in some way, the signing off gives substance to the decision making that has gone on. The clause puts on a legal basis what has always been accepted, namely that decisions that currently are taken can be judged decisions in themselves. Commissioners have accepted that just putting a signature on the end of a stream of computer print-outs does not mean that that person has taken a decision on each separately and checked them personally. We are putting the reality of the use of computers into primary legislation. That is the purpose of clause 2.
<P>
The Secretary of State and departmental accounting officers will continue to be accountable to the House for all decisions made on their behalf, including those made by a computer. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. Neither agency staff nor Ministers will hide behind the excuse, ``It was not out fault, it was the computer's.'' Ultimately, accountability for such decisions will remain with Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> May I, as a simple seeker of information, ask for clarification of clause 2(1)(b)? It provides for automation of decision making where decisions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may be made by a person providing services to the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take that to mean the private sector. How that will work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> It is an enabling power. If there were proposals to outsource any of the Department's work--there are no current plans--and if it were undertaken by a private contractor, the legal basis on which decisions were made by that party would be accepted as a decision in the totality of the legislation. To use the expression used by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford, if work were ``privatised'', an organisation--a third party--would have the legal power to make a decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. He said that the Government have no proposals at the moment to use those powers, but given that they have included them in the Bill, one can logically assume only that they propose to use the powers in subsection (1)(b) at some later stage. Will he confirm that that is the case? In what circumstances would that outside help be used?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> As I said, there are no current plans, but perhaps I can reassure the hon. Gentleman further. If there were proposals to involve the private sector in decision making, parliamentary approval or any order made under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 would be required or other statutory provision would have to be made by Parliament. Any proposal would have to come back for proper scrutiny by the House, but at the current time there are no plans to introduce such a proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Again, I am grateful to the Minister. His choice of the words ``at the current time'' is perfectly reasonable, but will he confirm that he expects the Government to go down that route at some point? Under what circumstances do they expect to take that step?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> What the Department and the Government have always said is that decisions that may be made on any outsourcing will be taken when we have asked, ``Will it work?'', ``Is it fair?'' and, crucially, ``Is it in the taxpayers' interests?'' All proposals will be judged against those criteria. There are no such proposals before the Ministers at the moment, but if they should emerge, there will be proper scrutiny via the procedures that I have outlined.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Perhaps I may probe subsection (1)(b) a little further. If we imagine that a particular decision has been privatised, so to speak, and a particular service provider therefore has to make the decision, in many respects the situation for the individual complainant will have been improved, because I take it that that individual would then be able to take an action for negligence, for example, against the service provider, who would be unprotected by Crown immunity.
<P>
However, has the Minister considered how such an action would proceed where the decision had been taken by a computer, since the clause will give legal authority for it to be taken by a computer? Has he considered the relationship between the law of negligence and decision making by computer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is tying himself up in imaginary situations. Such decision making will be accountable to the Secretary of State, so the rights of an individual to appeal against a decision and to take action against a decision will, as under many aspects of current social security law, flow to the Secretary of State. That will not change. I have made it clear that at the end of the day the Secretary of State is accountable for the decisions, and that will be the redress available to the individual.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> May I press that one stage further, because we may be about to get an assurance for many of us on the parliamentary record? Is the Minister saying that he would regard it as imperative for the Secretary of State to make a statement in Parliament, and perhaps to resign, if it could be shown that computers--[Interruption.] I thought the Minister said that the Secretary of State would be taking responsibility and would be accountable for the decisions made by these computers. Does it not therefore, follow that the Secretary of State would have to take serious action to remedy such a defect, if it was shown that computers were frequently making incorrect decisions? Would not responsibility for that fall directly to the Secretary of State? If that could be put on record, it would give Opposition Members considerable comfort.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> With absolute certainty, I can say that the Secretary of State will take her accounting responsibilities extremely seriously and ensure that through her actions, the proper checks and balances and assurances for the public will be put in place. She will be accountable to Parliament for those procedures. That assurance is absolutely clear.
<P>
The amendment itself would undermine the opportunities to improve service delivery and would compromise our programme to modernise social security. It would mean that decision makers would be able to use computers for relevant calculations, but no more--the decision itself would still need to be made by officers acting on behalf of the Secretary of State. Similar constraints would apply if decision making were to be contracted out. I emphasise that accountability is through the Secretary of State to Parliament.
<P>
The amendment would prevent us from achieving the improvements in efficiency and customer service that we want. It would prevent us from taking the organisation forward into a modern era. I am extremely surprised that the Conservative party wants to put impediments in our way; and I hope that the hon. Member for West Dorset will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
I should like to conclude by stressing an incoherence--of which the Minister may be aware--between his closing remarks and his introductory comments. He said earlier that staff--people, not computers--would be used when the exercise of judgment was necessary. Yet in his closing remarks he said that the problem with the amendment was that it would confine the use of computers to cases in which calculation--and no more--was involved. I am at a loss to determine what more a computer could do than calculate unless it is to make judgments; and if it is making judgments, it is entering the sphere that the Minister said would be reserved to the prerogative of human beings.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That illustrates the problem. The Minister is being guided, as his predecessors may well have been, by understandable official concerns about efficiency and streamlining, but he is not attending to the key difficulty of allowing computers to have a decision-making capacity. On the Conservative side, we continue to believe that that is ill judged. However, we shall not press for a Division. By registering our views and by dint of the Minister having made a gesture towards responsibility--however vaguely worded regarding the Secretary of State; I fear that egregious and numerous errors will be revealed over time--we hope that the notion of human beings being ultimately responsible for decisions may be somewhat protected. For that small mercy, at least, we are grateful. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment by leave withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am beginning to feel as though we are pushing large numbers of boulders up hills but without the slightest sign of doing any better than Sisyphus. We have been unable, alas, to persuade the Minister who has come into Committee with a thoroughly closed mind. In 10 or 15 years' time, he will come to regret not having changed his mind about amendment No. 30.
<P>
We hope to make more progress with amendments No. 2 and 3, which are thoroughly uncontentious. They are not in any sense partisan and do not even involve any eccentric preoccupations with computers. They are concerned exclusively with human beings and with information held about them. If the cause of open government means anything, it surely means being concerned about information on human beings and what is done with it.
<P>
As both sides of the Committee will be aware from constituency work, there are many cases of individuals who have prolonged dealings with one agency or another and whose files and data records are eventually expunged. There are some cases where achieving that has proved extraordinarily difficult. As the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) said earlier, it has been extraordinarily difficult to track down data and get the CSA to remove them from its records where somebody has been wrongly pursued, or where action has been taken that has subsequently proved erroneous.
<P>
Amendment No. 2 seeks to ensure that a service provider working for the Secretary of State who had obtained information would not be able to hold and use that information for other purposes. On the contrary, the service provider would have to return it. Amendment No. 3 is designed to allay the concern that gave rise to amendment No. 2. The cross-use of information, by which information obtained for one purpose is used for another, would be specifically prohibited.
<P>
As members of the Committee will be aware, cross-use of information is an increasing phenomenon. We all receive annoying, but probably harmless, junk mail as a result of such use. Much cross-use of information takes place for mere amusement, but such use of information held in respect of matters covered by the Bill could result in a serious invasion of individual rights.
<P>
A body of legislation exists to protect the individual from such problems, but it is never wrong to add belts to braces when the protection of individual rights is involved. As the Minister has repeatedly pointed out, the Bill is designed to streamline and make the system more efficient. Therefore it is all the more important to ensure that that streamlining and that drive for efficiency do not ride roughshod over individual rights. Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 were tabled in the hope that, being entirely non-controversial and non-partisan, they would be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Amendment No. 2 seeks to require private contractors providing services to the Secretary of State to return departmental information to the Secretary of State after they have finished with it. It is concerned with the proper aim of protecting the Department's customers from the misuse of confidential information held on computers by contractors.
<P>
Amendment No. 3 seeks to make it an offence to use or disclose information held by the Department for any purpose other than the official administration of social security, child support or war pensions. Any person convicted of that offence would be liable to a fine of up to level 5 on the standard scale. That is currently &#163;5,000.
<P>
I understand the concerns that have given rise to the amendments and the sincerity with which they were moved. However, I believe that I can reassure the Committee that there are already adequate safeguards in place to protect the confidentiality of information.
<P>
First, although we are committed to considering any case for private sector involvement on its own merits, as I have described, we have no specific plans at present to contract out decision-making work. As and when any such proposals are brought forward, they will go through the usual parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
Of course confidentiality will be a key consideration in any plans to contract out service delivery. I share the hon. Gentleman's concerns, but I can assure the Committee that amendment No. 3 is not necessary, because there are significant legal requirements already in place to protect against unauthorised use or disclosure of information by anyone handling that information.
<P>
Furthermore, the Department already has experience of dealing with contractors, and recognises the need to impose strict contractual constraints and to follow rigorous commercial contract procedures with such contractors. We already have examples of that, and they include the work of the national insurance recording system, which is now privately run. In addition, many smaller services have been contracted out, and these safeguards have been part of that process. The requirement for confidentiality is common to all the contracts, whether large or small. Service providers, in exactly the same way as civil servants, are bound by the law governing data protection and confidentiality.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Before the Minister moves on to the law regarding confidentiality, may I ask him a question? He mentioned the contracts, and we have given some thought to that matter. We support the idea that some of the services should in due course be contracted out if that proves appropriate. In order for the contract to be pursued and made effective, a damage would have to be established. The damage we are considering here is a damage to the individual whose case is being adjudicated, not to the contracting party, which is the Department or agency. How does the Minister imagine that the contract could be used as a method of enforcing confidentiality, as opposed to representing merely a hope that confidentiality will be enforced?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> If the contracts that have been set in place had been used in the way described, clearly that would break the contract, which could then be terminated. The contractual arrangements would include the power to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, because we may again be getting to the point when he could make an important statement on the record. It would be helpful if this time, unlike what happened on previous occasions, he were willing to clarify matters. Would it be Government policy always to revoke the contract--a rather striking measure--when a contractor breached the confidentiality clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Clearly, we would look carefully at the contractual arrangements and at the way in which confidentiality had been breached. It would be quite wrong to set here in concrete all the circumstances in which contracts would be terminated, but there is a possibility that that could happen if there were breaches of the contractual arrangements concerning data protection and confidentiality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Now we seem to be going backwards. The chain of argument was as follows. I asked whether the Minister had considered whether there were serious methods of contractual enforcement. The Minister replied that there were, because the contract could be revoked. I take it that that was a means of avoiding having to face head on the fact that there would be no damage and no right to sue the contractor or to seek a specific performance. Yes, the contract could be revoked, but then, rather than admitting at the next point that the contract would be revoked, the Minister fell back on saying that perhaps it would and perhaps it would not. Does that not in the end suggest that in the preponderance of cases a breaking of confidentiality will lead to no contractual consequences?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I do not think that one can draw that conclusion at all. What we put in place will be open to parliamentary scrutiny. The contracts will be clear on those points. As in all such matters, judgments are made about the nature of the breach of the contract and the appropriate remedy. They have to be considered case by case. It is not possible to give a definitive statement on every contractual arrangement and every situation in which any part of a contract appears to have been breached. We will have a robust contracting system and we will make clear judgments about the way in which it operates in practice. We now need to move on.
<P>
Service providers, in exactly the same way as civil servants, are bound by the law governing data protection and confidentiality. The principles in the Data Protection Act 1984 include requirements that personal data held for any purpose must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to that purpose. Personal data must not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose and must be handled securely.
<P>
Any civil servant who passed confidential information to a third party without the consent of the customer would be committing a criminal offence and would be subject to disciplinary proceedings. The same applies to any private contractor. Moreover, service providers would be contractually bound by departmental requirements and standards, and the contracts could be terminated if those were not met. I stress that such matters would be judged case by case.
<P>
An amendment to require contractors to return departmental data to the Department ``after use'' would not add anything to the security of departmental information. In addition to the fact that the staff of the contractor will be individually bound, we will, of course, impose rigorous conditions about the security of computer systems. Contractors will be required to have secure systems. Arrangements for the destruction or return of data will be made as necessary.
<P>
I appreciate that there are always concerns about confidentiality, especially if decision-making is contracted out, and more so when the information is sensitive. But, as I have explained, a range of legal protection is already in place, and I am confident that no contract will be signed without the Department's obtaining the guarantees that the Committee would expect.
<P>
As for unlawful disclosure, disclosing information without lawful authority is already strictly forbidden by section 123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which makes it an offence for people employed in social security administration to disclose personal information that they have acquired through their work. Anyone found guilty is liable on conviction to up to two years in prison or a fine, or both. Parallel legislation covers child support information.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Using or disclosing information unlawfully is also an offence under the Data Protection Act 1984. If personal data is used for any purpose or disclosed to anybody except in the way recorded in the register of the Data Protection Registrar, the person responsible can face prosecution and a fine.
<P>
I recognise that there is also concern about unauthorised access to computer systems. However, the Department's computer systems and networks are closed to all except authorised staff, whose actions are automatically audited. There are rigorous management checks and audit trails, designed to detect any cases of employees browsing through information that is not relevant to the work that they are doing. Any instance that is discovered is treated as a severe disciplinary offence, and can lead to dismissal and possible prosecution.
<P>
In future, the power to share information under the clause will permit the development of new integrated ways of working. They will help us to apply robust security procedures across the whole of the Department's services, and will ensure that the audit trails and management checks are even more comprehensive. Our policy will continue to be that the authority to access personal information will be given only on a need-to-know basis. We believe that the new systems will provide even greater security against unauthorised use or disclosure of information.
<P>
Those laws and security procedures apply both to civil servants and to any staff from external suppliers. Suppliers are firmly bound by the laws on confidentiality and data protection as well as being covered by the offence in section 123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The Department has not hesitated to act when necessary to discipline, dismiss or prosecute anyone who uses or discloses information without proper authority.
<P>
Our approach is to develop an active modern service, which means efficient services for those who deal with us. Systems must deliver value for taxpayers' money and make use of partnerships with the private sector when those make sense for customers, taxpayers and staff. As I said earlier, I understand why the hon. Member for West Dorset tabled the amendments. I hope I have satisfied him that we take confidentiality very seriously, and that there are adequate safeguards in place to ensure that the information we hold is protected. In the light of that explanation, and of the robustness of the procedures and the contracting arrangements, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Minister's statement was reassuring, at least towards the end. His reliance on the Data Protection Act and on other social security specific legislation, and the assurance that that legislation extends not only to officials in the agency or Department but to contractors, is reassuring. We cannot, however, take reassurance from his remarks about contracting, which betray either insufficient understanding of what happens when contracts are in progress and what system is likely to be used to address practical problems in contracting, or a blithe disregard for the facts. Clearly, when neither damages nor specific performances can be exacted, the likelihood of a contract being revoked as a remedy where a relatively small-scale action was taken, such as disclosing information against an individual, is extremely small.
<P>
The Minister has more or less admitted that there will be no other remedy. He has not mentioned the inclusion in contracts of penalties specifically for disclosure of information. Nevertheless, he made a strong case that there is an adequate legislative safeguard of a criminal nature against disclosure of information. Provided that his assurances that private contractors are equally bound by these proposals prove correct when tested in court--as no doubt they will be in due course--I suppose that we can rest assured that individual rights will be protected. Accordingly, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 2, line 12, leave out `or' and insert--

It is a simple technical amendment which I hope will have the Committee's support.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) The Secretary of State shall as appropriate use any information to which subsection (2) applies to revise or supersede a decision on an award of a relevant benefit under section 10 or 11.<P>

<P>
	(2D) ``Relevant benefit'' shall have the same meaning for the purposes of this section as for section 9.'.</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am sorry, Mr. O'Hara, if we caused confusion in our tabling of these two amendments, which we originally intended to go together. Perhaps something unfortunate about their wording caused you and the Clerks in the first instance to consider taking them separately; if so, something can perhaps be done about it at a later stage, if not today.
<P>
Our intention is to deal with the matter of sharing of information, which is the subject of clause 3. It was made plain on Second Reading, and is generally agreed, that there could be great advantages in a greater sharing of information--from two points of view. First, it is accepted that sharing information allows opportunity to catch out people submitting fraudulent claims and to ensure that such claims are disallowed. The second, different, point is that such information sharing would help claimants to become aware of exactly which benefits they may be eligible for, thus enabling them--and perhaps at an earlier stage--to claim them.
<P>
The amendments are aimed specifically at ensuring that the second aim, rather than the first, is met. However, that should not be taken to imply that we do not fully accept that there are good reasons for the sharing of information, such as avoiding and eliminating fraud. That is already in the Bill and therefore no amendment is needed. However, subsection (2)(a), with its reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any purposes connected with''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is rather widely drawn. One reason for tabling the amendment was to give the Government a change to explain more fully exactly what is intended in that phrase. If it were simply left in that format, there is a chance that they may have some purpose at the back of their mind in respect of social security generally, which we may not be happy with. We have therefore phrased the amendments to make the provisions applicable to social security questions in particular.
<P>
Perhaps I could explain briefly what the three new subsections in amendment No. 114 refer to. New subsection (2A) specifies the purposes for which such information could be used in terms of revising or superseding decisions which it is agreed are needed. We all recognise that one of the problems with the social security system is that too often we do not get it right first time, and that that can lead to revisions and superseding decisions. Both because of cost and because of aggravation to claimants, it is a problem that far too many cases have to go to appeal because they are not right first time, and the Government have made it plain that they want the new Bill to help to ensure that decisions are right first time.
<P>
The intention of new subsection (2B) is to put the onus on the Secretary of State to ensure that, when information comes to light which may be of use to claimants in deciding whether they are eligible for further or increased benefits, that information is passed on to them quickly. One might think that the Government would want to do that anyway, as all Governments claim that they intend to do their best to ensure that there is maximum benefit take-up. But there is always the temptation for a Government to see poor take-up as a way of saving taxpayers' money to use for other purposes. New subsection (2B) would give the Secretary of State an incentive not to fall into that temptation, and it would therefore be a useful part of the Bill. Proposed new subsection (2C) suggests that if the Secretary of State fails, for whatever reason, to make it plain to claimants that they may be eligible for some other benefit, and so to give them the chance to obtain it, the benefit should be backdated to the date on which the claimant should have been informed about it. If new subsection (2B) were accepted, new subsection (2C) would naturally follow to ensure that the claimant did not lose as a result of the Secretary of State failing properly to fulfil his or her duty.
<P>
As is generally true of the take-up of benefits, if the amendment were to be accepted, it would not in any sense increase Government expenditure above what it otherwise ought to be. Liberal Democrat Members do not suggest new benefits or that people should have benefits to which they are not entitled. We suggest simply a means to ensure that the benefits that the Government ought to pay out, under their own legislation, are paid to those people who are eligible.
<P>
It would be fair to say that the Government are, in principle, in favour of the proposals that I have outlined. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State discussed the case of a bereaved person who might fail to make a claim at the correct time. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We do not want a system that does not help a bereaved person to make a claim at the right time, but which allows a claim made 12 months late to be backdated.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State then made the following vital point:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We want people to have the right information at the right time.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Data need to be shared, so that when someone dies, the DSS can ensure that the right benefits are received there and then, rather than that the system should go wrong, resulting in claims having to be backdated.''--[Official Report, 22 July 1997; Vol. 298, c. 782.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I support the Secretary of State's comments. Liberal Democrats have proposed the two new subsections contained in amendment No. 114, which support the Secretary of State's apparent wish that we should always ensure that people have the right information to make their claims at the right time. That is especially important, given the later clauses that refer to backdating--
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene in a moment. I should like to finish my sentence.
<P>
If backdating is restricted, we should ensure that claimants have the right information at the right time to make claims for all the benefits to which they are entitled, so that they do not lose out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I have followed the hon. Gentleman's argument on amendment No. 114 with great interest. I am confused about the purpose of amendment No. 113. Will he clarify that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Hara, if my explanation lacked sufficient clarity. Amendment No. 114 proposes two new subsections that are especially relevant to social security; however, amendment No. 113 would not remove social security from the freedom to share information.
<P>
The Liberal Democrat party shares the Government's aim to ensure that claimants receive information on time so that they can claim everything for which they are eligible. I have no doubt that it is also the aim of the Conservative party; I certainly hope so. The Bill provides a new freedom to share information, and we should use it. Liberal Democrats accept that it will be useful to avoid fraud. It will also ensure that people obtain the appropriate benefits. The amendments are designed to do that, rather than leaving it to the good will of the Government. That good will might not always be fully available, especially when the Government are under financial pressure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I endorse my hon. Friend's remarks, and offer the Minister a chance to fulfil one of his party's manifesto commitments regarding elderly, poor pensioners who fail to claim income support. That group has been highlighted in a number of ministerial statements as a priority for Government action. The amendments would be especially relevant to a pensioner living in a council house who might not be familiar with the income support system, or who might not be keen on it, or understand it, but who would know what a rent rebate was. Such a poor pensioner would be in contact with the local authority and would be in the local authority housing benefit system. That person might have income below the income support level: for instance, he or she might receive just the basic state pension. The housing benefit authorities would say that that person was entitled to a 100 per cent. rent rebate.
<P>
At present, that would be the end of the story. However, the income definitions used for housing benefit are more or less identical to those used for income support. Would it not be a good idea, therefore, to help the Government to fulfill their manifesto commitments if the local authority had a duty to send that information to the body responsible for dealing with income support claims? That body could then immediately see that such a pensioner should be in receipt of income support, and the Government would be able to fulfill their manifesto commitment to give poor pensioners the income support to which they are entitled. Will the Minister support the amendments to enable that commitment to be fulfilled?

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> May I seek your guidance, Mr. O'Hara. Are we taking the two amendments together, or separately?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I beg your pardon; I should have explained. The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), who moved the amendment, requested that they be grouped. It was remiss of me not to announce that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I will therefore respond to them accordingly.
<P>
The clause provides a new, comprehensive and unified statutory basis for sharing information held by the Department in relation to social security, child support or war pensions. Information is currently shared under a mixture of various statutes, in some cases with the consent on the individual, and in others in which such sharing is permitted without breaking common law duties of confidentiality. That legal basis is adequate to support the current operation of the Department, but it may not be sufficiently robust to support new ways of working that we want to develop in the future, especially when such developments involve greater automation.
<P>
Amendment No. 113 would prevent the Department from using information relating to child support or war pensions for any other social security purposes. Rather oddly, however, it would still enable social security information to be used for war pensions or child support purposes. Perhaps that is not what was intended.
<P>
Our intention is that, where the same information is relevant to the administration of more than one function of the Department, the customer should be required to provide the information once--and once only. The barriers that the amendment would impose are not justified or necessary, and would prevent the Department from protecting the interests of the taxpayer and providing all its clients with the full seamless service that we are trying to create.
<P>
However, the clause is not about sharing information with those within the Department who have no legitimate need to have that information, nor is it about gathering more information than is necessary. It is about using information that the Department collects in the most efficient way.
<P>
Amendment No. 114 embodies two important objectives: first, to ensure that all claimants receive full entitlement to benefits, and secondly, to promote the take-up of benefits by those who are entitled, but who have not yet claimed.
<P>
As I have said in the debate on previous amendments, the policy proposals that are now developing will significantly improve service delivery of benefits and help to identify even more quickly than at present the full extent of an individual's entitlement. The amendment would be counterproductive to those plans, and would divert valuable resources away from the potential benefits of the new proposals.
<P>
The amendment would oblige the Department to re-examine and, where appropriate, use, all the information that it holds about people, whether relating to child support, war pensions or social security, to revise any decision about entitlement to benefit.
<P>
It is sensible that every time people give new information to the Department, such information should be used to reassess their entitlement to benefit. That idea is at the heart of our plans to modernise social security. People should be required to give the Department information once, and once only. Our aim is to develop a more integrated service to the public that avoids the need to supply the same information many times over, with a single point of contact wherever possible.
<P>
In order to do that comprehensively, however, the DSS needs to develop new ways of working and new, integrated IT systems. That process will inevitably take time: the scale of change required in such a radical restructuring of such large systems should not and cannot be underestimated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Can I take the Minister back to subsection (2B) of the amendment, the purpose of which I understand to be the notification of people who might be unaware that they are eligible for a benefit. Does the Minister agree with the Minister for Welfare Reform, who has long advocated using all the information available to his Department to notify all those who might be eligible for a benefit? The right hon. Gentleman is especially keen on such notification for family credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am not sure whether those are quotations but I accept that the inferences that the hon. Gentleman draws from what my right hon. Friend the Minister of State has said are accurate. Systems must be developed to ensure that once information has been given to the Department--and once people have access to information about their entitlement to benefit--there is a simple and efficient way in which claims can be administered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman leaps up, I must say that the current social security arrangements would make it impossible for the Department to be aware in advance of every individual who might be entitled to family credit. A representation has to be made to the Department before an assessment of entitlement can been made. I am sure that hon. Gentleman will agree that it would be completely impractical for the Department to write to every working person in the country time and time again as a matter of routine. [Interruption.] Does the hon. Member for West Chelmsford wish to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I merely wanted to remind the Minister that his right hon. Friend the Minister for Welfare Reform had been advocating that in the House for a number of years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I shall look carefully at what the hon. Gentleman is proposing that my right hon. Friend has said. We must ensure that either the employer--in the case of family credit--or the appropriate agency with which an individual has made contact is aware that there may be an entitlement to family credit. A system of ensuring that that entitlement is simply administered would thereby be promoted.
<P>
That is slightly different from what the hon. Member for West Chelmsford said about the Department trawling the country to look for every individual who might be eligible for family credit. The previous Government's advertising campaigns--via television and the production of leaflets and other information--clearly were intended to make everyone aware of their entitlements and of how to claim them effectively and efficiently. There should be no disagreement between the hon. Gentleman and me in that context, and certainly none between me and my right hon. Friend the Minister of State.
<P>
The Department's staff must now undertake many routine tasks that take them away from the essential face-to-face contact of a genuine adviser and case worker. We want the sensible use of information technology and the change in emphasis in the agency and among its staff to allow the efficient and effective sharing of information--within the agency and between agencies--which has been gained at the point of contact. Where the same information applies to more than one benefit, therefore, that information will not need to be supplied time and time again to receive different benefits.
<P>
If any amendment imposed such a requirement on us now, the problems of administration--which is already complex, bureaucratic and inefficient--would be exacerbated, as our current systems cannot always work in the integrated fashion to which we aspire.
