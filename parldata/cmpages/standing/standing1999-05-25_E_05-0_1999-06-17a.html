<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Witnesses eligible for assistance on grounds of age or incapacity</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): With your permission, Mr. Stevenson, I should like to outline our approach to the remaining part of the Bill. Before I do, I should explain, for the benefit of the Committee, that on Tuesday afternoon, my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) was moved from his home affairs brief to education. Although he still appears as a member of the Committee, it is unlikely&#151;barring my own incapacity&#151;that he will attend any more sittings. My hon. Friend had been researching the issues relating to part II, but it now falls to me to deal with them.
<P>
That provides the Committee with both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage is that Labour Members will see me waving my spectacles around for three or four more mornings and afternoons&#151;I mean in aggregate&#151;and will have to hear me whining on. The advantage is that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is a barrister and I am not. With respect to this part of the Bill, it is open to debate whether that is an advantage or a disadvantage. It may be a disadvantage in terms of my not entirely understanding what is written in the Bill and my failing to have the same detailed knowledge of other relevant aspects of the law. I say in a friendly spirit to the Minister of State that if I commit a clear breach of what is usual in the proceedings and appear to have a memory lapse. I hope that he and the Committee will be tolerant.
<P>
The Bill essentially amounts to two Bills in one. We have thus far dealt with the youth justice element; we now come on to the criminal evidence element. I suspect that no one would disagree that the clauses that we shall debate this afternoon and in next week's sittings are highly important and that the issues that they pose are different from what we have debated so far&#151;children and young people as offenders.
<P>
In the second part of the Bill, the young people with whom we will be concerned are more likely to be victims, not just of petty offences, but of the most serious offences in our criminal law&#151;rape, murder, serious assault and abuse of children. Children as victims and witnesses of such horrific crimes will be our main concern in the first clauses in part II. I have not had much time to study the matter, but it is important to try to ensure that such significant changes to the law are properly drafted. The Bill should mean what it says, and say what it is intended to express.
<P>
Above all, we must get a better deal for children and vulnerable people who are witnesses, and for rape victims&#151;that is the crux of clause 16. However, we must achieve that in a way that does not undermine the defendant's right or ability properly to defend himself or to be defended. We must ensure that we achieve a proper balance and that we enhance and protect the interests of justice.
<P>
Opposition members support the thrust of the Government's measures. That was clear on Second Reading. However, we have queries and anxieties. Differences of view, which are not along party lines, have also arisen. That became clear from discussions with colleagues who practise law and have views on the Bill. The differences will become more apparent later, when we consider the amendments in detail.
<P>
I suspect that all members of the Committee have independent views. As I am not a lawyer, I am perhaps less inclined to take up the cudgels on behalf of defendants that some of my right hon. and hon. Friends who are practising barristers-at-law. We need to redress the balance, especially in rape cases. With reference to clause 16 and chapter I of part II, we need to redress the balance in favour of children and vulnerable witnesses who are required to give evidence in court on serious matters such as those that I mentioned.
<P>
By way of a little history, the measure introduces further changes to those that the Criminal Justice Act 1991 made. As I said earlier, I was a member of the Committee that considered that measure. Those changes followed the Pigot report&#151;the report of the advisory group on video evidence. Its recommendations have stood the test of time. However, I acknowledge that some of its key recommendations, especially those on children and witnesses with disabilities, were not acted upon. It was sensible for the new Government to undertake a fresh review through the ``Speaking Up for Justice'' report. Its recommendations, which we broadly supported, are included in the Bill.
<P>
Chapter I of Part II deals with pilots. It does not make a change that will immediately apply to criminal trials the length and breadth of the country. However, the next two chapters will make such changes. I mention pilots because some of the proposed changes have caused controversy and anxiety, and I should like the Minister to reassure the Committee that the Government are genuinely open-minded about the way in which the measure will work in practice, and that they will not introduce changes, as practice dictates, as the pilots are extended across the nation.
<P>
I hope that that will help the Committee to understand our approach to the rest of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 16 defines the witnesses who may be eligible for special measures. Those witnesses are children, people with a mental disorder or significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning and people with a physical disability or disorder. Such witnesses will be eligible for assistance when the court takes the view that the completeness and accuracy of their evidence will be affected. Completeness is especially important in relation to the quality of evidence. Subsection (5) deals with the coherence of witnesses' evidence, defining that as the ability to give answers that ``can be understood''.
<P>
Clause 16 is not contentious, as it is an introductory provision and merely deals with eligibility. However, later clauses in part II will be contentious.
<P>
I have just one question for the Minister. The clause defines children as those under 17 and states that they will always be eligible for assistance. The Minister knows that several organisations have raised the issue of whether that limit should be 18. When we discussed children and young people in our debates on part I, we were discussing those under 18. However, clause 16 deals with those under 17. The definition in the Children Act 1989 may be more appropriate.
<P>
Why have the Government chosen 17 as the limit beneath which special measures should automatically apply? A 17-year-old may qualify for assistance under another definition, but that is unlikely.
<P>
<B>Ms Julia Drown </B>(South Swindon): I shall add briefly to the debate. We should try to make the law as simple as possible so that it is not scary for families and especially young people. Marriage at 16 is recognised. The provision takes effect for witnesses under 17. The Children Act 1989 affects those under 18; 18 is the age at which one has the right to vote.
<P>
Those anomalies are already present in the law, but the Bill perpetuates them. Will the Minister provide clarification? Does he agree that, in principle, we should simplify the law so that families are not confused and the process is as simple as possible?
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> I shall respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) about whether being a lawyer is an advantage in considering such matters.
<P>
In one important respect, it is a great advantage to the Committee that the overwhelming majority of its members are not lawyers. That statement is not the result of a sudden rush of blood to the head or the denial of a lifetime devoted to the law. However, that lifetime has taught me that it is a sad day in court when the interests of lawyers prevail over those of lay people. The defendant, the witnesses and the jury are the most important people in a court of law. Lawyers&#151;and legislators&#151;should recognise that the proceedings in a court of law and the rules of evidence should make it as easy as possible for lay participants in a trial to play their respective roles and to fulfil their functions in criminal law.
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The crucial function of criminal law is to enable the evidence to be tested, to put the prosecution on proof of their case and thereby to safeguard the interests of the defendant, the victim and the other witnesses. That is what it is about.
<P>
In introducing the Bill, the Government recognise that in the past, the criminal law and the criminal justice system have not always got it right. All too often, witnesses have not been able to give of their best in court, for a variety of reasons. The measure is designed to protect the public interest and thus the interests of justice, striking a proper balance between the interests and rights of the defendant and those of the victim. That demands that the best evidence possible be laid before the jury. Fear, intimidation and the vulnerability of age or incapacity can mitigate against witnesses giving their best evidence. The proposal will ensure that the best evidence possible comes before the jury so that its Members can fulfil their vital role.
<P>
Part II of the Bill is designed to increase access to justice for the most vulnerable people in society. Cases involving vulnerable witnessses are sometimes abandoned or not even begun because of the fear or apprehension of the alleged victim or the witnesses, which makes it difficult or impossible for them to give evidence in court in the presence of someone who is accused of committing a crime against them. Such obstacles to giving evidence sometimes result in unacceptable attrition, preventing cases properly coming before a jury or a tribunal in a court of law.
<P>
We are determined to change the culture of the court to make it more victim-friendly and witness-friendly and thus to protect the interests of the public and of the defendant, both of which have an interest in the court being an effective forum in which to test evidence. Such a forum should not be ineffective and flawed.
<P>
Chapter I of part II of the Bill sets out a range of measures that courts can award to witnesses who need help to give their best evidence. Of course, not all physical or mental disorders or disabilities affect a witness's ability to give his best evidence. The witness may not need or want help. The court will have to decide whether the nature of the disorder or disability is likely to diminish the quality of the evidence because it affects its completeness, coherence and accuracy.
<P>
The views of witnesses are vital. Clause 16(4) ensures that the court takes those views into account in determining whether a witness is eligible for assistance on the grounds of incapacity. That should be done early enough to ensure that the witnesses' fear of or apprehension about giving evidence do not weigh so heavily on their minds that they do not attend the final trial, or are so debilitated at the prospect of giving evidence that they do not give of their best.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I accept everything that my hon. Friend says. Would it therefore be more appropriate, in trying to change the culture of the courts, to give victims&#151;especially children&#151;the confidence that special measures would always apply unless they wished them not to do so? Should not the Government go further than the proposal in that respect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We have gone further than ever before; and on the basis of representations made by my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson), we have gone even further than was anticipated when the Bill was first proposed.
<P>
We have introduced a number of presumptions, which we shall consider when we debate each clause, to give confidence to witnesses that their concerns will be taken into account. A range of measures will be available to assist them. For example, children will give evidence-in-chief on video; there is a further presumption that a child should give any further evidence by live link unless the court directs that he should be cross-examined on video. We shall come later to the provision relating to the presumption that cross-examination will be conducted on video; that has not applied in the past.
<P>
The Bill takes the law forward to a great extent while retaining the necessary balance that is achieved by ensuring that a judge has control over the proceedings. It is upon the judge to ensure the fairness of the proceedings and that the jury receives the best evidence placed before it in the light of the particular circumstances of the particular child under consideration. If the capacity to judge in the light of all the circumstances&#151;albeit with the application of certain presumptions and the requirement to give reasons&#151;is not present, the jury could be inadvertently deprived of the best evidence relating to the case. The interests of justice are never served when a jury is unable properly to test the evidence. Experience shows that when a jury feels that it is being denied that opportunity, it is unlikely to find the accused guilty, for fear of convicting an innocent person.
<P>
We must get the balance right. It is not an easy process and representations will doubtless be made during the Committee that we should consider this or that other proposal. However, we believe that the balance is about right.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Ms Drown) mentioned, there has always been a variety of age limits for a variety of purposes in our law, for the understandable reason that for different purposes people are judged to have reached maturity at different times in their chronological life. The existing age limit for children providing evidence on video and live link is 14 for violent offence cases and 17 for sexual offence cases. Under the Bill we are making the age limit uniform at 17, which meets my hon. Friend's concern about certainty. For all child witnesses, the age limit will be uniform at 17.
<P>
We have heard no convincing evidence that the age limit should be increased to 18 for purposes of increasing confidence in the process of giving evidence. An 18-year-old is not in such a vulnerable position as to require the range of measures available to a 16-year-old. That is a matter of judgment: we have considered the evidence and that is our determination. Age limits throughout criminal legislation vary, as I said, according to the purpose for which the measures were introduced. The limit used in the Children Act 1989 was not intended to affect age limits in other legislation. That explains the limits outlined in the Bill.
<P>
Let me say a few words about the learning disabled. I want to ensure that people living with learning disability are subject to appropriate safeguards. All too often in my experience&#151;as a lawyer and as Under-Secretary in the Department of Health&#151;the particular vulnerabilities of people living with learning disabilities have not been taken fully into account. There have been scandalous cases&#151;I think of one in Buckinghamshire&#151;that have led to miscarriages of justice as a result of the perceived reluctance of juries to convict on the evidence given by people with learning disabilities.
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is right that the Bill will ensure that people with learning disabilities have the protection that ought to be properly afforded to them. There is no existing legal definition of ``learning disabled''. The definition in 16(2)(a) relating to someone who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(i) suffers from mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983, or
<P>
(ii) otherwise has a significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning''
<P>
</UL></FONT>encompasses those who might be considered to be learning disabled. However, it will be for the court to determine whether the degree of impairment is such as to warrant the measures.
<P>
The measures will include the capacity of a third party to act as an intermediary to enable learning disabled people to give of their best. It is a delicate and difficult task, but it is one that needs to be done and the facility should be available to the learning disabled. We shall work with charities and experts to ensure that people are available to provide such a service. The families and loved ones of those with learning disabilities are entitled to know that they have the full protection of the law.
<P>
Clause 16 embraces that concern and will ensure that we do justice to those with particular vulnerabilities. For that reason, I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Witnesses eligible for assistance on grounds of fear or distress about testifying</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 13, line 15, leave out from `witness' to end of line 32 and insert `arising from&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the nature and alleged circumstances of the offence to which the proceedings relate or&#151;<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) any other person who is likely to be an accused or a witness in the proceedings.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
First, I thank the Minister for his reply on the clause 16 stand part debate. I am more than happy to accept his explanation of the age issue.
<P>
The Minister referred earlier to the problems of witnesses who are afraid of giving evidence. I want to tease out from him the cause of such fear, because that is important if the test set out in the clause is to be met. Will the test be met if someone simply fears giving evidence or must there be another reason? Subsection (2) sets out factors that are to be taken into account. Will the Minister say whether the reference is intended to be exclusive? If it is, it might be better to omit the list of circumstances, or, alternatively, add at the end of line 17, after the words ``in particular'', the phrase ``but not exclusively''&#151;which is not in our amendment.
<P>
Our amendment was designed to clarify the drafting. I suppose that I am asking the Minister to explain, when he replies, why his version is better. While he gathers his thoughts, as well as paying attention to my point about whether the provision is meant to be exclusive, I want to ask to what degree intimidation, or reasonable fear of it, is important, so that the Committee can be sure that we are not talking about fear of testifying per se, because that can be a daunting experience.
<P>
The first time that I stood in the witness box in the Central Criminal Court as a police officer giving evidence in an armed robbery case was more daunting than when I first stood to speak in the Chamber of the House. Perhaps age and experience have an effect on one's nerves, but giving evidence is very daunting. For that reason, it is fine for the eligibility in respect of children to be effectively absolute but, in my judgment, the important question is whether the fear should be related to overt or covert threats or intimidation&#151;or to the consequences of being a witness in particular circumstances. The key question is, how are the fear&#151;and, indeed, the distress&#151;to be assessed?
<P>
Another factor is that subsection (1) refers to the court having to be satisfied that the quality of evidence might be diminished. What standard of proof is required to satisfy the court? A reading of our amendment will show that we have omitted specific factors which the court should take into account. We reached the view that in any discussion of whether the fear arises from aspects of the case, the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the nature and alleged circumstances of the offence to which the proceedings relate''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would in itself be all-embracing, or capable of so being. Effectively, if the giving of evidence arises from the nature of the offence, or from the alleged circumstances, a sexual or racial attack or domestic violence are, by definition, covered. I can understand what led the draftsmen to refer specifically to those three categories. We are probing meaning. Our proposal is more succinct, and makes it clearer that the fear and distress is caused not only by the experience of appearing in court as a witness to a horrific offence, but by threats or intimidation that relate to the offence.
<P>
<B>Ms Drown:</B> I want to speak about the amendment, and do some additional probing. Later, I shall argue for an automatic right to special measures for witnesses to sexual offences. However, on the assumption that I shall not persuade the Minister to accept that, I want to ask about the circumstances that would be taken into account if we accepted the amendment or if subsection (2) remained as it is.
<P>
Will the Minister provide for a rule that courts should not take the absence of physical injuries, or the fact that the witness and the accused know each other, to mean that giving evidence is less distressing? I ask that because the legal system frequently seems to regard rape by a man who is known to the complainant as less serious than rape by a stranger. Rape victims say that trauma exists despite lack of physical injuries. The legal system often does not seem to take that into account.
<P>
There is a danger that if legislation does not state that the absence of physical injuries should not be taken to mean that appearing in court is easier for the witness, that assumption will persist and will be used by defence lawyers to claim that special measures are unnecessary. We should also establish that the fact that a witness and a defendant know each other does not mean that the witness cannot be intimated by the defendant.
<P>
There was a recent case in which a woman was very brave. She told the press about her ordeal of being raped and then had to go through a court case. She asked for special measures such as a screen. She was refused a screen on the grounds that she had known her attacker for years and could not be intimidated by him. That was not a valid assumption, and it made the process much worse for her.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I read the clause in a slightly different way from the hon. Member for Ryedale. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In determining whether a witness falls within subsection (1) the court must take into account, in particular&#151;''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The does not make the provision exclusive. ``In particular'' refers to criteria that must ordinarily be taken into account, but it does not exclude others. That is how I read the Bill&#151;I may be wrong, but I believe that that is how it will be interpreted.
<P>
The need for special provisions is fundamental to the Bill. Victims and witnesses have long held that view. It has been apparent to the Crown Prosecution Service, the police and defence and prosecution lawyers.
<P>
I welcome the provisions, as they represent a considerable step forward. They partly implement the report, ``Speaking Up for Justice''. Over the past decade, many thousands of cases that fall within the Attorney-General's guidelines for prosecution cases have not commenced at all or, if they have, have been discontinued because the witnesses had difficulty giving cogent evidence. Cases have sometimes ground to a halt because witnesses were terrified of giving evidence.
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As a lawyer, I have been involved in assault cases, including those in which the male assailant and the female victim know each other. If, at the end of the day, the woman concerned does not turn up at court and I have to withdraw the prosecution, I understand the difficulty of her position. I have no criticisms of that.
<P>
I hope that the measure will begin to redress the balance. It is totally unacceptable for perpetrators of crimes to walk free and continue to intimidate those who can give cogent evidence against them.
<P>
I often come across such cases and meet people who, after the case is discontinued, say, ``I failed in my civic duty, as I could not give that evidence''. I sympathise with those people, as they experience terrific anxiety and feel that they are misusing the system. However curious and perverse, that is how matters turn out.
<P>
Often a judge throws out a prima facie case because the vital witness cannot contemplate going to court to give evidence. As I said, my experience as a prosecution and defence lawyer is that that is a common occurrence. I am pleased that the Government have grasped the nettle and are taking reasonable steps to deal with the matter.
<P>
The special measures are vital. When a case comes to court, the question whether it is a special measures direction case must be considered at the earliest possible opportunity&#151;pre-trial, hopefully, at the plea directions hearing. Routine forms are used for that, dealing with the number of witnesses, the length of a case, legal points that may arise and witness availability.
<P>
However, the forms should be amended. That is only a minor administrative matter. In every case, the onus should be on everyone to consider that form and it should not be ignored by the defence or the prosecution. Of course, the judge should have to approve the form before the case proceeds&#151;before dates are fixed and so on.
<P>
I am sure that such a minor administrative change will be introduced; indeed, it is vital that it should be. I agree with the hon. Member for South Swindon about the need for uniformity. Changing the form is one way of achieving that, so that consideration is given to every case. That will save much of the court's time, and will ultimately prevent the spectacle of going to court, only to find that everyone is there save the victim. Of course, thousands of pounds are wasted in costs and, to everyone's utter frustration, a seemingly guilty person walks away, another victim having suffered in that way.
<P>
I therefore fully endorse clause 17, and am pleased that it has been introduced.
<P>
I turn to the subject of video-link evidence, which is a good idea. In a moment, I shall briefly address the notion of cross-examination before trial.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that a later clause deals specifically with video evidence. He may wish to bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am obliged, Mr. Stevenson. I shall address video-link evidence later.
<P>
I fully agree with the thrust of clause 17, which represents a considerable step forward. However, I was rather concerned about amendment No. 43, which would delete from subsection (2)(c)(i) the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the social and cultural background and ethnic origins''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would, without doubt, exclude such considerations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Those factors surely fall within the reference in subsection (2(a) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the nature and alleged circumstances of the offence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> With respect, they do not, because a person's background has nothing to do with the circumstances of the offence. Some ethnic communities in the UK feel alienated from the criminal justice process and are encouraged by their peers not to have anything to do with it. In those circumstances, such people will be under considerable pressure not to take part in the process&#151;effectively to ignore it. For their sake, we need to consider special measures to enable them to fulfil their civic duty and accord them the same rights as anyone else.
<P>
In the same way, religious beliefs and political opinions are relevant. We all know about the good men and women who call at 8 am on a Saturday morning to put their view of religion. They do not believe in the criminal justice system. The elders of their church sort out problems: however serious, if the elders say it is all right, it is is all right. People with those religious views will not come forward unless something special is provided to make it proper and easy for them to give evidence. Of course we should embrace them in our community in the same way as anyone else: whether we agree with their religion is neither here nor there.
<P>
I am worried about those two examples. I understand the reasoning behind the amendment but it is, with respect, flawed and the original wording is to be preferred. My reading is, as I explained at the outset, that the criteria are not exclusive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful to all who contributed to our short debate. It is a probing amendment because the hon. Member for Ryedale would not suggest that these matters should not be taken into account in assessing the fear and distress occasioned by the experience of giving evidence.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to ensure that all relevant factors are taken into account. We want to give the judge some guidance as to what factors should properly be taken into account in assessing someone's degree of apprehension or fear about giving evidence, which can be so strong as to be a bar to that person giving of their best evidence. The clause sets out the sort of factors that might be involved: it is not meant to be and is not exclusive. Other factors might have been brought to bear on the mind and sensibilities of the individual in engendering fear and apprehension so great as to affect the quality of evidence that might result. We are talking about something more than the usual embarrassment or apprehension about giving evidence that was mentioned by the hon. Member for Ryedale with his experience as a police officer.
<P>
I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), and the clause will also meet the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon. She referred to the victims of domestic violence who have made a complaint against a partner. The nature of their pre-existing relationship may cause apprehension, because they know what their partner is capable of. Whether on a particular occasion there are marks and bruises is neither here nor there. The court will be able to take pre-existing domestic circumstances into account when it assesses the extent of someone's fear or distress. The clause is on point and will assist the victims of domestic violence.
<P>
<B>Ms Drown:</B> I am grateful for that clarification; it is important. However, such fears do not arise only as a result of domestic violence. In the case that I described, the woman involved was raped by a Sikh priest who she and her family had known for several years. The court decided that, because the victim and the accused knew each other, there was not such a problem. That was not the woman's view. If she had known before what the court procedure was like, she would not have reported the rape. Will my hon. Friend clarify that the Bill will also apply to cases in which those involved know each other?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That provision is in the Bill. The clause refers to a witness's religious beliefs and social or cultural background. The woman was raped by a priest. The fact that she had a religious connection with the priest because she was part of his flock and came from a culture in which priests receive particular veneration is relevant in determining whether the special measures will apply. Those factors tell in her favour and I would expect the court to assess how her circumstances might well add to her fear and apprehension.
<P>
I do not want to jump ahead of myself, Mr. Stevenson, because I remember your gentle admonition to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. A presumption will be that such measures will be available and that it will be harder to rebut that presumption than is currently the case.
<P>
<B>Ms Drown:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I thought that I had clarified my hon. Friend's point&#151;I have tried.
<P>
<B>Ms Drown:</B> It is perhaps unfortunate that my hon. Friend picked up on the religious background to the case that I described. My point was that the victim and the accused knew each other and that the court judged that that would mean less distress for the woman, which was not her experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> As far as date rape and acquaintance rape are concerned, if the court is satisfied that there is fear and apprehension, it matters not whether those involved have been on a date before or are acquainted. The court is entitled to take such factors into account, but, in the case that my hon. Friend outlined, they should tell in favour of special measures, not against them.

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Far be it from me to intervene on private grief, but the words in clause 17(2)(d) might cover that example. It refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any behaviour towards the witness on the part of . . . the accused''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The serious example described by the hon. Member for South Swindon would be caught by that wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> For all the reasons that I have given, I am satisfied that the clause's wording is exactly on point with the case that my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon described. However, that does not get round the problem of the tribunal and the person making the determination.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I must tell my hon. Friend that nothing that the Committee does will get over the existing problem caused by some tribunals. They take an attitude towards such cases which is unacceptable in this day and age. That is why I said that the clause must be seen as part of the process of changing the culture of the courts. I do not want to try your patience, Mr. Stevenson&#151;you will tell me if I stray out of order&#151;but this measure and other measures that the Commitee will discuss must be judged in the context of the body of work that needs to be done on the training, and the selection, of the judiciary who hear such cases. I shall come to those issues in more detail when it is more in order to do so. The best time may be on Report. I hope that I have dealt with my hon. Friend's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Am I intervening or making a speech?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Intervening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Therefore, I shall be brief. I agree with the Minister of State. He has answered the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for South Swindon. However, will he also deal with the crucial point, which is, what is the cause of the fear? The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy appeared to suggest that, just because people have a certain religious belief, they should be entitled to the special measures. My interpretation of the clause is that fear or distress should arise before someone is entitled to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Let me make it clear that what is important is not whether someone has a particular religious belief, is of a particular political persuasion, is in a particular relationship, has a particular ethnic origin, has particular domestic or employment circumstances, is from a certain social or cultural background or is of a particular age. What is important is the fear and distress that they experience. A court must be satisfied that that fear or distress is such as to impact on the quality of the evidence that they are capable of giving and it must be satisfied that the special measures would help. The emphasis is on the word ``satisfied'', which means exactly that. It is not a question of being beyond reasonable doubt, and we do not use phrases such as ``the balance of probabilities''.
<P>
A court must be satisfied. When it is, it is under an obligation to consider what special measures would help witnesses to overcome their fear. It is not for the court to explore whether the fear or apprehension is justified. If it exists, that is enough. The court does not have to decide whether it is justified. If the fear is likely to affect the evidence given, the special measures should be used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell </B>(Colchester): Would it not be to the advantage of all concerned if, when the victim requested special measures, they were granted? Otherwise, the victim might well have to go through the equivalent of a pre-trial hearing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No. There are circumstances in which it might be necessary for a victim to attend a pre-trial hearing, but they will be rare. It is enough for the request to be made and the reasons given. That is why we do not require the court to be satisfied that the fear or distress is for a justifiable reason. If the court is satisfied that there is fear or distress, that is enough. Otherwise, the hon. Gentleman might have a point.
<P>
If there were a big inquest and it came out that a woman had previously been beaten about the head and was terrified, or that a particular area had a history of racial violence and that racist remarks had been daubed on the wall, and if the individuals were made to relive those experiences, that would itself be a disincentive to proceed. They will not therefore be required to do that. Once the court is satisfied that fear or distress is present, that evidence might be diminished as a result and that special measures would help, those special measures will be provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> Is the Minister giving a categorical assurance that no victim will be required to attend the equivalent of a pre-trial hearing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That was the very thing that I said at the outset that I was not going to do, because it may be necessary in some circumstances. However, I do not expect that to be the norm. In so far as it is possible to use administrative guidance in these matters, there is no reason why such guidance should not make that clear. There are various reasons&#151;I shall not go into them in detail&#151;why it is undesirable to require the presence of the victim at the pre-trial hearing. What is important is that the CPS and the court are aware of the victim's views. It may be necessary to ensure administratively that that is the case.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes </B>(Stretford and Urmston): My hon. Friend's clarification has been helpful, but I want to be absolutely clear in my mind. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Having seen and heard the witness and assessed his degree of vulnerability . . . it will be for the court to determine what measures should be put in place.''&#151;[Official Report, 15 April 1999; Vol. 329, c. 458.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that mean that a victim of rape might be called to demonstrate her distress directly to the judge only in exceptional circumstances? Is that not the norm that the Minister anticipates? It would be helpful if he would clarify that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It would be extremely unlikely. I return to the point that I made earlier&#151;in response to the rape example cited by my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon&#151;about the presumptions that apply. Under clause 17(4) the presumptionis that the witness will be eligible. The presumption is the other way round: in other words, it will be for the defence to show why special measures should not apply in a sex case. It would not fall to the complainant to prove or demonstrate anything at all. It is highly unlikely that complainants in sex cases would need to attend a pre-trial hearing. As I said, the administrative measures at our disposal are there to be used in precisely such cases.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint (Don Valley):</B> Can we prevent the process of application for special measures from becoming the first stage in the adversarial contest between lawyers? It would help to speed up the decision on special measures. Could not the defence make a written application if it wants to rebut the measures? Even with my hon. Friend the Minister's assurance that the victim does not have to be present, the thought of defence and prosecution lawyers introducing sexual history at the initial stage is an extra pressure that the complainant should not have to face. Could we make the process administrative and take the heat out of the situation? That would strengthen the measure's presumption of the need for special measures for those who are eligible for them under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> My hon. Friend is right to be wary of adversarial pre-trial direction hearings. Attempts to make such hearings adversial invariably backfire.
<P>
Clause 19(1) provides for measures that can be granted on formal application or by the court's violation. I do not anticipate that those matters will be tackled adversarially. Differences of opinion may exist. The parties may make applications, but I do not envisage an adversarial hearing that a complainant is required to attend as a matter of course. There is no power to require the complainant to attend a pre-trial hearing. There is no right to attend such a hearing. Lawyers attend them, but live witnesses are not expected or required to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> Always?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am bound to say&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Sedentary interventions are out of order. Other interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Drown:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I trust that that question was asked in jest.
<P>
<B>Ms Drown:</B> No, it was not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I give way.
<P>
<B>Ms Drown:</B> My hon. Friend described rare circumstances in which witnesses might have to attend a pre-trial hearing to express their distress about being in the same room as the defendant. That could create a problem. The defendant is entitled to attend to instruct his lawyer, but the only way that a witness can receive the protection of not being in the same room as the defendant is by going to a pre-trial hearing that involves being in the same room as the defendant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am bound to say that that is an unlikely scenario. For example, it is difficult to persuade defendants to attend and pre-trial hearing when their presence is wanted, let alone when it is not wanted. There is no entitlement for a defendant to be present. If, by peradventure, the defendant turned up outside, or was brought to court, and the judge was minded to hear from a witness, he could required the defendant to be outside the court, or to be kept downstairs in the cells. I have practised law for 23 years, and I have never known that to happen. However, a judge has sufficient power over the court to prevent the scenario that my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Does the Minister agree that a pre-trial hearing is about the administrative position of the case? It would not be necessary for witnesses to attend; it is a question of determining how many would do so. My earlier point about the need to print this question on the form would suffice. The onus would then be on defending counsel to persuade a judge that witnesses should attend. The fears of the hon. Member for South Swindon would be allayed if there were an assurance about that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I have a great deal of confidence in the use of forms in so far as they are taken seriously by those who fill them in, and in so far as proper reflection is engendered by their existence, and the requirement to complete them. As a practising lawyer, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that on occasions a form is completed almost with casualness and speed minutes before the justices come into the room&#151;sometimes in their very presence&#151;and it is not exactly the sum product of much consideration or reflection. Therefore we must be careful to ensure, not only that forms assist the process but that administrative directions accompanying the forms, and the judge's approach to the format, encourage proper consideration before they are filled in. With those caveats, I think that the hon. Gentleman's suggestion is useful.
<P>
If memory serves me well, some forms that were used two years ago at pre-trial hearings did ask whether special measures were needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> They still do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am glad to hear it. So those forms hold out the prospect of being useful while not remotely requiring the attendance of anyone to give evidence live in what is, as the hon. Gentleman said, essentially an administrative hearing. The Committee having exhausted the topic, this might be the time for me to urge the hon. Member for Ryedale, who has heard and reflected on the responses&#151;tested extensively, as they have been&#151;to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I shall not use the word ``strayed'', Mr. Stevenson, for fear of incurring your wrath. I have certainly ranged across the clause. But that will have been useful, given that some of the points raised were pertinent to the following debate. I accept the Minister's comments for the moment, despite not being entirely certain that we have obtained clarification relating to the cause of the fear or distress. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall repeat the words of the hon. Member for Ryedale, who remarked that there had been a somewhat wide-ranging debate on the previous amendment, so I am sure that members of the Committee will not want to rehearse the same arguments on this amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 13, leave out lines 35 to 39.
<P>
I am grateful for your comment, Mr. Stevenson. I shall try to restrict my remarks to an explanation of the amendment.
<P>
As I studied the amendment, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, I became more and more persuaded that the amendment, by leaving something out, might leave a void. On the other hand, it might be argued that, in effect, despite what subsection (4) was intended to achieve in practice it would not make much difference. I shall briefly explain why.
<P>
If subsection (4), which the amendment would delete, gives complainants in sexual offence cases the right to eligibility, and the intention is to give greater priority to the complainant in sexual offence cases, I have much sympathy with what the hon. Member for South Swindon said. However, one might ask, what is the logic of that intention when the eligibility is still rebuttable? In order to obtain the special measures, the complainant in a sexual offence case would still have to satisfy the requirements of clause 17(1) even if one could anticipate that the defence would seek to rebut the eligibility. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere tabled this probing amendment to draw attention to that point.
<P>
It is clear that the Government intend to give greater priority to complainants in sexual offence cases, who should be eligible for the special measures. However, for the reasons that the Minister outlined, there will be an attempt to rebut; and if that rebuttal is based on the same requirements as clause 17(1), the final outcome will be the same.
<P>
The Government may want complainants in sexual offence cases to be given greater priority, but common practice suggests that they will not receive it. Technically, it could be worse: if, during the preparation of a case, the rape victim can assume that she will have the special measures, she may be encouraged to come forward and say that she is willing to go to court to testify in those circumstances. However, she may later discover that because the defence has been successful in rebutting the presumption, contrary to her expectations she must go to court and give evidence in the usual way. That could result in a very tricky situation. If she gives evidence, the experience may be wholly unhelpful, but if she does not, the trial will be less than satisfactory.
<P>
If I am correct in my expectation of how the adversarial arrangements will work, and not too cynical about defence lawyers, it means that they will be encouraged to go through a process of rebuttal. As the Minister said, there are two crucial questions to be asked. The court will take the decision, but what is the standard of proof? How will the courts make a judgment?
<P>
I said that it might be argued that if the subsection was deleted, something else should be put in its place. That brings me to the real issue: whether the eligibility given to complainants in sexual offence cases should be capable of rebuttal at all. I do not know whether it has been sent to every member of the Committee, but in my mailbag yesterday morning there was a letter signed by Sara McGuire, Michael Mansfield, Vera Baird, Anne Shamash, Joanna Toloczko and Ruth Bundey, most of whom are known to the Committee. They make a plea that at the very least the Committee should consider that special measures for complainants in sexual offences cases should automatically be available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Is that the view of the Opposition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not in a position to tell the hon. Gentleman what is the formal view of the Opposition, as I believe that I explained earlier. The issues to which we, as individuals, have to respond run so deep that one could ask Members of both main parties&#151;the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon, Member for Colchester, is temporarily not with us&#151;and the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy for their opinions and get different answers.
<P>
I shall not press the amendment to a Division as we are trying to take stock of the Committee's views. It is fair to say that the view of the hon. Member for South Swindon is different from that of the Minister. We need to debate the matter in a mature way.
<P>
The letter to which I referred a moment ago arrived too late for me to consider tabling an amendment, but we do not need an amendment to have a dabate on the issue, as you will appreciate, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
We tabled the amendment because we want to be convinced about the Government's scheme of things, which is to give priority, but for that priority to be rebuttable. We want to know to what extent that provides added protection and comfort for complainants is sexual offence cases. Complaints in other cases must rely on making their case under section 17(1) instead of there being a presumption that they have a right, although that right is rebuttable. I am not convinced that the proposal provides extra protection.
<P>
The signatories to the letter say that their 25 years' experience suggests that the issue should be dealt with decisively. We have an opportunity to do so that comes round only once in a very long time; that is why we must get it right. I leave the Minister with this thought: it is his Bill&#151;I am not thinking unkind&#151;and I know what he intends by including the subsection. However, some of his hon. Friends&#151;and I&#151;suspect that it will not achieve what he wants.
<P>
The Committee, and the House on Report, will have to judge whether subsection (4) as drafted will, in practice, give added protection. If we come to the conclusion that it will not, we need to address the issue differently. I am not saying that one would go quite as far as the signatories to the letter and say that it must always be irrebuttable. I shall ask my right hon. and hon. Friends in the shadow Cabinet, especially my hon. and learned Friend the member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier), the new shadow Attorney-General, to see whether there is a way of continuing to allow rebuttal, but in circumstances so limited that it will not become normal practice for rebuttal to be sought.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Drown:</B> I oppose the amendment, but I want to probe my hon. Friend the Minister a little further about why subsection (4) does not say, ``entitled to assistance'' rather than ``eligible for assistance''. I know that he has already told the Committee his views, but it is important for the arguments to be heard.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rydedale has given some reasons why it might be appropriate to say that a witness in a sexual offence case should be entitled, as a right, to special measures. One of the most important factors is to try to get rid of the uncertainty that so many witnesses face in such cases. The Home Office report, ``Speaking Up for Justice'' said that uncertainty was a problem that must be remedied. Without an automatic right to special measures, witnesses could face months of uncertainty. If we are to encourage more women&#151;rape victims in particular&#151;to come forward, there must be more certainty in the process.
<P>
I have spoken to the Crown Prosecution Service, police officers and women's refuges. They agree that if it were possible to say to the woman when she first walks into the police station, ``If the case goes to court, we assure you that there will be a screen if you want it'', it would make the process so much better for her as a witness. They also talked interestingly about how the process has developed with child witnesses. When they were first offered screens or video links, judges and lawyers were wary and said that it would affect the quality of evidence, and that cases would fall because juries would feel at a distance from the witness. The practice is now common, and no child has been refused special measures in recent years.
<P>
There are further advantages in giving an automatic right to special measures, unless the witness does not want them. Sometimes, there is concern that special measures or a screen somehow prejudice the defendant. If a screen were an automatic right, the judge could say to the jury, ``You mustn't take any implication from the fact that there is a screen or special measure; it is an automatic right for witnesses in such cases.''
<P>
To get over the problem of the court needing to feel that it is in charge of its procedures, several organisations have suggested that there should be an automatic right to special measures, but that the court should be free to decide what the appropriate special measure should be&#151;a screen, video link, clearing the court, or whatever. Will my hon. Friend the Minister think about that?
<P>
In addition to the organisations mentioned by the hon. Member for Ryedale, I point to two other examples of support for this proposal. First, research was carried out in 1996 by A. Konradi, entitled, ``Understanding Rape Survivors and their Preparations for Court''. That research showed clearly how victims would give better evidence if they had the protections that they wanted. Secondly, the Zero Tolerance charitable trust says that the judicial system has a poor record on protecting women and children who experience crimes of violence. It points to the growing amount of academic research and women's testimony that the experience in court is like being raped all over again.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will think about those witnesses in such cases. It is an issue not only about fear, distress and potential intimidation if a defendant is in the same room, but about allowing the defendant the right to see the victim again and the right to be in the same room. One-way screens do not solve that, but we should ask women, ``What would encourage you to come forward to try to increase the appalling rate of convictions for rape?''

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I have much sympathy with the hon. Lady's views, although I stop short on there being an automatic right. I am not ideologically opposed to that, but we should be striving for the position outlined by the hon. Member for Ryedale, in which defence lawyers can apply routinely for an exemption. That will not continue. I believe that judges will stamp on that very soon; otherwise there is no point in the proposed legislation.
<P>
When the Bill is enacted, I think that there will be some directions on practice from the Court of Appeal, the Judicial Studies Board or the Lord Chancellor's Department. It is vital that judges realise that the cases for which exemption is allowable will be very few, and arise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. Otherwise, all the work that has been done will come to nothing. There will be more heartache for the witnesses who have already suffered traumas. I do not think that it will become routine for lawyers to apply for exemptions, but to bring about a change in culture&#151;to adopt the Minister's words&#151;there will have to be firm practice directions so that everyone realises when there is an exceptional case, although I cannot foresee what it might be. That will be the only time when there is an exception to the rule.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> It is important for my hon. Friend the Minister to clarify the position. I hope that he will say that, should an application for special measures not be allowed, there will be clear guidance requiring judges to say why not. Will my hon. Friend clarify the position for domestic violence victims? They may not have been raped, but they will be going to court on charges of assault. They may require special measures because of the nature of the domestic violence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I can respond immediately to my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley. Such victims do not have the benefit of the automatic presumption that applies in cases of rape. They have the potential benefit of special measures, but it is not automatic.
<P>
With regard to rape and sexual offences generally, we must be clear about what is intended by the amendment. It would do the reverse of what has been outlined by the hon. Member for Ryedale. Not only would it remove the presumption that we have put forward in favour of special measures for victims of rape and other sexual offences, but it would make it incumbent on the prosecution, on behalf of the complainant, to establish why special measures should be introduced. My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon is absolutely right to oppose the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Ryedale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No. The hon. Member for Ryedale reflects absolutely the Opposition's position, which was demonstrated by every Opposition Member who spoke&#151;bar one, and she a woman&#151;on Second Reading.
<P>
I welcome the Damascene conversion of the hon. Member for Ryedale to the interests of witnesses and victims in rape cases, but it is contrary to the view of the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), who would have us believe that the Government are embarking on a course of action that is inimical to the interests of justice. The Opposition will have to get their act together pretty quickly because we will give them only some leeway&#151;in view of the chaos and confusion that now reigns after yesterday's events&#151;and will not seek to gain too much party political advantage from their obvious discomfiture at the changes made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day (Cheadle):</B> The Minister is getting bored with the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No, I am not&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have already referred to sedentary interjections, and I hope that I will not have to refer to them again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful for your protection in these matters, Mr Stevenson.
<P>
It is a bit rich of the hon. Member for Ryedale to speak to an amendment and then to suggest that what we are proposing for the first time to protect rape victims somehow might not go far enough, especially when the very amendment to which he speaks would remove that protection entirely. Nevertheless, I shall take it in good part as a probing amendment, which effectively allows me to discount the amendment itself and discuss the real points made by my hon. Friends the Members for South Swindon, for Don Valley and, in other representations, by my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart), for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes), for Luton, South (Ms Moran) and for Lancaster and Wyre.
<P>
I say that because this is a serious debate and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) said, because there is widespread concern among the people whom we represent about the failure of the culture in the criminal justice system adequately to protect the interests of the victims of sexual crime. So much is that the case&#151;it does not make happy reading&#151;that where in 1985 the percentage of initial reports of rape that ended in a conviction was 24 per cent., by 1996 it had fallen to nine per cent. That is why the issue is so serious and why we must create a balance between the interests of the defendant and those of victims and witnesses.
<P>
Above all, it is vital that the evidence available to the jury is the best possible so it can have confidence in it. I can assure the Committee that we will listen to any suggestions that are intended to ensure that the jury receives the best possible evidence.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I greatly welcome therefore the contributions that my hon. Friends have made in correspondence and in Committee. They have given us food for thought. We shall, in Committee and on Report, consider how best to deal with their concerns about the balance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I do not know whether the Minister of State was speaking tongue in cheek, but he has not done himself or the subject any credit by seeking to politicise the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Well&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I speak for myself and all Opposition Members. We feel as deeply as everyone else about the subject. I have practised law for 25 years and I have seen cases day in and day out. I object to the politicising of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but I do not think that even he would suggest that he was in any way dragged&#151;either by implication or directly&#151;into what was a political response to a mischievous contribution from the hon. Member for Ryedale. I do not want to go over ground that I have already covered. However, it was a bit rich to table an amendment, seek to renege on it and then question the Government's competence and commitment to the cause.
<P>
My response was a little tongue in cheek, but it contained some seriousness. However, I exempt completely from my admonitions the hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and for Colchester (Mr. Russell). Blames lies squarely with the hon. Member for Ryedale, but I shall not go down that road. Let us return to the issue.
<P>
Complainants in cases of sexual offences can be expected to find giving evidence distressing. Their evidence is bound to be of an intimate nature. Anyone who considers that he or she has been raped is likely to have found the experience profoundly distressing and is unlikely to want to relive it in front of strangers. That is true regardless of how robust someone might be in other life situations.
<P>
It does not matter what a person's occupation is. In communication with me, my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon raised the question of the distress that might be caused to a rape victim who is a lawyer. She might be denied special measures because she was a lawyer and had therefore heard such cases before. It might be felt that giving evidence is unlikely to have any effect on her. My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley made a similar point to my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon.
<P>
It should not matter however robust one is. The clause seeks to make it a presumption that witnesses should have special measures. The defence teams will have to rebut that presumption, so the onus is on them. I take the point of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy that some will try it on initially. That is in the nature of the adversarial process and the profession. However, we have to make sure&#151;this is where changing the culture comes into play&#151;that judges, in the exercise of their proper judicial function, understand clearly what the intention of Parliament is. I hope that the withdrawal of the amendment and our returning to the matter on Report will demonstrate that our intention is, and will be in the overwhelming majority of cases, to afford special protection to the complainant in rape cases. That is a reasonable position to take and the Government will strive with as many allies as possible on the Opposition Benches on the Floor of the House to ensure that the Bill leaves this place with that presumption buoyed up and strengthened in every way. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister has been uncharacteristically uncharitable. I said at the outset that the purpose of the amendment was to test whether the reverse process in respect of complainants in sexual offence cases was worth the way in which it is expressed in the Bill and whether the fact that the rebuttable element was based on the same test as for everyone else would afford some protection.
<P>
For all the Minister's fine words about the Government's intentions, he effectively admitted that he is not completely satisfied that the Bill, as drafted, meets the concerns of his hon. Friends. He points to potential differences between me and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, who is not an Opposition spokesman, but speaks from the Back Benches. As a lawyer, he is entitled to his opinions. I can say plenty about that in respect of both sides of the Committee. I have no doubt that some Labour Members who practise at the Bar, especially the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham), with whom I served on the Home Affairs Select Committee for 10 years, would have a word or two to say about our discussions were he to have had the misfortune to be appointed a member of the Committee by the Government Whips' Office, which would have prevented him from appearing in court.
<P>
The debate has highlighted the fact that there is clear disagreement between the Minister and his hon. Friends. I will be charitable, not uncharitable, and I think that Labour Members should take away from the Committee the thought that the Minister is willing to reconsider the clause's drafting.&#151;[Interruption.] I understood him to say that, between now and the Bill being discussed on Report, that that was his intention. If no, and if the Minister intends to bring forward the Bill on Report without fresh thoughts, Labour Members will not be satisfied. It is clear from the letter that I read out to the Committee, which I no longer have in my possession, having passed it to Hansard, that several leading barristers are not satisfied that the Bill will provide adequate protection. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere thought up the amendment and tabled it in our names.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> Go on, blame the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not blaming anyone. My hon. Friend was right to highlight the fact that the subsection needs attention, and that is what Labour Members have said throughout the debate. Hansard will show that I am the only Front-Bench spokesman to have had the grace to reflect that concern.
<P>
Despite what the Minister says, I am not satisfied that subsection (4) gives the protection that the Government claim for it. We shall obviously need to reconsider the matter on Report. The Minister has admitted that much at least. I shall not commit myself to table a revised amendment on Report, anymore than the Minister has. However, he has acknowledged the anxieties that have been expressed about the matter. There is only one way to interpret the provision; even though the intention is to give a priority and reverse the process, in many cases the effect will, in practice, be the same. That is why Labour Members are anxious; indeed, I can see from their faces that I have struck a chord this afternoon.
<P>
It has been an important debate. I am not convinced by what the Minister said. I have an inkling that, truth be known, neither is he convinced that the wording has the full impact that he Government seek to achieve. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Special Measures Available to Eligible Witnesses</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 14, line 4, at end insert `and subsection 2(A)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 46, in page 14, line 12, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) A court may only make a special measures direction in relation to a witness eligible for assistance by virtue of section 17 if it is satisfied that the impairment of the administration of justice likely to result from a dimunition in the quality of the evidence of a witness if a direction is not made outweighs the desirability of justice being administered openly and in accordance with the procedures which would otherwise be followed.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The first word in my notes is ``probe''. I hope that I have established what we are about and that we can make more speedy progress. I certainly do not intend to labour the point. I want to know how the courts will be required to balance the interests of a vulnerable witness in need of protection against the need&#151;indeed, the right&#151;of a defendant to have uninhibited access to open justice and for the defence lawyer to engage in cross-examination.
<P>
Another phrase usually provokes a prolonged debate, but I do not want that to happen today. The Minister will be aware of the concern that some elements of the Government's proposals may infringe the provisions of the European convention on human rights on the rights of the defendant.
<P>
The amendments pose two questions. First, how will that balance be struck? Secondly, what thought have the Government given to allowing the Home Secretary to sign the certificate on the front of the Bill?
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The balance will be struck by the judge, who will take into account all the circumstances. He will have before him the prosecution's evidence, hear the arguments, make an assessment of the issues involved and have control over the court's processes so as to ensure that the jury has access to the best evidence possible. The judge holds the ring, reconciling the defendant's and victim's rights, the witnesses and the public interest.
<P>
That is why ``Speaking Up for Justice'' recommended a rebuttable presumption in relation to rape and sexual offences. It recommended a presumption, not a mandatory requirement, that such special measures be provided. That is the thrust behind the discussions that we have had in Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale is right to say that there will be disagreement across the party political divisions about how that balance will be achieved and where the line should be drawn. However, the Government and&#151;I would argue&#151;a responsible Opposition must bear in mind the European convention on human rights.
<P>
We have done that and are satisfied that the Bill strikes a balance that meets the requirements of the convention, and those of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department and Lord Williams of Mostyn, who speaks on such matters in the other place. During the course of deliberations in the other place, Lord Williams said that the Bill meets the requirements of the convention.
<P>
At the same time, we must address concerns expressed by my hon. Friends about a criminal justice system that has been perceived as failing rape victims. We are determined to address concerns about such failings, which are reflected widely in the community that we seek to represent.
<P>
We have struck a balance. The special measures for which the Bill makes provision are intended to accommodate the needs of the witness within the trial's overarching aim and the fairness that must lie at its heart. The court should not put the procedural interest&#151;or, as the amendment would require, running the trial in a normal manner, without special measures&#151;above the need to arrive at a fair position at which the interests of justice are served. That applies in cases in which the court thinks that a witness will benefit from special measures which will not adversely affect the other party's ability to test the witness's evidence.
<P>
Undoubtedly, lawyers are predisposed to matters remaining as they are. So many of them react instinctively against the taking of special measures. We must live with that fact, but we do not accept it. We are determined to change the basis on which the court addresses such issues, so that there is a proper presumption that special measures should apply when appropriate.
<P>
We are satisfied that that is in accordance with the European convention on human rights. Special measures will be granted only when the court has considered whether any measure would inhibit a witness's evidence being effectively tendered. The only exception to that is when there is, quite properly, a specially targeted presumption in favour of providing special measures for child witnesses in especially harrowing cases, such as those that we are all aware of that involve allegations of serious sexual violence and cruelty. The convention has plenty of jurisprudence upholding the importance of special protection for special categories of witness. For those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Ryedale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister, in the tenor of his reply, brought us back to more consensual ground and asserted his conviction on several matters. I did not seek to advance a detailed argument in support of such concerns, but merely to flag them up, so I shall not press the point whether he has fully demonstrated why they are not justified. Only time will tell whether they are or not. In the fullness of that time our courts will interpret the issue, and there may be challenges under the European convention on human rights. Ministers are entitled to assert their judgment&#151;that the measures conform with the convention&#151;and others are entitled to express alternative views. We shall not know the outcome for many years. The arrangements are only pilots, so there will be opportunities to consider them again in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I shall express resentment from my point of view and, I suspect, from the points of view of others who are strongly in favour of special measures and want to see them extended and made mandatory. I cannot conceive of them working against the interests of defendants. Their purpose is to get facts into the open, and there is nothing in special measures that would prevent facts from being challenged. Special measures get rid of intimidation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman tempts me to make a point that I was trying to avoid and have an argument about the convention. On reading the convention, he will see that defendants have rights. We are not talking about victims, as I have made abundantly clear. Defendants have rights, so it is correct to consider the issue of balance, as there will be challenges if there is no balance and rights are not properly protected. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I shall ask the Minister some questions, which I hope he will accept in the spirit in which they are offered. These are, first, on the time scale of the pilots and the areas in which he thinks they are likely to be introduced and, secondly, on who will put the case for the witness. We know that the prosecution or the defence can apply to do so, but a defence witness may feel as intimidated as a witness for the prosecution. I think particularly of gang warfare cases or assault cases where those giving evidence for the prosecution may not take kindly to witnesses who speak up or might be available to speak up for a defendant and without whose evidence a miscarriage of justice might arise. There is also the question of what process will apply in respect of witnesses obtaining the special measures in such circumstances. Clause 19(1)(b) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``the court of its own motion''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
may grant the special measures; it is fair to ask how that will be activated. Can the Minister explain the mechanism that allows a witness to approach the court, as provided in clause 16(4)? Will such a witness be entitled to seek advice and, if so, from where? Finally, how will witnesses know that pilots are available in their area? We are discussing changing not the generality of criminal justice law but certain elements on an experimental basis. That suggests that, at least initially, courts in pilot areas will go out of their way, in cases where there is any prospect of witnesses needing special measures, to ensure that witnesses know that they are available. I think that the Minister will acknowledge that there could be circumstances in which a witness may need special measures that may not necessarily be immediately obvious to the prosecution or the defence.
<P>
A final question for the Minister is on a long-term issue. We are talking about protection for witnesses in criminal cases but the Minister will realise that one does not need much imagination to predict that there may be a need for special measures in some civil cases. To what extent has he and the Secretary of State discussed that between themselves and with the Lord Chancellor's Department?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his important points. I shall set out how we intend to proceed. First, we intend to do so with due expedition. It is important not to let the grass grow under our feet, and we have not done so. ``Speaking Up for Justice'' is being taken forward by an interdepartmental, multi-agency steering group responsible for considering the 78 recommendations in that document, some of which are reflected in the Bill. That group is drafting a comprehensive implementation plan so that all the measures are implemented syllogistically.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Rysdale referred to the Lord Chancellor's Department, which is represented on the group and will be aware of the implications for civil jurisdiction. He will not expect me, as the Minister responsible for criminal justice policy, to comment on that.
<P>
We shall ensure that the pilots are identified at an early stage so that we can begin to prepare the infrastructure in pilot areas. At this stage, I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman where those pilots will take place. Discussion continues on whether they should do so on an area-by-area basis.
<P>
We intend to start implementing the simpler measures by the end of next year. The more complex ones will require training and guidance, not least for the Crown Prosecution Service, barristers and, for some of the special measures, solicitors and solicitor-advocates. Solicitors responsible for identifying and corralling defence witnesses, for example, will need to bear in mind the importance of notifying the court of any special measures that may be necessary in relation to those witnesses. For example, those calling witnesses with learning difficulties will need to assure them that their special vulnerabilities have been taken into account and drawn to the court's attention.
<P>
Training and direction with, from and by the professions will be necessary. I welcome the Bar Council's commitment articulated at the recent Childline conference, and its recognition of the need for the special training of barristers. Such training will meet some of the anxieties that some of us have had about the tone and manner of cross-examination of vulnerable witnesses that at times seems designed more to undermine and corrode than to assist and elucidate. Although proper professional scope for undermining credibility always exists, it needs to be done in a way that reflects a professional approach that is not destructive of the witness's character and personality. A proper balance should be struck. I welcome the Bar Council's recognition of that.
<P>
For some of the Bill's more complex measures relating to the presumption in favour of video-recording cross-examination of child witnesses in sexual offence cases, it will be necessary to have in place sufficient facilities of a sufficient standard to bear piloting. Work will need to commence on that at an early stage. It will also be necessary to ensure that any operational difficulties have been identified and dealt with before the pilots are established, so that accurate judgements based on the pilots can be made.
<P>
The issues raised by the hon. Member for Ryedale about making the court aware of potential needs for special measures might be usefully addressed, as mentioned earlier by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, by the witness summons form. Forms can be used in innovative and constructive ways to impart information and increase awareness of witnesses' rights. We are giving thought and deliberation to these issues and we welcome views from hon. Members and indeed the public, which has an interest in carrying these matters forward expeditiously.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Special measures direction relating to eligible witness</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 15, line 13, after `witness', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or any other party to the proceedings'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 50, in Clause 21, page 16, line 43, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after hearing representations from the parties'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not intend to detain the Committee. The purpose of amendment No. 47 is to inquire whether the defence should be entitled to express a view and, if so, how that entitlement will be ensured. That is what lies behind the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or any other party to the proceedings''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is all I want to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I shall be brief. The amendments are practicable and in no way inhibit the powers to be vested in the court. There is every reason for the views of all parties in the case to be considered in reaching a conclusion about the efficacy of a special measure direction. At the end of the day and despite the need to ensure fair play for all and observance of the Human Rights Act 1998, the needs of the witness must be paramount. After all, we start from the standpoint that the witness is, by definition, vulnerable so he or she must come uppermost in the court's thinking and consideration. Having said that, I see no reason why the views of all should not be taken into account in arriving at a conclusion. That will inform and improve the quality of the court's final decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Before making a special measures direction, the Bill requires the court to consider the witness's views and the interests of the party testing the witness's evidence. The party calling the witness will usually have made the application for special measures so each interest will have been taken into account. If the court decides to make a special measures direction on its own motion, I expect it to consult the party calling the witnesses, as well as the witnesses and the other party. It can also consult the witnesses' parents, social workers or any other source of expert advice. However, I do not see the need to consider the interests of a co-defendant who is not testing a witness's evidence.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said, the proposal is designed for especially vulnerable witnesses. It is to ensure that those vulnerabilities are taken into account that we believe that special measures should be considered and, when appropriate, granted. No other interest, other than that of a person testing a witness's evidence, is relevant. The witness's vulnerability is something that the court will take into account, and the interests of the co-defendants who are not testing the witness's evidence are to that extent immaterial. The Bill will require courts to take into account the interests of all essential witnesses.
<P>
I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn. If it were accepted, there would, as the hon. member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy pointed out, be the danger that witnesses' views would not be treated as paramount. They are paramount and should not be seen as of lesser importance. The prosecution and the defence will have their say, but this measure is about the interests of witnesses. When the co-defendants or other parties to the proceedings are not challenging a witness's evidence, it is not necessary to afford them the rights and opportunities that the amendment would give them.
<P>
The Bill underlines the special importance of the witness's opinions. For that reason and because of the earlier remarks of the hon. Member for Ryedale, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's confirmation that the defence will have the right to make the necessary representations. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Will the Minister say a word or two about subsection (6) and what it will mean in practice? Courts already have significant discretion to make some special measures. In particular, they can use video links for the giving of evidence. The importance of that discretion has been made clear, but the Minister said that the Government's proposals would be introduced in pilots towards the end of next year. Therefore, it will be a considerable time before the Bill, when enacted, will deal with the concerns that we have expressed.
<P>
It would be helpful for the Minister of State to remind us of what the courts can already do. I do not expect an exhaustive explanation, but subsection (6) reminds us that the courts already have certain powers and certain relatively unfettered discretion that they can use. We hope that, given the strength of feeling expressed on Second Reading and in Committee, courts might be encouraged to use the powers more often and not wait until all the pilots have been introduced. I see that I have touched a chord with the Minister.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Smith (Basildon):</B> Perhaps I should declare something of an interest in that I wanted especially to speak about special measures relating to people with learning difficulties. Both my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon and I have vice-chaired the VOICE Association of the House of Commons. It might help the Minister if at this point I relayed a comment that was made at our annual general meeting by Dr. Chris Williams of VOICE, who spoke about the protection of vulnerable people. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I find myself in the strange position of being in the House of Commons and not primarily wanting to hit the table and demand that someone `does something' about something.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The reason is, of course, the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is good testament indeed to the special measures in the Bill which have been warmly welcomed by so many groups.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will consider three extra points and give the Committee some clarification. At meetings of the parliamentary VOICE group, we have heard some disturbing and distressing tales from people who have been through the court system. People with learning difficulties have been abused because they did not have the necessary access to be able to give the court the information that they wanted to give. The Bill will address this problem.
<P>
I welcome the comments from the hon. Member for Ryedale, which were very different from those of his right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), who said on Second Reading that we were looking for better quality evidence so as to get more justice in the court system.
<P>
With that in mind, will the Minister first look at special measures for people with moderate learning difficulties? Many people have moderate difficulties that may not immediately be noticed in the court system, although they need guidance and assistance, as the hon. Member for Ryedale said. The hon. Gentleman does not have learning difficulties, but he said that he was alarmed when he went to court for the first time. I am sure that many people feel that way. I wonder whether special measures could be extended to people with moderate learning difficulties.
<P>
Secondly, we all welcome the introduction of intermediaries into the court system when someone is giving evidence. But for people with learning difficulties, problems sometimes arise when they try to explain to their lawyers or to the court what their difficulties are and what special measures would be most appropriate for them. It would assist the courts if communications skills proved to be the difficulty, or if someone with with severe learning difficulties who did not understand the nature or extent of his problem had a member of his family to assist the court in giving evidence so that it could decide on what special measures could be made available, and how they could be carried out. Help such as that would remove the occasional problem of intimidation. A witness with learning difficulties could be intimidated and might not want to give evidence in court, or an outside body might not wish to do so. The presence of a friend to assist the court could help considerably. I do not suggest that there should be a statutory duty to consult a carer, because many people who need special measures will themselves identify their need. However, there are caes where a carer, patient, friend or relation will be able to assist the court.
<P>
My third point may seem technical but I should be glad if the Minister would consider it. Clause 19(3)(b), relating to quality of evidence, refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether the measure or measures tend to inhibit such evidence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems to me that the phrase ``might tend'' could be an expectation that may or may not be fulfilled. It could be seen as a get-out clause to be used in different cases. It could be said that there could be cases where something ``might'' tend to inhibit the evidence being tested. ``Might tend'' would be very remote. I should like the Minister to look again at the phrase. If we could delete the word ``might'' and substitute ``would tend to inhibit such evidence'' the onus would be on the defence to produce evidence that could affect the evidence being tested in court.
<P>
Many hon. Members greatly welcome special measures. Several people to whom I have spoken who have been through the court system said that the provision could have made a difference to them. A friend of mine was attacked in a rape case. Had the measures been in place, her story might have been different. The people from Voice to whom I spoke believed that their stories might have been different had the special measures been in place many years ago. Therefore, I welcome the measures warmly, but I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider the three points that I made.

<P>

<B>Ms Drown:</B> I want to take up those points briefly. Subsections (2) and (3) still apply to children. I appreciate that a Government amendment, which would introduce a stronger presumption for children, will be tabled later. However, while the clause remains in the Bill, my hon. Friend the Minister should clarify what takes precedence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Let me say in response to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon that I appreciate the work of Voice. It has sometimes provided a voice that has been sorely missed on behalf of the interests and well-being of people with learning difficulties. Those people have not had a voice. On occasion, without Voice, they would not have one. We owe that organisation a debt of gratitude, not least because it involves people with learning difficulties at the heart of its advocacy. That is important.
<P>
We want to ensure that the court has the capacity to arrive at a view on the needs and requirements for special measures that arise from any vulnerability. Therefore, we do not try to differentiate low, moderate or high learning difficulties. A person with moderate learning difficulties who feels that he requires special measures should be able to receive them if he can satisfy the court of that need. We must ensure that the court is able to make a decision about that need. That requires the sort of training, awareness and sensitivity about learning difficulties that has not always existed in the past. I undertake to explore the matter with officials, with a view to discussing with the Judicial Studies Board how its input into training might be enhanced. That would be valuable.
<P>
On the role of intermediaries, it is important to recognise that a court, under its existing discretion, can hear evidence from a carer, relative or social worker. There is continuing and important provision for supporters to accompany witnesses. We can reinforce that in the guidance to create an atmosphere that is conducive to allowing the person with learning difficulties to give of his best. Familiar people can sometimes compensate for unfamiliar surroundings. Even if those familiar people have to be accommodated in the well of the court&#151;in the eyeline of the person with learning difficulties, but where they would not usually be seen&#151;that cold bolster the confidence of those with learning difficulties.
<P>
The provision is about enabling people with learning difficulties to give of their best. It is not about preferring one person's evidence to that of another, nor is it about saying that people with learning difficulties cannot be wrong. It is not about saying that they cannot be completely wrong or misguided, or that they are misinforming the court inadvertently or advertently. Such people are just like the rest of us, with the same strengths and vulnerability, but happen to have learning difficulties and a particular vulnerability that needs to be understood.
<P>
I have a great deal of sympathy with the third point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon. I must, however, bear in mind the certification that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has given in respect of the European convention on human rights. I shall reflect on the impact of the convention on the wording that she suggested. Under article 6&#151;the right to a fair trial&#151;everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to have witnesses against him and those who are called on his behalf examined under the same conditions.
<P>
The courts will have to interpret the Human Rights Act 1998 in a way that is consistent with article 6 of the covention, so any change in the wording that we might introduce in response to my hon. Friend's concerns about a perceived lack of strength in the provision as drafted would still have to be read subject to article 6. I shall reflect on what she said to ascertain what, if anything, we can do to meet her concern, which is shared by other members of the Committee. We want to meet it in a way that would not undermine the right of the defendant to have witnesses examined in comparable terms with those called on his behalf.
<P>
I turn now to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon. The interrelationship between clause 19(2) and new clause 3 is set out in the proposed subsection (2) of the new clause. It would create a stronger presumption in favour of certain special measures for child witnesses, which must be seen within the overall scheme of clause 19, subsection (3) of which will not apply in cases when a presumption falls to be made under the new clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale referred to the court's inherent jurisdiction. It is important that Parliament, when making new law, does not unwittingly interfere with, or erode, that jurisdiction. Over the years, the court's inherent jurisdiction has gained the flexibility that is essential to enable the judge who holds the ring to see that fairness reigns, justice is done and that the interests of the various parties are balanced. Undoubtedly, that inherent jurisdication existed in the past to enable the provision of, for example, foreign language interpreters and of interpreters for the deaf. The hon. Member for Ryedale asked for examples in which the court is cleared and when screens are provided for witnesses who are defendants or who are otherwise ineligible for special measures under the Bill. The inherent jurisdiction of the court will still exist.

Concern has been expressed in Committee today that inherent jurisdiction has not been used more generously in the past. I well understand that point. It is not for me, as a member of the Executive, to climb into the ring on those inherent jurisdictions that belong to the judiciary&#151;save to say that, when the Bill has received Royal Assent and becomes an Act it will be appropriate for the court to have mind of it when the prosecution or the defence raises matters about special measures for vulnerable witnesses. That will be regardless of the fact that we have not yet implemented the pilot. The measure will be on the statute book; it will be a perfectly legitimate expectation on our part to say that we expect judges to get the message, which has been expressed clearly this afternoon on both sides of the Committee and will continue to be expressed.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
