<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Atkinson and look forward to serving under your expert and erudite chairmanship. We had a good preliminary sitting under the chairmanship of Mr. Maxton, and we look forward to your encouragement and judicious intervention in our debates to ensure that we stay in order.
<P>
I shall concentrate my remarks on amendment No. 1. The Committee will have noted that amendment No. 55 is technical. It is consequential on amendment No. 1 and would ensure, if passed, that amendment No. 1 has the desired effect.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 would narrow the enormous scope of the principal clause. We shall provide evidence during the debate to show how its wide-ranging scope and powers need to be narrowed. We may need to have a similar debate on the parallel power concerning the dominant position. I am sure that the Committee has grasped the fact that clause 2 covers one of the two central powers of the Bill. We must explore why it is so wide ranging. It should be narrowed to make the transition to and impact of the Bill more manageable for business and more sensible for customers in the marketplace.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) will focus on the impact that our amendment, if successful, would have on reducing the substantial compliance costs that the Bill would impose on British business. We disagree with the Government's forecast for compliance costs; we believe that they will be many times higher than the amount that the Government have specified. One of the principal strengths of amendment No. 1 is that it would greatly reduce those prospective compliance costs, but I shall leave it to my hon. Friend to make that case in his excellent way.
<P>
We shall highlight the effect that the unamended Bill will have on the retail pharmacy sector. That industry is a good example of the dramatic impact that the Bill will have on small and valued local businesses throughout the country. My hon. Friends the Members for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) and for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) will concentrate their remarks on the consequences of the clause for retail pharmacies. They will support my amendment, which, if successful, would narrow the clause's impact on a range of businesses.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 would add a new subsection (9) to clause 2 and would limit preceding powers in the clause. As I have said, the clause is wide ranging. Under subsection (1),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings, or concerted practices which . . . may affect trade within the United Kingdom, and . . . have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition . . . are prohibited.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an entirely new departure in British law.
<P>
Under current competition law, which many businesses think is quite tough enough, one is allowed to carry on with an existing business or practice unless or until the competition authorities have investigated it and found it to be unreasonable; in which case, one is asked to desist from that conduct. Under current legislation, businesses that are worried about their practices have the option to register those practices as registered agreements, which gives them the comfort of knowing that proceedings will not be taken against them.
<P>
The burden will shift dramatically under the new regime. Businesses will have to satisfy themselves that nothing that they do could be construed as being anti-competitive. If they make a genuine mistake or error they can be prosecuted by the new competition authority and fined up to 10 per cent. of turnover for the infringement. The new law would therefore have a strong element of retrospection; it would impose much tougher penalties; and it would threaten far too many business practices--practices that might be perfectly reasonable under the new regime and which are perfectly reasonable today.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> The right hon. Gentleman skirts over the fact that many of the 10,000 agreements registered with the Office of Fair Trading are not significant in terms of competition. It is an enormous burden, over which the right hon. Gentleman's Government presided. The Office of Fair Trading says that the practice is wholly unnecessary. We are moving to ensure that it does not continue. The right hon. Gentleman offers no solution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am offering a partial solution. The Minister will realise from later amendments that we suggest a de minimis threshold, which would exempt quite a lot of agreements and arrangements. If the Minister wants a higher threshold, which would exempt even more agreements, we shall look favourably on it. He will concede that that would represent some reduction in the work load.
<P>
Although the Minister is right to say that, over the years, a lot of effort has been put into examining and registering those agreements, that work has now been done. The Bill, however, will destroy it, because no grandfather or grandmother rights exist to carry those agreements forward. The Bill imposes exactly the same burden on businesses as did the original requirement for businesses to investigate and register their agreements. They will have to start again.
<P>
The Minister will no doubt remind us of what his boss, the President of the Board of Trade, told the House. The right hon. Lady said that the Bill is designed to be tougher and that, by definition, all the agreements that were all right under the existing system will have to be re-examined. Businesses and lawyers will have to take difficult decisions, such as whether to drop their practices in case they are caught under the new law, or whether to take the risk of continuing with them and of retrospective fines being imposed.
<P>
That is why we believe that compliance costs will be massive. Every one of the registered agreements, and quite a lot of unregistered agreements, will have to be explored anew. Good legal advice will have to be taken before the directors of those firms can be sure of continuing to do what they have been doing previously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Will my right hon. Friend concede that as vertical agreements are a pervasive and entirely normal practice, and without reference to the inhibition of competition, we face the prospect not of the 10,000 or so existing registered agreements but of, potentially, at least until the Government define the exceptions or exemptions, an infinity of agreements, all of which will have to be considered for exemption, although perhaps not formally applied for?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. Yet again, I was being too moderate, because I was concentrating only on the agreements that have already been registered, which will need to be re-examined. However, a host of other arrangements and agreements exist--perhaps a multiple of the 10,000--that any sensible director or legal adviser would have to put to lawyers again, to discover whether they might fall foul of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): I confess that I find my right hon. Friend's wetness somewhat disappointing--and surprising. However, I shall do my best this morning to stiffen his resolve. In the light of what was said on Second Reading, does my right hon. Friend think that the President of the Board of Trade now regrets saying, when the draft Bill was published last August, that she saw a good case for excluding most vertical agreements from the scope of the Bill, which I know most business would welcome?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I cannot be sure of the state of mind of the President of the Board of Trade because she is not, as my hon. Friend may know, one of my closest confidants and because she is not present in the Committee and does not seem to be taking a great interest in the important deliberations on the Bill. However, she may now regret those words, especially as her new mode of responding to any query is to say that it is too difficult for a mere Minister and must be deferred to a quango and the Director General of Fair Trading. This is a lady who creates the Bill with the help of her officials, who is absent from any of its proceedings, who sees it creating enormous confusion among businesses--who now do not know what the Bill will and will not allow them to do--and who retreats behind the lines by saying that the director general and the new competition authority will tell the business man whether he got it right or wrong by either taking him to court and fining him, or letting him get away with a practice that he had always thought perfectly reasonable.
<P>
The Minister should accept the spirit of the amendment and of my remarks. I make a sincere plea to him to try to understand the Opposition's position on the Bill. I am keen on more competition in many marketplaces. The history of my involvement in politics is interwoven with my advocating that competition is best for customers, and that, step by step, more markets should be opened up to more competitive pressures so that we can pass the benefits to customers. The Minister may recall that I campaigned for many years for gas and electricity competition against what were originally state monopolies and subsequently privatised companies with dominant positions. He may also recall that I piloted the detailed work on telecommunications liberalisation and was especially keen on allowing cable television companies to provide more competition in the telephone market.
<P>
I therefore need no lectures from the Government on the importance of competition. I am happy to work with them, in their zeal as converts to competition, where that makes sense and increases benefits for a wider range of customers. I hope that we will move amendments that identify where we think that competition can be strengthened. However, converts should be careful about their new-found zeal, and that applies to the Government. All good things must have some limitations and there must be an acceptable pace of change. My worry about the Bill, as someone who passionately wants more competition in the British marketplace and the wider world marketplace, is that it goes too far, too quickly, in unpredictable ways. It does not take into account the normal business arrangements or agreements that may, to the zealot, seem anti-competitive, but which help the conduct of the marketplace and widen customer choice and satisfaction.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 attempts to identify a limited series of practices that are normal in British business and are deemed to be legal and satisfactory by the current competition authorities and about which the Bill should give reassurance. It is not an exhaustive list--I am sure that Members of the Committee can think of practices that should be added to it--but it is offered to the Minister, if he is listening, in the spirit of helping the Government to reduce disagreement with the business community and of helping to concentrate the Government's attack on those anti-competitive practices that they most dislike. If the Minister says that the prime purpose of the Bill is to ensure a more competitive bus industry, for example, and to prevent unreasonable concentration in local and regional markets in that industry, I would welcome that; I would ask for an explanation of how it would work, but if I were satisified that those were the consequences, I would accept it. However, if the bill is not amended, the Minister risks opening up to court action or cessation a series of business practices that he might, on reflection, prefer to continue.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 would apply to companies that share a licensed technology in whose development and promotion they are involved. Such an arrangement should be deemed, at least for a period, as pro-competition, rather than anti-competition. A company that is involved in developing new technology and ideas will want to enjoy a period in which it has the right to earn the reward for its investment and better thinking before there is a free-for-all in the marketplace. That is accepted in patent law, but I am not sure that the Bill meshes sensibly with that. An exemption should be made in the clause. The Minister may, having taken official advice, propose better words than I have crafted. It is important to specify an exemption for companies that spend a great deal of money on developing new technology, which would not otherwise be available to future generations. Sensible management of the market is normal practice and might be required to allow companies to develop their ideas and to ensure that they are produced in the United Kingdom, rather than being taken up by others elsewhere, where regimes differ.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second suggestion in amendment No. 1, which would become new subsection 9(b), is to make it clear that clauses on price discrimination do not prevent the normal business practice of offering larger discounts for larger custom. It would be devastating for the Government if they could no longer enjoy bulk discounts on their purchases, on the grounds that to do so would unreasonably discriminate between categories of customer on the basis of size.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will say that he believes that such a protection is unnecessary and that the Bill, as drafted, will not jeopardise discounts to larger purchasers. If he does, that will be progress: our proceedings may help businesses when they judge what risks they run, and the Minister's words could, ultimately, be used as evidence in a court of law.
<P>
However, even if the Minister can offer that reassurance, it would cost him little to reinforce it--perhaps in words of his own choosing; again, I suspect that Government lawyers can better draft the amendment than I, as a non-lawyer can--because that would show business that the Bill does not constitute a threat to larger discount schemes, which are commonly used in business.
<P>
The third protection is in new subsection (9)(c). It is not clear in the Bill where a promotional discount ends and where predatory pricing begins. I am sure that the Minister and I would agree that predatory pricing is an evil. I trust that we would also agree that it is illegal under the current regime. The Minister may tell us that the Bill will make it even more difficult for businesses to get away with predatory pricing, and that it will be even easier to prosecute under the new legislation than under the old. I would be prepared to listen with an open mind to such a case.
<P>
If that is the Government's case, it is even more important that in the Bill and in the Minister's words, business is offered some reassurance that the common practice of promotional discounts is not under threat. That will require some crafting, to ensure that we can distinguish between a predatory price and a promotional discount--a powerful point that the shadow Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), has often made to me. He is worried lest the doctrine of the President of the Board of Trade on the relationship between cost and revenue in predatory pricing might ultimately state that a business that makes a loss is by definition, anti-competitive. A business in, for example, a competitive area of manufacturing, which is suffering from the strength of sterling and the level of interest rates that Government policy has created, might be plunged into loss because of too much competition in the market.
<P>
It would be extremely tough on such a business if it had to face an inquiry into whether its prices were too low and predatory when it was struggling to stay in the marketplace and to maintain jobs. I hope that the Minister will say something helpful about promotional discounts and on pricing under duress and stress when low prices and losses are clear evidence of an all-too-competitive marketplace--if there can be such a thing--rather than evidence of predatory pricing and unreasonable conduct.
<P>
My next proposal in new subsection (9)(d) applies to recommending selling prices that are not mandatory. This is topical because the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs appeared on television last night to hail, at last, the possible triumph that he foresees in lowering electrical goods prices in the shops. He promised us lower electrical goods prices for last Christmas, but unfortunately they did not arrive in the shops near me. I see from the look on the faces of my hon. Friends that they did not arrive in their shops either.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> What about the Trade Descriptions Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend asks about the Trade Descriptions Act, but I fear that it does not apply to Ministers. It would be good if it did because we do not seem to have received the price benefits on electrical goods that the Minister promised last summer.
<P>
However, we must look ahead. The Minister has now made his decision and has announced it on television, so it must be true. We therefore look forward to monitoring electrical goods prices carefully in the months ahead to see whether the competitive benefits that he is suggesting come true.
<P>
Despite the Minister taking that view on recommended selling prices for electrical goods, I hope that he will agree that recommended selling prices are not always a bad idea. Before destroying recommended selling prices in every industry, we should examine each industry to see whether such an abolition would have adverse consequences on customer interests or even on the state of the competitive marketplace by enabling a fairly dominant player to become more dominant as a result of the price conduct that was pursued.
<P>
I have a couple of examples that the Minister might like to mull over, one of which will be familiar to him because we referred to it in our wide-ranging debate on Tuesday. At present, it would be possible for the competition authorities to deem a recommended selling price for a newspaper. That is usually observed by every retailer to be an anti-competitive practice, but it would follow the Minister's own thinking about electrical goods. The nature of this Bill is that it is a sledgehammer to crack a series of--not very large--nuts in that it might involve the removal of recommended selling prices for newspapers.
<P>
Another example is the current practice of recommending selling prices for books. The net book agreement has gone--the previous Government thought that it went too far--but there is still some acceptance of the idea of printing the price of a book on the cover, and a number of retailers do that. It does not prevent price competition through book clubs, discounting in bookshops or other mass marketing techniques, but there is a recommended selling price on many book jackets and covers.
<P>
Does the Minister think that that is a good idea or is it another example of an anti-competitive practice that he would like to be removed by the Bill? I ask that in a genuine spirit of inquiry because the book trade--and book customers--would be interested to know. If the Minister thinks that he can do for book prices what he hopes to do for electrical goods prices, he may have a case that we would want to listen to carefully. If he has not considered that matter, I urge him to do so before rejecting the amendment, which is designed to cover just such a case.
<P>
I am not in favour of stopping the new competition authority investigating any of those practices, including recommended selling prices, industry by industry, as the current competition authorities often do.
<P>
We would support a case being made against recommended selling prices if they went too far, or gave a limited number of people too much power in the market, but each industry deserves its day, week or month in court. One must sift the good from the bad. One cannot do it with a piece of blockbuster legislation, because it may mean that no one can carry on with a practice, even if it has offsetting benefits or has previously been deemed to be in the public interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Do the right hon. Gentleman's comments embrace the abolition of the restrictive practices court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to explain his question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The right hon. Gentleman said that every industry should have its day in court. Does he advocate the abolition of the restrictive practices court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> As the Minister knows, the official Opposition do not want to change the current arrangements, because the forthcoming legislation is a mess and a muddle. We want legislation that will answer all those difficult questions. We would, of course, entertain new competition legislation if it dealt with real problems and if Ministers knew what the consequences would be.
<P>
	The Minister must know that our case against the Bill is that it is either unnecessary or premature. We could be persuaded that it was merely premature, but, at the moment, we are against it in principle. We want more competition and a smooth transition, so we are now forgetting our opposition and trying to consider the Bill clause by clause, to see how it can be improved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman then saying that restrictive practices should continue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am saying that the present system should continue. Perhaps the Minister is thinking about the possibility of a pharmacy case coming before the restrictive practices court. However, as my hon. Friends will bear out, there is a big difference between the sort of cases that presently come before the court and what would happen under the new competition authority.
<P>
	Under present arrangements, the rural pharmacies have a public interest defence, which goes wider than mere competition on price but, under the Bill, the pharmacies will lose an important element of that public interest defence. Therefore, without the Lords amendments--perhaps even with them--the Bill will be an attack on those pharmacies.
<P>
	My answer, to keep the existing system, in no way prejudges the court's decision on pharmacies, but the Minister should remember that when the court last investigated the matter it found resale price maintenance in pharmacies to be in the public interest. The Conservative Government were happy with that decision; we decided that it was a reasonable outcome. If the law is unchanged, it is possible that, in a future case--no case is currently being brought--the court could come to the same conclusion. The rural pharmacies would have their chance and would have a wider defence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My right hon. Friend said that he welcomed the earlier decision of the restrictive practices court, which enabled retail price maintenance in pharmacies to continue. At one time, the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs presumably welcomed that decision himself. When he was in Opposition, he was a keen enthusiast of RPM. Now that he is in Government, he appears to have betrayed those previous commitments. That is a rather extraordinary state of affairs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I do not want to be hard on the Under-Secretary, because he has not confirmed that that was in his mind. Perhaps I was too suspicious in thinking that that was the purpose of his intervention.
<P>
My hon. Friend, in his usual perceptive way, is absolutely right that the Minister, when in opposition, let it be known that he was warm-heartedly in favour of the current practice in rural pharmacies. The Secretary of State for Health, too, held that view when in opposition. For all I know, he still holds it. As he has primary responsibility for health care, he would be wise to hold to that view, because rural pharmacies do more than sell medicines. They provide advice, and give some welfare back up to the local community. That is why rural pharmacies are valued, but, by going ahead with the Bill, the Government seem determined to preside over the closure of many hundreds of them.
<P>
Under paragraph (e) of amendment No. 1, clause 2(2) would not prohibit agreements which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``represent partnerships to take on projects which are too large for individual companies''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The idea behind that is to recognise that, in some industries such as the construction and private finance project industries, it is most important for a group of companies to come together to bid and see through a project. The competitive work takes place at the bidding stage. In some large project cases, there might be only one British bidding consortium. All the important British skills in that area may have been put together and the consortium may have to fight like mad against European or global competition to get the contract.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Having been through that process and won the contract fair and square in the marketplace, I am worried that companies could find that their partnership agreements fell foul of the Bill. Without bearing in mind the wider context, it could be argued that, having major United Kingdom competitors lined up in a single bid and their being the agents carrying out that bid, was anti-competitive in a narrow sense. That would be a gross injustice. It would have been pro-competitive to have won the competition.
<P>
It would be helpful to people undertaking partnership ventures of the kind that the Government are keen to encourage to hear some words of reassurance from the Minister that there would be no intention to capture such partnership agreements between erstwhile competitors seeking to carry out major projects. However, I should prefer to have such a reassurance set out in the Bill, which is the purpose of subsection (9)(e) of amendment No. 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I draw my right hon. Friend's attention to one of the most peculiar elements of the absence of a parallel in the Bill to proposed subsection (9)(e). It could be argued in court--some lawyers believe that it might be--that the entire private finance initiative that the Government have adopted so enthusiastically would constitute a set of practices that were anti-competitive. Does he agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Yes, indeed. One could construe it that way. I should be interested to hear the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend's good point. The Government certainly thought it necessary to exempt conduct and monetary policy from the Bill. Do they seriously think that someone might bring a case against the wise men and women of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee for running a single monetary policy in a unitary kingdom? I trust that it will remain a unitary kingdom, but we shall await events in the Labour party's policy. Surely we need reassurance on something more likely than that, which is someone bringing an action against a group of companies that have formed a consortium for an individual purpose and are in business, as my hon. Friend suggests, in some senses with the Government.
<P>
The Government may be the customer or they may be a party to the agreement in another way. They may be offering reassurances about the future streams of revenue, for example. The competition authorities might consider that to be thoroughly unreasonable, because it is not usual to have guaranteed sources of revenue based on a hypothetical variable rather than a real flow of revenue to a project. The Minister should take seriously our worries about the impact that such a policy could have on private finance initiative projects as one group of projects in the category of large projects requiring the concerting of activity.
<P>
My hon. Friend leads me into a related thought. The Government are a great advocate of partnerships in general. Many of the partnerships that they are promoting and recommending through their current and proposed regional bodies and training and enterprise councils would get into difficulties under the Bill, unless that point were clearly safeguarded or clarified. If we need to safeguard monetary policy, I am sure that we need to safeguard such an arrangement.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will my right hon. Friend pursue that argument one stage further? I draw his attention to the words ``or effect'' in clause 2(1)(b). Does he agree that there would be a presumption that all local partnerships would be caught by that? Even if the intention is far from trying to distort competition, the effect in all local cases would necessarily be to distort competition by introducing a dominant operator into a sector that would otherwise be unoccupied by such an operator.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is self-evidently true.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The plot thickens, and I would like to add another element to it. In the spirit of my right hon. Friend's earlier remarks, does he agree that one of the biggest dangers created by the Bill, in the context of what might broadly be called a partnership or consortium activity of business undertakings within the United Kingdom, is that a bidder from outwith the United Kingdom who is disappointed in a bid for, say, a United Kingdom public works contract might resort to trying to blow the thing apart in the British courts on the grounds that the consortium activity was collusive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Just such a case might go before the competition authority and become a celebrated case. We will later draw attention to the fact that many different parties will be able to intervene and make complaints and that the competition authority will be able to follow those complaints. My hon. Friend's example is a good one; a disappointed foreign bidder might allege that the three major British companies in a sector had ganged together to win a contract and that that was anti-competitive. I would see that as good news, involving vigorous global competition for a very large project, but--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the right hon. Gentleman, but he is anticipating a later group of amendments. I ask hon. Members to stick to the amendments under consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am happy to do so, Mr. Atkinson. I emphasis my fear that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, a disappointed foreign consortium could allege that it was anti-competitive, under the Bill, for the principal British competitors to gang up to win the business. We need comforting words from the Minister about the definition of the marketplace; it often comes down to a judgment of whether the market is local, regional, national, European or global. In the case of a European or global market, it is important to have a safeguard such as my proposed new subsection (9)(e). Our brief exchanges have demonstrated that that represents a real point of concern to those who have studied the unamended clause, or will study it in due course, who realise that it may jeopardise reasonable arrangements.
<P>
My final proposal in amendment No. 1 is new subsection (9)(f), which permits the encouragement of new markets and technologies through joint action. That is a development of new subsection (9)(a), which deals with a more specific case of a similar problem. I hope that the Minister will accept that customer choice and ultimately, price competiton is furthered by businesses making creative leaps and by investing in research and development and in the future. The speeches of Ministers in the present, and indeed previous Government, are peppered with lectures and exhortations to businesses that that is what they should be doing to keep British business at the forefront of global business and to ensure that we can pay ourselves salaries that guarantee us a decent life style. Nothing in the bill, however, gives complete reassurance that there are times when what seem like anti-competitve agreements are necessary to develop a new market for a new technology.
<P>
I shall give the Minister an example of a decision that I had to take when I was a Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, dealing with competition. I was faced with a problem that caused me to think long and hard. I had to decide whether we should continue with two satellite television services, when the evidence suggested, and it was therefore argued, that they would destroy each other and we would ultimately have none. For the sake of competition in the wider television market, was it better to allow those two competitors to merge and to form a strong presence in satellite television, which would in turn apply pressure for improvements in traditional terrestrial services?
<P>
The Under-Secretary will know that despite--or because of--my great belief in competition, I concluded that the two companies should merge, and advised the Secretary of State accordingly. They did so, and subsequently, as a single company, became an extremely vigorous competitor that offered more choice and variety, as well as sports sponsorship. That was a direct result of allowing them to merge and be pro-competitive.
<P>
In our fast-moving technological world, the Under-Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade will often have to make such difficult decisions. The Bill should not pre-empt them. It should leave open the opportunity to allow what would be an anti-competitive practice in a mature market to exist for a period in a developing or growing market, in order that new competition and choice are made available.
<P>
A further example is our decision to allow cable companies a limited period of freedom from certain types of competition so that they could invest massive sums and build up a critical mass before unleashing on them the full force of competition from the former dominant player--indeed, the former monopolist--in the market. The Government and the Opposition have had a few arguments about the exact timing of the changes to revert to full competition, but I suspect that in his more honest moments, the Under-Secretary would agree that much is to be said for the early decision to allow cable companies to invest and develop. Again, we want to protect such decisions through the proposed amendment.
<P>
I am sorry that I have had to go on at some length, but I hope that you, Mr. Atkinson, can see that the amendment contains real meat--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Beef.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> --real beef, even on the bone, although perhaps Ministers would not approve of that.
<P>
We want to offer the Government a way of limiting the enormously wide-ranging powers that they hope to take under clause 2 and of reducing the burden of sifting out agreements to allow arrangements and practices that Labour Members would consider perfectly reasonable to continue. My only apology to the Committee is for not having thought of all the general cases that I should have included. I am open to suggestions about what paragraphs (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of proposed new subsection (9) should include. I fear that many more such examples exist. I hope that the Committee will see that we have thought through at least six sets of cases in which we believe powers should be limited.
<P>
I am disappointed that the Minister of State is not present, given his discourteous remark to me on Tuesday that I would rather go to the cricket than be here to pursue the debate today. I hope that the Committee will see that his prediction was entirely wrong. It is strange that the Minister is not here, and that he has decided to launch a different policy about a different subject on the same day that this important debate proceeds in Committee. It means that I may have to nip away to answer some of his points on that other policy before the Committee adjourns, but I leave matters in my hon. Friends' capable hands. I hope that, in future, DTI announcements will be made on Mondays or Wednesdays, rather than on Tuesdays or Thursdays, so that we may have the benefit of the Minister's attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I speak in favour of the amendments, especially amendment No. 1, which my right hon. Friend for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) has so learnedly and lengthily discussed. However, I do so to describe how amendment No. 1 would affect cost, to which I referred in an earlier debate. Since then, the Department has been kind enough to fulfil the Minister's promise of distributing to all members of the Committee the so-called compliance cost assessment and the so-called regulatory proposals.
<P>
One of the main purposes of amendment No. 1 is to reduce the burden on British business of non-recurring costs, which as the compliance cost assessment that has now been provided shows, are so inadequately understood. I share the self-denigrating tendency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham, at the end of his speech because I fear that we may have failed to propose an amendment that is sufficiently wide to catch all those who could be spared the great costs that are entailed. Nevertheless, the proposed subsection (9)(a) to (f) would have a major impact on non-recurring costs.
<P>
I hope that we have captured the major items that would otherwise give rise to costs, which we estimate on a back-of-the-envelope basis to be between a factor 100 or 300 wrong--I hope that the Minister will ask his officials to come up with a better or more formal view. It is probably one of the most egregious cases of error in a compliance cost assessment that we have yet received.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The issue takes us into the detail of clause 2(1)(b). Before discussing the precise wording of the clause, I draw the Committee's attention to paragraph 15 of the compliance cost assessment. One of the more remarkable elements in a remarkable document is in the section dealing with non-recurring costs under the chapter headed ``Prohibition of anti-competitive agreements'', which is a majesterial three paragraphs long with no supporting annexes or calculations. That is a tendency that I find in a large number of so-called compliance cost assessments. The standards were never high under the previous regime, but they have slipped abysmally.
<P>
Paragraph 15 explains why the estimate of the non-recurring costs for the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements provided in the financial memorandum of the Bill is &#163;2.6 million to &#163;2.4 million. The paragraph states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There may also arise compliance costs in relation to agreements which are not registrable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 13 helpfully explains that all the agreements that are registrable under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 and have been granted a section 21(2) direction are exempt. I take that to be one of the main burdens of the line of argument pursued in the compliance cost assessment. It argues that those have been exempted so we are left with compliance costs in relation to agreements that are not registrable. Paragraph 15 continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``One set of such agreements may be those which would infringe the prohibition but satisfy the criteria for an individual exemption. There may also be some agreements which are not registrable under the RTPA and do not infringe the prohibition''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept that I am trying to give an accurate and honest account of the logic of the line of argument pursued in the compliance cost assessment, but I shall more than welcome an intervention if I am making a mistake. I understand that a section 21(2) direction under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act is exempt automatically following the amendment to schedule 3. Consequently, we are left with only two minor categories of agreement, one of which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would infringe the prohibition but satisfy the criteria for an individual exemption.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The other does
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not infringe the prohibition, but . . . it would be reasonable to notify the DGFT on a fail-safe basis.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are minor categories because the bulk of agreements that can be caught by the Bill will have already been caught by the RTPA, will have been registered and, if they are not being pursued in the restrictive trade practices court, will have benefited from a section 21(2) direction.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the way in which a section 21(2) direction works. Section 21 of the 1976 Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If it appears to the Secretary of State, upon the director's representation, that the restrictions accepted or information provisions made under an agreement . . . are not of such significance as to call for investigation by the Court, the Secretary of State may give directions discharging the Director from taking proceedings''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They are exempted agreements because they were forced by the RTPA to be registered. Someone has considered them, decided that they are not significant in terms of the RTPA and directed that they should not be pursued in court. The line of argument in the compliance cost assessment is that we do not need an amendment such as amendment No. 1 because there are few agreements left that could conceivably be pursued or that would worry lawyers or companies.
<P>
That line of argument derives from a wholly different reading of the import of clause 2(1)(b) from that which we or lawyers acting on a non-political basis have found. It relies on a wholly different reading of the difference between the new provisions of clause 2(1)(b) and those of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act. Section 6 of the RTPA states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This Act applies to agreements (whenever made) between two or more persons carrying on business within the United Kingdom in the production or supply of goods, or in the application to goods of any process of manufacture . . . in respect of any of the following matters''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A list numbered (a) to (f) follows. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham has also produced a list from (a) to (f). The list in the RTPA includes matters such as prices charged and recommended, terms and conditions, quantities and descriptions of goods and process of manufacture. The relevant provisions that would have given rise to the section 21(2) direction is one that deals directly, in specifically drafted legislation, with the constraint of activity at the retail end of the market. That is how the RTPA has been conceived and drafted. To be fair and generous to a Labour Government, the Act was well and conscientiously drafted.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> We thought so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I took the trouble to read Hansard to see what Conservative Members said about it at the time. We said, rightly, that it was legislation that was particularly apt for the task of constraining certain actions at the retail end of the market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Drawing on his recent business experience before coming to the House of Commons, does my hon. Friend think that directors of companies with complicated arrangements, contracts and agreements--whether registered or not--would, as a fiduciary duty, have to put all those matters to lawyers to see whether they might fall foul of the legislation? Is not that the point about the cost?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member for West Dorset responds, I must tell him that I am having difficulty in understanding how his remarks are relevant to the amendment. I should be grateful for an explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I fear that my speech is a long chain of logic, but I assure you, Mr. Atkinson, that it is focused on the amendment. The structure of my argument is that the amendment removes a vast array of agreements that would otherwise be caught by the Bill and that will entail a vast non-recurring cost of legal investigation.
<P>
In order to establish that argument, I have to go through the stages. First, I must show that they would be exempt--that is clear from amendment No. 1. Secondly, I must show that the agreements would otherwise be caught--which I am now trying to do. A large pile of agreements, which would not have been caught under the 1976 Act, will be caught under the Bill, which will therefore entail a non-recurring cost. Finally, I must show that those non-recurring costs will be large. If I do that, I will have shown that, unamended, the Bill will have a large effect on the costs of British business. I am focusing directly on the amendment, Mr. Atkinson; I merely follow its chain of logic.
<P>
I am doubly grateful for my right hon. Friend's intervention. First, I apologise unreservedly to the Committee; I realised only when preparing for our debate that I was guilty--I was, alas, guilty also on Second Reading--entirely unwittingly of failing to disclose what I never imagined could be thought of as a relevant interest. I am a director of a bank. It did not occur to me that a director of a bank could have any interest in a Bill that seemed to be entirely concerned with industrial activities that restricted trade or competition. It has come to my attention that it could have vast implications for the banking sector. I therefore declare that interest, and I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for reminding me of that.
<P>
Secondly, my right hon. Friend is absolutely right that the point at issue--it is the next leg of my argument--is that clause 2, which would be changed by amendment No. 1, is wholly different in scope from the narrow definitions of section 6 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act. Clause 2(1)(b) refers specifically to any agreement that has as its object or effect
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That provision is on a far wider plane, as it affects consumers at the retail end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's argument with a degree of admiration. It is important to tease out the difficulties. My hon. Friend will, I am sure, have seen the Financial Times report entitled ``Business Law Europe''. The section headed ``Bad law makes hard cases'' states that under the present Director General of Fair Trading there is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no threat of intrusive regulatory interference.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``legislation should not be drawn up with the present incumbent's good sense in mind.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>It concludes that legislation should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``capable of accommodating a pedant without bringing the UK economy to a halt.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is worrying.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Without wishing to be a pedant, I have some difficulty in understanding what that intervention had to do with the amendment. If the hon. Gentleman could explain, I should be grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I fear that that intervention referred not to you, Mr. Atkinson, nor to the other members of the Committee, but to me. I am acting as a pedant, but one with a purpose. I fear that we shall have a vast array--this is the connection with the amendment--of pedantic lawyers on both sides of the many cases that will be brought if the amendment is rejected, who will pedantically argue whether, as a matter of fact, agreements not caught by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act and not registered are nevertheless caught under clause 2.
<P>
We have tried to analyse what would happen in the absence of amendment No. 1--if our interpretation of the possible scope of clause 2(1)(b) proved to be well founded--to the cost of British business when compared to the projections published in the so-called compliance cost assessment. Necessarily, our calculations are rudimentary and cannot compare with what the awesome array of experts, economists and lawyers that the Department can call on would produce if they put their minds to it. Alas, the three brief paragraphs of the compliance cost assessment have not employed that vast array of talent.
<P>
Our simple back-of-the-envelope calculations are vastly preferable to no calculations at all. I put them forward entirely tentatively but constructively, hoping that the Minister will come back with a proper assessment, which we can investigate in detail. Taking British business as a whole, there are about 4 million businesses, about 3 million of which are outside the scope of clause 2(1)(b), and hence amendment No. 1, because they are tiny, mostly comprising the self-employed, and are unlikely to have made agreements. Who can say how many of the other 1 million businesses might be caught by the clause? However, we can approximate in a not unreasonable way.
<P>
The companies in the FTSE 100 index consist of oil majors, airlines and major car and drug companies. Each company has an agreement of the kind specified in amendment No. 1. In some cases, the companies have hundreds of agreements. Almost all the business of oil majors is represented by such agreements, some of which will have been registered. I should be interested to hear from the Minister, who is better placed than I am, how many agreements have been registered by the FTSE 100 companies, particularly those for which co-operative joint ventures are a regular pattern of business.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have talked only to one oil major about the matter and, in that instance, 221 agreements would be covered by amendment No. 1--none of which had been registered--with the total volume broadly estimated by the relevant general council at 24,000 pages of agreement. He omitted all those agreements that were subject to registration under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act. I do not know how that multiplies across the FTSE 100 companies, but we are talking about a need for those companies to review documents using highly expert legal advisers whose charges, I fear--in deference to those members of the Committee who are lawyers--are very high. I do not know whether the Minister will deny that. It will not be cheap to use City firms to investigate thousands of pages of complex agreements to see whether they are caught by clause 2(1)(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman studied paragraph 2 of schedule 3?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes. Will the Minister say what that provision will do in respect of agreements that are not registered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It makes it clear that existing agreements cleared under section 21(2) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act do not need to be looked at again. I hope that that is helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In that case, the Minister must not have been listening to my earlier remarks. I apologise if they were too boring to retain his attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> You said it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise, but the Minister is not aware that we are dealing with a matter that will cost British industry hundreds of millions of pounds. It is worth his paying attention to my remarks, however boring they are.
<P>
Section 21(2) directions, to which I referred at length, are covered by paragraph 2 of schedule 3. If an agreement has not been registered, ipso facto it could not have been subject to such a direction because, under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, such directions can be given only in relation to agreements that have been registered. The Minister needs to challenge a different part of my logic. He must show that I am wrong to assert that an array of complex arrangements are caught by clause 2(1)(b) and not covered sufficiently by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act to have been registered. In the absence of further elucidation, I find it highly implausible that there is no such array despite the fact that no such array is signalled in the compliance cost assessment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> I was surprised at the Minister's intervention. Does my hon. Friend agree that there are sufficient provisions in paragraph 2 of schedule 3, whereby the director general can revisit agreements registered under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 and, in doing so, the director general is likely to have regard not to the existing provisions of that Act, but to the prospective provisions of the new Competition Act, as it will become? The latter Act, which my hon. Friend has made clear is much wider in its scope, particularly if it were not to include amendment No. 1, might lead to a large number of revisited agreements under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson, but this point of detail is material. My hon. Friend may be right. I say ``may'' because I spent some considerable time pondering the issue. We are dealing with schedule 3, so it would be out of order to deal with it directly, but there is no doubt that the drafting of paragraph 2, in particular the articulation of sub-paragraphs (1) and (3), is wholly unclear, at least to the layman. It is not clear whether the fact of a direction having been issued, and having still been in force
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``immediately before the coming into force of section 2'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would or would not of itself constitute a continuing exemption from the legislation. One would have to look at sub-paragraph 3 to understand that, and that is not clear.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall not strain your patience, Mr. Atkinson, because we shall reach this subject in due course, but if the director general believes that an agreement would be prohibited where it is not excluded, paragraph 7 brings one straight back to the position whereby the agreements may be revisited.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I fear that my hon. Friend, with his customary acuity, which exceeds my own, may be right. If he is, the figures that I am vainly striving to expose, notwithstanding the Minister's interventions, are wholly understated. We would then have to consider anew all the relevant registered agreements.
<P>
However, in the spirit of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham, who was castigated by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham as wet, I shall take the moderate position that has characterised our remarks in Committee today. I shall eliminate for a moment consideration of the effect of schedule 3, to which the Minister, when he woke from his slumbers, briefly animadverted, and concentrate entirely, therefore, on the simple-minded view that the Department is right to claim that the section 21(2) direction exemption will effectively remove from consideration all those agreements that are registered. We are nevertheless left with all those that are not registered and might be caught by clause 2(1)(b).
<P>
On a simple analysis, one might guess that we are talking about 100 firms that would have legal costs of, at a modest estimate, perhaps &#163;200,000 a piece, and, at an upper estimate, perhaps &#163;1 million a piece. Therefore, we are talking of between &#163;20 million and &#163;100 million of non-recurring costs simply to investigate that, the great bulk of which might be avoided by amendment No. 1, because almost all the agreements will probably be caught, if we have not omitted some great feature of the industrial world that did not occur to us in amendment No. 1, in which case we would be delighted to see amendment No. 1 reamended by a Government new clause, or by whatever other method.
<P>
However, I fear that the 100 large firms are only a tiny beginning of the story. There must be about 10 per cent. of the million businesses that are not in the tiny 3 million category that will have a complex of agreements that are, or could arguably be caught, by a clause about effects, and which certainly will not have been registered under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act--for example, agreements of minor joint venture--any of which could be caught by the provisions of clause 2(1)(b), and would be exempted from being caught by amendment No. 1.
<P>
If we imagine the 10 per cent. in question--that is 100,000 businesses--and a modest legal fee of, say, &#163;2,000 to investigate all the agreements or, at most &#163;10,000--for four hours' work of a serious lawyer--we have an estimate of between &#163;200 million and &#163;1,000 million for the non-recurring costs for that section.
<P>
Then there is a tranche of businesses, I know not how big, between the small firms and the large--perhaps 1,000, perhaps 10,000, it is difficult to know--whose costs would be between those two figures but probably more like those of the small firms. They would still be considerable--perhaps between &#163;20,000 and &#163;100,000.
<P>
I stress that, not as a debating point, but in a serious effort to get the Minister and his Department to do the work that the compliance cost assessment should have done seriously, and to expose it before the Committee. I hope that he will present figures that show that I am wrong or that my suggestions are implausible. If they are not, my figures show non-recurring costs of between &#163;250 million and &#163;1.2 billion, compared to a compliance cost assessment that suggests that those figures are &#163;2.6 million to &#163;4.4 million--a remarkable discrepancy.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 would remove if not the whole, at least the great bulk of that necessity. If my logic is correct--I am entirely willing to be corrected by the Under-Secretary--amendment No. 1 is not a minor matter. Nor is it important only for the reasons that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham so lucidly exposed about the future. It is important because the clause will immediately clobber British manufacturing industry--at a time when it is not in the best state--with several hundred million, perhaps more than a billion, pounds' worth of costs.
<P>
It would be wrong if the Committee were to reject amendment No. 1 without knowing whether my fears are well founded. Alas, the Under-Secretary has provided no clue: no appendix shows whether my calculations are ill founded. In the spirit of moderation, I have not referred to recurring costs, which we think are also estimated incorrectly. We are discussing hundreds of millions of pounds, about which either I or the Under-Secretary is in error. It would be improper for the Committee to reject amendment No. 1 without knowing which one of us it is. The safe course would be for the Under-Secretary either to agree to present an amendment that reflects amendment No. 1 at a later stage, if my suspicions prove well founded, or to accept the amendment at this stage and merely revise it later if he can show that my assertions are false.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): In the spirit of compromise and in the context of his last observation about whether his or the Under-Secretary's figures are correct, would my hon. Friend agree that the figure might fall somewhere between the two? However, even if it did, if it was in the direction of the figures that my hon. Friend quoted, the force of his arguments would remain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is usually right about everything. I entirely agree that the figure could fall between mine and the Under-Secretary's, but the gap between them is rather large. I agree that such a figure could remain a cause for concern.
<P>
One of the most important firms of solicitors in the United Kingdom, Lovell White Durrant, made a submission to the Department, in which it expressed a view about how much such work there might be. That submission said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The DTI appears to suggest that under 200 firms will require advice on the impact of this legislation. We would estimate that over 200 of our own clients will require advice''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In this case, therefore, the factor of difference is equivalent to the number of large legal firms in the United Kingdom. By that method, I, too, arrived at figures that were between 20 and 100 times larger than the Department's estimates. Although I entirely accept the right hon. Gentleman's point that it would be foolish for us to insist on figures that are back-of-the-envelope calculations, the presumption must be that we have, if anything, understated the scale of the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I have just studied the Hansard report of our previous sitting. At column 39, 17 ayes and six noes are recorded for the Division. Those figures are correct. However, at column 40, although 17 names are indeed recorded as having voted aye, only five names are recorded as having voted no. The missing one is mine. As the Conservative Whip, I should like to maintain a pristine voting record, so I seek your good offices to secure a correction.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right; a correction will be made.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham dealt comprehensively with the several further general exemptions from the chapter I prohibition proposed in amendment No. 1, but it would be useful to examine the extent to which the amendment could meet some of the difficulties of community pharmacies.
<P>
On Second Reading, many of my hon. Friends referred to rural pharmacies. I have the honour and privilege of representing a substantially rural constituency, but I freely acknowledge that the difficulties are faced not only by rural areas but by community pharmacies. Amendment No. 1 lists a number of agreements that might have a direct bearing on the predicament of community pharmacies.
<P>
In a later debate, we shall discuss the transition arrangements, and the extent to which cases before the restrictive practices court might be stayed, pending the transition to a general prohibition. None the less, it may be useful to examine whether cases of the sort instanced by my right hon. Friend, which would give rise to a general exemption, might also be of benefit to community pharmacies. I suspect that we shall find that the benefit is not complete.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I wish to make a brief statement in support of rural pharmacies. The hon. Gentleman is leading on to the fact that community pharmacies in urban areas are also important, because people there--the old and the unwell--can be just as dependent on the nearby pharmacy as people in rural areas.
<P>
May I take this opportunity, Mr. Atkinson, to say that I am a director of a manufacturing company?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interests should not be declared during an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I stand corrected.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> While I am on my feet, I can tell the Committee that the question of rural chemists will be dealt with later. We should not debate it now; we should debate only amendment No. 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall certainly adhere to your direction, Mr. Atkinson. I look forward to our debate on community pharmacies, because the agreement--the subject of the reference to the restrictive practices court and how the Bill might interact with it--is important. I shall therefore constrain myself.
<P>
I shall refer instead to some of the exemptions presaged in amendment No. 1 that would give some benefit to pharmacies. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham made clear, although the Restrictive Trade Practices Act has a general public interest criterion, the Bill is moving directly to a competition criterion. As a general proposition, I thoroughly agree with the contention that competition is in the public interest.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that we have a two-stage approach to tackling the problem of rural pharmacies? We need the law to say that recommended selling prices are permissible, which the amendment would acheive; subsequently, we shall need to make special provision for those recommended prices being mandatory in pharmacies. That is why, with your permission, Mr. Atkinson, we need to refer now to the plight of pharmacies, because it is partly covered by proposed subsection (9)(d). However, you are right to say that the other part of the package will be dealt with at a later stage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must make it clear that I have no objection to hon. Members mentioning rural pharmacies in connection with amendment No. 1. I was advising the Committee that I did not want hon. Members to embark on a wide-ranging debate on rural pharmacies.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I seek your guidance as to whether it is appropriate to mention it, but I have a press release dated Thursday 21 May 1998 which clearly states that the Opposition intend to raise the plight of small pharmacies in today's Committee proceedings. Does not that clearly ignore your ruling?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not a point of order for the Chair. I shall ensure that members of the Committee remain in order during the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> It is my intention, Mr. Atkinson, to remain entirely in order. I look forward to debating the substance of the matter at a future sitting, when we shall be able to speak about community pharmacies generally.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham was correct in his intervention; indeed, he anticipated what I was about to say. The general exemptions, as applied to the pharmaceutical industry, show that some of the public interest benefits to be obtained from the agreements mentioned in amendment No. 1 are incontrovertible. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset made clear, they will give us the opportunity to reduce the uncertainty that, in other circumstances, would result from a general prohibition, to which the exemptions are as yet relatively unspecific.
<P>
That brings me back to the fact that the Government have not yet delivered on their promise to make clear the extent of exemptions from chapter I prohibitions. The amendment goes directly to that point and helps us to decide how such agreements might be exempted. For example, proposed subsection (9)(a) speaks of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``licensed technology protected by patent''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Insofar as they are the sellers of licensed pharmaceutical products under patent, pharmacies will be substantial beneficiaries of such an exemption. It would be a retrograde step to take a prohibition approach if there are no equivalent exemptions. That would bite directly into the ability of pharmacies and other industries to provide that sort of licensed technology.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend made clear, recommended selling prices are often a gain to the consumer. That and the discounting of larger purchases is a protection not only for smaller pharmacies but for some of the larger chains; the vertical relationships between suppliers and retailers can deliver benefits to the consumer. Recommended retail prices should not be presumed to be beneficial to the consumer; indeed, they may be anti-competitive. However, particular benefits may be associated with community pharmacies, which will need special treatment. We shall discuss that at a later stage.
<P>
The general proposition, which may go a considerable way to helping pharmacies and other related industries, is that communities may benefit if the manufacturers can enable pharmacies to operate in an unregulated or ill-advised selling environment. Because pharmacies act not only as retailers but as service providers, we want manufacturers to create a selling environment that will maintain the level of service offered by such businesses. We shall discuss that aspect later.
<P>
We can achieve something of that task. We can reduce the extent and impact of a general prohibition, and the uncertainty that it would cause, by the application of particular cases. We shall go further, in due course, and look at particular industries. However, achieving positive agreements to deal with licensed technology and recommended selling prices will certainly be of benefit to community pharmacies and other industries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> On behalf of the Government, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I hope that our proceedings will be brief and effective.
<P>
	Before turning to the detail of the amendment, it might be for the benefit of the Committee if I make clear how the Bill is designed to operate. We can then set amendments Nos. 55 and 1 against that background and understand why the Government reject them.
<P>
	The Bill is certainly not designed to set out an exhaustive list covering every conceivable business agreement or practice and prescribing, in some mechanistic way, whether the agreement or practice in question will be caught by the prohibition. That would not be possible, nor would it make any sense. Instead, the Bill will set up a framework for dealing with anti-competitive agreements and practices. Whether or not an agreement or practice is caught is dependent on its economic effects. That is in stark contrast with existing law under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which looks to the form of the agreement to decide whether it is caught. The new approach of looking to the effects of an agreement is widely accepted as being far more practical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I ask this question purely to ensure that there is a statement by the Under-Secretary on the record, which I believe to be of the utmost importance. He says that the Bill relates only to ``effect'', but subsection (1)(b) clearly refers to agreements that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``have as their object or effect''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that catches agreements that have a certain motivation, regardless of their effect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The Bill certainly covers agreements that have as their object anti-competitive behaviour. Of course, the reason for including both the object and the effect--the effect is the addition--is that it can be very difficult to prove that someone has anti-competitive behaviour as his object because, for example, the paperwork might not be available because the agreement had been made verbally. That is what has made current law the subject of valid criticism from business. The two go together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way again?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I will deal with this matter in detail later. If I am able to make some progress, we shall see whether I can satisfy the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
	As has been stressed by all who have spoken this morning, harmless agreements are not covered. The draft advice and information that the director general has now made available expresses the view that agreements will have no appreciable effect on competition if the parties' market share does not exceed 10 per cent. The director general is giving clear guidance on what will or will not be likely to be viewed as appreciably anti-competitive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I recognise that the Bill attempts to establish a framework and that the Under-Secretary cannot be expected to pronounce on every case. However, it would be useful if the Committee was told broadly where the hon. Gentleman stands. Does he believe that the agreement between manufacturers and pharmacists is, in essence, benign or objectionable? Which?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> the hon. Gentleman asks a good question. It is one that I am now putting to the right hon. Member for Wokingham. Of course, as a Minister I cannot comment on specific agreements and whether they are objectionable, but the right hon. Gentleman does not have that restraint. So far, he has failed to tell the Committee--I give him the opportunity now--whether he believes that they are benign or objectionable. Perhaps he could also tell us whether he still believes and advocates a pill tax to fund medicine and whether that would be good for pharmacists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I thought that the Under-Secretary was making a serious point, until he went off on his little tirade. I have been clear in this Committee. Although it is not the Opposition's duty to lay down a policy on every issue, I said that we were quite happy with the judgment of the court, which said that such agreements were not against the public interest. It is now incumbent on the Under-Secretary to tell us whether he shares that happiness or whether he wants the Bill to abolish the arrangement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I will be clear and direct The court clearly took the right decision when it last considered the matter. We must see what decision it takes this time. Obviously, if factors have not changed the court will come to the same balanced view on the matter. Does the right hon. Gentleman think that resale price maintenance for over-the-counter medicines should continue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I have said that I am happy with the current system. If the Government and the authorities take a case to court, it would be useful for rural pharmacies to have the current defences under existing law, which would give them some chance. Our issue with the Under-Secretary is that he wishes to change the law in a way that prejudges the case and takes away one of the principal defences that was accepted last time. It is incumbent on the hon. Gentleman to answer the question. He could dispense with the need for any court case. He could say to the industry, ``I am solving the issue through the Bill.'' He should tell us today, yes or no, whether he wants to exempt the arrangement or clobber it.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> There is no doubt the court will look at the public interest, as it did previously. It is in the gift of the right hon. Gentleman to settle the issue. Will he persuade the vice-chairman of the Conservative party, who was responsible for referring the matter to the OFT, and also to the European Commission--a somewhat pernicious act--to withdraw the referral?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> No. I said that I want the industry to have the same defence available today that succeeded last time the matter went before the court. It is the Under-Secretary who wants to take away that defence. He wants to prejudge the case. I ask him to tell us what the Government intend to do. Will they get rid of the practice quickly or over a long period? Or will the hon. Gentleman do, at the last minute, what many of his hon. Friends want him to do, namely, table an amendment to settle the problem once and for all--against the background of his proposal to abolish the pre-existing system that was given a clean bill of health?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> My position and that of the Government was made clear on Second Reading. I urge the right hon. Gentleman to read the Hansard report.
<P>
The amendments are unacceptable and, indeed, would be unworkable. We appreciate, as does business--although it has not penetrated the Opposition--that under the effects-based approach harmless agreements would not be caught. As I have already pointed out, more than 10,000 agreements have had to be registered with the OFT. Such registrations represent wholly unnecessary work for the authorities and for business. It is the result of form-based approach, which the right hon. Gentleman seems to be advocating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I want to make some progress. The hon. Gentleman took up a considerable amount of time earlier. I did not find him boring; I listened to him with care.
<P>
United Kingdom firms that are currently subject to competition law have first to assess their agreements under EC competition law. Many of them have done so for 25 years, especially the larger firms alluded to by Opposition Members.
<P>
The director general or the utility regulator--not Ministers--will decide whether a particular agreement or practice has appreciable anti-competitive effects. He will act in accordance with established EC jurisprudence and his decision will be subject to appeal to the independent Competition Commission. The proposed system will recognise that agreements that have appreciably retrictive effects on competion may have beneficial effects overall--to take in the point raised by the right hon. Member for Wokingham. That is why there are provisions for exemptions to be granted, which we will discuss on later clauses.
<P>
I shall now deal with the detail of the amendments and what I believe would be their detrimental effect. Under an effects-based prohibition system, it is not possible to prescribe exhaustively in advance what types of agreements will be caught. It is not what other authorities in the European Union, which have been operating this system for more than 25 years, have found necessary; nor should we. Only mad Europhobia suggests that the EU system is unworkable when it has worked very well for a long time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> One of the points we wish to stress is that it is not simply a matter of bringing EU practice into effect in Britain. That practice already directly affects Britain, and we make no complaint about that. However, the Government are trying to adapt and apply a European jurisdiction dealing with cross-border trade issues to a national market, and do so through British language and through a British statute. It is not pure European law--it is a hybrid. That is why it is incumbent on the Under-Secretary to explain to the British business community what special effects this law will have, over and above the effects we know about from European jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> That is one of the key reasons why the director general has issued guidance and rightly entered into an active dialogue with businesses they feel they may be affected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman talks about dialogue. Has the task force consideration of block exemptions been concluded yet?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I understand that the work has not yet been concluded, but I will find out and let the hon. Gentleman know.
<P>
It could be dangerous to exclude from the prohibition the unqualified list of agreements set out in amendment No. 1. For example, the sharing of patent technology between competitors with a high market share could be a mechanism for carving up the market and causing serious harm. That is why we have stressed that we must look at the effects of an agreement to assess whether it is harmful. That is why we want to move away from the form-based Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which has been so widely criticised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Gentleman is saying that it is not practicable or possible to specify a list of agreements that would or would not be covered by the Bill. Therefore, will he tell the Committee why the President of the Board of Trade, at the time of the publication of the draft Bill, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I see a good case for excluding most vertical agreements from the scope of the Bill.''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The inference to be drawn from that was that she envisaged positive action to secure that exclusion. Why is the Under-Secretary now saying that that is not practicable or desirable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman began with one point about listing specific agreements and then moved on to a general principle. I have more sympathy with him on the second point, which I think he has grasped. Indeed, his first point was contradicted by his second point. Of course what my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade said was right and in line with the spirit of the Bill, which is framework legislation giving clear guidance. It is similar, in a number of ways, to the legislation that the Conservative Government proposed and to which the right hon. Member for Wokingham obliquely referred. There is a clear case for vertical agreements if that is practical, and my right hon. Friend has spelt that out.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham raised a number of red herrings. He does not seem to realise that predatory pricing is not illegal under existing legislation. It is not illegal unless the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has investigated it and found it to be against the public interest, and it has been prohibited by an order made by the Secretary of State. Therefore, contrary to what the right hon. Gentleman said, predatory pricing may, in certain circumstances, not be illegal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Under-Secretary's remarks about predatory pricing take me straight back to the question that I have wanted to ask for some time. Is he clear that, if an act, such as predatory pricing, has as its object--not effect--that which is listed in subsection (1)(b), it would be caught; that motive alone would count?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Motive counts if an act is caught by the object of the agreement; if its purpose, objectively considered, is to restrict competition--for example, horizontal price fixing and market sharing. I did not realise that there was a political divide on these issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> There is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> There appears to be, but we shall see whether the Opposition's amendment is a probing one or whether they will push it to a vote. In such cases there must be an analysis of the effect of the agreement to establish whether there is an appreciable effect on competition and on trade.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> indicated dissent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> That is the overriding guidance in the Bill. In many cases, no clear distinction can be drawn between the object and the effect of an agreement. Each agreement has to be examined in turn to see whether its objects or effects fall within the Bill.
<P>
The other bogus claims made by Opposition Members show how badly they have read the Bill. If I heard the right hon. Member for Wokingham correctly--I could hardly believe my ears--he said that there was an exclusion for monetary policy operated by the Bank of England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> There is no exclusion. To what in the Bill is the right hon. Gentleman referring? He may be referring to the 1989 White Paper, when he was Minister. I hope that I have now brought him up to date. It is not helpful to live in the past on this matter.
<P>
Other matters, some of them genuine, were raised. One was the right hon. Gentleman's claim that if a company makes a genuine mistake it will face a fine. It is clear that penalties will be levied only if the infringement is deliberate or arises through negligence. To make that clear, the Government have tabled an amendment. It helps if we concentrate on the realities behind the Bill, not on a misreading of it, or on a White Paper of 1989.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham will correct me if I am wrong, but I understood him to be referring to schedule 2 and the extent to which the Bank of England is a self-regulating organisation. Schedule 2, paragraph 2, exempts self-regulating organisations, such as the Bank of England, from the impact of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman puts a specific example which may or may not apply. There is no automatic application; it is straightforward--
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire was right. That was one of the references that I made, along with a reference to general public policy. I had assumed that the Government's thinking had developed and that they had decided that the conduct of a single monetary policy was not an anti-competitive practice of which they disapproved. Is the Under-Secretary now saying that I am wrong and that the Government do not want one Bank of England with one monetary policy? Does he know?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> As I have made clear, there is no exclusion for monetary policy operated by the Bank of England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes there is--in schedule 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman misreads the schedule, not for the first time. He also misread the parts of the Bill that dealt with fines for genuine mistakes and with exclusions. Schedule 2 does not cover the operation of monetary policy by the Bank of England.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Schedule 2 makes it perfectly clear that a recognised self-regulating organisation under the Financial Services Act 1986--such as the Bank of England--is not affected by chapter I prohibition in relation to its regulating provisions or specified practices. Surely the operation of monetary policy and the regulation of interest rates are specified practices of the Bank of England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman cannot even read the schedule without inserting his own words. If he did, he would see that it does not cover the operation of monetary policy by the Bank of England. The only way that he could fit that in was by inserting his own words. If he wanted that included in the Bill, he should have moved an amendment to achieve that. His misreading started on page 1 of the Bill, and I am sure that it will continue throughout our proceedings until the final page.
<P>
The Government have no hesitation in rejecting the amendment. If pressed to a vote, I am confident that my hon. Friends will support our rejection of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I had no intention of detaining the Committee, but the Under-Secretary's earlier refusal to give way forces me to do so. We are grateful to him for amendment No. 37, to which he referred and which we shall debate later, because it changes the position on genuine mistakes. He is ungenerous to accuse us of having misinterpreted the Bill, when we pointed out something on Second Reading that prompted him to introduce a well-crafted amendment. It would be churlish to deny that it is welcome.
<P>
I urge the Under-Secretary to attend to my remarks, pedantic though they may appear. He made a set of statements about subsection (1)(b) that will have the utmost significance now and, eventually, in court, where our proceedings may be used. He slipped between two wholly contradictory sets of statements. It is of the utmost importance that the Committee receives clarification from the hon. Gentleman. He repeatedly described the Bill as ``effects-based regulation''. It could have been effects-based regulation, but because it takes the words, in this case ipsissima verba, of the relevant article from the treaty, it uses the phrase ``object or effect''--not ``and'', but ``or''. Effect does not, therefore, have to be shown; only object needs to be shown. I accept that, in many circumstances, effect is easier to show than object, but in other circumstances, object is a great deal easier to show than effect. If the hon. Gentleman makes such a statement, it will resound around the newspaper industry. Witnesses have said that Mr. Murdoch, for example, stated that his object was to do down certain other newspapers. If the Under-Secretary says that we are right to interpret the clause as referring inclusively to object or effect, it would need to be shown only that that was Mr. Murdoch's purpose. It would not need to be shown that the effect of his actions was to distort competition. It is of the utmost importance for the Committee to know what the Under-Secretary and the Government intend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I will not comment on a specific case or hearsay evidence of what someone or other has been saying. What the Opposition must grasp is that the object of an agreement is its purpose objectively considered. The European Court has held that some agreements, by their nature, have the object of restricting competition. An example of that is horizontal price fixing arrangements or market share.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I fear that the hon. Gentleman is dealing with only half of my point--and not the relevant half. It is certainly true that there may be cases, following European jurisprudence, where the courts rule that even though it was not in someone's mind that the agreement should have that effect, nevertheless it was the object of the agreement that it should do so. ``Object'' is not so narrowly construed in the Bill. In the English language, object includes purpose. How can one have an object unless it includes purpose? One might have a purpose in one's mind that was not the objective effect, and was not, in the court's view, likely to be the objective effect, but which was nevertheless in one's mind as a purpose. Would that catch someone out?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Only if it were established that there was an appreciable effect on competition and trade.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In that case, it should be the hon. Gentleman's purpose to look again at the drafting of subsection (1)(b) and to change it substantially. Instead of stating ``object or effect'', the Bill should make it plain that object is caught only in the circumstances that I described. That would remedy the problem and we would all be in agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his reply. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset said, it is to be welcomed that the hon. Gentleman is now correcting genuine mistakes. The Opposition warmly welcome that. However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will remember that it is not in the Bill, but in the form of an amendment.
<P>
I am grateful, too, for the Under-Secretary's answer on one of the six headings in my proposed subsection (9)(a). He made the interesting point that it would be possible, under the wording that I suggested, for dominant players to carve up the market. I suspect that that would be caught by subsequent clauses relating to an abuse of a dominant position. Although I am not entirely happy with my wording, I urge the Under-Secretary to admit that I have a point about meshing competition legislation with patent law.
<P>
The Under-Secretary did not respond at all to the other five headings in my amendment. I assume that his silence means that he does not have a case against our proposal, so it is odd that he is not prepared to give a little ground or offer to go away and think again about what we have been saying about a relatively easy way to exempt a large number of harmless agreements. Including that provision in the Bill would avoid the cost problems to which my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset referred and it would remove the uncertainty facing British business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Under-Secretary could solve the problem, at least pro tem, by exempting all agreements pre-dating the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Indeed--and do it in a way that does not still leave people having to turn to their lawyers, which I fear they have to do now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset is sensible? On Second Reading, when we challenged the President of the Board of Trade to say precisely what were the uncompetitive agreements and damaging commercial arrangements that the Bill would unscramble, she simply said that it was not a matter for her. It would be helpful to know precisely what the Government mean by uncompetitive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is right. One of the problems with the Bill is that before setting up a new quango, we should know what we wish it to achieve. Ministers have a duty to the House of Commons and the public to give greater guidance in the Bill so that the instructions are clear to those who have to do the task. The Government are creating a great machine with no purpose or direction behind it, leaving us to worry about how it might career down the road doing considerable damage.
<P>
The Under-Secretary seems to think that my hon. Friends and I have come to the Committee this morning in a spirit of party partisanship. I assure him that we have not. The issues that we have raised in the amendment are not in the spirit of Tory is right, Labour is wrong. We are parliamentarians, trying to clarify the Government's intentions and produce better legislation, which is the main purpose of a Standing Committee. There will be occasions when the Under-Secretary and I disagree politically, but the purpose of the amendment is not to highlight the Labour-Conservative split; we are trying to make better legislation.
<P>
The Under-Secretary seems to misunderstand one important point. If all we were doing was applying European treaty-based law in the United Kingdom, we would not need to legislate at all. We could simply repeal our existing competition law and say to people, ``There is a treaty and a European Court. Our courts will act as subsidiaries of the European Court of Justice. Given that it has only the treaty to interpret, it will interpret the treaty and European jurisprudence and that will be our competition law.''
<P>
The Minister and his officials clearly decided that that is not the right way forward. I agree that it is better to have a domestic law that may go wider than the European law or incorporate it into British jurisprudence through a British statute. I am happy with that approach. But I am not happy with the Minister constantly telling us that this is the same law as the European law. It is not. That is why we need to spend time making the Bill right. It is a different UK law; it will act directly and will be in force through a UK quango. Of course, it must recognise the supremacy of European jurisdiction in certain cases, but not in all cases, and we must ensure that it does so sensibly.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the President of the Board of Trade was right about vertical agreements and he will be pleased to know that I agree that she was broadly right. He seemed to think that that was the end of the matter. Why has not the Under-Secretary tabled amendments that could solve the problem now? It would be good to do so now under this clause, and in a way that we can all understand. Many of our problems would either fall away or could be modified because the overriding amendment would tackle such problems.
<P>
The Under-Secretary suggested at length that I misunderstood the current position on predatory pricing. I do not misunderstand the position. Predatory pricing is wrong under the current competition regime. The Under-Secretary said that the case has to be proved and that if it is not proved, it is not wrong. That is the usual system and will remain so under the new legislation. Predatory pricing will be illegal but it will still be necessary to prove the case. One man's predatory price is another man's promotional discount or bargain. The object is not to stop bargains or promotional prices but to define a special group of prices that is trying to damage the market.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that one of the main difficulties that has been encountered in recent years is that the current legislation makes it extremely difficult to prove that a predatory pricing exercise is anti-competitive, and that that is one of the issues that the Bill should address?
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is a more worthwhile debating point than the points raised so far by the Under-Secretary. I would need persuading that it is possible to draft an amendment to the existing system that would make it easier to prove predatory pricing without stopping perfectly reasonable price promotions or discounts of which I, as a customer, would like to continue to take advantage.
<P>
I should be happy to examine any form of words that the hon. Gentleman or the Under-Secretary may produce, but that is not what we have here. We have a great steamroller of a Competition Bill, yet Ministers seem quite unable to tell us what they wish or intend to flatten, let alone what they might flatten, as they career around the industrial and commercial highways of Britain in the powerful new machine that they are trying to fashion.

We degenerated into the realms of farce when the Under-Secretary made the impassioned case that monetary policy would not be excluded from anti-competitive action. I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be interested to learn that thinking in that respect has changed, and that he and the Bank of England should be careful about what they are doing. The idea of having a single interest rate and a single set of money supply figures is obviously old-fashioned to the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I take to heart my right hon. Friend's comments about acting in a non-partisan spirit, but does he agree that we might be able to help the Minister out of this particular difficulty? Does he agree that the only basis on which it could be said that monetary policy is not exempt is if it had not been caught in the first place? Does he think that it might have been the Minister's intention to argue that subsections (a) and (b) of clause 2(1) did not catch the activities of the Monetary Policy Committee in the first place? If so, can he offer any illumination on why it would not have caught those activities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Given the nature of the legislation and the explicit range of exemptions for various professional and regulatory bodies, which I had taken to include the Bank of England, I find it difficult to believe that the Under-Secretary could have thought that. I remember deliberations and consultations on that in the early stages of the legislation, in which the Bank of England was one of the bodies that was clearly in the minds of those framing the legislation that needed to be exempted in either general or specific terms from the Bill's possible impact.
<P>
Much of Government activity needs to be exempted from the Bill because much of it is, by definition, anti-competitive. It is based on single monopoly provision or single monopoly decision. For example, there is only one monopolies commission, and that is one exception to my usual rule that one needs three or four of anything to have a choice. It would probably be going too far to have three or four monopolies commissions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my right hon. Friend think that, as a result of the bizarre comments made by the Under-Secretary a few moments ago, the members of the monetary policy committee and the Chancellor of the Exchequer might now be concerned for the security of their jobs? If that were the case, and there were a genuine available alternative to the establishment of an interest rate policy, as of fiscal policy, might that not be extremely good news for the competitiveness of British industry?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Member for Wokingham should ignore that intervention. It is clearly out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> You disappoint me, Mr. Atkinson--it was so much fun. But, at your request, I shall restrain myself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Given the distortions that have characterised the right hon. Gentleman's speech in the past five minutes, it must be made clear that the Bank of England does not operate as an undertaking in this respect. Therefore, it is not caught by the prohibition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am delighted to learn that the Bank of England is not covered by the general exemption for regulatory bodies, as I had thought that it was acting as a regulatory body. We shall leave that to others as it would take up too much of the Committee's time to go over the Bank of England legislation again.
<P>
I had hoped that the Under-Secretary would agree that at least some of the points made by me and my hon. Friends under proposed subsection (9)(a) to (f) would be taken away and incorporated into subsequent amendments. Even at this late stage, I urge the hon. Gentleman to recognise that we are offering helpful and constructive proposals that would simplify matters considerably--and he has said that that is something that he wants to do--would lower the compliance costs--whether the Committee believes his figures or our figures--and would reassure a large number of businesses. It would also be good news for customers to know that simple things like promotional discounts and discounts for larger purchasers were not intended to be caught by this Bill. I find it breathtaking that the Under-Secretary cannot even give that oral assurance in Committee, let alone offer an amendment to that effect.
<P>
In view of the lack of answers from the Under-Secretary, I will press the amendment to a vote. Even at this late stage, and in the interests of better legislation, I urge the hon. Gentleman to think again about several of the points that we have made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Amendments Nos. 85 and 88 stand in my name, while amendments Nos. 20 and 78 stand in the name of the hon. Member for Eastleigh. I want to explain the purpose of amendments Nos. 85 and 88. I shall start with amendment No. 88, if the Committee will forgive me for this slightly back-to-front way.
<P>
	Amendment No. 88 would bring the appreciability test into the structure of the chapter I prohibition. It is a European Union principle that is reflected in the operation of EU comeptition law and the article 85 prohibition, although it is not directly cited in that article. My understanding is that amendment No. 20 shares the same intention, but I believe that amendment No. 88 is better for two reasons. First, although the word ``appreciability'' is not so well recognised in UK legislation and statute law as the word ``significantly'', it is precisely the test that is applied in the European Court of Justice. Therefore, there is every possibility of a distinction emerging over time if EU case law on the appreciability test applied, but UK courts were asked to apply a significance test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Since my hon. Friend and I last spoke about this matter, it has become clear from the OFT guidance that the director general is using the appreciability test, which strengthens my hon. Friends argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. My understanding, not only from the OFT guidance but from what the Under-Secretary said when responding to the previous debate, is that the hon. Gentleman will not contend that appreciability is not of the essence of the application of the chapter I prohibition. However--and I hesitate to anticipate the hon. Gentleman's response--he may argue that as the article 85 prohibition does not contain the exact word ``appreciability'', our statute need not include it either.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham was right to say that we are bringing the article 85 prohibition into UK law, but through UK statute. Therefore, there is every reason not only to have regard to the UK's particular economic circumstances and markets, but to have regard--I am no lawyer, but at least I know this much--to the manner in which we want our statute law to be applied in our courts. If we want an appreciability test, it should be included in the Bill. It is our custom, where possible--and where a provision will not subsequently be substantially varied by order or guidance--to include such matters in our legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am listening carefully to my hon. Friend. If we incorporate article 85 in a way that reflects the circumstances that pertain in the UK, that would be not only sensible, but would provide an analogy with the way in which domestic legislatures incorporate EU regulations as distinct from EU directives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend helpfully reinforces my point.
<P>
I was explaining why I believe the Committee should prefer amendment No. 88 to amendment No. 20. Amendment No. 20 applies directly to subsection (1)(a) and the words, ``may affect trade'', which the hon. Member for Eastleigh want to make, ``may significantly affect trade''. That could be interpreted as having a quantitative effect on the trade pattern within the United Kindom or, when taken with amendment No. 78, the trade pattern between the UK and other EU member states. It is undesirable to go down that route as our intention with the appreciability test is not to confine it to a quantitative impact upon trade, but to determine whether there is an appreciable effect on competition. While trade and competition are related, competition subsumes trade, rather than the other way around.
<P>
I come now to the reasoning behind amendment No. 85. The structure of subsection (1) is curious. If we wrote legislation to constrain agreements that prevented, restricted or distorted competition, we would make that plain. However, the Government have written this subsection so that it has two limbs--first, how trade is affected within the UK; and secondly, how competition is restricted within the UK. The phrase ``within the United Kingdom'' therefore appears twice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point that tells us something about how the Bill is drafted. Article 85 of the treaty contains the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which may affect trade between member states''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the original, therefore, the reason for the reference to trade was to limit it to European issues.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> There is always a danger in giving way to my hon. Friend, because he is always ahead of me in the argument. Happily, I was going to come to that point. The Government have drafted the clause 2 prohibition to reflect exactly the form of the article 85 prohibition. Richard Whish, an eminent and authoritative competition lawyer, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The most precious part of Community law is the desire that no behaviour should have the result of dividing up the Common Market.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is true. The essence of the article 85 prohibition is that it is written in the context of legislation that is designed primarily to prevent activity that would distort competition between member states. However, in the context of the United Kingdom, we can rest on the proposition that we do not want to entertain anti-competitive activities that would distort competition within the United Kingdom. The second limb alone is we do not need to specify that trade within the United Kingdom is a separate activity that needs to be protected. Competition is sufficient in itself; there is no separate and distinct question of trade between member states.
<P>
In the context of article 85, I understand that my logic would not apply. The article 85 prohibition seems to be effective in that sense. Otherwise, from the perspective of EU competition authorities, there is a severe danger that those engaging in agreements for such purposes would argue that the relevant market did not appreciably affect competition between member states, and that, therefore, the agreement was not important from that perspective. They may argue that it affects trade between member states, but not competition in the relevant market for that product. I am getting into deep water, and shall probably go out of my depth if I am not careful, trying to find examples to sustain those theories. We are dealing with a theoretical proposition, but in discussing the first substantive clause, we must get the general proposition right.
<P>
Amendment No. 85 would remove the reference to trade within the United Kingdom, leaving the provision to rest on competition within the United Kingdom. Later amendments to subsection (3) deal with geographic descriptors. To avoid doubt, when we discuss those amendments, we could argue that the clause will affect local and regional markets within the United Kingdom, because we can deal with questions that relate to parts of the United Kingdom. Subsection (7) also applies in that respect. There is no question but that the prohibition is intended to apply to competition anywhere inside the United Kingdom, and no question but that it would affect trade within the United Kingdom. We do not need a separate proposition in subsection (1)(a) to make that point.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will go on to explain the import of amendment No. 78. However, amendments Nos. 85 and 88 are intended to make the Government's intentions plain, to make the Bill work--the amendments are needed if the Bill is to work--and, especially with amendment No. 88, to achieve better and clearer drafting for the purposes of UK statute law as compared with European law.
<P>
The Government may take the view that we do not need an appreciability test because clause 60 will allow the principles of Community law to be used in an interpretation of clause 2. There may be difficulty, however, because clause 60 deals with the principles of law as applied by the ECJ, but not necessarily substantive competition policy as developed by the European Commission. Much of the precedent that will be relied upon will not necessarily derive wholly from ECJ case law. If the interpretation of appreciability is to be included in OFT guidelines, it may be tested in UK courts and therefore will not necessarily encompass the developments as applied by the European Commission.
<P>
I hope for some positive co-operation between the two sides of the Committee, so that we can achieve a better drafting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall give way to my hon. Friend, but then I must conclude.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Under-Secretary was caught earlier by an ``or'' that he had not noticed. He is now caught by an ``and'' that he may not have attended to. Subsection (1)(a) states that agreements must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``affect trade within the United Kingdom, and''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In order to be prohibited, agreements must also be caught under subsection (1)(b). Agreements must be caught under paragraphs (a) and (b); they must affect both trade and distort competition. It might help if the hon. Gentleman could tell us what items could affect competition that are not trade, and therefore what is not caught under clause 2 that he would have liked to have had caught.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am delighted that my hon. Friend has mentioned that point. It is another consequence of translating article 85 prohibitions directly into UK law. It is perfectly obvious that the intention of the drafters of the article 85 prohibition in EU law intended to give effect to their own prohibition as it affects trade between member states. Indeed, they were going rest upon that provision to delineate the respective jurisdictions of the competition authorities between the community institutions as compared with UK institutions.
<P>
When we translate that language into UK legislation, including the ``and'', we are left with the absurdity described so precisely by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset. I am particularly grateful to him--with his customary perception, he has added to the argument. On that basis, I hope that the Under-Secretary will reflect upon matter, and find that the amendment will substantially improve the Bill. I hope that he will do likewise with amendment No. 88, which will improve the drafting of the Bill if not its substance.
