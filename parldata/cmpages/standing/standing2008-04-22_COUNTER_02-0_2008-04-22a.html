than pre-charge detention without trial. When those questions are

							<b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): Good afternoon. May I
turn first to the issue of post-charge questioning? I notice, Sir Ken,
that when you gave evidence before the Home Affairs Committee back in
November, there was a general agreement on the desirability of
post-charge questioning, but you highlighted the issue of safeguards on
how it operates. If one looks at the Bill, one sees that there is no
judicial authorisation for post-charge questioning. Although it is
suggested that there should be amendments to a new PACE code&#151;we
obviously do not have that at the moment&#151;in order to regulate
it, no judicial element is introduced. From your point of view as
prosecutors, do you think that that is a satisfactory state of affairs?
Would it be better if there were a degree of judicial authorisation to
ensure that there are not subsequent arguments in court about whether
behaviour has been oppressive in any way to those who are being
interviewed, over what could of course be a prolonged period between
charge and
trial?</div>
					<a name="0804239000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Ken Macdonald:
							</b>
						</i> I do not believe that judicial
oversight is necessary, although that is a matter for Parliament. A
difficulty with judicial oversight of the sort that you are suggesting
is that it could significantly slow down the process. I imagine that
the judge would be relatively reluctant to make an order of that sort
until he was well seized of the case. We are envisaging 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>here questioning that takes place fairly swiftly after charge. However,
I do believe that some element of supervision would be desirable. It
seems natural that the police should consult the prosecutor in the
case, so that a decision can be taken on whether post-charge
questioning in the circumstances of that case is appropriate. An
element of supervision is desirable, but judicial supervision could
slow the process down too much.</div>

							<a name="0804239000484"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> May I turn briefly to data sharing, before we move
on to what is probably the main issue? Are you happy with the
provisions for extensive data sharing? While acknowledging that there
is an obvious need to be able to share data, particularly to prevent
terrorism, does the scope provided for in the legislation go further
than is necessary simply to deal with terrorist cases? It seems to
extend into a wider area, particularly when it comes to material that
might have been collected by the security services.</div>
					<a name="0804239000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Ken Macdonald:
							</b>
						</i> This is a matter on which there are
strong opinions, both inside and outside Parliament. Data sharing is a
hugely useful investigative tool and source of evidence for
prosecutors. We have seen the enormous use that we have been able to
make of the DNA database&#151;I am thinking particularly of cold case
reviews, but material of that sort is increasing deployed by
prosecutors to great effect in our Crown courts. Data sharing is a
valuable tool, and one that we would
encourage.</div>

							<a name="0804239000485"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> May I ask a third question, this time on
aggravated offences? When you gave evidence back in November, there was
agreement that aggravated offences had a role, but you had some slight
reservations about the extent to which they could sometimes complicate
matters, particularly because they require areas of proof that might
not otherwise be required. Having seen the Bill, are you happy with the
way in which that measure has been formulated?</div>
					<a name="0804239000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Ken Macdonald:
							</b>
						</i> I said that I thought that it needed
careful examination, and the reason for that answer was that normally,
if a case is terrorist connected or terrorist aggravated, it will be
charged as a form of terrorist offence&#151;for example, terrorist
financing, encouragement of terrorism, or another of the many new
offences that we have at our disposal. I think Miss Hemming and I both
struggle a little to imagine a situation in which we would be
prosecuting a case in the Crown court and only tangentially, perhaps at
sentencing, suddenly revealing our view that it is a
terrorist-aggravated offence. We would then have to prove that beyond
reasonable doubt, which would suggest that it should have been sensible
to prosecute it as a terrorist offence in the first place. The measure
can work, if that is what Parliament wants. I was expressing some
hesitation about the extent to which it might be useful, but that is a
matter for
Parliament.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): Sir Ken and Sue
Hemming, I am pleased that you were able to join us today. I want to
ask you about the use of intercept evidence. I note, Sir Ken, that you
have been a strong proponent of that. We heard from the Metropolitan
Police Commissioner this morning that in his view, even if progress
were to be made in that area, it is inconceivable that arrangements
could be brought into practical effect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>for a period of some years, and that it is not therefore a relevant
consideration for this Committee? Do you agree with that
assessment?</div>
					<a name="0804239000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Ken Macdonald:
							</b>
						</i> It sounds a little pessimistic. The
matter is not straightforward and there are good arguments on both
sides. The Chilcot review indicated that that is something that we
should do if we can, although it set a number of tests that need to be
met. They are being worked on, and we are contributing enthusiastically
to that work. As you said, we have long believed that the material
would be valuable and that we should find a way of using
it.</div>
					<a name="0804239000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would not say that it is something that should take years, and as far
as I am aware, it is not the Government&#146;s intention that the
process of completing Chilcot ought to take years. The imperative is to
get the work done as soon as
possible.</div>

							<a name="0804239000487"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> This is a general question, and will have a bearing
on what we discuss later in terms of pre-charge detention. Again in the
evidence from the police this morning, Mr. Quick, who gave
evidence on behalf of ACPO, gave the impression&#151;I do not want to
put words into his mouth&#151;that he felt that the prosecuting
authorities were involved only at a late stage in the investigation
process, and might not be aware of the complexities that the
investigating officers had to face in trying to produce sufficient
evidence to put before a court. Do you, as prosecutors involved from
the early stages, share that
characterisation?</div>
					<a name="0804239000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Ken Macdonald:
							</b>
						</i> No, it is not a characterisation that
I share. We created the counter-terrorism division in 2006 to create a
centre of world expertise in prosecuting this work. We have achieved
that, and we have a 92 to 93 per cent. conviction rate. We have more
experience than any other public prosecutors in the world with this
sort of work, and we do it to an exceptionally high standard. We have
an extremely close relationship with the counter-terrorism command at
Scotland Yard. Miss Hemming and her colleagues work daily with officers
from the very earliest stages of investigation, often well before
arrest and sometimes at the stage when operations are being designed.
The model that we now follow in our relationship with the police, which
we refer to as the prosecution team, is for prosecutors and
investigators to work together at the earliest stages, as they have
traditionally done in other jurisdictions, so that we can obtain the
best evidence in admissible form at the earliest possible stage, and
present the strongest case at trial. We have a close and enduring
relationship with the police, which involves early working on
cases.</div>

					<a name="0804239000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir
Ken, you gave very helpful evidence to the Home Affairs Select
Committee inquiry into intercept evidence, if I may remind you of it.
In our report, we said:</div>
					<a name="0804239000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
found the DPP&#146;s clarification of the problems surrounding
disclosure very helpful: if the Crown Prosecution Service has already
rowed back from a misinterpretation of the extent of disclosure
required under 1996 legislation, then it should be possible to cope
with the amount of transcription that the defence could legally
require.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0804239000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
obstacles that the police appear to be putting in the way of, or the
arguments that they are advancing against, the use of intercept
evidence appear to be twofold: first, the potential disclosure of
intelligence sources and, secondly, the bureaucracy involved in
transcription. You clarified that for the Home Affairs Committee, and
it would be very helpful to us if you could clarify your view about why
that transcription is logistically possible and, indeed, how it works
to the advantage of your counterparts in other
jurisdictions.</div>
					<a name="0804239000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Ken Macdonald:
							</b>
						</i> Certainly, in other jurisdictions,
they regard that material as absolutely indispensable. The Americans
told me that they could not remember an organised crime prosecution in
the United States that last proceeded without intercept material. The
Australians told me that people who did not use this material were not
&#147;serious&#148; about prosecuting organised crime.</div>
					<a name="0804239000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
hand, I recognise that there are arguments on both sides. One is
certainly the bureaucracy involved. It is essential that we find a
system that does not place undue burden on the police or agencies and
cause them to divert resources from the front line. Under our law, what
is disclosable is any material that we intend to rely upon in evidence.
In addition, we must disclose any material that we possess that, in our
judgment&#151;nobody else&#146;s&#151;undermines our case or
assists the defence&#146;s case.</div>
					<a name="0804239000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">In recent
years, a practice has grown up of the prosecution simply opening the
keys to the warehouse and handing over everything so that the defence
could make the determination for itself. That practice was never in
accordance with the law. When I became DPP, I was determined that we
ought to return to the statutory basics in order to restrict
unnecessary disclosure in criminal cases, which was being used to
derail trials by swamping them with a mass of irrelevant materials. We
are now much more focused in what we
disclose.</div>
					<a name="0804239000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as transcripts are concerned, we have to disclose those upon which
we intend to rely. We also have to disclose those that seem to
undermine our case or assist the defence&#146;s case. Beyond that, we
have no duty. Lord Bingham, the senior Law Lord in the case of H and C,
has decried the practice of defence fishing expeditions, which derail
the trial process in the vain hope of turning up something that might
be useful. We are much more careful about disclosure now. The judiciary
is much clearer as well about what should be disclosed. My view is that
general principles of common law and statutory disclosure in English
law can be relied upon to make the disclosure of transcripts in
organised crime and terrorist cases both appropriate and
manageable.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Ben Wallace</b> (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con): I want to ask two
questions. The first follows on from the previous question about
interception. When you say 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>that you are a proponent of interception and the use of intercepts, is
that as defined under the Terrorism Act 2000, covering post, e-mail and
telephone, but not surveillance? There is often a misconception that
bugs in rooms, listening devices or cameras are in fact not considered
intercept as defined in previous law. Or are you saying that both
surveillance and intercept should be
admissible?</div>
					<a name="0804239000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">Sir
Ken Macdonald:</b>
						</i> It should all be admissible, subject to the
normal rules of evidence and subject to us not disclosing material that
would compromise national security or the capability of the agencies.
Currently, mail intercepts are perfectly admissible, as too are bugs in
rooms and in telephone handsets. In essence, what is not admissible is
material that is tapped in a more sophisticated way. Everything else is
currently admissible, and we rely on it. We also rely on intercept
material from abroad, which we use to very good effect. Recently, we
got a string of convictions in people trafficking cases and guilty
pleas as a result of intercepts sent to us by the German police, I
think&#151;certainly, it came from continental police. That happens
quite frequently. They are always surprised when we tell them that we
can use their intercept, but not
ours.</div>

experience, in how many cases has a lot of the evidence hinged on
forensic evidence rather than cross-examinations of suspects? We heard
from the police this morning that in 90 per cent. of the interviews
that they conduct, the suspect does not say
anything.</div>

						</i> That is certainly true. In terrorism
cases, including the old IRA cases and cases involving the newer form
of terrorism, it is comparatively unusual&#151;very unusual, I would
say&#151;for suspects to answer questions. What is important,
however, is that if they do not answer questions, the jury can be
directed by the judge that they may draw an adverse inference against
the defendant for his failure to answer a
question.</div>
					<a name="0804239000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
importance of that in post-charge questioning is as you indicated in
your question. An awful lot of evidence comes to light after charge. At
present, we have no way of putting it to a suspect to obtain an adverse
inference if he refuses to answer questions about it, and we do not
think that that is fair. We think that it should be open to the
prosecution to place before a suspect the fruits of the investigation,
even if they come about after charge. If the defendant wants to answer,
fine&#151;his answers can be given in evidence. If he does not want
to answer, why should the Crown not be allowed to have an inference
drawn from his failure? If that can be done if the defendant refuses to
answer questions pre-charge, why not
post-charge?</div>

						</b> If the Bill were passed and you were in
a situation where you had a post-charge questioning
facility, would you be more likely to allow a charge against a suspect
to go ahead, given that you had the new power? This is going slightly
into the pre-trial detention issue, but you could lay a charge. I
suppose that the threshold would not be as high with the new
power.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir

						</i> I do not think that the power would
make any appreciable difference. The reason is that, as I said,
suspects rarely answer questions in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>terrorism, or indeed organised crime cases. I am not sure that the
possibility of an inference from silence would be likely to tip
consideration of whether a threshold charge exists from
&#147;no&#148; to &#147;yes&#148;. My own view is that the
difference would be marginal. I do not know whether you share that

Hemming:

						</i> Yes, I do share that view. Obviously, it
makes a difference if the jury can draw an inference if the judge
allows it to do so, but the key issue is that a lot of important
evidence comes to light after charge, and those issues should be put to
the defendant, as he will be at that stage, in the same way as anything
would be put to him before the charge is put. He can be given an
opportunity to give an explanation if he wishes to do so. If he does
not, he will be subject to the same powers that exist before charge;
that is, we can ask the judge to draw an adverse inference. The
difference in the charge will be marginal, but obviously there will be
a difference. Otherwise, there would be no point in having the
inference.</div>

world, we know that specialist prosecutors are more successful in
dealing with this type of crime. I suppose that that is why you
invested in your specialist unit. The argument that is proposed by the
Scottish Law Society is to keep a separation, or at least to have a
requirement for a certain number of hurdles to be overcome before you
could take control of a case that may have implications in Scotland. In
your experience, would the Bill make things easier? Does it remove some
of the barriers that existed in the recent case of the London and

I would not confuse pre-charge detention with internment. Internment
without trial is an executive act designed to take people off the
streets and incarcerate them without much process of law. I am not an
expert on what happened in Northern Ireland, but broadly that would be
internment. Pre-charge detention means holding people in the
expectation that sufficient material will be forthcoming to charge them
with a criminal offence and put them into the court system. It is a
procedure that is entirely controlled by the

is about confusion with internment. There are quite a few safeguards,
in that the police, the prosecutor and then the judge have to look at
it on a regular basis. Making an application for a warrant for further
detention is not an easy process, nor should it be. The decision about
whether to make an application in the first place is not one that is
taken readily. From the community point of view it is as much about
explaining what it is, how it works and why we need it, as it is about
the length of time; however, there may come a length of time when it

be police intercept, not agency intercept. My feeling is that once we
started to use it, it would become fairly prominent in our armoury. The

that they use it too much and neglect other areas of investigation.

judicial and parliamentary oversight. The implication was that you

for us to say whether we do or do not want legislation, and I am not

can say&#151;I have said this on a number of occasions&#151;is that
for our part, as prosecutors, we do not perceive any need for the
period of 28 days to be increased. Of course, people have argued to the

charged, in 40 per cent. of cases, we have charged them on the
threshold test. If we were going to make applications for warrants of
further detention and keep people in unnecessarily, we would have used
the 14-to-28-day period a lot more often than we have. We have used it
in only three cases, and we have not used it once since the
London-Glasgow bombings. That probably says something about our
attitude towards warrants of further detention and pre-charge
detention.</div>
					<a name="0804239000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was the
prosecutor who spent 28 days in the police station with the police
officers on one of those cases&#151;the largest&#151;and made the
charging decisions. We certainly did not keep people in unnecessarily.
There has to be a certain amount of time for the police to investigate.
If you arrest people, the police have to look at what the plot is, who
is involved and what the evidence is. As with any case, the pre-charge
detention time has to allow a certain amount of time for the police to
investigate and question. I seriously dispute any allegation that we
kept people in any longer than we had to. As I have said to others who
have asked me that question, I wanted to go to bed a long time before
the 28th day, and I certainly was not going to sit in the police
station for hours and hours and days and days with people being
unnecessarily and unfairly locked
up.</div>

matter of practice rather than law, a summary of the evidence so far
and an overview of the investigation so far. The actual application is
generally very detailed, and the ex parte part of any application will
depend on each individual case. Our experience is that, as time goes
on, the ex parte applications become less and shorter. Clearly, at the
very beginning of an investigation you are in a very different
situation than at 14 or 21 days. In only one of the applications that
have been made by prosecutors against 17 individuals was there any form
of ex parte application and that was a tiny part of

						</i> The normal full test for prosecution
is a judgment by the prosecutor that the material before him provides a
realistic prospect of conviction. That means that there is a better
than evens chance that the verdict will be guilty. The prosecution must
also be in the public interest. If the prosecutor is considering a case
that is sufficiently serious that a remand in custody would be
appropriate in the event of a charge, he may charge on the threshold
test, which is a lower
test.</div>
					<a name="0804239000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
threshold test says that a prosecutor can charge on the basis of
reasonable suspicion that the offence was committed, coupled with it
being in the public interest to prosecute. That reasonable suspicion at
the charging stage must be based upon material that is already
admissible or which the prosecutor believes can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>be rendered admissible for trial. Currently, it could not be based on
intercept evidence or any other material that is clearly inadmissible,
such as intelligence material that could not be rendered admissible.
There must be a reasonable suspicion on the basis of material that is
either presently admissible or is capable of becoming admissible, plus
it being in the public interest to prosecute. That is obviously a lower
test than the full

is that if you are considering a provision that fundamentally affects
civil liberties, as this one does, you wish to be sure that the problem
that it is directed against is real. I am quite satisfied that this
provision would be lawful. As I have said, if it was in law, we would
use it if we ever found it necessary to do

							<a name="0804239000523"></a>Mr.

						</b> Two things. The first is about the difference
between you and the police as put by Sir Ian Blair and Mr.
Quick this morning. It is curious that you are working in tandem. In
effect, the investigative process has you almost identically enmeshed
because of the new rules on the Crown Prosecution Service. You are
working to solve the same problems, yet at the end, Sir Ian&#146;s
reaction was to say that if we lived in a different world with
intercept evidence and American-style plea bargaining, he would be more
comfortable, but he feels the need for 42 days. You explained, and you
have repeated this afternoon, that from the CPS point of view, 28 days
appears to be entirely adequate for the task that you have to perform.
You may not wish to answer this question, but will you give an
explanation to the Committee for that divergence of
view?</div>

							<b class="B">
								Sir
Ken Macdonald:
							</b>
						</i> It just shows that there can be honest
opinions on both sides, Mr. Grieve. I looked at Sir
Ian&#146;s evidence this morning and I think that he suggested that
the police were better placed to make the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>judgment because they are involved in the investigation. In fact,
prosecutors must determine when the investigation has turned up
sufficient evidence to create a charge, and I should have thought that
we were very well placed to make that judgment. I respect Sir
Ian&#146;s view and the police view, and those of everyone on the
other side, but our experience is that we have managed comfortably with
28 days, and have therefore not asked for an increase. It is possible
to set up hypothetical situations in which you might have nothing after
28 days but suddenly get evidence after that time. I repeat: anything
is possible; the question is whether it is remotely
likely.</div>

briefly follow on that last comment, you said that the discrepancy in
views between yourself and ACPO is based on your assessment of the
evidence and the chargeability of that evidence. The police view is
that, because they are responsible for gathering the evidence, in
effect, they have a different perspective. Would it not seem fair to
you that, although you sit in judgment of the evidence that has been
gathered&#151;it is perfectly legitimate for you to have a view on
that&#151;the police view on the legitimacy of extending the period,
which is based on the fact that they continue to pursue areas of

to post-charge questioning. When you gave evidence in front of the Home
Affairs Committee on 21 November, you indicated that you were in favour
of it, subject to the right safeguards. Indeed, that seems to be an
almost universal view on a cross-party basis in the Commons. Do you
feel able to comment on the Bill as it has been published and do you
consider that the safeguards in respect of post-charge questioning are
adequate? In particular, do you consider that a layer of judicial
oversight ought to be provided, or do you think that it is merely
sufficient that we should have revised PACE codes to cover the system
that ought to be
adopted?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">

the safeguards will depend in the first instance on what the contents
of the code of practice will be. I am unaware of whether there is a
draft in existence, but if there is, I am afraid that I have not seen
it.</div>
					<a name="0804239000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to your question, given that the likelihood is that in many
circumstances, the judges will have some oversight in relation to
post-charge questioning&#151;I would have thought that if anyone
comes to trial and there has been questioning post charge, it would be
up to the defence to complain about how it had taken place, if it was
contrary to the codes of practice. I would have thought that would
provide a degree of judicial supervision in that case. I suppose that
it might not do so in circumstances where the defendant was not charge,
or for some reason the issue was not raised. I would prefer to see some
degree of judicial supervision in all cases, however that came about;
not for the judges to be asked to approve questioning, perhaps before
it took place, which might put them in an invidious position, but to
have an oversight as to how code was operated and how people exercised
the powers in
practice.</div>

the use of intercept evidence. As you know, the Home Affairs Committee

use of intercept evidence, given that what we have heard about
experiences in other jurisdictions seems to indicate that it has been
immensely useful in securing terrorist

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Lord

							</b>
						</i> We are out on a limb in relation to this.
I looked very hard at it during my time in office, and particularly
wanted to talk to those countries that had highly sophisticated
intelligence-gathering capabilities. I can understand that if a country
does not have the same level of capability as we have, their experience
may not be the same. I was told by very senior officials, at the
highest level in the US justice system for example, that they regarded
intercept evidence as highly important and did not understand how we
managed without it. We heard similar views from other jurisdictions. I
am quite clear that in the field of serious crime, at least&#151;I
recognise that the Committee is looking rather specifically at
terrorism, to which I shall come&#151;intercept evidence could be
highly valuable. To deny prosecutors that very important tool runs the
risk that very serious criminals will not be properly
pursued.</div>
					<a name="0804239000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as terrorism is concerned, from cases that I have seen, I am also
confident that there are cases in which intercept evidence would be
valuable. There would need to be safeguards. I believe that the model
referred to in the report of the Chilcott review, which I have worked
on a lot, could provide the necessary safeguards, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>with a little more work. I very much hope&#151;to speak liberated
outside the Government&#151;that we will get on with that, because I

country.</div>

						</b> In respect of getting on with that, have you had a
chance to look at clause 60? It is very short. To remind you, it will
amend the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to enable the
disclosure of intercepted communications in asset-freezing proceedings.
I was told off when questioning a previous witness for calling that
slightly barmy. Do you not think that it is slightly strange that we
are proposing to legislate to use intercept evidence to freeze assets,

justification for making that separation. If you are going to use
intercept evidence, if makes sense to look at it across the board and
not just in one important, but isolated area. This does not help in
circumstances where prosecutors know that there is intercept evidence
that would help them to secure a conviction, because they will still
not be able to use
it.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Lord
Goldsmith:
							</b>
						</i> It concerns me because they are precisely
the legitimate concerns would need to be dealt with in any model. The
first principal legitimate concern is about the risk that they will be
required to disclose information that could undermine their
capabilities by revealing an ability to do something, which could be
damaging. In my view, that could be dealt with in part by not making it
obligatory for the prosecution to use intercept evidence, so that it
would be used only if it is inculpatory&#151;when it tends to prove
the guilt of the defendant&#151;and when the state wants to use it.
That means that if you have good intercept evidence, but the security
agencies say, &#147;You cannot reveal this&#148;, you do not use
it.</div>
					<a name="0804239000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ultimately,
the other way of dealing with that, as happens in other cases, is to
find other ways of ensuring disclosure, if you are required to disclose
something that tends to show that the defendant is
innocent&#151;exculpatory evidence&#151;which RIPA sort of covers.
There are ways in which to deal with that, but the ultimate sanction is
that the prosecution simply does not continue with the case. Very
occasionally, that happens, for example, when a court requires an
informant&#146;s identity to be disclosed. In that case, you just do
not continue. That is the
protection.</div>
					<a name="0804239000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
agencies&#146; second legitimate concern is that they might be
required to spend a significant part of their resources on what they
would regard as fishing expeditions&#151;people say, &#147;Please
transcribe every tape that you have intercepted in relation to this
person over the past five years and translate it.&#148; That is a
legitimate concern. I believe that the way in which to deal with it is
to have a system under which the court closely supervises, and is
required by Parliament to supervise, the way in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>which such disclosure applications are made and met, so that the court
will only order that disclosure where it is satisfied that it is
necessary to do so in the interests of justice. That is not
straightforward to do. One way of doing it is to have codes of practice
as to the way that intercept operations are run, which are no doubt
laid before Parliament for its consideration, if not approval, and have
that as a part of the structure. So it is quite complicated. I believe
that although there are legitimate concerns, they can be met, which is
why I answered the first question by saying yes, there are problems.
But I do not regard them as
insurmountable.</div>

discussion about when to use intercept would be on the basis of our
saying, &#147;If people know we can do this, use it, but if they
don&#146;t, don&#146;t.&#148; Obviously, there is a field for
disinformation in the sense of keeping people guessing as to what they
can do. That would be one of the considerations in what is done. But
everybody knows that certain forms of communication can be intercepted.
We see it when foreign Governments produce evidence that we ourselves
use in our courts. We prosecuted a very significant trafficking case
that we could not otherwise have done, as I recall, without using
intercept evidence from Holland. There may be more esoteric areas where
you do not want to let people know you can or can&#146;t, but I do
not regard that as a reason for not using intercept evidence where it
is probative and it will help to secure the ends of justice, where,
frankly, everyone will know that that is a capability that you have got
already.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): I just want to pursue this
point. In answering Ms Taylor&#146;s questions you have identified
two areas of concern for the services, both of which appear to have an
answer. First, the prosecuting, or the state, authorities can decide
how much intercept evidence to disclose and, if it is a risk, not
disclose it. Secondly, if the agencies are receiving end of fishing
expedition requests, as you describe it, it would seem merely to be an
operational decision as to whether they have the resources to respond
positively to those, as well as a decision about its appropriateness;
and its appropriateness would be covered, as you suggest, by a code of
practice. If I have summarised those two areas correctly, what is your
conclusion as to why proposals from the Government are not included in
this
Bill?</div>

conclusion in relation to that matter is not to suggest any bad faith
or anything of that sort on the part of anybody. I am sure that the
reason lies in a genuine concern as to how the system would operate and
to be sure that it would operate. I am concerned that there are ways of
dealing with these problems. It is important that, if there is a
decision in principle that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>intercept evidence should be made available under the right conditions,
everyone, including the agencies, which have a legitimate interest in
this, can work together to ensure that the safeguards, codes of

I may, I should just like to make a slight qualification. The
disclosure of evidence is not simply dealt with by way of the
prosecution deciding, because there is evidence that is incriminating,
where the prosecution can decide, and evidence that tends to exonerate,
where that needs to be revealed in some form in the interest of a fair
trial. That has to happen anyway, under section 18 of RIPA. You have to
find a way of disclosing at least the substance of the matter, and you
need to do something along those lines. Out of fairness to the
agencies, the resources issue is not just operational; there are some
areas in which the availability of resources, such as the translation
of scarce languages, might be quite limited. I understand the concern
about people not being able to listen to live conversations that may
affect security today because they are engaged in the fruitless
exercise of transcribing conversations from the past, which,
ultimately, are not going to be relevant to the trial. Forgive me for

judge for an indication of the sentence, but you cannot involve the
prosecution very much, and I would be in favour of doing that. However,
I am not sure why it would justify the extension of the period of

charge them if they passed the threshold test and if you had enough

we conclude that it is possible to foresee circumstances arising in the
future in which the current upper limit for pre-charge detention should
prove inadequate to ensure a full and expeditious
investigation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0804239000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are
you seriously sitting there and denying the efficacy of what the police
are saying, and saying that you do not see the need, in exceptional
cases, for an extension of the 28

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Lord
Goldsmith:
							</b>
						</i> I am sorry, but I am seriously sitting
here and saying that, for two reasons. The police have had significant
plots and concurrent plots that they have had to investigate and they
have done enormously well. Jacqui Smith&#146;s statement the other
day about the number of cases that have been prosecuted and the number
of people who have pleaded guilty demonstrates that. It is a testament
to our prosecutors, our intelligence services and the police and I pay
tribute to them in relation to that. However, in none of those cases
would it have been of help to have a longer period than 28 days. I
looked hard at those cases personally when I was in
government.</div>
					<a name="0804239000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I say, you come to a point where you have to ask yourself what is the
purpose of keeping someone in detention any longer. Are you going to
get a sudden admission from them? No, you are not. Are you going to get
any more information from them? Well, 28 days is four weeks. It is a
long period in which to investigate. Is it simply that you want to
protect yourself against the chance that you might find something
later? If you find 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>something later, you can still charge them. If you charge them with a
lesser offence, and if you allow post-charge questioning, which I
believe is right, you can ask them about that as well. Or are you
simply concerned that they may be a threat? We have legislation to deal
with people against whom you cannot prove enough to prosecute them when
there is a threat&#151;control orders. I regret to say that I do not
think that the proposal is
right.</div>
					<a name="0804239000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
principle, it is enormously important that something as significant as
individual liberty, which is such an important part of this
country&#146;s background, should not be undermined or removed unless
you can show that that is necessary, not just that it might be
desirable at some future stage. The test of necessity is important
here, and it is not met. I am also concerned that the proposal is
counter-productive, because it sends a message to people, particularly
to Muslim communities, that we are down on them and that this is
another attack on them. The worry is that misguided young men may take
that as a justification for taking up arms, as they see it, against us.
The proposal needs to be necessary, and I do not believe that it is.
That is why I seriously, but respectfully, disagree with ACPO&#146;s
conclusion.</div>

the Criminal Justice Act 2003 extend the period of pre-charge detention

did. I looked very hard at the evidence and I was persuaded. I started
from a position of scepticism, given that the period had just been
extended, and I was persuaded that the increase in the methods that
terrorists were using, particularly with communication, computers,
encryption and the overseas element, justified some extension to the 14
days. Obviously, I looked hard at that issue with prosecutors and
looked hard at the evidence that the police put forward&#151;I was
part of the group that considered the matter&#151;and I did not
believe that it justified an extension beyond, perhaps, 28 days. It
certainly did not justify an extension to 90 days. I was very
uncomfortable about that and would not have been able to support it had
it come to my House to vote on. It is very important that we look at
these matters enormously carefully. I have set out the principles that
I think should be adopted, as well as my personal judgment on where we

						</b> May I press you on that point? Your answer is very
interesting: you say that you started from a position of scepticism but
were prepared to accept the extension from 14 days to 28 days under the
2006 Act on the basis of the increasing sophistication of terrorist
networks in relation to computer technology, sophisticated
communication and encryption. We can understand that, and you are well
known for your defence of civil liberties, but do you see an essential
contradiction between that position and your position now? You are
effectively saying that the sophistication of the technology that
terrorist networks use is now set in aspic and cannot possibly have
moved on from 2006. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>Do you not accept that terrorist networks are becoming ever more complex

after a parliamentary vote and for a temporary period&#151;that is
basically what is in the Bill; the proposal from Liberty that part 2 of
the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 could be used to deal with the
exceptional circumstances that were acknowledged by the Home Affairs

judge-managed investigations similar to those in France and Spain.

Judge-managed investigations are an interesting idea but would be
difficult under our system for much broader reasons. We have moved
towards that, to some extent, by giving more power to the prosecutors,

they all seem to have been ways of finding a compromise between not
having an extension and having some extension. I am not attracted to
any of them

notify the House of someone effectively going into an extended period
of detention. But we would not be allowed to know their name. We would
not be allowed to know any details of the case and so on. What do you

evidence have you obtained so far? Is there a reasonable prospect that
with a further period of time you will obtain further evidence that may
lead to a charge? Fourthly, has the investigation been carried out with

the role of the Government to provide a framework of legislation that
will do its utmost to protect the public from the sort of atrocities

although I am keen to facilitate everyone getting in and asking the
questions that they want to ask, we need to operate within some basic
rules. Questions about parliamentary calculation on whether this or

frankly, and I would have thought fairly obviously, not in order.
Similarly, questions about people&#146;s motives, which impugn or
might be thought to impugn the integrity of people in public life, are
singularly inappropriate, so let us stick to the issues. I want to be
fair to everyone, but the Chair sometimes has to rule, and it would be

that</div>

police service since 1997&#151;I served for well over 30
years&#151;but as a matter of practice I have since kept as close to
the service as I can. Without having a head count, the article is
correct. I ask the chief constables whom I meet&#151;in an
environment that is not so much social as semi-professional&#151;a
number of questions on topical issues, one of which is the issue that
you are addressing today. In reply to my question, &#147;Do you need
an extension beyond 28 days?&#148; I cannot remember one who has
said, &#147;Yes, categorically we do.&#148; Some have said,
&#147;Well, it is getting pretty close&#148; in terms of some
investigations that they know of where the clock seemed to be running
out on them. However, when pressed&#151;I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>have not gone into the level of detail that you are going into with
colleagues today&#151;some said, &#147;No, I don&#146;t think we
need it&#148;. That is what I said in the article and that is the

							<b class="B">
								Lord
Dear:
							</b>
						</i> In no order of priority, I do not think that we
need the extension of the 28 days&#151;this is not a good place to
start&#151;partly because a lot of people oppose it. They are people
of weight whom I respect, and they are experienced&#151;one, Lord
Goldsmith, has just left the room, but I could parade many others. More
to the point, one needs to look at what other countries are doing.
Forgive me for going into the detail that you may already have heard,
but if one looks at comparable, or even at non-comparable, countries
around the world, one will find that we are far ahead of them on 28
days: Turkey is seven and a half, Russia is five, and Spain is five.
Critics could say that some of those countries are not common law
countries, which is true, but it is interesting that they are a way
short of 28 days.</div>
					<a name="0804239000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you look at
common law countries with an accusatorial criminal law system, you will
find that Canada has one day, America has two days, and that Australia,
with 12 days, comes nearest to us. We already outstrip comparable
countries, which leads me to my next point, which is also in the
article. The moment that you put yourself that far ahead, without very
strong supporting evidence, I believe that you become a propaganda coup
for al-Qaeda and others, which already points to us, in my
understanding, because we are at 28 days. I sure that it would be
delighted if we were to move to 42 days&#151;perhaps I do not need to
go into the reasons for that because the way in which such a move would
be handled is fairly obvious. My understanding of the theory of
terrorism, as has been said for many years&#151;I think it is
true&#151;is that many terrorist groups, historically in the past 40
or 50 years, have declared that all you need to do to seriously damage
a western democracy is to push it and create a ratchet effect that
causes it to erode essential freedoms and legal liberties until you get
to the point at which you can point to it and say, &#147;There you
are. I told you so. We are fighting a totalitarian regime&#148;. That
is fairly obvious, but it is important. If you go past 28 days, you
play into that milieu rather more
readily.</div>
					<a name="0804239000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also believe that there are alternatives. I sat in for only the last 10
minutes of Lord Goldsmith&#146;s evidence, but I heard him being
questioned on post-charge questioning, which I introduced in that
article. I believe that that is an alternative. I need to say&#151;I
may be pressed on this point&#151;that I have the highest regard for
the police and other security organisations as they are presently
co-operating. They do a very good job for us. They are dealing with a
problem the like of which I did 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>not see. I was brought up with the IRA and other quite dangerous
terrorist groups, but they were not suicide bombers. The suicide bomber
has changed the landscape of counter-terrorism for obvious reasons. It
makes the police&#146;s life much more difficult. As Lord Goldsmith
was saying before I began my evidence, I do not know of a case in which
we have been pushed up against the 25, 26 or 27-day mark. In fact, most
cases have been dealt with well short of that time. I understand that
the bid for an extension to 28 days is a just-in-case bid, but I think
that there are alternatives that do not fall into the trap of giving a
propaganda coup to al-Qaeda, as I believe it
would.</div>

I understand the situation at the moment, we have not yet been pushed
up against the 28-day barrier. I understand the arguments, which are
well made, that it is there just in case you need it. The just-in-case
argument goes along the lines of the growing sophistication of
terrorism and counter-terrorism. I do not understand the detail, for
reasons that I have already explained to you, but I can understand the
principles. There is a race between the two. That frequently means, not
only because you are being pushed to counter terrorism with more
sophisticated means, but because of suicide bombing, that you have to
interpose earlier. If you have not heard that evidence already, I give
it to you now. You are driven to interpose earlier than you would
normally in standard crime or even in the old IRA-type crime, which
means that you do not have the evidence that you might have had had you
delayed. You cannot afford to delay. I understand that. We are going
around and around on the point.</div>

that there are ways of not going past the 28-day barrier, not giving a

mentioned, for example, acts preparatory to terrorism. I would find it
amazing if somebody was in custody at 27 days and there was no evidence
at all that one could adduce. I would be very surprised to hear that,
and quite alarmed because one would have expected evidence to have been
accrued on the minor offences&#151;the preparatory offences of which
there are several&#151;and one could then charge on post-charge
questioning, with all the paraphernalia that we know about that, in
order to hold that person in custody under the current legal

saying that this has happened. All I know is that I have
read&#151;and indeed heard only half an hour ago or less&#151;that
the ex-Attorney-General said that to his knowledge there have been
three cases, I think, that have gone past 14 days. That to me is quite
significant. We are not yet bumping up regularly against 25, 26 or 27
days. I accept that as a fact from those who I believe would know what
they were talking about, but I am being asked by you to hypothesise and
what I am saying is that I would be very surprised if you get to the
25, 26 or 27-day point without something that you can charge in the
terrorism world&#151;acts preparatory, or membership of, would come
to
mind.</div>

asked virtually every police officer whom I came across whether they

evidence?&#148; But that is a road to ruin. The essential balance
must be between how long you do that for and how much you value civil
liberties and all that goes with that side of the argument, which is
why Parliament has pitched at 28 days and why it is debating 42.

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Lord
Dear:
							</b>
						</i> I have always felt that intercept evidence,
following pretty well every other country of a comparable nature,
should be admitted into evidence. That is on one side of the coin. It
is probably just as important or more important in terrorism cases.
But&#151;there is a very large &#147;but&#148; to this&#151;the
opposition to it comes quite understandably from those who collect the
evidence. I do not want to say in a public forum where that is but
unless you push me, but you can guess
where.</div>
					<a name="0804239000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mentioned earlier in answer to another point the technological race
between the terrorists and the counter-terrorist officers. Although I
do not know the detail, I know enough about it from those who are
prepared to talk to me to understand that it is now very highly
sophisticated indeed. The security authorities, including the police,
are understandably very unwilling to disclose, by adducing the
evidence, the way in which they gather that evidence, such as the
technology, the means and so on. I can understand
that.</div>
					<a name="0804239000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a rather facile example, but if it is a straightforward telephone or
mobile phone tap, it is no problem. If it is something a good deal more
sophisticated, perhaps involving hacking into e-mail traffic or
something more sophisticated than that, the security authorities would
have to weigh up whether to risk exposing their techniques to the
world. They could lose that one case or run with it and put the
evidence in. It would be a very finely balanced
judgment.</div>
					<a name="0804239000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
latest position, as I understand it, is that if the safeguards can be
found and the prosecuting authorities are able to adduce the evidence
and protect the way in which it was gathered, they might have a case
for using it. I do not underestimate the difficulty of that in the sort
of examples that we are looking at in counter-terrorism. In the end, I
think that, generally, the security forces would prefer not&#151;I am
guessing&#151;to put the evidence in, for fear of compromising their
techniques, and that they would prefer to use the information as
intelligence rather than as evidence. There is a big difference, as you
will understand.</div>

highly sophisticated means at their disposal and do not want to
compromise those in ways that I need not explain again. You are quite
right: Australia, Canada and other countries have used it for a long
time. To be the devil&#146;s advocate, however, they do not
have&#151;they do not investigate&#151;nearly as much terrorism as

looking for examples of terrorism, you could look in Madrid, at the
twin towers on 9/11, one very sophisticated series of explosions in
London on 7/7, a series of attempts on 21/7, Glasgow airport and so on.
All of that has its roots somewhere in what we generically call
al-Qaeda. Other people here would probably explore in greater detail
what is meant by Islamic terrorism, but al-Qaeda, in the terms that I,
and perhaps most of us, use it, is a generic term for all of that
fundamental Islamic-based terrorism against the western democracies. If
you are telling me that you disagree, that is fine, but I shall
certainly not withdraw the statement that an increase in

until proved innocent is another matter altogether. In terms of
pre-trial detention time limits, I give it to you as a matter of fact
that in Germany it is two days, in France it is six days, and in Russia
it is five days. One could go on. We are confusing inquisitorial and
accusatorial systems; in other words common law systems against the
Napoleonic
code.</div>

there is no evidence to show that the incidence of false identities,
the number of languages involved or the number of international links

9/11 attacks in 2001 (when the maximum period of pre-charge detention

						</b> There is a danger that the argument is moved away
from whether this Bill is a good accessory or a good assistance to
counter-terrorism practices. Does it provide better tools for our law
enforcement agencies or does it hinder them? It is entirely fatuous to
talk about different aims of different terrorist organisations. Would
you agree with me that the ultimate goal of good counter-terrorism is
that the communities that terrorists come from communicate well with
the law enforcement agencies and are well penetrated by sources in
certain areas that are crucial? If you get to that position it is the
ultimate goal of good counter-terrorism. You get early warnings. You
get to know who is who and you catch people in the act and therefore
get convictions without overstepping the mark. Would you say that is
one of the ultimate
aims?</div>

to have communities on side with you so that&#151;this is almost a
facile remark&#151;they do not see the need to commit acts of
terrorism at all. Having compatibility with groupings, whether they are
large or small, is clearly an objective. As you move towards
that&#151;of course, you may never reach that point&#151;the
greater the degree of harmony with those populations, the better and

Dear:

						</i> That is quite difficult to answer. Let me try
to answer you in parallel, and please tell me if I have not addressed
your point. This answer is partly the answer that I gave to one of your
colleague&#146;s questions a while ago. If you ask most operatives
&#147;What do you need?&#148;, they will say that they need more of
whatever it is&#151;time, information, powers and so on. You could
take that argument all the way through to saying that once you are into
counter-terrorism territory, anything goes. That would be very
dangerous, and I guess that none of us in this room would want that,
but that would be one extrapolation of one view. The more tools you
have, the better. As I have said, there is a balance, which one has to
strike, between civil liberties, due process and the history of this
country and everything else that goes with it. That is not just about
academic jurisprudence; part of it is about whether you disturb the
balance of society with everything you do. That is partly why I talk
about propaganda.</div>
					<a name="0804239000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
growing danger of some possible courses of action disturbing the
fragile relationship between communities and the way in which they
interact. That is important. It is all about balance. We are sitting in
this room talking about a balance between powers on the one hand and
responsibilities on the other. To come back to the question that I
think you asked, there will be those in the police who would vote 100
per cent. with what I am saying because they are facing outwards at the
community, and there will be those inside who are dealing with it,
probably around the operations room desk who will want more powers and
who would probably vote with some colleagues in this room who have
prosecuted an entirely different case. I do not need to remind you that
Parliament is acting as an umpire in this matter; it is a question of
balance. You will see those two views reflected within police forces
and security organisations&#151;almost automatically, I always

						 In the past,
there have been some practical issues. One particular case resulted in
no proceedings because of the sufficiency of evidence in Scotland. It
was clear that there were common productions in England and Scotland,
which could have been conveniently prosecuted together. However, there
was no nexus between the two incidents, and the time scales of the
prosecutions were out of step&#151;the English prosecution could have
taken place within 18 months, but the Scottish prosecution was required
to take place within 110 days. The lack of time scale and evidential
considerations would have created a difficulty had there been a
sufficiency, but we did not get to such a stage.</div>

incident, which is sub judice at the moment&#151;I shall refrain from

quickly to look at the issue of universal jurisdiction. That move came
from Scots. It has been characterised as an infliction on us, but it is
far from that&#151;I raised it with the Attorney-General to ensure

						 It is
nonsense. I raised the matter with Baroness Scotland because of the
circumstances of the case and the time scales at that stage. There is
already universal jurisdiction in the Explosive Substances Act 1883 and
the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, and it has worked very
well. We also have frequent experience of cross-border crime. Criminals
do not respect the border at Carlisle. Therefore, we have common
experience of having to look pragmatically at which jurisdiction should
have preference. We deal with that in discussions and, using our
expertise as prosecutors, make decisions in the public interest,
irrespective of any political pressure or dynamic there may be at the

						 Yes, clause 11
recognises that there is a distinct approach to such matters, but it
secures the evidence so that it would be admissible in the context of
any English proceedings that were based on evidence that was obtained
in the Scottish context. It addresses those problems but recognises
that there are idiosyncrasies. In fact, I listened to the previous
witness, Lord Dear, talking about the inquisitorial and adversarial
systems. Of course, we in Scotland have a unique hybrid of an
inquisitorial and adversarial system. Therefore, we are very distinct,
and there are many differences between our legal

						 We do not have
a concept of plea bargaining in Scotland. We have plea negotiation.
Plea bargaining is a distinct process that generally takes place in the
United States. The judge is involved in the process, and will give an
indication of the sentence before the accused commits himself to a
plea.</div>
					<a name="0804239000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it is very much a central part of the criminal justice system in
Scotland that, if there is a possibility of a plea of guilty, the
prosecutor gives serious consideration to it and continues to do so as
the case progresses. The earlier the plea, the better, in the sense
that it avoids huge deployment of resources by the force, particularly
in terrorist cases, as you can imagine, and also trauma and distress
for witnesses who anticipate coming to give evidence in court. It is
also an indication of
remorse.</div>
					<a name="0804239000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Scotland, we have a system that recognises early pleas of guilty with a
discounted sentence, if the judge considers it appropriate. It is not
mandatory, but judges do afford discounts to pleas of guilty that are
given at an earlier stage. The prosecutor will consider any plea that
is tendered by the defence in the public interest when it is put
forward.</div>

						 I do not see
that there is any distinction. What motivates an accused person will
vary from one case to another. Obviously, experience in these terrorist
cases tends to be, certainly in Scotland, that they do go to trial. It
may be part of the process of having a public airing of the cause. The
motivation for what created the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>crime is perpetuated in the publicity and the oxygen that is given
through the process of trial, rather than if there had been an early
plea.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Russell Brown</b> (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab): Lord
Advocate, you have already indicated that we do things slightly
differently north of the border. It has been suggested that there is a
conflict between the proposal to allow post-charge questioning and the
principle in Scottish common law that, once charged, a person is under
the protection of the court, and the court has a duty to ensure that
nothing is done to prejudice the trial. Do you have any concerns about
the proposal of post-charge
questioning?</div>

						 This is an
example of where the different culture in England and Wales in the
judicial system is quite marked compared with that in Scotland. There
is a tradition that, after someone has been charged, anything that is
elicited by way of questioning would be inadmissible in evidence,
unless it is a spontaneous declaration or exhortation by the accused,
or a voluntary statement. Further questioning would be prohibited.
There is no absolute prohibition on visiting the accused about other
matters in that context. The general rule of our evidence, that is
devolved to the Scottish Parliament, is one of fairness.
Notwithstanding the existence of a provision that would allow the
evidence of post-charge questioning to be admitted into court, it would
still be subject to the general test of fairness in our law of evidence
in Scotland. The matter would come under judicial consideration of
whether or not it was
fair.</div>
					<a name="0804239000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
listened to Lord Dear and it resonated with me that the existence of
post-charge questioning without an adverse inference from silence,
which, of course, we do not have in Scotland either, is somewhat less
valuable in Scotland than it would be in England and Wales. That
distinction is important. Equally, my experience as a prosecutor over
25 years is that, even where adverse inferences may be available, where
we can take into account the failure of an accused person to establish
a defence or to make a comment, generally it will be accompanied by a
qualification from the accused or the suspect that, &#147;On the
advice of my solicitor, I have been advised to say nothing.&#148;
Given that a jury will thereafter hear that the solicitor provided that
advice, be it wrong, given the consequences, I am not sure what weight
a jury would attach to an inference from silence in those
circumstances. Therefore, limited benefit can be achieved evidentially
from that, even in a Scottish context, if we did have
it.</div>
					<a name="0804239000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also think that there is a danger of questioning too much. Once you
have a sufficiency and it is good enough, if you go back to the accused
to question further, you often get an answer that you do not want. By
that time, in the context of post-charge questioning, there will have
been disclosure, if it is post-petition, of the statements that formed
the basis of the Crown case. If you approach the accused with
questioning, he will be able at that stage more intricately to link his
answers to what he knows to be the state of evidence. Therefore, he may
well be able to give answers that exculpate him, rather than
incriminate him. Certain tactical issues would have to be considered
about the value of that. Again, I would not be able to speak about the
English experience. I can only speak about my concerns about its
efficacy in
Scotland.</div>

						 From my
perspective, the universal jurisdiction is an overdue provision. It is
absolute common sense, and it will afford a flexibility and an
assurance with regard to one accused of committing a crime anywhere in
the United Kingdom. If we look at recent events, terrorism can happen
across the board in the UK, and the basis for jurisdiction will not be
snarled up in any way because of the absence of a specific crime in
that context.</div>

						 If there is a
conspiracy to carry out terrorist offences, there is a basis for
jurisdiction in either Scotland or England and Wales. Indeed, that is
certainly satisfactory where the evidence is quite patent at the
earlier stage as to what that is. If it is not clear that it is a
conspiracy and it might have been a number of isolated incidents from
the same accused, the basis would not be clear at that stage. You could
have two simultaneous events that are unrelated but for which there is
a common accused. That being the case, as a matter of certainty across
the board in all terrorist offences&#151;including the financing of
terrorism, which could come from frauds that might not be patently
connected with terrorism but which we thereafter discover
are&#151;the public interest would be served by the ability to
prosecute either in London or

						 I thought that
that was rather quaint when I read it, because we have had the Customs
and Excise Management Acts and the Explosive Substances Acts since the
late 19th century without anyone agitating in Scotland that they are
our terrorists and that they need to be prosecuted in a parochial way.
It is absolutely clear that the real priority here is the public
interest, and terrorism in that context demands that we act closely
together to ensure both the public interest and fairness for the
accused. The trial must take place coherently and expeditiously and
with witnesses and common evidence, ensuring that we do not have two
separate show trials in each jurisdiction simply because of the
difference in our
jurisdictions.</div>

						 We have had

but also does so in Liverpool. Two years ago, I prosecuted a drugs
courier who was taking drugs from Liverpool to Edinburgh. You have a
crime in Liverpool and in Scotland, and we could have chosen to
prosecute in either location. Certainly, the jurisdiction of the High
Court is absolutely clear, but what is also clear is that we have an
ability to have prosecutions that recognise that there might be
continuity of action across the

clause 24, which deals with post-charge questioning in Scotland, did
not. It seemed on the face of it to be incompatible with the
reservations that you expressed about how it would work. I am always
conscious of our profound ignorance in this House when legislating on
criminal matters in Scotland without the benefit of enough Members in a
Committee who have Scottish legal training. To come back to this, are
you satisfied that clause 24 is workable in Scots law? I am not clear
about what you said earlier about the relationship between this UK
legislation and its effect and the procedures that will be adopted
eventually in Scotland and the role of the Scottish Parliament in this
area. Could you perhaps just unpick that for
me?</div>

						 I shall deal
with that last issue first. The fact that a statute allows evidence to
be admissible, or not to be inadmissible, which I think is what
clause 24 will do, does not thereby render it evidence that
would be put to proof by the court. The court will still determine
whether, generally, there is fairness in the way in which evidence is
extracted. If I had a provision that allowed post-charge questioning,
but in pursuing that I tortured the accused or threatened him with
assault, that would render that evidence inadmissible for the
underlying reasons of unfairness. That is why the law of evidence is
bolted on to any provision that, legislatively, may be allowed to admit
evidence in
court.</div>
					<a name="0804239000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
far as the usefulness of the provision is concerned, we do not have a
tradition of post-charge questioning. The point that Mr.
Brown made about the protection of the court being afforded to an
individual at the point where they have been charged is important in
Scottish evidence and Scottish procedure. In the Scottish context it
will have less value, but in the context of universal jurisdiction it
may be of use in cases that the English may have&#151;because of
that. Again, it is limited, because if someone was cautioned and
charged in Scotland, they would not be cautioned about an adverse
inference, because we do not have them in
Scotland.</div>

						 I am not
intimate with the suggestion that it should be repatriated. Certainly,
my discussions with UK ministers have not involved that suggestion.
Terrorism legislation is quite clearly reserved. But the prosecution of
terrorist offences is devolved in its entirety in Scotland. The
investigation by the police is devolved. As Lord Advocate not only am I
the prosecutor, but I am in charge of directing the police in their
investigations in Scotland: they must comply with my lawful directions.
So mine is an inquisitorial role; it is quite distinct from that of the
Director of Public Prosecutions. Although the Crown Prosecution Service
now has the right to charge in England, that is a relatively new
development. In Scotland, it does not matter what charge the police
bring, because ultimately the charge that prevails is that applied by
the prosecutor, who can often depart entirely from the charge brought
by the police. So we have a different regime there
altogether.</div>
					<a name="0804239000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
far as the repatriation of powers is concerned, the prosecution in
terms of the Scotland Act 1998 remains the responsibility of the Lord
Advocate. Again, it is not something that the Scottish Parliament can
change: it cannot alter or adjust that. The Lord Advocate is duty bound
to act independently of any other person, including colleagues and
Ministers, as well as the UK Government or the police. So there is an
independent prosecution system. Therefore, the investigation of
terrorism and a terrorist incident at the coalface, where it arises,
involves the devolved entities. The local police, the Ministers who
deal with civil contingencies&#151;for example, water and emergency
powers&#151;and the Lord Advocate would be involved and an emergency
room would be set up. But we would be in direct communication with
Cobra, and we would be advising the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary
and other Ministers precisely what was going on at that level, with the
UK having an overall interest in
terrorism.</div>

						 I suspect that
I would only be happier if I was insecure about how matters would
progress. Experience to date is that we, as prosecutors&#151;the
Attorney-General, with whom I have a very good relationship, and her
predecessor, Lord Goldsmith&#151;would engage immediately in
discussions. There is no question of someone snatching a body from
Scotland simply because the English wanted that. Likewise, I assure you
that I would not snatch an English terrorist who happened to be found
in Glasgow, because it works two ways. I suspect that there has been
concern that somehow I would be alienated or that my independence would
be eroded&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Yes, for that matter, it might

						 However,
concern has been expressed that the clause should contain an express
provision of consent, which might also raise the spectre and prospect
of judicial reviews at the point when the prosecutor, south or north of
the border, is about to transfer a prisoner. Investigations at a
crucial stage could, therefore, be snarled up in civil proceedings. A
very clean provision on the basis of a clear understanding that we
would not act without the consent of the other and that we would both
act in the public interest as prosecutors should provide a reassurance
sufficient for both
Parliaments.</div>

						 Yes. Terrorism
expertise is very much with the Metropolitan police, who have
tremendous expertise and experience in dealing with such matters.
Unfortunately, we also have that expertise in Scotland, because of
Lockerbie, which remains the worst state-sponsored terrorist case in
the United Kingdom. We have also experienced Irish terrorism and more
recent cases of terrorism and acts preparatory to terrorism, which have
been prosecuted. Although we are a small country, it is not as though
we have no experience of it. However, undoubtedly, the expertise and
experience is with the Metropolitan police. The co-ordinator,
therefore, is extremely welcome when he comes to Scotland, but when he
does come the constitutional position changes, because thereafter he is
assisting the chief constable and so subject to the directions of the
Lord Advocate, as are all chief constables in Scotland. That is about
knowing each other&#146;s jurisdiction intimately. I think that we
require protocols to support the
legislation&#151;</div>

						 I think that
there should be protocols to ensure that there is no ambiguity. I also
think that we require training so that those who come north of the
border do not simply see it as a very foreign alien jurisdiction. We
need to be familiar. We do that through joint table-top exercises,
which are very
useful.</div>
