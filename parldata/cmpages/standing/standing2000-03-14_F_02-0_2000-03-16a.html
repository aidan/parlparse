<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we commence scrutiny of the Bill, I have two announcements to make. First, the Committee may recall that the question of communication by e-mail was raised at the first sitting. My reaction to that was the commonsense one, but I decided to consult on the matter. After reflection and consultation, it seems that that commonsense view should prevail. Not all Members have an e-mail facility, and although it might be useful and generous for the Government to communicate by e-mail to those Members who have it, they should do so for the moment only in addition to the usual communication with hard copy.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> On a point or order, Mr. O'Hara. I appreciate that ruling. The Home Office will communicate by e-mail with all members of the Committee who wish it-in addition, of course, to the usual methods. Through you, Mr. O'Hara, I ask members of the Committee to give their e-mail addresses to my officials.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. As the member of the Committee who raised that point, I express my gratitude to the Minister.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That seems a generous and commonsense solution. Members of the Committee will have heard what the Minister said. I shall raise the matter at the Chairmen's Panel, but in the meantime that seems a commonsense way forward.

<P>
The second announcement is that, for the good of the business of the Committee, I have exercised my discretion in accepting two starred Government amendments to clause 6-Government amendment (a) and Government amendment No. 71. I trust that the Committee will accept my judgment that it is done purely to allow the Committee to make progress. I make that announcement now, instead of leaving Members to wonder why starred amendments have been accepted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. First, I thank you for your ruling on e-mails. Secondly, in answer to a point that I made on Second Reading and at our first sitting, the Minister has kindly provided us with a letter dated 14 March that sets out many of the details that I had hoped for. Will he be able to say-through you, Mr. O'Hara-whether the regulations under clause 12 will be made by affirmative procedure, given the complexities highlighted in that letter?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a matter for debate now, but I shall give the Minister the opportunity to reply.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman's question now, but I shall do so shortly.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is more or less what I thought.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Unlawful interception</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 10, after ``internationally'', insert ``or recklessly''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 16, after ``intentionally'', insert ``or recklessly''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> the amendments deal with the part of clause 1 that provides for the offences of unlawful interception, first in respect of public postal and telecoms systems, and secondly in respect of private systems. As the offences are drafted, the prosecution will have to show that an interception took place, that it had not been lawfully authorised and that it was intentional. The amendments would widen the offences to cover interceptions that are not only unlawful but reckless. The offences are one of the most important protections provided to victims of unlawful interceptions and will enable prosecutions to be made when authorities or other parties intentionally and unlawfully intercept communications.

<P>
Even as they are currently drafted, the provisions will concentrate interceptors' minds, but they will also provide them with protection for accidental interception of information without authority. The word ``intentionally'' provides the interceptor with a defence for mistakes and careless actions. We believe that it is perfectly right to introduce such protection, but we are concerned that the current drafting would also provide an interceptor with a defence for reckless interception. If an interceptor had a warrant or authorisation but grossly exceeded it, not caring less whether he intercepted other communications, he could defend himself by saying that he had not deliberately set out to do it, perhaps because he just did not give a fig.

<P>
It is important to penalise reckless interceptions, so we should be aware that the Bill gives interceptors wide powers and considerable flexibility. Clause 5(3) allows interceptions to be authorised in respect of all postal and telecommunications systems for a wide range of broadly defined purposes. The intercepted communication does not even have to be identified by the warrant. Clause 5(6)(a) provides discretion to intercept other communications. The list of people who may apply for a warrant is long and open ended. The Secretary of State can designate any person to apply, but he does not have to sign the warrant itself. A senior official may instead suffice, and he can quickly modify the document. In some instances, the interceptor does not even require a warrant when he believes that there is consent. In other words, consent does not have to exist; the interceptor must merely reasonably believe that it does. Clause 4 deals with external interceptions under mutual assistance agreements, for which no warrant is required.

<P>
Interception of communications is an invasion of privacy that should occur only in conditions that are tightly circumscribed by the House and which are necessary for effective crime fighting and the other purposes set out in clause 5(3). United Kingdom subjects are entitled to protection from overweening power and state interference. The amendments would ensure that interceptors do not act recklessly and would provide a counterbalance to the wide powers contained in the Bill.

<P>
The clause also affects internet users and internet service providers. Internet users believe that they own the internet system and that they have great freedom. I think that their confidence in the internet is currently justified. However, if interception is to be widely practised and sometimes undertaken recklessly, it will undermine confidence in the internet. It will also damage the interests of internet service providers, who share an interest in ensuring that interception is well targeted and incapable of being used in a broad and reckless way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor: </B>(Esher and Walton): My hon. Friend makes an important point. The purpose of encryption is to add confidence to e-commerce and to internet use. It is bad enough for an internet service provider to have to allow interception that is carried out with care and due attention, although, by and large, it is understood that such interception must sometimes be undertaken by security and other services. However, it would be more worrying if interception could be handled recklessly and without the interceptor bothering to tidy up after himself or to look after the private key that he used to obtain access and any additional information that became available. Such activities would undermine confidence in the whole system of e-commerce in Britain and could encourage people to base their businesses overseas.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> My hon. Friend makes the right point. That is an issue which affects use of the net and the consumer's confidence in it. An innocent net user-and most users are innocent-would not want a substantial number of his communications to be intercepted. Obviously, there are one or two people who use the net for criminal purposes-that was highlighted on the Second Reading. However, we should not accept the mindset that that constitutes a substantial proportion of the use of the internet. I think my hon. Friend is right that it could damage confidence in the net if there was a feeling that vast amounts of information were being hoovered up and sieved in order to locate the odd item used for criminal purposes. That power should be used in a targeted way.

<P>
Without breaking any of the confidences that are in the letter that the Minister kindly sent us, one of the key points is that the level of interception is important when it comes to the cost and the technical complexities of providing an intercept capability. The interceptors may say to themselves, ``I'm not intentionally intercepting communications unlawfully and I don't give a fig'', and act recklessly, feeling that they are protected. I am not sure that they will have the necessary concentration of the mind, and if the interceptors do not have a proper sense of their responsibilities, interception could become expensive and burdensome for internet service providers. I think my hon. Friend makes an important point. If there was a gung-ho attitude among interceptors, it could overload the interception capability.

<P>
It is also likely that the internet will become an even greater force for communication than it is presently. Certainly, stock market investors feel that it will become a widely used method of communication. If that is the case, it is important for the confidence of users and for our future as a country that trades on the net, that there should be no doubt as to the intentions of interceptors.

<P>
The question of recklessness has come up over the years in the courts, and there are classic judgments on the subject. I shall cite Lord Diplock, who touched on this in the Lawrence case. He ruled:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Recklessness on the part of the doer of an act presupposes that there is something in the circumstances that would have drawn the attention of an ordinary prudent [and sober] individual to the possibility that his act was capable of causing the kind of serious harmful consequences that the section that created the offence was intended to prevent.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In this case, it is intended to prevent people intecepting deliberately. We are saying that mischief should cover any reckless act as well.

<P>
Lord Diplock said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the risk has been identified and the risk of those harmful consequences occurring was not so slight that an ordinary prudent individual would feel justified in treating them as negligible. It is only when this is so that the doer of the act is acting ``recklessly'' if, before doing the act, he either fails to give any thought to the possibility of there being any such a risk or, having recognised that there was such a risk, he nevertheless goes on to do it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a sophisticated definition of recklessness, but it shows that the courts are able to decide what recklessness is.

<P>
In a judgment that is more relevant to the concerns of politicians, Lord Lane, as Lord Chief Justice, ruled in the Taylor case that a defendant is reckless if he acts in a way that shows that he ``could not care less''.

<P>
The last thing we want are interceptors whose minds are not properly focused on what they should be doing. We recognise that, in general, the authorities act responsibility and interceptions have been correctly handled, but we do not want to start a culture of slackness when the powers have been widened. We do not want interceptors who could not care less to act recklessly.

<P>

<B>Mr. A. J. Beith </B>(Berwick-upon-Tweed): I am just a little puzzled. An interceptor who works with a warrant that is granted by one of the bodies described would be acting with lawful authority, but the person who is proscribed from carrying out intercepts would not have that authority. Whether reckless or not, he would be acting illegally.

<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes my point in a sophisticated way. A person who exceeds his lawful authority can use the defence that although it was a terrible accident or he did not pay proper attention and was reckless, his actions were unintentional. We believe that if he recklessly exceeds his lawful authority, he should be subject to the rigours of the law. The right hon. Gentleman is right. If someone had lawful authority, which is an element of the offence, he could not be found guilty, but when he exceeded his lawful authority and acted recklessly he would still have the defence that his actions were unintentional. He should not have a defence in those circumstances, because we do not want to allow reckless interceptions. I hope that that is a satisfactory response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I am still puzzled. If a person does not have lawful authority, he does not have lawful authority. He cannot exercise the defence of recklessness if he did not have lawful authority in the first place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The offence has three elements: there must be an interception, it must be without lawful authority and it must be intentional. A person who exceeds the powers of the warrant or authorisation and therefore intercepts without lawful authority would not be guilty unless the prosecution could prove intent. We believe that, if he intercepts without lawful authority and is reckless, he should be found guilty. The amendment widens the mental element of the offence to include recklessness. We do not want interceptors to be able to rely on recklessness as a defence. I hope that that deals with the right hon. Gentleman's point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I will reflect on it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am glad to hear that and I should be interested to hear other opinions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I understand the thrust behind the hon. Gentleman's amendment. He is trying to create a climate in which a culture of slackness cannot operate. I appreciate his motivation.

<P>
The amendment would increase the scope of the offence of unlawful interception beyond times when a person intercepted intentionally and without lawful authority to additional situations in which a person intercepted recklessly and without lawful authority. A reckless action that resulted in the interception of a communication would constitute a criminal offence.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) understood the situation. Once a warrant has been issued, the interceptor can carry out only those interceptions that are necessary to do what is expressly authorised and required by the warrant as set out in clause 5(6). If the interceptor were to go further in the way that has been described, he would be acting without lawful authority and would be open to a challenge under the Human Rights Act 1998. I think that that was what the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed wanted to point out in his intervention.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> That is not quite right, because the power with respect to interception is slightly wider under clause 5(6)(a). It is not only interceptions covered by the warrant that would be authorised; communications not identified by the warrant could also be intercepted. A wide discretion would be allowed, to try to effect the purpose of the warrant.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but I do not think that it counteracts what I and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said about the matter. The main burden of my argument about this is that, apart from the extension of the criminal offence to apply to private, as well as public, telecommunications networks and postal networks, the offence under the Bill replicates that found in the Interception of Communications Act 1985. I understand the argument that we are widening the terms and that we are dealing with a new world. The internet was given as the example of that. However, we are not aware of any shortcomings in the drafting. It is intended that the offence would catch those who deliberately went out of their way to intercept a person's communications.

<P>
Recklesness is difficult to define in criminal law terms. The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) correctly observed, with reference to judgments discussed by Lords Diplock and Lane, that they showed that the courts were capable of deciding what was reckless. That is true, but the term is nevertheless difficult. It does not stand out clearly. I was inclined to make a joke about the shadow Chancellor's remarks on recklessness in public spending and about the way that that relates to things such as police numbers. Recklessness is now a political as well as a purely legal term. In the two classic ways of thinking about the word it applies to the carrying out of an act despite the fact that either the accused foresaw a likely consequence or a reasonable person would have foreseen the likely consequence. In both cases, the interception would be a by-product, rather than the purpose, of the act, and would not therefore be relevant to the intention of catching those who went out of their way to intercept. It is difficult to envisage the situation that the amendments would remedy.

<P>
The point about confidence made by the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) is important, but it plays both ways. Some internet service providers are concerned that the Bill is too rigorous for them to comply with effectively. A danger of accepting the amendment would be the potential liabilities for them. I am not talking about cash liabilities but circumstances in which they would need to be particularly careful. The culture of slackness has been established. Conditions might come to seem more onerous and difficult for internet service providers than at present, although I know that that is not the intention behind the amendment.

<P>
I appreciate the spirit in which the amendments were tabled and I am prepared to consider whether another wording could achieve what is intended by them, without the difficulty of using the word ``reckless'', which is less straightforward than the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire suggested. I hope that he will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I want to speak in support of the amendments and to pick up on the Minister's concerns about the word ``recklessness'', which, he hinted, might introduce uncertainty into statute.

<P>
For many crimes, intention to cause the proscribed result or recklessness is sufficient to impose liability. A person who does not intend to cause a harmful result may take an unjustifiable risk and, if he or she does, that person is deemed to be reckless. The situation with interceptors suggests that not all risk-taking activity constitutes recklessness. In Smith and Hogan's ``Criminal Law''-the establised text in this context-the editor, Professor J. C. Smith, observes that, although a surgeon who performs an operation may take a risk, that risk is justifiable. In most cases, recklessness is not prima facie an offence for which the surgeon would be liable. Another example involves the promoter of a tightrope act, who would be aware, at some level, of the risk of harm. However, the fact that he was promoting that activity would not necessarily constitute recklessness.

<P>
In a case involving citizen's arrest, recklessness would not apply if the citizen drove a car dangerously in an effort to stop the criminal from getting away. Case law suggests that the well-meaning citizen would not, prima facie, be guilty of reckless driving.

<P>
I want to get to the heart of the matter. The amendments would improve the clause because the courts have clearly said that, if the act of risk taking involves no social utility-for example, a game of Russian roulette-the slightest possibility of harm would be enough to prove recklessness. At the other end of the spectrum, case law suggests that, if an act involves a high degree of social utility-for example, in the context of law enforcement, intercepting the traffic of criminals-only a high probability of harm being done would constitute recklessness. On the one hand, in relation to cases with no social utility, it is easy to establish recklessness, but, on the other hand, in the context of law enforcement and in relation to cases with high social utility, it is much harder to establish recklessness. I hope that the Minister will take that on board. He has not established adequate objections to the amendments.
{**UF1**}To establish recklessness, it is necessary to show that the individual took an unjustifiable risk. Two forms of recklessness are interesting. The first is defined in case law as Cunningham recklessness, which requires proof that the individual was aware of the existence of unreasonable risk. The interceptor would have to be aware of a risk when seeking to intercept traffic under a warrant.

<P>
The other form of recklessness, Caldwell and Lawrence recklessness, requires a slightly different test. That test would be satisfied if the individual knew of the existence of the risk, or-this goes further than the Cunningham test-in the case of an obvious risk, if the interceptor had failed to give any thought to the possibility that a risk might exist. The Caldwell and Lawrence test is slightly more onerous. Those clear legal principles meet the Minister's objections to the amendments.

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Caldwell recklessness, as Diplock held, includes not only the mens rea of intention, which is provided for in the Bill, but recklessness, as suggested by the amendments. If, prima facie, it was thought that wrongdoing had been committed and that the interceptor had overstepped the lawful authority that was vested in him, it would require also proof of his state of mind. Diplock held that the individual must have been aware of the risk, or not have given thought to the possibility of its existence. Not giving thought to something is a state of mind; it would therefore meet the mens rea requirements.

<P>
I shall not say much more about that, because the point was well made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire. I hope to have made it clear that it is not the vague, uncertain term that the Minister wishes us to believe.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Listening to my hon. Friend, it occurs to me that it is not difficult for the interceptor to judge whether a risk exists, because the test of lawful authority, which is also part of the offence, means that he must know what the warrant allows. One hurdle is already in place. As the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said, the interceptor does not get off the stocks for such an offence unless he goes beyond his lawful authority by exceeding the terms of the warrant or authorisation, and then only with the high threshold mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley). In cases of social importance such as law enforcement, the interceptor must go beyond that; he must act recklessly. Does my hon. Friend agree that officials undertaking that work therefore have two substantial protections?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. He makes a powerful and lucid case. His rapier legal mind was ahead of mine. My rusty legal brain has not been deployed for remuneration for seven or eight years.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I wondered whether the phrase ``rapier legal mind'' was a compliment or an attack.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> It was merely a statement of fact.

<P>
I am grateful for the powerful point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire and I hope that the Minister will take it on board. The requirements imposed on an interceptor by the terms of the warrant, and the lawful authority that he must abide by, are already provided by statute. For the reasons elucidated by my hon. Friend, the Minister should take some comfort from the fact that the certainty and clarity provided by the amendment would be a belt-and-braces provision for what is already a regime of lawful authority. The interceptor will have to deal with that regime at the outset, but he will also have to meet the recklessness requirements, according to the case law to which I alluded.

<P>
Finally, there is a question mark over what activities are covered by recklessness, whether it be Cunningham recklessness or Caldwell/Lawrence recklessness. Case law distinguishes between theft offences, manslaughter offences and other offences against the person. To what extent is it sensible and appropriate to apply recklessness to regulatory offences? In the famous Reid case, the majority in the court expressly recognised that although ``reckless'' has a variable meaning, it depends on the context-in other words, what type of activity is the subject of the legal challenge.

<P>
Although the Caldwell/Lawrence test is understood to be limited to criminal damage, it is applicable in case law to statutory and, as Professor Smith says, mainly regulatory offences. There is sound precedent for introducing a recklessness test. I should like to hear the Minister's thoughts on why the amendment would not improve the clause and give adequate, proper and sensible protection for those whose use of electronic data is subject to an interception.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I am very sympathetic to the intention of the amendment, but I am not persuaded that it will do the job. Although it is directed at the misuse of authority by public officials who are engaged in interception, the principal purpose of the clause is to prohibit the misuse of interception by anyone. The state is by no means the only threat to an individual's liberty. All sorts of people would like to intercept other people's telecommunications. The clause prohibits them from doing so with intent.

<P>
It is, of course, possible to intercept telecommunications accidentally. In the old days, telephones were rationed and people shared party lines. We had to put the telephone down quickly or hear the next-door neighbour's conversation. There has to be a definition of intent, and the clause provides a vital protection against people who like to eavesdrop on others' communications. In line with the European convention on human rights, any interception should be subject to careful warranting and scrutiny. In so far as the concept of recklessness has a bearing on officials of the specified bodies, I am not persuaded that it would improve the Bill.

<P>
In the Minister's initial response, he used a significant word-by-product. It is difficult to engage in authorised interception without producing a by-product. Attempts to access the conversation of one party could involve hearing the conversation of an irrelevant party about a matter that has no bearing on the subject of the warrant. Mistakenly, but with good intent, someone could pick up conversations between different people who happen to use the telephone that is the subject of the warrant. Material that has no bearing on the matter under investigation might be embarrassing or damaging. Disciplines to deal with and destroy by-product to ensure that it is not misused are important, and should be exercised by the relevant bodies. They are probably a better safeguard than the notion of recklessness, which would be difficult to prove.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> In what sense is the right hon. Gentleman suggesting that recklessness would be difficult to prove? Case law in respect of Caldwell/Lawrence and Cunningham makes the test clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I am speaking of cases in which the official is able to demonstrate that he was acting in good faith in seeking to carry out precisely the reuqirements of the warrant. In such cases, by-products would arise not through recklessness but because of the inherent difficulty of targeting relevant conversations in respect of a warrant on a particular telephone number.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Clause 5(6)(a) ensures that conduct authorised under an interception warrant will include the by-product. Paragraph (a) states that authorised conduct includes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>all such conduct (including the interception of communications not identified by the warrant) as it is necessary to undertake in order to do what is expressly authorised or required.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Authorised conduct also includes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>conduct for obtaining related communications data<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
-another obvious by-product, which could include logging details-and conduct by any person which provides
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>assistance with giving effect to the warrant.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The by-product is entirely wrapped up in those provisions. As lack of lawful authority is the starting point of the offence, one will have jumped a massive hurdle by proving that an official, for whome clause 5(6) provides an awful lot of protection, did not have authority to intercept. With a recklessness provision, it would then have to be proved that the official not only exceeded the powers specified in clause 5(6) but was reckless in using them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman
is trying to achieve. I am suggesting, however, that
 by-products obtained without any element of recklessness are a much bigger problem. I am arguing that the likelihood of demonstrating that a public official has been reckless in making interceptions is small. I do not think that public officials behave recklessly in carrying out such activities, but that does not remove the by-product problem, for which it is difficult to legislate in anything other than general terms. Even if recklessness was taken into account, that problem-to which the Minister referred in passing and about which I have spoken a little more-would still be of primary importance. Whether recklessness was part of a by-product's acquisition is less important from the point of view of the individual affected than the fact that it was acquired and the need to ensure that it is destroyed and not misused.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I was amused by the comments made by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed on party lines, but I do not use the term in the Alastair Campbell sense. I recalled an American romantic comedy entirely based on the problem of party lines and asked my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas) whether he remembered it. He replied that he was born only 20 years after the film's release and had no recollection of it. I wondered what would and would not have been reckless in relation to party lines.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds made an effective point. He sought to demonstrate that recklessness would significantly impact on events in very few sets of circumstances. He tried to deal with my suggestion that considerable risk was involved in such provisions by referring to a high social utility test. He gave examples involving a surgeon, a tightrope walker and Russian roulette players. The shadow Cabinet sometimes reminds me of Russian roulette, as it whizzes around on policy matters. The hon. Gentleman suggested that, as interception has a high social utility-all Committee members recognise that-it would be very hard to demonstrate recklessness, so the impact of such provison would be limited.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman went further by referring to mens rea. I am not a lawyer, but I know that it would have to be demonstrated that an interceptor had not thought about an issue if recklessness were to be proved. Any internet service provider would be in a strong position to say that an interceptor had thought about his activities. The interceptor would, by definition, have thought about them in determining the systems that he used to intercept information.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman successfully argued that only in limited circumstances would the word ``recklessness'' make a difference to the way in which internet service providers or others operated. He was trying to show-and did so well-that we need not worry about the amendment, because it would not give rise to a problematic ripple effect, but the knock-on effect of accepting that is that we must ask what would be the virtue of an addition whose impact would be so limited.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds was making the point that the amendment would not lead to many court cases. However, the ripple effect would work with respect to declaratory effect. It would concentrate the mind of an official dealing with the matters in question on well-targeted and well-thought-through operations. It would prevent a slack or gung-ho attitude.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is a fair point, and I shall deal with it in a second.

<P>
The remarks of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds suggested a downside to the inclusion of the word ``recklessness''. He took us through an interesting discussion of Cunningham recklessness versus Caldwell/Lawrence recklessness. I think, although I am not a legal expert, that he referred to the case of Reid and a majority verdict, implying that even among high legal authorities different opinions were held about the definition of the word. The hon. Gentleman showed that the word could be thought to mean one thing in one set of circumstances and something else in another. Although I accept that there is substantial case law, issues of definition remain and would ripple through the matter that we are considering.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Minister is of course right and the legal test of recklessness would be objective. The court would consider the facts of each case that arose. Nevertheless, the declaratory effect, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire, of putting the term on the statute book would surely be outweighed by any possible uncertainty-which is, I think, being hinted at-with respect to the objective test.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I will come to the point about declaration in a moment.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds also suggested a belt-and-braces effect. Two or three other aspects ofthe provision also have that effect. We have not yet discussed the fact that clause 5(6)(a) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>all such conduct  as it is necessary to undertake in order to do what is expressly authorised or required.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The two words ``necessary'' and ``expressly'' in that context would have a fairly substantial belt-and-braces effect with respect to the slackness referred to by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. Indeed, the commissioner-Lord Nolan at present-would pick up the details in his annual report and set out errors that were made.

<P>
The second belt-and-braces effect came to light in the remarks of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, when he referred to by-products and the destruction of material collected in the relevant way. That is dealt with under clauses 14 and 15 and I hope that the Government will be able to satisfy hon. Members about the matter when we reach that point in the Bill.

<P>
The hon. Members for Bury St. Edmunds and for North-East Hertfordshire spoke about the declaratory effect of including the term ``recklessness''. I know that a word in a Bill has force. However, the Government, by working on the Bill, by conducting a full dialogue-which is not yet concluded-with internet service providers about the operation of the Bill, by offering guidance and in other ways, will clearly set out a declaration that the culture of slackness to which the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire referred could not be part of the arrangements. The declaration will be given although it may not be on the face of the Bill.

<P>
Finally, I understand the purpose of the amendment, which I do not condemn in any way. It is a positive attempt to move the debate forward. However, for the reasons set out by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, the amendment will have a limited practical impact in terms of prosecutions. We also need to bear in mind that a belt-and-braces approach is suggested by the words ``necessary'' and ``expressly'', the role of the commissioner's annual report, the by-products that are contained in clauses 14 and 15; and the dialogue that we have with the internet service providers. On the other side, there is a tangible risk that uncertainties about what the word ``recklessness'' might mean in this context and the legal discussions that may arise from this could make things more difficult for internet service providers. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire will consider withdrawing his amendment. If not, I ask my colleagues to vote against it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> We have had a good debate on this important subject. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds stated the argument well-and I do not say that because he described me as having a rapier-like legal ability although I enjoyed that remark. He went through the various steps that are required to establish recklessness. All of them suggest a high degree of protection for the honest official who is doing his best in a targeted and sensible way. The Minister put that in the context of internet service providers. It is important to consider their position, but the thrust of the amendment is to deal with the issue of over-mighty authority. I am not suggesting that officials are over-mighty or overweening. By and large, one has the highest opinion of those involved in crime fighting. However, there are occasional lapses, some of which are accidents and some of which are the result of the wrong attitude. We have seen that in a range of cases over the years involving the investigation of crimes where the attitude-the culture-has not been right. We are anxious to provide some protection for the citizen while recognising the importance of the principle.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds has said, first, that, as regards the objective test for proving recklessness, the degree to which the courts will raise the hurdle is often based on the social importance of the operation concerned. The courts accept that crime fighting is the Government's highest duty and that, in order to exercise that duty, they need the power to intercept and to have the flexibility that the Bill provides. A high threshold is already required before a court official will say, ``Yes, this person was aware of the risk, it was an obvious risk and the person ignored it''. Secondly, my hon. Friend said, in the context of crime fighting, that the courts feel that the probability of risk is high. He also said that the concept of recklessness is useful in relation to offences of a regulatory nature because one of the mischiefs that it deals with is the official or authority that acts high-handedly. It is a unique protection for the citizen to have recklessness included. The third important point that my hon. Friend made is that the Government can sustain the present drafting only if they are prepared to countenance a situation in which reckless interceptors get away with it. If someone passes the big hurdle, in prosecution terms, of going beyond lawful authority and intercepting a communication-the first and second elements of the offence-and also acts recklessly, why should he be defended? Why not say that he should be guilty of an offence because he has done something that is wrong? Citizens should be protected from public officials who, recklessly intercept their communications without lawful authority.

<P>
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed made the point, which helps my arguement, that such an offence would be difficult to prove. We do not want hundreds of cases to come before the courts. I doubt whether there would be many instances of reckless interception if the offence were on the statute book. The guidance would advise people to be cautious and target interceptions. We want to encourage that climate. It is good that it would be difficult to prove the offence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I want flag up a matter that relates to clause 12. Interception involves the technological problems of packet switching. There could well be reckless intervention of technology to discover what is going on. Such matters will be challenged as we discuss the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The document that is being circulated by the Minister, much of which is confidential, shows that a high level of technical difficulty is invovled in achieving an interception capability, but I am confident that companies in the business will be cautious. They will not risk legal action or prosecution. The danger is, however, that when officials are-rightly-anxious to get at the evil people who ply some of the trades that we discussed on Second Reading, the broad powers may allow a culture to develop that goes beyond sensible, targeted interception, to one that routinely uses interception. I have outlined why we do not want that. It would have a declaratory effect. If there were an offence of reckless interception, the guidance of the bodies that exercise warrant would advocate caution.

<P>
Finally, the Minister mentioned clause 5(6). Although it is true that the words in paragraph (a) are belt and braces, they are belt and braces in the interests of the interceptor. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>all such conduct (including the interception of communications not identified by the warrant) as it is necessary to undertake in order to do what is expressly authorised or required by the warrant,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but the word ``necessary'' is not qualified. The person who operates the warrant does not need to apply a test to proportionality or to exercise reasonableness. Paragraph (a) allows him to do what is necessary to achieve the express authority in the warrant. If an official or an authority decides that to achieve the purpose of the warrant, it is necessary to intercept a vast number of communications in addition to those that are listed in the warrant, that would be permissable. The belt and braces are in the interests of the interceptor, not the possible victims of interception. That strengthens the case for the extra protection that is provided by the word ``recklessly''.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I have been listening carefully to my hon. Friend. When I studied the Bill, the same point occurred to me, but from a slightly different angle. The Secretary of State is under no obligation or duty, when issuing a warrant, to satisfy himself that it is proportional and necessary. Warrants will be issued on such vague terms as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purpose of safeguarding the economic well being of the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State should require convincing prima facie evidence to be advanced by the organisation requesting the warrant before he grants it. Will my hon. Friend reflect on the fact that a new clause might be needed that places an obligation on the Secretary of State to satisfy himself about the absolute necessity of issuing a warrant? That would be one way to deal with the odd official who overreaches or is reckless in demanding a warrant.

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> My right hon. Friend makes an important point. As he will have seen, amendments have been tabled in my name and that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) that are targeted on that issue. The Home Secretary has to satisfy himself about the matters in listed in clause 5, subsections (2) and (3), but subsection (3)(d) is wide. Those are certainly matters to which we shall return.

<P>
Despite the courteous attitude of the Minister, we feel that it is an important protection. We are not satisfied, and we shall press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
Question put, That the amendment be made:-

<P>
The Committee proceeded to a Division.

The Chairman's attention having been drawn to the fact that Mr. Paul Clark was present in the Room but had failed to vote due to a misunderstanding, he directed that the Division be commenced afresh.

</FONT><B>Mr. Maclean:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Will you reflect, in your capacity as Chairman, on the point that I made on Tuesday? [Laughter] I forecast that having sittings commencing at the crack of dawn would end in tears. We have seen the Government again in a complete shambles, although not the Minister, who has coped admirably with having to rise at the crack of dawn. Opposition Members and even myself, Sir, have been able to participate in the vote, but the Government, having got into a shambles as a result of holding meetings at odd times of the day and night on Thursday, have now got into another on the first Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. It should be taken into account in judging these matters that the Government now appear to have divisions on their own side which are forcing them-including the Minister-to sit in the Chamber until a quarter to 2 in the morning. If this becomes habitual, the Minister may want to reflect on whether he wishes to change the sittings motion.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister chooses not to respond. I am not sure that those were points of order, but I note that they are expressions of opinion. In the list of points of order, I am not sure that I asked for the doors to be unlocked, but they should be.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 6, leave out ``or implied''.

<P>
This is an important amendment, which deals with clause 1(3).

<P>
Subsection (3) creates a tort-a civil liability-of unlawful interception on a private telecommunications network if the interception takes place in the UK. Either the sender, the recipient or the intended recipient of the communication could bring an action. That would cover a situation where an employer unlawfully intercepted a telephone conversation with a third party, and either the third party or the employee may sue. It also has a wider resonance because it would deal with other situations where a private telecommunications network was subject to inteception. Clause 4(2) is designed to provide a possible defence where the interception is for the purpose of recording a business transaction or for a legitimate practice of business, which will be defined in regulations. As is usual with Bills that grant such wide ranging order-making powers, the negative resolution procedure will be used, so we do not have the opportunity to discuss this in Parliament.

<P>
The background to this subsection is the Alison Halford case. Members of the Committee will recall that the case of Halford and the United Kingdom was heard in the European Court of Human Rights and a landmark in this area of the law. Alison Halford, formerly assistant chief constable for Merseyside and now a Member of the Welsh Assembly, took her case to the European Court of Human Rights and argued that, in tapping her personal telephones at work and at home, the chief constable of Merseyside had infringed her rights under the European convention. The background is that in May 1983, Ms Halford had been appointed as an assistant chief constable with Merseyside, becoming the most senior woman police officer in the country. On eight occasions in the next seven years she applied unsuccessfully to be made deputy chief constable. According to her, the Home Office consistently withheld its approval for promotion on the recommendation of the chief constable of Merseyside.

<P>
Following a further refusal to promote her in February 1990, Alison Halford commenced proceedings on 4 June 1990 in the industrial tribunal against, among others, the chief constable of Merseyside and the Home Secretary. She claimed that she had been discriminated against on the grounds of sex. The hearing came before the industrial tribunal in June 1992. The issue that went before the European Court of Human rights concerned alleged breaches of the European convention in the gathering of the evidence for that industrial tribunal.

<P>
A key issue in the case was article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In addition, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The commission agreed that there had been a violation with respect to the interception of calls from Ms Halford's office telephones and further agreed, with regard to the case law, that telephone calls made from business premises as well as those made from the home could be covered by the notions of private life and correspondence in article 8.1.

<P>
The interception was held to constitute
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>interference by a public authority-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
within the meaning of article 8-with the exercise of Ms Halford's right to respect for her private life and correspondence. Article 8.2 further provides that any such interference with that right must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in accordance with the law.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The court held that the interference was not in accordance with the law for the purposes of the article, because domestic law did not adequately protect Ms Halford against interferences by the police with the right to respect for her private life and correspondence. With no clear evidence, the court did not, however, find that article 8 had been violated with respect to Ms Halford's home telephone calls.

<P>
It was also decided that Ms Halford was entitled to an effective domestic remedy as provided for in article 13 and that there had been a violation of that provision. The clause should be considered against that background, because it provides a remedy in cases of unlawful interception on a private telecommunications network, which would include an office telephone.

<P>
The amendment would narrow the subject matter of any action to interceptions by the controller of a private telecommunications system or a person acting with his express consent. Express consent is a clear concept in law. It must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>positive and evidenced by some words or actions. Mere acqueiscence is not enough.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The courts have upheld that definition numerous times.

<P>
The right of action under the clause arises from something wider than express consent and would therefore cover an instance in which it was not the person controlling the system or its use, but someone with that person's implied consent, who used the system to intercept. I have worries about the meaning of implied consent in this context. Would it cover the interception of a call by a person with permission to operate the system, perhaps by listening in to a telephone call or arranging to read e-mails? Alternatively, would it be necessary for the person with control of the operation of the system to be aware that the person with permission to operate it was using it for the purposes of interception? What would happen if the controller knew that person X was able to intercept for lawful purposes under clause 4(2) but nothing had ever been said about other calls and communications or what rules applied?

<P>
I can imagine facilities being provided for commercial discussions to be monitored and transactions recorded. That would be lawful under clause 4(2). What would happen if the person controlling the operation of the system was awawre that the facility was available, although nothing had been said about the system's other uses, and somebody went ahead and used it to intercept another call? What about the employee who is on a frolic of his own but can use the facility? Is silent acquiescence enough? If nothing had been said or done to show consent but the necessary facts were known, would consent be implied?

<P>
We must ask whether implied consent is sensible in that context. The term has been given numerous definitions over the years. The Minister spoke about problems in defining recklessness, but I did not agree with his remarks, as the courts have been considering it for donkey's years. Is he happy about the meaning of implied consent? Are we happy that we know what it means, and will it not lead to trouble?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will my hon. Friend draw on his extensive legal knowledge to tell us about case law in respect of implied consent, for the benefit of Opposition Members and the Minister?

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Funnily enough, I can do so. The term has been considered several times over the years. As far as I can see, it first arose in relation to consent to marriage. In the 19th century, when youngsters required permission to marry at an extraordinarily early age, many cases hinged on expressed and implied consent, and the latter was held to be satisfactory for marriage. I could refer to a number of cases in which substantial consent was the primary consideration. In the 19th century, it was held in the case of Smith, 44 Chancery division 654-

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> What about the internet?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> This slightly predates the internet.

<P>
It was held in the case that, where no formalities were prescribed, consent would be implied if the persons whose consent was required expressed no disapproval of the marriage and induced it by their conduct. In other words, if one remained silent in the face of a couple who wished to marry, one could induce the marriage and give implied consent.

<P>
The matter arose slightly earlier in the Debtors Imprisonment Act 1758. A ``free and voluntary consent'' was necessary to authorise a sheriff to carry a debtor to a tavern. The consent had to be active, as distinguished from that which is said to be implied by silence. In the case of Dewhurst v. Pearson, 2 LJ Exchequer reports 143, it was held that implied consent was not enough to express a debtor's agreement to accompany the sheriff. The debtor had not said anything, perhaps because he was drunk or had been banged over the head.

<P>
Other such cases have arisen. Mere silent acquiescence by a lessor in respect of a trade forbidden by a lease does not imply consent. Silent acquiescence in such cases was always held not to imply consent. However, section 23 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 ensured that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mere acquiescence in a change of user to business use does not amount to ``consent'' within the meaning of this section. 
<P>
``Consent'' requires a positive affirmative act such as written or oral acceptance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
Obviously, numerous cases have involved implied consents, but I should like to know what the Minister is getting at with that right of action. Can he give me an example of someone who would have implied consent? Is he thinking about a situation which a parent is on the telephone and a child listens in to the call? Would that constitute implied consent, because of the relationship and the fact that the parent might not object? Could it apply when a spouse, for example, listens in to a telephone call at home?

<P>
The matter becomes more difficult in a business context. Various authorities are given to people to use equipment in business. It is impossible for managers to supervise every call, unless they do so electronically. We would not want businesses to be imposed with the burden of checking calls. Given the Halford case, it is doubtful whether that could be done. We would not want businesses to be sued because of such a vague definition. However, the Minister may be able to refer to recent cases that have cleared the confusion, as a result of which implied consent is straightforward.

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): People are interested in the Bill, because call centres are used increasingly in our environment. More people are covered by private telecommunications networks that will require monitoring and they want a legal framework established for such a system. The amendment concerns people being subject to a criminal offence for having intercepted calls as set out in subsection (2) or when individuals whose calls have been intercepted have recourse to a civil tort under subsection (3). We are discussing the boundaries between the two provisions. Let us consider a call centre, the senior management of which has, under subsection (6),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a right to control the operation or the use of the system,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and when other people in that call centre monitor one in every 10 business telephone calls as part of regular practice.

<P>
Will the Minister say what contractual arrangements would be required for the call centre to fall within the scope of subsection (6) under the ``express or implied consent'' provision? If the amendment were accepted, how would the provision of only ``express consent'' affect the operation of such businesses in which several people are carrying out legitimate monitoring? It would be nonsense for people to be subject to criminal penalties when they are undertaking such action as part of a business. Someone who hacks into the system and intercepts calls with no authority should be subject to the criminal law under subsection (2), but those who carry out such activities as part of their business should not.

<P>
If we narrow the definition of responsibility, we may harm the interests of those whose calls are being intercepted because they will no longer have recourse under subsection (3) to the civil tort taken against the individual, because the business could argue that there was no express consent. What are the Minister's views about that? Without the implied consent provision, the business could disclaim responsibility for the interceptions that had taken place. If that were the case, and the criminal penalty under subsection (2) also failed, the individual whose calls were intercepted could lose out. We do not want that to happen because individuals who work in a telecommunications environment need to have clear framework of law in which they can defend their interests against either an intercepted telephone call, or the inappropriate use of calls that may be part of a general working pattern and are authorised by the owner of the system.

<P>
To what degree does the Minister think that there may be an impact on business, in terms of changing the access that must be provided to individuals in the workplace? Due to such provisions and some cases under the European convention on human rights, call centres are already installing pay phones in obvious places. They acknowledge that the individual must have access to private telephone lines due to the monitoring of business lines. What might the impact of provisions about ``express or implied consent'' be on the provision of telephone lines for private use, especially within call centres?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> We have had a helpful discussion, as well as an interesting historical discourse from the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. The amendment would be effective only through a further amendment to clause 1(6). It would extend the criminal offence of unlawful interception and restrict the circumstances in which an individual could bring a civil action against a person intercepting on a private telecommunications system.

<P>
The comments made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) were to the point. People with ``implied consent'' can get out of the criminal offence and be dealt with under civil liability instead. We have to discuss the borders of definitions such as ``implied consent''; the amendment would criminalise the activities of those believe that they have implied consent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Why? Our amendment to subsection (3) simply defines the tort. It does not have any effect on the criminal exemption.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's point about the problem of defining ``implied consent'' in a moment. The concept of ``implied consent'' would move activities about which there are complaints from criminal to civil law. That is the key purpose of the phrase in this context. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will reflect on that.

<P>
We are keen not to criminalise a vast range of activities that are carried out routinely in offices and homes. The first example that I intended to give-that of a teenage child listening to a parent's telephone call on an extension in the family home without the parent's knowledge or express permission-has already been used. We would not want to criminalise such activity, but the amendment would have that effect unless the child had been given express consent to listen. Such an action would become criminal rather than civil. The Bill gives the child the additional defence of ``implied consent'', so in the unlikely circumstances of the parent taking action against the child on civil grounds, that would be confined to civil rather than criminal courts.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> In that example, it is likely that the other person involved in the call would be less happy than the parent. How is the consent implied in those circumstances? The teenager would surely have no defence if the parent had not agreed to his listening in.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall talk more generally about implied consent in a moment. The example that I was going to give-in each case implied consent will be judged by the courts on the facts of any given circumstance-concerned a postman. If a postman delivers a letter, he has implied, though not express, consent to walk up to the front door so that he is not trespassing. Similarly, a teenage child could resonably claim that he had the implied consent of his or her parents to listen in to a phone call. That would be a defence, even though no express consent had been given-for example, by someone saying that a certain phone call could be listened in to in a particular circumstance. That is why we drew the clause as we did. We were concerned, both in the domestic area-about which the hon. Gentleman is as concerned as we are; I am not suggesting any difference of motivation-or, to give the examples mentioned by the hon. Member for Hallam, in business, to prevent a series of communications being criminalized. That was the intention.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
A similar situation would occur when a person makes use of an answerphone to record a telephone conversation, without the caller's knowledge and without the express consent of the person in whose name the phone line is registered. That recording would constitute a criminal offence if it were made available to someone else. While it is right that an aggrieved caller should have a civil right of redress against the person making the recording, to make recording a call within the confines of a person's own home a criminal offence seems disproportionate.

<P>
I should take this opportunity to say something about the word ``disproportionate''. A great deal of our discussion is and has to be about proportionality of offences in different circumstances, and the judgments all of us in this Committee have to make in relation to the different issues with which we have to deal. The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire raised the Halford case, which has been a difficult one which has run on over a period. The amendment would make it harder for someone, such as Alison Halford, to bring a civil action. She would have to show that the police officer tapping her phone had the express consent of the chief constable. That might be a great deal more difficult for her to demonstrate than the situation that we are talking about, which would at least give her civil redress in those circumstances because the implied consent gave her more possibilities.

<P>
Similar considerations come into effect when we consider the arguments put by the hon. Member for Hallam. In precisely the way that I was trying to describe, a series of issues arises on the balance between criminal and civil activity. We do not want a range of reasonably routine activities-whether in call centres or in other types of businesses-to be brought within criminal law rather than be subject to civil actions. I have a number of call centres in my constituency-major financial institutions-which operate according to fantastically strict guidelines as a result of financial services regulation due to mis-selling, and so on. No issues arise from that, but we want to be absolutely sure that we are not criminalising activities unnecessarily. That is why we have put in the clause.

<P>
I hope that I have responded properly to the amendment, which was tabled to clarify the situation and to protect people's liberties, rather than for any other reason. I shall be interested to see how the hon. Gentleman responds. I hope that he will seek leave to withdraw his amendment because it would have some effects that I do not think he had intended in moving it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I should like to tempt the Minister to comment a little more on that. Subsection (3) creates the tort of interception of a communication on a private telecommunications system. It is freestanding, and that is its purpose. It is true that subsection (6) has a different purpose, which is to exempt certain categories of conduct from criminal liability under subsection (2). However, it is legitimate to debate whether the words ``express or implied consent'' are a useful description. One could equally have the word ``consent'' on its own. It is difficult to know what ``implied consent'' means as a matter of law. I may be wrong, but nothing that the Minister has said encourages me to think that I am.

<P>
We are told that a person whose teenage child listens in to his telephone calls has given implied consent for that. Is that because the child is a minor, or for some other reason? Is there some implication of law that children are entitled to use their parents' telephones in that way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The consent is not given because the child is a minor but because he or she is a family member; that is the implication.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Obviously, we all give our children permission to use the telephone and we would be in terrible trouble if we did not. My 14-year-old daughter would never let me hear the end of it. However, I do not give her permission to listen in to my calls when I ring my friends, the bank manager or my Whip, because those conversations are often difficult and personal-although not in the case of those with my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff), the Whip.

<P>
Is the Minister saying that simply because we give people-our children, for example-permission to use the system, we give them implied consent to listen in to other people's calls? That is a worrying idea. Let us imagine that one colleague in a workplace, when transferring a call, can leave the line open and listen in to the conversation of another. I do not believe that most employers would consent to listening in; they would consent to people using the system. If there is a call to a Minister's office, the civil servant may listen in, for obvious reasons, but that is an example of limited consent. It would not extend to listening in to the Minister's calls to his wife.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> Or his Whip.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Or his Whip-although I am sure that the Minister is well in with his Whips after last night. Can he help? Is it right that an implied consent to intercept is given with permission to use the system?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I do not think that there is the magic about implied consent that the hon. Gentleman suggests-I am not suggesting that he is casting spells. It is simply a question of fact. Express consent implies the direct decision to communicate in some form an express, explicit consent to an act taking place. Implied consent is consent that has not been put into words, and so is a question not of law but of fact. Of course, that would be interpreted in the courts in any judgment of any fact or circumstance.

<P>
I will take the examples that the hon. Gentleman has given. Let us imagine that his teenage daughter listened in to a conversation with his Whip, and that the conversation was not so shocking that she felt obliged to put the phone down immediately because she was deeply disturbed to discover things about her father that she had not previously realised. If the issue arose, would he want it to be considered in the criminal arena or in the civil arena? If the phrase specified only ``express'' consent, even a small case of that type would be considered in the criminal arena. If the Government's words are allowed to stand, the case could be considered in the civil arena.

<P>
I cannot help more than I have done. The purpose of the wording in the clause is to prevent a wide range of conversations and different types of listening in that take place in the home or in a business environment from being brought into the criminal arena. Our intention is to introduce a limitation in that regard. I see from the hon. Gentleman's expression that I have not entirely satisfied him, but I cannot add much more to what I said about our motivation for choosing that wording.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Minister has worried me even more by those remarks. The amendment was not intended for subsection (6), but under that subsection, exclusion from the criminal arena similarly occurs in circumstances where there is implied consent-which means, for example, where my daughter uses my telephone to do something with which I do not agree, or a police officer, as in the Halford case, does something with which the chief constable disagrees. I do not understand how ``implied consent'' is involved in such situations. Consent always means agreement; if it is expressed, words are used, orally or in writing. One must base the assumption that consent is implied on something concrete-one cannot have a principle of agreement where the person does not agree.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman has pointed to a genuine difficulty. Implied consent would be given, for example, by someone working in a call centre who is told that he or she must monitor calls as part of the job, but that requirement is not written down. It would be reasonable for such monitoring to fall outside criminal sanctions. Where someone has not agreed, as in the example of a child using the telephone, the implied consent provision does not apply. Consent cannot be said to have been given unless there had been some verbal exchange along the lines that the person is happy for the extension to be picked up when he or she is on the phone.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes the point well. Tort is a different issue. That is a question of whether the chief constable of Merseyside, for example, could be sued for something that one of his officers had done but to which he did not consent. From what the Minister said, it seems that if a police officer, in the Halford case, for example, listened in to the phone calls of someone whom he or she did not like and passed the information to solicitors acting for the chief constable, in a private operation, the chief constable could be sued. It is hard to see why, if he had not agreed to the operation. Consent, whether expressed or implied, must surely mean agreement. If it does not, that is a pretty poor do.

<P>
The Minister said that he will ponder those matters and we will not press the amendment to a Division. We may have to return to the matter unless further thought is given to it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 2, line 48, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the interception is in accordance with provisions of regulations made under section 4(2) with the object of ensuring that the senders and recipients of such communications are made aware of the purposes for which, and the circumstances in which, those communications may be intercepted.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 58, in clause 4, page 6, line 33, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the regulations must include such provisions as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for attaining the object defined in section 1(6)(b).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendment again explores where criminal sanctions cease to apply to interception on a private telecommunications network. The background is the Halford case. I shall not go over that again as it has been covered. We are particularly interested in a key aspect of the judgment in that case, which states that interference with article 8 rights-the crucial rights at stake in the case, relating to respect for the privacy of private and family life, home and correspondence-is permissible if it is prescribed by law.

<P>
The amendments attempt to clarify the way in which legal authority is given to the interference with article 8 privacy rights. We are pleased that the need for a broad legal framework for the privacy rights of people using private telecommunication networks is accepted, but we are concerned about the point at which an individual whose communications are intercepted engages in that process. At present, there is no requirement for an explicit undertaking to prove that an individual has consented or is aware that he or she will be monitored-I am thinking in particular of call centre environments, in which individuals will be monitored. Most people will accept that as a necessary part of the work, but under the framework they may not be required to give their consent or to show their awareness of such monitoring in a legal document.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We examined the clause 4 provisions that relate to amendment No. 58, and noticed that regulations will be made on the type of communications that may be intercepted. We felt that it would be appropriate to try to intervene, although I recognise that the amendments approach the issue from two angles. Amendment No. 57 is about prescribing the limits of the criminal sanction and ensuring that senders and recipients of communications are made aware of monitoring. That is good practice and most people are now informed that their calls may be monitored. However, that approach has no legal basis, and we want it to have one following the findings in the Halford case and the general provisions of ECHR article 8. Regulations that authorise certain calls could cover that. We could move from a good practice model of telling people calling in, ``Your calls may be monitored'' and people working in the call centre, ``We will monitor your calls'', to a statutory system.

<P>
I recognise that the wording and the approach may not be entirely to the Minister's satisfaction, but I hope that he will give us an idea of what it would be acceptable to tell a caller and a recipient of communications from a call centre. What would satisfy the requirements of ECHR article 8? Are regulations the best method, or are there alternatives? The Minister must ensure that an individual who works in a call centre cannot say in court, ``Well, I may have been told this and I may have been told that, but it wasn't prescribed by law so it fell out with the judgment made by the European Court of Human Rights.''

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Again, I appreciate the spirit of the amendments. The intention in the Bill is to deal with the implications of the Halford case and ensure that there is a proper legal basis. Perhaps I have not yet emphasised that it is a key task of the Bill to ensure that we comply with the European convention on human rights provisions in the Human Rights Act 1998, when it comes into effect in October.

<P>
As the hon. Gentleman suggested, amendment No. 57 would mean that an interception on a private telecommunications system could be lawful only if it complied with a stipulation in the lawful business practice regulations under clause 4(2) that any person whose communications may be intercepted is made aware of when that might happen. Amendment No. 58 would insert such a stipulation into the regulations.

<P>
The amendments would require anyone monitoring a private network to ensure that every person who might be monitored was made aware of the purpose for which, and circumstances in which, that might happen. The Government are as keen as anyone to ensure that the privacy of the individual is protected; hence clause 1(3), which enables a civil action to be brought against anyone who intercepts on a private network. A key driver for the legislation is the idea that such interception should be in accordance with the law.

<P>
The lawful business practice regulations will govern the actions of businesses and public authorities when they monitor calls to the switchboard or staff communications. They will contain the stipulation that businesses should make every reasonable effort to inform parties to any communications that monitoring may take place. As the hon. Member for Hallam said, such practice is becoming more general. The Bill and the regulations that will be passed under it will ensure that that is increasingly the case.

<P>
However, applying those regulations to the general public is a different and difficult matter. In the example that we discussed about teenage children, the amendments could place a legal obligation on all parents to inform every person who called on the telephone that their child might pick up a second phone in the home. I realise that that is not the intention of the hon. Member for Hallam, but such a requirement is onerous: it is neither reasonable nor realistic. Such communications are already protected by the civil action provision in clause 1(3).

<P>
We have sought to set a clear legal basis throughout the Bill without imposing onerous requirements on the people who operate telephone systems. We believe that the business regulations will provide the framework to establish what the hon. Gentleman wishes to achieve. There is already a stipulation that businesses make every reasonable effort to inform parties to any communication that monitoring may take place, which provides the necessary protections without establishing a system that is so onerous that it becomes impossible to handle the population as a whole. That is why we resist the amendment, but if the hon. Gentleman feels that I have not dealt adequately with all his concerns, I would be prepared to consider further how best to draft the regulations in order to meet them. We share the same motive.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I share the concerns outlined by the Minister, although I agree with the point that the hon. Member for Hallam makes. If monitoring is likely, it is right for the other business user to be made aware of it. What worries me about the amendment is that the subsection deals with exempting individuals from criminal liability. If, as a result of a mistake, inadvertence or recklessness, the warning were not given, the person concerned could be moved up into the criminal category, which would be wrong. The mischiefs of clause 1 are unlawful and intentional interceptions taking place without any malpurpose. If the exercise were done for statistical reasons in order to track a business transaction and, for some reason, the warning had not been given, it would be draconian to move up from the category of civil liability into criminal liability. That is my concern about the business arena.

<P>
As to the effect on individuals, I take the Minister's point. It would be difficult to insist on carrying out the proposals in all circumstances. At the workplace, for example, private calls are often made and it is conceivable that another employee could use the equipment to listen in. In the domestic context, it becomes even more difficult. Youngsters may have permission to listen to their parents' telephone calls, which amounts to consent. Requiring them to give warnings under regulations that are, frankly, framed for the business sector is too difficult. I therefore share the Minister's concerns, while agreeing with the basis point of the hon. Member for Hallam.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I was pleased with the Minister's response, which I had hoped to draw out through the amendments. Whenever Bills include commitments to make regulations, it causes difficulties when they cannot be put before the Committee during debates. I hope that the Minister will be able to supply us with at least a draft as soon as possible, so that we can see how the regulations will deal with the problem before the Committee finishes.

<P>
The Minister suggested the phrase ``reasonable efforts'' as appropriate for demonstrating that someone tried to create awareness that a call would be monitored. Such phrases will be useful to those who want to ensure that the matter is taken seriously: nobody must be allowed to get away with monitoring telephone calls because the provisions in the regulations are not strong enough.

<P>
The Minister also mentioned domestic telephones. The more we go into the matter, the more I am tempted to think that the Bill should exclude the domestic enviornment, because it is incredibly complex, although much of what is proposed is reasonable in a business context. It is difficult to frame legislation to cover both places. People do not want to take up court cases involving their 14-year-old children, but they may want to bring a serious case against their employer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked about the regulations. The exercise is being conducted by the Dept. of Trade and Industry, which has some expertise in the matter. I cannot make a formal commitment, but I hope that the draft regulations will be available before the summer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's additional clarification. I am reasonably confident that the regulations will put good practice on a statutory footing, which is what we want. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Clause 1(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>-Where the United Kingdom is a party to an international agreement which-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) relates to the provision of mutual assistance in connection with, or in the form of, the interception of communications,

<P>
(b) requires the issue of a warrant, order or equivalent instrument in cases in which assistance is given, and

<P>
(c) is designated for the purposes of this subsection by an order made by the Secretary of State,
<P>
it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to secure that no request for assistance in accordance with the agreement is made on behalf of a person in the United Kingdom to the competent authorities of<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
-another-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>country.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I understand that the background to that provision
 is that the Government, and the previous Administration, have been involved in negotiations in Europe on a draft convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the member states of the European Union. The notes on clauses state that there are no similar agreements currently under negotiation but the subsection provides some flexibility for the future. It also mentions the Secretary of State's duty to ensure that no request for mutual assistance is made without lawful authority in accordance with subsection (5).

<P>
I recently asked the Minister a written question about the negoitiation on the draft European convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters. He explained in his reply that it has been under negotiation since 1996 and that its broad purpose is to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>enhance existing arrangements for co-operation between member states' judicial and prosecuting authorities for the purposes of criminal investigations and proceedings. The negotiations have been complicated, and, throughout, the Scrutiny Committees of both Houses have been kept fully informed  Although a number of specific provisions have cleared scrutiny, the Convention itself remains subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Work has continued to agree outstanding matters and  the opinion of the European Parliament  has now been issued, and is to be considered  at the Council meeting on 27 March 2000, an attempt should be made to complete work on the Convention. My officials will remain in contact with the scrutiny committees.-[Official Report, House of Commons, 22 February 2000; Vol. 344, c.866W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That answer, on 22 February, was obviously tabled in contemplation of the fact that the Committee would consider such matters.

<P>
The provision on mutual assistance appears in many of the early clauses. It would help our consideration of clause 1, and our understanding of this part of the Bill, if the Minister explained more fully what the mutual assistance draft convention is likely to say on the subject of interception. We should like to know how it interrelates so that we have some idea of the burdens or obligations on Britain and what rights we are giving to our European partners. Although I do not oppose clause stand part, I hope that the Minister will explain the background to the proposal.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am happy to do so. I hope that you will allow me to answer the hon. Gentleman's reasonable question fully, Mr. O'Hara, because it relates to the Bill and it is incumbent on me to set out the position in as much detail as I can.

<P>
Member states of the European Union are currently negotiating a draft convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters. The draft convention is intended to improve co-operation in the fight against serious and organised crime by improving procedures for mutual legal assistance. Whatever the pro or anti-European positions taken in the House or elsewhere, that aspiration is widely shared.

<P>
The convention lays down that, in general, assistance should be provided in accordance with the procedural requirements of the requesting member state, whereas the current presumption is that the law of the requested member state shall prevail. The convention will also provide a basis for co-operation in the use of modern methods of investigation-for example, controlled deliveries and the use of modern technology such as hearings by live video link and interception telecommunications.

<P>
The interception provisions that are part of the convention were originally intended to ensure that law enforcement agencies will have the capability to intercept satellite telephone calls on the intercepting member state's own territory. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that communications whistle around between countries and jurisdictions in a complicated way these days.

<P>
The draft convention, which is now being discussed, provides two ways of achieving that. The first, under article 16, is by making a request for technical assistance to the member state with the satellite ground station, wherever it is. The requested member state is under an obligation to comply with such requests provided that it is satisfied that an interception warrant has been issued by the requesting member state. Legal authority for that is set out in section 1(4)(C) of the convention. The second way is by ensuring that member states allow satellite operators to provide intercept capability using service providers based on the territory of the intercepting member state. This is set out in article 17 of the draft convention.

<P>
The draft convention was subsequently extended-although not at the request of the United Kingdom-to provide a framework for member states to request the interception of communications of a target located on the territory of another member state. Most member states, although not the UK, already make such requests under existing mutual legal assistance arrangements. I can tell the hon. Gentleman, pursuant to my answer to him of 22 February, that the current, Portuguese, presidency of the EU anticipates reaching political agreement on the convention at the Justice and Home Affairs Council this month. However, the convention will enter into law only when eight member states have ratified it-something that is likely to take at least another two to three years. I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman clarification for which he asked. I am sorry, Mr.O'Hara, to have done so at such length, but I thought it important to answer the hon. Gentleman fully.

<P>
As to possible wider uses, although, as the hon. Gentleman said, from the guidance notes it appears that no similar agreements are currently under negotiation, the subsection will provide flexibility for the future. I can only mention a meeting of the G8 summit on organised crime that I attended on the Government's behalf in Moscow last September at which there was substantial discussion amongst members including the Americans, Canadians, Japanese and others who obviously are not associated with the EU on ways of improving our co-operation, especially on issues such as money laundering, and so on. We are not at the stage of negotiating agreements but I hope that we shall be able to bring about better agreements on these issues simply because crime is now organised at such a sophisticated level internationally, as the hon. Gentleman understands.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Minister explained that an interception warrant would have to be granted by the member state which requested the communication to be intercepted, instead of the existing system being used. Is there some convention, agreement or protocol that deals with the matter of the terms and conditions under which warrants are to be issued? One has only to study the Bill to see that we have a fairly structured regime, although I would argue that in some ways it is too wide. Do other European countries have a similar structure, or is there an intention to reach agreement on one? Are meetings being held? Is the Minister satisfied with these aspects?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> As I understand it, we have to be satisfied that an interception warrant has been issued by the requesting member state. As the hon. Gentleman implied, the legal systems and the means by which such warrants are issued are different in each of the member states. We are not yet at a stage-nor will we be for some time-where anybody is suggesting that we have a uniform system across countries with their different areas. One reason for the third pillar in the EU is to respect different legal systems and not to try to create a supranational legal structure.

<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, everyone needs to be satisfied with the integrity of the warranting process, as he described it. That is a central part of the discussions that are taking place, but as I am not the Home Office Minister responsible for conducting them, I cannot give the detailed answer that he would like. However, I will write to him to set out how the convention is looking at the question of the integrity of the warranting process in the different countries concerned, if that would help.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I would be grateful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The clause replicates the offence of unlawful interception contained in the Interception of Communications Act 1985 and extends it to private networks to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Halford v. UK, to which I referred earlier. I am glad that we have had such a good discussion on the various points raised.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Meaning and location of ``interception'' etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 4, line 5, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Secretary of State may by order provide for a further definition of the words-``a substantial section of, the public in any one or more parts of the United Kingdom.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is designed to allow the Minister to explain a little more about the definitions of telecommunications systems and services. Clause 2 defines a public postal service as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any postal service which is offered or provided to, or to a substantial section of, the public in any one or more parts of the United Kingdom;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It defines ``public telecommunications service'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any telecommunications service which is offered or provided to, or to a substantial section of, the public in any one or more parts of the United Kingdom;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
These are important provisions because people such as members of the Internet Services Providers Association believe that there is a certain amount of doubt about exactly what they mean. The amendment says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may by order provide for a further definition of the words-``a substantial section of, the public in any one or more parts of the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in the future by regulation. Uniquely, we do not seek that that should be done under the affirmative resolution procedure.

<P>
The Internet Services Providers Association makes the point that the definitions in clause 2(1) do not clarify whether internet services that are either a) only offered to a restricted section of the public or b) only open to private members, would be regarded as public systems. For example, would JANET servers that carry all traffic from UK universities be considered to be a public system? The association suggests that the Bill include a definition of publicly available telecommunications services-PATS-that is in the interconnection directive at paragraph 1.16:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a PATS service is one which is available to any user who is prepared to pay the price offered and abide by any applicable terms and conditions. A PATS service may be of interest only to a particular type of end user, as long as any end user who could use the service is eligible to do so. Services available only to closed user groups or on an individual contract basis cannot be said to be publicly available.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
According to the understood definition, which is different from that in the Bill, some services available to ``the public'', even the public sector, could fail the new test. The situations that the Internet Services Providers Association has mentioned to ask whether they involve
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a substantial section of, the public<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
include the provision of parental or local community access to the internet at a school in a community on a particular evening.

<P>
The association also asks what the position would be where a hotel, exhibition or conference centre offers internet access in private hotel rooms, or only to exhibitors at and visitors to an exhibition. Those are public events, but the ability to surf the web is restricted in that it may be only from an exhibitor's stand. Is that the provision of a telecommunications service and, if not, why not? Arguably, a substantial part of the public is involved. If a conference is for invited guests only, is the network private that day but public during a different event the next day? How many days a year could a network give access to the public and yet retain private status? Would a corporate network suddenly become public if it placed a kiosk in the lobby for visitors to surf the web while they waited? What if such a corporate activity went further and ran a cybercaf that was co-located to its premises and which used the same system?

<P>
Those are the points that the Internet Services Providers Association has raised with me. It occurs to me that the wording
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a substantial section of, the public<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is quite a difficult one. I thought of ways in which one might amend it, perhaps by specifying a number of individuals on the face of the Bill. That, too, has its difficulties. I wondered whether it was necessary to say ``substantial'' at all and whether one might simply say that, if the system was available to ``a section of, the public'', it was a public system. I can envisage some difficulties with that because that might mean that the threshold was too low.

<P>
It is difficult to see how the wording could be amended, but the association does seem to be making some points that the Minister might care to answer. It is obviously very worried.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Can the Minister give us examples from existing statutes of the use of the wording
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a substantial section of, the public in any one or more parts of the United Kingdom,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not necessarily in relation to telecommunications or commerce? That would help to elucidate for the Committee, humble seekers after truth that we are, what it might actually mean. In the absence of some precedent in statute, I am forced down the route that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire was forced down in asking whether perhaps there should be some numerical test. He gave excellent examples, particularly in relation to exhibitor stands that may be open to the public for only a certain number of days of the year, and to invited guests only. In light of my hon. Friend's questions, and of the failure to enumerate on the face of the Bill a number of people or a percentage of the population, it would be helpful to know the precedent in statute for using the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a substantial section of the public in any one or more parts of the United Kingdom<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or simply
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a substantial section of the public.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The amendment is extremely well motivated and it would provide flexibility in future. It is always difficult to draft legislation in rapidly changing technological circumstances. I entirely appreciate the spirit in which the amendment was tabled, especially as this is a difficult matter. However, I do not accept the suggestion that the phrase used is insufficiently clear and self-explanatory: it means that the service must be available to more than just a few people, but that it need not be available to everyone. For example, a service might be available to everyone with access to cable, or to everyone who can afford it.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked about similar definitions. The phrase is used in, for example, section 40 of the National Parks and Access to Countryside Act 1949, and section 26 of the Highways Act 1980. The courts are familiar with the phrase: for example, it is used in charities law and in coroners' cases. I am advised, extraordinary though it seems, that the definition has been used to determine whether, for the purposes of the Copyright Act 1911, a boat-shaped drawing room suite with spindle legs was artistic or merely vulgar.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I thank the Minister for that reply. Will he give examples of how the courts interpret the phrase under those statutes? What percentage of the population is used? Are we talking about 51 or 75 per cent? Perhaps he could elucidate the case law.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I cannot do so now, but I shall consider how I can answer those questions more specifically. As the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire has said, it is difficult to envisage how any other definition, other than the phrase that we have used, would operate. The phrase can be used because it already exists in statute-albeit, in relation to historic circumstances that do not apply to internet service providers today-and because the courts have experience of such definitions. Any alternative-say, specifying 51 or 75 per cent., as suggested by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmund-would be too rigid.

<P>
The phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a substantial section of the public<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is self-explanatory and sufficiently flexible to allow the law to evolve. It is a tradition in this country that the law evovles to meet changing circumstance. I am loath to cause confusion by agreeing to the possibility of the Secretary of State making further orders, although I acknowledge that, as the hon. Member for North-Hertfordshire said when moving the amendment, the intention is to enable the Secretary of State, rather than the courts, to update the law on such matters as circumstances change. I am confident that the courts' interpretation of the phrase will provide the flexibility needed to allow the law to develop as we would wish. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Again, I should like to tempt the Minister to go a little further. Obviously, the phrase ``a substantial part'' does not necessarily mean 50 per cent. In fact, it is likely to refer to less than that. If more than 50 per cent. were being referred to, a different phrase would be used, such as ``most'' or ``a majority''. Therefore we are considering a group of people, but less than half the public. That is what causes concern.

<P>
With legislation on access to the countryside, it does not matter what the number is, because the issue is whether the public can visit a certain place. The aim is not to calibrate something so that people can judge whether it is a telecommunications system, as in this case, or something equally complex. To decide what is a piece of contryside is relatively simple, provided that one knows that a substantial body-the public-has to have access to it.

<P>
With something like this, problems arise, I gave examples of community access to the internet at a school one evening a week. That is quite important; all over the United Kingdom community colleges and schools are offering members of the public access to the internet in the evening. They need to know whether they are operating a public telecommunications system. If they are, the Bill places burdens on them. I hope the Minister will clarify some of the obvious examples that will arise, such as hotels that are running conferences and offering facilities to visitors. Internet services in every room are becoming the norm. We need to know whether that is a public system, because of the duties that the Bill imposes on public systems.

<P>
Similarly, if corporate networks, which can be substantial, decide to provide a cybercaf or other system located on site-or off site and switched in-they need to know whether it is a public system. The Minister says that it is clear, but I am not sure that it is. Although the expression has previously been used in law, it has been used in different circumstances. If ISPA, which is one of the two main bodies in the the internet-and one of the two main bodies which the Government are treating as top-line consultees on the technical aspects of the Bill, and which are not likely to be ignored-is saying that these practical issues need to be addressed, it is not enough for the Minister to say,``That's all very well, but the law has looked at it before and it's pretty obvious''-or words to that effect. The Minister needs to give us more detail. I invite him to do so, or we shall not be satisfied.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> As I said before, I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman made his points. I take the point that he made about the importance of ISPA and the dialogue that we are having. The hon. Gentleman knows that under clause 12-and I am preparing myself to deal with it when we discuss that clause-the Secretary of State wil impose obligations on persons providing public telecommunications services. It is not the Government's intention to impose them on providers with only a few customers or an extremely limited reach. To take the example of hotels, my off-the-cuff view is that it would not be our intention to cover them in the way that the hon. Gentleman described. The notices will take effect only when individual notice is served under clause 12.

<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will discuss his points on clause 12 with ISPA directly to find out whether we can get greater clarity and satisfy him more fully. My only hesitation concerns whether the power which he suggests should be given to the Secretary of State will help to solve the problem. Although not obvious, the phrase is there, and it is possible for the matter to be dealt with in the way that we describe. I take his point about the need for further dialogue, however, and assure him that we will have it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I may have missed it, but the specific question relating to parental and local community access to the internet at a school on a specific day-not 365 days a year on a monthly or weekly basis-which is a potent example and relevant to many of our constituents, is whether the Minister believes that that would constitute access to the public.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> As I said, my off-the-cuff view of these examples is that they would not be covered, because they would not be substantial. I shall not commit myself to that, but I have given the hon. Gentleman an assurance.
