<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000397"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> It is a pleasure to be here with you,
Mr. Amess. As I walked towards Westminster this sunny
morning, I was delighted to know that I would be spending it in
Committee discussing the Bill, and I am sure that all hon. Members feel
that way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div><a name="0906177000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The former
Secretary of State referred to getting the architecture right in
introducing the Bill, and many people in the real world will feel that
we have not got it right. A regular gripe when considering the
south-west regional spatial strategy&#151;the one with which I am
most familiar, for obvious reasons&#151;is that the region does not
make sense and that attempts to come up with strategies across an area
as geographically large and economically diverse as the south-west is
not necessarily the way forward. The approach has been to identify
sub-regional areas within that and to develop them.</div>
<a name="0906177000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been my
view and that of many people across the south-west&#151;I am sure
that the situation will be similar in other regions&#151;that regions
that were set up back in the 1980s for various purposes, including
Government purposes, might not necessarily be the right way to proceed.
Therefore, regional development agencies that operate along those
boundaries might not be the right way to go. The amendments tabled in
my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne
seek to promote a debate about whether those regions are the right way
to proceed. They also seek to put in place procedures that would
stimulate that discussion and enable principally local authorities, in
consultation with their communities, to come up with suggestions about
what the natural regions really are. We might therefore have RDAs that
mirror those natural regions, as well as reflecting Government
arrangements.</div><a name="0906177000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
the failure of the north-east referendum to convince people that
elected regional authorities are the way to go&#151;certainly in that
part of the country&#151;we have been in a limbo state in which RDAs
and regional assemblies have muddled along, trying to persuade people
that they have the authority to take important decisions for the
regions that have been constructed for them. It is fair to say that
that approach has been greatly criticised.</div>
<a name="0906177000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill gives
us the opportunity to build a new regional policy, to look at the
current boundaries and decide whether they are correct, and to put in
place a mechanism for opening up debate and allowing it to move
forward.</div>
<a name="0906177000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906177000398"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con): This is an extremely
important clause because it encapsulates, in the opinion of Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition, the missed opportunity and failure of
imagination arising from the sub-national review of July 2007.
Ostensibly, the clause is about sustainable economic growth and land
use. However, it is also about the Government&#146;s attitude
towards, and their relationship with, local authorities and locally
elected people, and the question of whether the Government trust them
with the authority and autonomy to make decisions in their own
areas.</div>
<a name="0906177000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are clear
that we cannot support the clause and will be making the case strongly
that it is unnecessary. It was apparent from the public consultation,
leading on from the sub-national review, that what local authorities
and other key stakeholders wanted was more power to be devolved locally
and less to be given to unelected quangos. As the hon. Member for North
Cornwall said, the architecture of the clause as outlined in the Bill
is extremely important, because it will establish a regional strategy
made up of regional development agencies and leaders&#146; boards,
which are not what people want.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div><a name="0906177000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members will
know that in February 2009, we published our document entitled
&#147;Control Shift&#151;Returning Power to Local
Communities&#148;. The Local Government Association has also made
significant representation about regional policy, particularly in its
document, &#147;Prosperous Communities II&#151;vive la
d√(c)volution&#148;; not a catchy title, Mr. Amess. We
pledged to abolish regional planning and housing powers exercised by
regional government; we pledged to strip regional development agencies
of their powers over planning and to give powers to local authorities
to establish their own local enterprise partnerships to take over the
RDA
functions.</div><a name="0906177000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000399"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman is
setting out; it is also my party&#146;s determination to support
retention as far as possible at local level. Does he share my view that
at times, it might be appropriate for there to be pooling between local
authorities where there is clear agreement between them about moving
forward, and for them to come up with common strategies across areas
that, unlike the Government, they might feel form more natural
regions?</div><a name="0906177000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000400"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The hon. Gentleman is as astute as ever in his
observation that our policy is indeed about allowing local authorities
to work together where there is commonality of interest, particularly
on economic matters. One of our key areas of concern about regional
policy since 1999 is the lack of recognition of the fact that regional
government and policy is a top-down concept and does not take
significant account of the particular social, economic and demographic
issues that relate between authorities. To take the example of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s own region, the economic issues in west Cornwall
might as well be a million miles away&#151;in a different
galaxy&#151;from those affecting the Forest of Dean, for instance, or
east Dorset. The same is true of Milton Keynes compared with Thanet, in
the south-east region.</div>
<a name="0906177000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regional
government has also failed to deliver what was once promised on
expenditure, for instance. Some &#163;13 billion was spent by
regional development agencies between 1999 and 2008, and salaries have
gone from &#163;38 million to &#163;120 million. There has been a
159 per cent. increase in the running costs of RDAs. I will come back
to some of those figures later.</div>
<a name="0906177000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned
about the confusion in the Government over the representations of the
sub-national review. The Government said, following consultation, that
they</div><a name="0906177000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;expect
the RDAs to delegate responsibility for spending to local authorities
or sub-regions wherever possible unless there is a clear case for
returning spending to the regional
level&#148;.</div><a name="0906177000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
also
said:</div><a name="0906177000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Legislation
is not needed to deliver the spirit of the sub-national review
reforms.&#148;</div><a name="0906177000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the same time, officials in the Department for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform were advising the Department for Communities and
Local Government
that</div><a name="0906177000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;RDAs
cannot delegate responsibility for the spending of their
budget...RDAs will still have to formally approve projects
proposed by sub-regional partners and we will be accountable for
them.&#148;</div><a name="0906177000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is clearly a tension in the Government between their public
protestations about devolving local power to local councils and key
stakeholders and what is being said in central Government, which is
effectively that the purse strings, power, influence and decision
making will remain central.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div><a name="0906177000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906177000401"></a><b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): The hon.
Gentleman is highlighting another important distinction to be made
between delegated and devolved decision making. It seems that a lot of
the RDAs are simply implementing Government policy, which is a
delegated process, rather than giving discretion to local authorities
to decide what resources are spent on and how the decisions are
taken.</div>
<a name="0906177000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000402"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The hon. Lady has hit the nail on the head. In a
nutshell, that is the difficulty of this clause on the regional
strategy.</div><a name="0906177000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Local Government Association estimated in the recent report that I
quoted that there are 50 sub-national functional areas in England.
Decision making needs to be taken at that level. Below the national
level, markets for goods and services, housing and labour operate at
the sub-regional or city regional level. My right hon. Friend the
Member for Skipton and Ripon made that point when discussing tourism
and the diversity of the local economy in North Yorkshire, as opposed,
for instance, to west or south Yorkshire, and the right hon. Member for
Doncaster, Central
responded.</div><a name="0906177000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other noteworthy issue in the clause, we have been prevailed upon
by the Campaign to Protect Rural England to ask whether the clause is
only about delivering housing targets. Is it only about residential
development and a top-down approach of cramming as much housing into
key areas as possible, or is it truly about sustainable economic
growth? Sustainable economic growth&#151;growth that can be sustained
and that is within environmental limits&#151;is included in public
sector delivery agreement 7, but it is not in the Bill. Will
the Minister address that issue in respect of the
clause?</div><a name="0906177000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will not be voting for the clause. We do not have time to discuss the
philosophical and ideological differences between us and the
Government; suffice it to say that they have had 10 years to devolve
power truly and to give people responsibility for directing events in
their own locales and districts. The clause does not do anything to
give the electorate faith and trust in our shattered political system.
Indeed, it centralises power among unelected, unaccountable people,
which is something local people do not want. They want decisions made
in their community to link back directly to the decisions they make at
the ballot box. I fear that the clause will set back the cause of
devolution and local
autonomy.</div><a name="0906177000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906177000403"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): I took the
precaution yesterday of reading the policy document on regional
strategies issued by the Department specifically for the purposes of
the Bill. Frankly, anyone reading it can find whatever they are looking
for in it. It is like a vast fishing pond. One is pretty sure to net
something, but some very bizarre species come out of it. To begin with,
paragraph 2.2
says:</div><a name="0906177000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bill does not specify what the regional strategy should
contain&#148;,</div><a name="0906177000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">although
most of the rest of the document goes on to do so.</div>
<a name="0906177000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Overall,
the aim should be for a concise and succinct
document.&#148;</div><a name="0906177000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well,
hope springs eternal in the human
breast.</div><a name="0906177000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although
the responsible regional authorities must have regard to national
policies and guidance issued by Government, it is expected specific
policies would only be included in the regional strategy if there is a
genuine and distinctive regional or sub-regional dimension. The
regional strategy should not repeat national 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>policy or guidance. Instead, the content would be driven by regionally
specific issues that join up with national priorities. While the form
and format of the regional strategy and the level of detail for any
given topic is for each region to decide, it is expected that economic
objectives, housing, climate change and renewable and low-carbon energy
would receive particular
focus.&#148;</div><a name="0906177000363"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="0906177000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we read further down, we find that the strategy is required to have a
section dealing with sports, culture and media. I am not sure whether
the Yorkshire regional strategy is going to opine on whether Leeds
United were wrongly demoted, or whether or not they should be promoted
into the premiership. I think that the Minister for Regional Economic
Development and Co-ordination and I might find a rare moment of
agreement on what happened to Leeds United.</div>
<a name="0906177000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also not
sure whether the north-west strategy should opine on whether it was
wise to sell Ronaldo and who Manchester United ought to acquire as an
alternative to him. Of course, if we are dealing with sport,
T√(c)vez&#146;s situation is a subject of major regional
preoccupation. As far as the south-west is concerned, I am aware that
the football team is of more relatively local interest. I do not wish
to upset my colleagues in the Liberal Democrats, but I am not aware
that they have featured
recently&#151;</div><a name="0906177000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906177000404"></a><b class="B">Ian

real politics into the debate by talking about Manchester United. Can

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000405"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>The Committee is greatly amused by the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point of order, but it is not actually a point
of order.</div>
<a name="0906177000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000406"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess. A couple of days
ago, I was listening to some commentaries on the radio with the
political correspondent from the <i class="I">Manchester Evening News</i>. He
opined that the hon. Member for Eccles was losing interest in politics.
He also suggested that the hon. Gentleman did not care what happened
about the boundary changes if the worse comes to the worse and the
former Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government were to
find that her executive decided she should spend more time with her
motorbike&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption</i><i class="I">]</i>&#151;and
badge.</div>
<a name="0906177000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
point in pretending that the document is not prescriptive. In fact, it
is extremely prescriptive on housing. It says in terms that housing
strategies will be translated to targets in local communities. Now, one
could say that that has not changed; all Housing Ministers have ended
up imposing targets because building houses is an unpopular
activity&#151;my own Government did so, and it is time that this
Government did so, too. It is quite optimistic to think that we can
develop a scheme whereby housing is self-generating. It is worth a try,
but it would be difficult.</div>
<a name="0906177000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906177000407"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): I very much
concur with what the right hon. Gentleman is saying. In the unhappy
situation that the Conservative party appears to pay little attention
to the views that he is expressing, what thoughts does he have about an

<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>appropriate mechanism to ensure that housing figures can be delivered
without the consequence of his party&#146;s current policy, which
appears to leave that entirely to local authorities on the assumption
that they would produce the necessary output? He said himself that that
was optimistic.</div>
<a name="0906177000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000408"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I think that the right hon. Gentleman would agree
that there is a prior question. The problem is that the robustness of
the statistics on which we base our housing demand calculations is
always questioned. Let us be clear that they have often been robust in
the sense of understanding demand, but we are all used to local
communities carrying out housing surveys that are, frankly, extremely
aspirational in character. If we were to translate them into figures
for housing need, they would be very intellectually un-robust indeed.
We should start by trying to have a more intellectually robust system
for calculating the basis of need.</div>
<a name="0906177000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point about the strategy is that it might take five years to produce.
It will be a fascinating document&#151;I cannot say that it will be
very entertaining, but we all get our pleasures in different ways. The
time taken to produce it raises the crucial question: what
assumptions should be made about public
expenditure?</div>

Rogerson:</b> On a point of order, Mr Amess. I have been
enjoying listening to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution,
but given the contributions made by Conservative Front and Back
Benchers, it strikes me that we seem to have moved into a stand part
debate. I wondered whether that was your intention or if we should
debate the amendments as we come to them.</div>
<a name="0906177000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000410"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>I have been listening carefully to the
arguments deployed, football interventions aside. The right hon. Member
for Skipton and Ripon will perhaps be mindful, but he is perfectly in
order at the moment. It is still my intention to allow a stand part
debate if the Committee wants
one.</div><a name="0906177000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000411"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I am grateful to you for that, Mr.
Amess. This is a crucial issue; we all know that we are in a period in
which whoever forms a Government will cut public expenditure expressed
in real terms. Let us hope that we will not have another stupid debate
about that. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> There is no point in
the Whip making remarks under his breath; we all know that is a fact.
As a huge amount of any regional strategy relies on public investment,
what assumptions does one make about that public investment? It is a
very good question, because five years is longer than the normal
planning cycle for
spending.</div><a name="0906177000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are also practical issues. Let us take the most bizarre region of
all&#151;the south-east region. How does one produce a strategy for
the south-east that excludes London? The south-east, plus London,
represents a huge chunk of the United Kingdom&#146;s gross domestic
product. Will someone produce a strategy with a great hole in the
middle? How would someone do that, and how would people relate it? The
document says nothing about how regional strategies should be stitched
together. What happens if Yorkshire and the Humber produces a regional
strategy that is at odds with, or competitive with, or does not match
up with or is not part of a wider vision that encompasses the
north-east or goes across 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>into the north-west? <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The Minister
talks about the Northern Way. It has made some progress, but the idea
that the Northern Way is some huge mechanism to link together the
trans-Pennine economies is rather
far-fetched.</div><a name="0906177000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
does one produce that strategy in an area such as the south-east? The
question raised by the Liberal Democrats is legitimate: what is the
definition of &#147;region&#148;? What is the economic, social or
geographic cohesion of the regions? They are lines drawn on a map;
there may be units for which it is much more logical to draw a strategy
than those
areas.</div><a name="0906177000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have serious doubts about the concept of the regional strategy and
whether it is practical given the uncertainties about the future of
public expenditure and the inability of any Government to give those
long-term perspectives on the flow of public expenditure. We all know
that nobody can do that. We do not know how the strategies will mesh,
or how the south-east will take account of the fact that London makes a
great hole in the middle of its regional strategy.</div>
<a name="0906177000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prescriptive
intentions written in non-prescriptive language lie at the heart of the
document. I have severe questions about whether the whole thing will
work. I
read:</div><a name="0906177000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Other
infrastructure needs include: Waste. Water. Minerals. Culture, media
and sport. Environmental
infrastructure.&#148;</div><a name="0906177000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is prescriptive down to its fingertips, despite its claim that it is
not. It will be very difficult to deliver. I just hope it does not turn
out like Gosplan, which took a huge amount of time to develop and a
relatively small amount of time to understand that it could not be
delivered.</div><a name="0906177000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000412"></a>The
Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination (Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> I have to confess to the Committee that I am
extremely disappointed and dismayed by the Opposition&#146;s lack of
understanding of the importance of ensuring that we are delivering on
the economy not only at national and local level, but at regional level
as well. It is vital that, when we look at some of the strategic issues
that affect the economy, we have the spatial level to do so. It is true
that individual local authorities have an important part to play in
driving through economic development and regeneration. Given the stance
that the Opposition took earlier in pouring cold water over the ability
and duties that we are placing on local authorities with regard to
economy, I am surprised that they are suddenly saying that everything
must be done
now.</div><a name="0906177000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no doubt whatsoever that some issues are best dealt with at the
regional level. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon surely
remembers that Michael Heseltine, when he was a Secretary of State,
recognised the important role that needed to be played at the regional
level when he devolved the Government offices to the regions. There was
a certain all-party consensus on the matter&#151;my right hon. Friend
the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich will correct me if I am wrong. I
think that there was recognition that certain decisions could not be
simply made nationally and forced on the regions and that certain
decisions were not possible for individual local authorities to take
themselves.</div>
<a name="0906177000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000413"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div><a name="0906177000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000414"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I will give way in a second, because I want to
give some examples. On transport infrastructure provision, the right
hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon has just poured cold water on the
efforts of the Northern Way to provide a cohesive economic overview.
Actually, the Northern Way is doing extremely important work on the
benefits of a high-speed rail link to the north. The cross-Pennine belt
has travel-to-work areas and the connections between the ports are
vital. Having a view that crosses those regional boundaries is not only
possible under the legislation, but beneficial. When we look at
large-scale investments, it is important to have a regional
approach.</div><a name="0906177000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we look at countryside protection and the green belts, it is difficult,
if not sometimes impossible, to address those issues at the local
level&#151;it needs long-term planning. The right hon. Gentleman
said, &#147;Oh, these might be five or ten-year looks ahead.&#148;
That is absolutely right, and so they should be. If we are to get that
type of infrastructure planning done coherently, we need that regional
look. Particularly, with regard to the amendments, we need to set the
boundaries, which have been based on a lot economic evidence, while
being able to work across those boundaries. Absolutely nothing in the
Bill will stop that.</div>
<a name="0906177000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
Gentleman mentioned a situation in the south-east and London. There are
some good examples in the south-east, such as Thames
Gateway&#151;</div><a name="0906177000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000415"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> A
shambles.</div><a name="0906177000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000416"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Quite a lot of people would be dismayed to
think that, if the Conservative party ever achieved power, it would
think the work in the Thames Gateway a shambles. Some big investment
companies that are putting money in and creating jobs would be
disappointed to hear
that.</div><a name="0906177000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000417"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The Minister seems to be labouring under the
misapprehension that my party, as an Opposition party, is opposed to
the concept of regional decision making or a regional tier. In most
democracies, regions are based on cultural, economic, geographical and
all sorts of other factors, which make the regions work and become
recognisable by people. No one is going to die in the trenches for the
south-west region, and that is a fundamental problem. I completely
agree with what the Minister is saying about a regional tier of
government, so she does not have to worry about us opposing that. But
what should those regions be and how should they work? I hope she can
say more about why the Government feel that regions should exist for
ever under boundaries set up, as I understand it, by a previous
Conservative Government, in the days of needing responses to nuclear
threats, regional command centres and so
on.</div>
<a name="0906177000364"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="0906177000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000418"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I do not know where the hon. Gentleman got the
idea of a nuclear threat. This was about making sure that central
Government departments had at regional level a Government office that
was able to bring together the different strands of policy in order to
look at things like housing, planning and, increasingly, the
environment. This is not about a nuclear threat, which is a rather odd
concept. It is true, however, that there is regional resilience
planning at regional level, which is important. I do not think,
however, that was the overriding reason for devolving 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>power to Government offices. As I said earlier, the population coverage
tends to be about 5 million in each of the Government
areas&#151;similar to the German L√§nder. This is about the
right level of population density for proper economic
planning.</div>
<a name="0906177000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000419"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The Minister is advancing the argument that we
should look at the record of the past to judge the efficacy or
otherwise of the clause. What does she make therefore of the figures
that show, with the exception of the north-east, that regional
economies grew faster in the period 1992 to 1999 than they did in the
period of RDAs in 1999 to 2006, and that the United Kingdom now has the
widest gap in economies between regions in the whole of the European
Union? It has widened further in the past 10
years.</div>
<a name="0906177000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000420"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I would challenge what the hon. Gentleman says,
because if he looks at the difference, for example, between the
competitiveness of Yorkshire and the Humber and of the
south-east&#151;this is true of many of the northern regional
areas&#151;it has lessened since 1997. There has been a profound
effect on the least well-off economies. Since 1997, the gross value
added per head of all English regions has improved relative to the EU15
average. We have seen a narrowing of the gap in GVA growth rates
between the greater south-east and the other English regions. That has
reversed a trend which had been in place for 80 years.</div>
<a name="0906177000340"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I have
done a lot of work on the regions, and I would be surprised if, when
the hon. Gentleman looks at the facts, he does not accept, as do many
of his Conservative councillors and councillors from all parties, that
this kind of integrated spatial planning is necessary. The
difficulty&#151;this is where the sub-national review comes into the
equation&#151;is that when we looked at the whole issue of regional
government, I supported that proposal, because I thought that it was
the ultimate regional accountability. However, the electorate did not
think the same way, so we have to look at how to build in the input
from local authorities in the area. That is why the regional
development agencies and the leaders&#146; boards have to agree the
overall regional
strategy.</div><a name="0906177000341"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">That
is why this clause is so important and why the Opposition parties are
wrong in not recognising the importance to the economy of this kind of
planning, particularly during an economic downturn. What is coming to
the fore is the need to be able to look forward over the next five to
ten years to what is our regional economy going to look like, what
skills we will need, what planning policies, what housing policies, and
what industrial strategy we will need. It is not possible simply to do
that at local authority level. This is an extremely important
clause.</div><a name="0906177000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
happened previously was that regional assemblies were dealing, to an
extent, with one part of the issues&#151;transport and
planning&#151;local authorities were dealing with housing and the RDA
was looking at regeneration. The importance of this measure is that all
of those are being brought together in one strategy, because there is
increasing recognition that transport, planning and housing are crucial
to the development of the economy. That is why opposition to this
clause betrays a lack of understanding of the need to regenerate our
regional economies. I am particularly surprised at the opposition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>from the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, because I always
worked on the assumption that he recognised the importance to places
like Yorkshire and the Humber of that kind of investment
strategy.</div><a name="0906177000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000421"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> There is a difference between supporting an
investment strategy and having doubts about whether we need some
super-duper global plan to deliver it. A huge amount of what the right
hon. Lady has said prompts the question of what kind of public finance
is going to be available over future years.</div>
<a name="0906177000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
Lady mentioned skills. What assumptions will those drawing up the plan
be entitled to entertain about the funding available, for example, for
colleges of further education, which are major providers of skills?
What assumptions are we entitled to entertain about the volume of money
which local authorities might be able to dispose of, for example, for
their transport and highways budgets, or, for that matter, for national
road building? What assumptions are they entitled to entertain about
the funding available for major infrastructure projects, such as a
high-speed link, for
example?</div><a name="0906177000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Public
expenditure accounts for a huge proportion of the gross domestic
product of all the regions, just as public sector employment is
probably the second or third biggest employer in every region. I do not
see how you we plan unless Government gives us some working assumptions
about the public funding available, not least because so much public
funding and private funding are linked together&#151;one is the
catalyst for the other. There are huge assumptions here, and we have
not been given a clue about
them.</div><a name="0906177000342"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000422"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> This is complete nonsense. Is the right hon.
Gentleman committing his Front-Bench team to say that, since local
authorities should be the only ones doing economic planning, they are
going to be given a forecast of 20 years of actual public expenditure?
He is entirely missing the point of a regional spatial strategy, which
is about saying, for example, in the Yorkshire and Humber area, what
the future possibilities are in green technologies. What does the
region need to plan for regarding skills? What does it need to plan for
in transport? We need to shape economic thinking, showing inward
investors that we seek to provide, within the region, the right
economic conditions and the right education, bringing together the
universities in the way we have been, looking at research and
development for the future.</div>
<a name="0906177000343"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
right hon. Gentleman knows what happens if such a long-term strategy is
set out. Implementation will be geared towards the relevant amount of
public expenditure, but his argument and attitude is, &#147;Unless
you can put a figure on every single part of the strategy, we should
not do anything. Let&#146;s not have a go and think about the real
economic forward planning; do nothing because you can&#146;t put an
exact figure on every single part of
it.&#148;</div><a name="0906177000076"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000423"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> My right hon. Friend is making an extremely
valid point. I listened to the entirely intelligent response from the
right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, who rightly is trying to find
certainty about future prospects and trends. However, I must tell him
that that is not life. He is slightly overwhelmed by his own
interpretation of the measure as some kind of latter-day soviet Gosplan
that determines everything according to the availability of public
finances.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div><a name="0906177000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">As all of us
with reasonably long memories are aware, the Government of whom the
right hon. Gentleman was a distinguished member in the 1990s had very
pessimistic views about public expenditure, and cut it. As a housing
Minister, he had to put up with some very serious reductions in his
budget. The climate has changed, and we have seen considerable
investment since then. Inevitably, the downturn will have consequences
for a while, but it would be wrong to base planning for the future
simply on assumptions of public sector investment. Planning should be
based on the wider economic imperatives, which is what is behind the
clause.</div>
<a name="0906177000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000424"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. I
wish to add only this: I have meetings as a regional Minister with
potential inward investors, and they want strong leadership, not only
at local authority level, but at regional level. This combination, in
which we bringing together the different strands of economic planning
with business-focused regional development agencies, alongside
political leadership through the leaders&#146; board, is the way to
convince people that we are serious about ensuring that our regional
economies are as robust as
possible.</div><a name="0906177000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich says, the
right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, who spoke the other day about
the contribution of North Yorkshire and the fact that plans had to be
in place to rescue inadequate tourism or whatever, ought to be
listening to what businesses, economists, and potential inward
investors are saying about the
issue.</div><a name="0906177000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000425"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> The Minister is making a distinction between
substance and form. My question is this: do we need this big,
overarching machinery to deliver the goods? The universities in
Yorkshire have a good reputation of getting together to deliver high
technology, and they are linked worldwide. The universities in
Sheffield, Leeds and York, which are very high quality, do not need a
regional strategy to know what they have to do, because they are
getting on and doing it.</div>
<a name="0906177000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
extolled &#147;The Northern Way&#148;, but even if it was as
successful as she said, that was done without a regional strategy. I do
not question whether it is desirable for people to know where they are
going, but I do not want everything frozen for five years while people
labour to produce a strategy that might be overturned by
events.</div><a name="0906177000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
the way, I was concerned about the low value-added in tourism in
Yorkshire. We need to increase that.</div>
<a name="0906177000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000426"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Again, the right hon. Gentleman is wrong in
assuming that the universities do not want to be involved in the kind
of forward planning that we are talking about. I chair the Yorkshire
and Humber economic delivery group, which seeks to ensuring we have a
regional response to problems resulting from the economic downturn, and
is also looking to the future. Because of the way in which the
universities in Yorkshire have joined together, they have taken a clear
view of the region&#146;s needs and said, &#147;This is what we
need to do to help attract inward investment and ensure that our
graduates remain in the region.&#148; They are looking at research
and development needs, and how universities play a part in local
industries. They are extremely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>focused on the regional agenda, which is why they have come together in
such a way, as their region is one of the best in recognising the
importance of regional input.</div>
<a name="0906177000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
Gentleman, as a Member representing a constituency in that area, really
ought to look a little closer and perhaps with a slightly more open
mind at the benefits we are gaining from the regional approach. I hope
that he will be pleasantly surprised by what is happening, but it is
incredibly disappointing that the hard work going on at a regional
level, often including Conservative councillors, is not in the
slightest way recognised by the
Opposition.</div><a name="0906177000365"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="0906177000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000427"></a>Ian
Stewart:</b> I advise my right hon. Friend to be cautious
about accepting the Damascene conversion of the Opposition to localism
and local democracy. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon has
been leading a working party of sorts looking at localism&#151;they
are no doubt attempting to be the new Labour-y Tories for the future.
My view is straightforward: it is a bit rich for a party that voted
against last year&#146;s Local Transport Bill, thereby wishing to
diminish real local democracy, to start advocating local democracy in
this Committee.</div>
<a name="0906177000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000428"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> My hon. Friend is right to remind us that
during the passage of the Local Transport Act 2008, the
Conservative Front-Bench spokesmen were out of touch with what their
local councillors recognised as a good Bill that allowed local
authorities to plan properly according to local needs. As I recall,
local councillors wrote to those Front-Bench spokesmen asking,
&#147;Why do you never listen to a word we say?&#148; That is
another example of them not wanting to let go, and not recognising or
allowing the kind of economic development that is absolutely vital,
especially in these difficult economic
times.</div>
<a name="0906177000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000429"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I had hoped that there would be some consensus in
the debate. The right hon. Lady fails to recognise that we have
legitimate concerns about whether there is a diversity of provision at
regional level, which is dealt with in the clause. She will undoubtedly
be aware of a report by the respected <i class="I">International Journal</i><i class="I">
of Urban and Regional Research</i> in 2006 that found, notwithstanding
the huge amounts of money that had been spent by the RDAs,</div>
<a name="0906177000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;scant allowance
for region specificities as they have all produced strategies that
reveal a remarkable generic resemblance&#148;.</div>
<a name="0906177000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, the RDAs
are not adding value that will help localities, but are in fact using a
template given to them by central
Government.</div>
<a name="0906177000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000430"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> It is quite wrong to say that the RDAs are not
adding value. The recent report to which I referred showed that every
pound spent brought &#163;4 of value to the region. I can send a copy
of that report to the hon. Gentleman because he really ought to ensure
that he looks at the importance to the regional economies of the work
that is being carried out by the RDAs.</div>
<a name="0906177000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it is
important to stress that regional boundaries are a framework rather
than a straitjacket. As I have said, we support and encourage joining
up between local areas and cross-boundary work at a regional level.
There is flexibility in the Bill. I suspect that the amendments are
probing but, following my reassurance, I hope that they will be
rejected if pressed to a Division. I stress 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>again that this clause is one of the most important in the Bill; voting
against it would be to the detriment of the economic prosperity of all
our regions in the future.</div>
<a name="0906177000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000431"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I was pleased that the Minister addressed the
issue in the amendment at the end of this long debate. We could have
had a shorter debate that would have quite clearly said that the
Liberal Democrats feel that the regional boundaries do not necessarily
make sense, although some might. I am not an expert on all regions, and
I would not seek to be, as these issues are for people in the regions
and their elected representatives to
decide.</div><a name="0906177000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
seems to be a fixation among Government Members that the boundaries are
right. I listened for the Minister&#146;s defence as to why they are
right. She said that they are about the same size as the L√§nder
in Germany, but given that the L√§nder include Bavaria and
Bremen, which are of different size and population, that argument does
not stack up. If we are merely going to chop up the country to get the
population numbers absolutely right, the process becomes even more
meaningless. All that makes it obvious that we need more debate about
what the regions
are.</div><a name="0906177000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000432"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> How does the hon. Gentleman envisage the
reorganisation of all the boundaries happening? There should be
flexibility to work across and within boundaries, but at this point,
when there is a complete focus on getting through the economic
downturn, while still looking beyond it to what our regions are going
to look like, the uncertainty that would be caused by a huge
reorganisation would make that extremely unwise. How long does he think

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000433"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The whole point is that that would be determined
by local people. If they think their region is right, that is fine, but
presumably the Minister must agree that it is pointless to put together
a regional strategy that people feel does not work and does not
represent any community of interest. It is very time consuming to go
through a process such as the recent regional spatial strategies and to
draw up documents that may or may not come into force, or have
influence over a particular area, when the people within that area do
not feel that it represents a real region.</div>
<a name="0906177000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
there is the facility for cross-border working, but that leads only to
duplication. Rather than having cross-border working between borders in
areas that do not make sense, why not have regions that work, that
represent communities of interest and that recognise people&#146;s
economic, geographical and cultural affinities to get a set of
strategies going forward that are right? It is crucial to get that
right now, even more than in the future.</div>
<a name="0906177000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the wider
debate about whether there is a purpose to having a regional tier of
government and that way of doing things, the Minister came back time
and again to the idea that Government offices somehow represent
devolution, but in my book they do not. A civil servant who is directed
by a Minister, or as part of a Whitehall Department, does not represent
any form of devolution just because they sit somewhere out in a region
rather than in Whitehall.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000434"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Does my hon. Friend believe that the power is
the equivalent of having a bank branch in the town? The branch does not
determine local policy, but implements the main bank&#146;s policy.
Government offices for the regions are there to do the
Government&#146;s bidding in the regions, not to make
decisions.</div><a name="0906177000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000435"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention.
People who have been in banking for a long time might say that when
bank managers made direct decisions on whom to lend money to and there
was genuine devolution of such decisions, people made more sensible
lending decisions that we have seen in recent
years.</div><a name="0906177000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000436"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> It is amazing that the hon. Member for Falmouth
and Camborne says&#151;I am surprised that the hon. Member for North
Cornwall backs her up&#151;that a local bank just implements its
central bank&#146;s policy. The point is that people are saying that
they want local branches with the ability to consider what is happening
in the local area and to interpret the central bank&#146;s policy to
determine what is appropriate. I said about Government offices that
there is an important point that one can have a centralised
approach&#151;that is what the hon. Member for North Cornwall and,
amazingly, the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne are now
saying&#151;or the Government can be present in the regions. Michael
Heseltine importantly accepted that it was important have an approach
that recognised the particular issues that pertain within different
regions.</div><a name="0906177000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000437"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> That remark shows that the Minister has not
acknowledged the debate that we are attempting to promote. How can the
Government have a policy appropriate to a region when that region does
not function as a region? As the hon. Member for Peterborough said, a
regional policy that seeks to reconcile the situation in Swindon with
that on the Isles of Scilly just does not work. They have completely
different economies and geographical circumstances. I am not saying
that regional policies should function at parish level. There are
natural communities, but we need more of a debate about what those
regions are and what represents a sensible
region.</div><a name="0906177000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
said, Mr. Amess, that we could have a stand part debate on
the clause, and perhaps we can return to whether regional strategies
are right. So far, we have not heard any justification for the current
regional boundaries or why they should be inviolate, so I shall press
the amendment to a

Chairman:</b> Before we move on to the next amendment, this
morning I have indulged hon. Members, and we have had a very wide
debate on the first group of amendments. I am still minded to have a

short
debate.</div><a name="0906177000117"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000451"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I shall attempt to be brief and bear in mind the
instructions that you have quite rightly given the Committee,
Mr. Amess. The amendments seek to put the principle of
sustainability at the heart of any regional strategy on any boundary.
We are concerned that, given the role that the Bill gives to regional
development agencies, which focus on delivering economic targets and
growth, important gains that have been made on sustainability policy
will be lost. We had such a debate during last year&#146;s Planning
Bill Committee, which led to the Planning Act 2008, where it was felt
both in Committee and on Report that it was important that every effort
was taken to ensure that important principles of sustainability lie at
the heart of any legislation and any regional planning
process.</div><a name="0906177000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s planning guidance shows that there has been a
growing awareness of the issues, particularly in relation to climate
change. Amendment 72 centres on the mitigation of climate change and
the Government&#146;s ambitious targets, which were approved by the
House last year, to tackle climate change. Adaptation is also
important; it is absolutely vital that any new planning development is
able to adapt to climate change, which is sadly well under way. That is
my view, and it is also the view of my hon. Friend the Member for
Falmouth and Camborne, who originally tabled amendment 72, as well as
the view of other members of the Committee who have added their names
to the amendment, which now stands in the name of the hon. Member for
Liverpool, Walton (Mr.
Kilfoyle).</div><a name="0906177000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are crucial, and I hope that the Government will accept
them. They will reassure people who have to engage with regional
strategies that the gains in relation to sustainability policy and
tackling climate change are included in the Bill, and that a core
function of the strategies is not only to address the economic future
of the region, but to address issues of sustainability and climate
change.</div><a name="0906177000122"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000452"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> It is a shame that the hon. Member for Liverpool,
Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) is not able to speak to his amendment;
the Whips have no doubt intervened to ensure that he does other things
on a Tuesday morning. I heartily concur with the views of the hon.
Member for North Cornwall. I was remiss in not fully quoting from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>the public service agreement delivery agreement 7, which seeks to
encapsulate the meaning of sustainable economic growth as</div>
<a name="0906177000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;economic growth
that can be sustained and is within environmental limits, but also
enhances the environment and social welfare, and avoids greater
extremes in future economic
cycles.&#148;</div><a name="0906177000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
concur with
that.</div><a name="0906177000344"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">We
should also not disregard the importance of the Sustainable Communities
Act 2007, which had cross-party support, and in which the hon. Member
for Falmouth and Camborne played a significant part. On that basis, we
will support the amendment if it is pushed to a vote.</div>
<a name="0906177000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000453"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I will be very brief. Essentially,
clause 70 requires the regional strategy to take account of
sustainable development principles and to be subject to a
sustainability appraisal. It applies to all policies in the regional
strategy, and it would be superfluous to add a specific reference to
land use and development. Amendment 72 would have a negligible effect,
other than to make explicit what is required by clause 74(1)(a). For
that reason, I hope that the Opposition will not press their
amendments.</div>
<a name="0906177000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000454"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am not surprised by the Minister&#146;s
response. In my few years in the House, it has been usual practice for
Ministers to say that the legislation covers the issue that we have
raised, even if it is sometimes hard to find the key definition that we
are looking for.</div>
<a name="0906177000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906177000455"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman
agree that the Minister has been putting two arguments simultaneously?
When it suits her, she has said that the duties in Opposition
amendments should not be included in the Bill. At other times, she has
said that it is essential that duties on local authorities are included
in the Bill in extraordinary detail.</div>
<a name="0906177000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000456"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point as
usual.</div>
<a name="0906177000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
indicated that we should consider these matters under clause 74(1)(a),
which refers to</div>
<a name="0906177000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;national polices
and advice contained in guidance which has been given by the Secretary
of State&#148;.</div>
<a name="0906177000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that
people will feel that that is explicit enough. That guidance may
change, and there is a whole range of guidance. The issues that we are
discussing, particularly with regard to climate change, are of such
overriding importance that I cannot see a reason for not including our
proposals in the Bill.</div>
<a name="0906177000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000457"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> My understanding of what my right hon. Friend
the Minister said is that amendment 72 was covered by clause 74(1)(a),
which refers to having regard to</div>
<a name="0906177000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;national
polices...contained in guidance...given by the Secretary of
State&#148;,</div><a name="0906177000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is exactly in line with the thinking in amendment 72.
However, will the hon. Gentleman tell me what on earth amendment 100,
which inserts the word &#147;sustainable&#148; in line 16, does to
add to the duty that we are discussing? The duty is absolutely clear
and precise, and all the responsibilities in this part of the Bill are
covered. The duty is not obscure or difficult to find&#151;it is
pretty clear. Clause 70 says:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div><a name="0906177000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
responsible regional authorities and the Secretary of State must
exercise their functions under this Part in relation to the regional
strategy...with the objective of contributing to the achievement
of sustainable development.&#148;</div>
<a name="0906177000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems pretty clear.
I cannot see what on earth the point is of adding another clause or
subsection to the Bill to say exactly the
same.</div>
<a name="0906177000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000458"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The difference is that &#147;contributing
to&#148; is fairly vague. One could contribute to the achievement of
sustainable development in a fairly minor way and satisfy the
provisions. The importance of these issues necessitates putting our
proposals where we propose in the amendment and saying that the key
purpose of any regional strategy is to secure sustainable
development.</div>
<a name="0906177000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Definitions of
the word &#147;sustainable&#148; are commonly accepted, including
in the Sustainable Communities Act 2007. I would be far more
comfortable and reassured if we included sustainable development as a
primary purpose of the regional strategy, rather than saying,
&#147;The regional strategy is there to look at economic development.
In passing, it may contribute to other issues.&#148; That is just not
good enough.</div>
<a name="0906177000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000459"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I hesitate to speak for the hon. Member for
Liverpool, Walton, who is absent, but my recollection is that he
specifically told the Minister on Second Reading that he was
endeavouring to include the amendment in the Bill because he had no
idea of the real meaning and practical effect of sustainability in his
area&#151;the north-west. The issue is self-evident. For that reason
alone, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment should
stand.</div>
<a name="0906177000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000460"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention
and for those closing remarks. It is clear that there are different
views across the Committee. None the less, many hon. Members feel that
the amendment deals with an important principle so I wish to press it

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000475"></a>Dan

the regional strategy being approved for a region it must be passed by

<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div><a name="0906177000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed how agreements reached at regional level, as defined by the
Government, are seen as binding on local communities by their
democratically elected authorities. A similar gap has emerged with
regional spatial strategies. It is clear that up and down the country,
there are differences of opinion among local residents about what
regional spatial strategies propose and among local authorities about
what is appropriate for their areas. As local authorities are the
democratically elected representatives of their areas, it would be more
democratic to have a framework through which local authority members
can vote on whether a regional strategy should come into
force.</div><a name="0906177000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the word &#147;veto&#148; will pass the
Minister&#146;s lips in her response because the amendment would hand
a veto to individual local authorities over regional spatial
strategies. However, if a democratically elected local authority feels
so strongly that what is being proposed over its head for the
Government&#146;s idea of a region is inappropriate, there ought to
be a means by which it can call people back to the table to enter into
further negotiations to ensure that the strategy is appropriate to the
needs of people across the
region.</div><a name="0906177000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000476"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> What would happen if one small council were to say
no? In the south-east, there are 77 councils. The basis on which it
would say no would almost certainly be pressure from inhabitants about
proposed housing plans. How many would have to say no and how much
renegotiation would have to take place? What would happen if the other
side of the argument did not want to budge? I do not like the concept,
but if we have it, we must try to make it
work.</div><a name="0906177000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000477"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is responding to the
issue of a veto that I raised. Part of the problem, as he has pointed
out, is how difficult it is to conceive of the south-east as a region
and to set regional priorities that would be appropriate to all local
authorities across the area. The amendment is what the Minister
referred to earlier as a probing amendment. I wanted to prompt a
discussion about what role democratically elected members of local
authorities should have in approving regional
strategies.</div><a name="0906177000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000478"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> If the hon. Gentleman wants to build in a
safeguarding mechanism, would it not have been more sensible to propose
a weighted vote that depends on the proportion of the population of the
region represented by each local authority? That is analogous to the
European Union objective. That would be a forum for renegotiation, but
there would have to be links between rural and urban areas to force it
to
happen.</div><a name="0906177000367"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000479"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> We could move into the type of debates that we
held in our consideration of the Business Rate Supplements Bill about
double key votes and those sorts of issues. However, the purpose of the
amendment is to prompt a discussion about what role democratically
elected members might have in the approval of the regional
strategy.</div><a name="0906177000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill sets out a role for leaders&#146; boards, which are an attempt
to replace regional assemblies. Regional assemblies, because they are
unelected and because they have all sorts of co-opted people on them,
have proved to be an experiment that has not worked; the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>seem to acknowledge that with their plan for ending them.
Leaders&#146; boards are another attempt to put in place some role
for local authorities in this sector of regional planning. Again,
however, they are somewhat limited.</div>
<a name="0906177000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">People elect
councillors in their areas in the hope that they will be able to take

this regional policy is that leaders&#146; boards will be in place,
but people will not feel reassured that leaders&#146; boards are
either powerful enough or sufficiently legitimate to carry out that
role in regional planning. The Minister has also talked about Regional
Select Committees in the past and the role that they have in scrutiny.
However, the Liberal Democrats have highlighted the fact that there are
weaknesses with that system too.</div>
<a name="0906177000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
solutions have been proposed. I agree with the Minister that ultimately
the only solution is to have a democratically elected tier of regional
government in areas where there is public support for that system. In
passing, I could mention that there is still a petition somewhere in
Downing street with 50,000 signatures that calls for a Cornish assembly
which the Minister might like to look at in her new role.</div>
<a name="0906177000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come back
to our earlier debate about whether or not these regions actually work.
From my point of view, I do not think that we will ever move to a stage
of having democratically elected regional assemblies unless the people
in each region feel that that is the region in which they belong. That
is a problem that our earlier debate attempted to overcome, but I will
not revisit that debate now, Mr. Amess, as I am sure that
you would rule me out of order if I did so.</div>
<a name="0906177000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is a probing amendment to prompt discussion about whether or not there
should be a greater role for local authority members in considering
these regional strategies, because they are the people who are held to
account by the electorate, as Members of Parliament are, yet neither
local councillors nor MPs have a significant role in the planning
process as set out in the Bill. I do not think that leaders&#146;
boards go far enough.</div>
<a name="0906177000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000480"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> We were getting on well with the Liberal
Democrats, but I am afraid that we will have to disagree with them on
this issue. For the Liberal Democrats, it again comes down to their
desire to square the circle. They find themselves between a rock and a
hard place, because they are committed to regional government and the
diktat of the European Union, which of course was the genesis of
regional policy, but at the same time they have to pay lip service to
the local authority, local autonomy and democracy. They are therefore
trying to square the circle, by supporting a regional strategy while at
the same time effectively encouraging councils to veto the regional
strategy, as it is set out in the legislation.</div>
<a name="0906177000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal
Democrats cannot have it both ways. Our heart is with their desire for
local democracy, but the amendment is effectively a wrecking amendment,
because the fact is that it is completely impractical. There are large
numbers of authorities in the south-east, the south-west and other
regions. Even if one accepted the Minister&#146;s premise that
business needs certainty and the capacity to make long-term decisions
at regional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>level&#151;a premise that has not been demonstrably proved and that
will not be proved by Ministers&#151;the amendment goes against that
premise. How can that kind of long-term planning and certainty be
possible when, for instance, 77 local authorities in the south-west
have been invited to impose a veto? The amendment is impractical, but
we are sympathetic to parts of the argument made by the hon. Member for
North Cornwall. We will be sitting on our hands regarding this
particular amendment.</div>
<a name="0906177000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000481"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> With your permission, Mr. Amess, my
instinct is that I will be able to address more fully some of the
issues later, particularly the leaders&#146; board, which is dealt
with in the next clause, and the process of approving the strategies,
which is dealt with in clause 75. In the meantime, the
problem with the amendment is that it would duplicate provisions
elsewhere in this part of the Bill, and would fundamentally change the
partnership approach, which we devised as a result of extensive
consultation last year. For those reasons, I urge the Committee to
oppose
it.</div><a name="0906177000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000482"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I said in my opening remarks that I did not
intend to press the amendment to a vote: I simply sought an opportunity
to raise the issue. There are serious questions to be asked about the
democratic accountability of the set-up proposed in the Bill, but as
the Minister says, we will discuss that at a later stage, so I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0906177000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000483"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we debate clause 67 stand part, I remind
Members that although this is a key clause, most of the issues have
been explored. I ask those who wish to contribute to make their remarks
brief.</div><a name="0906177000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000484"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I will be brief, Mr. Amess. You have
been remarkably flexible in allowing the debates that we have had to
take
place.</div><a name="0906177000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that the Minister has made a comprehensive case for the
clause. Many of the concerns that we have expressed have been
dismissed, particularly about the lack of plurality of delivery for
regional development agencies. We are not minded to support her
arguments on the specific point about sustainability or on the point
that I raised earlier about the failure of imagination to progress from
the sub-national review in 2007 and listen to what local people were
saying. It was not necessary or appropriate to disband the regional
assemblies, with their stakeholders and directly elected local
councillors. The Government had a great opportunity at that stage to
build on the success that they had achieved, to a certain extent, with
the regional
assemblies.</div><a name="0906177000345"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
Minister also failed to make a coherent case for the added value that
she claims regional development agencies have made. We could parry
figures across the Committee as to whether they really have added
value. A similar period before they were established in 1999 suggests
that they have not greatly added value, given the huge amount of money
spent on them. In our document, &#147;Control Shift&#148;,
published in February, we made clear our view on regional strategies.
We are not saying that we have all the answers, but the premise of our
well-established policy involves both giving more power to local
authorities and encouraging them to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>work around their natural economic and social demographic affinities. On
that basis&#151;I hope that we will have the support of the Liberal
Democrats&#151;we will vote against the clause in its
entirety.</div>
<a name="0906177000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000485"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> In responding to what the hon. Member for
Peterborough said about his party&#146;s vision, my concern is that
the proposals outlined by the Conservatives contain no provision for
more institutionalised regional co-operation, even if people in those
regions believe it appropriate. Perhaps unusually, we find ourselves
sitting between the other parties. The Government&#146;s view is that
the regions are right, and that that is the way forward; the
Conservative party&#146;s view is that regional government is
altogether a bad thing. In our view, regional government may be
appropriate for a particular area, and the people living there may be
convinced that it is the right model for them. However, regional
government should be able to develop far more organically than being
imposed from the centre.</div>
<a name="0906177000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">My party does
not have a problem with the concept of regional planning, but the
clause uses the existing regional boundaries, which is a problem. I am
expected to return to my electorate and tell them that the regional
spatial strategy process has been a success and has met with such
universal approval that the model will be developed, and that we shall
look at all sorts of other issues in a new all-singing, all-dancing
regional strategy. I believe that my constituents would laugh in my
face, which is why I cannot support the
clause.</div>
<a name="0906177000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000486"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> That is a glaring example of the Lib-Dems
sitting on the fence. They do not want to make a decision. The official
Opposition are at least saying that they do not believe in the idea of
any kind of regional intervention. That fits their overall strategy,
which is that nothing can be done during these difficult economic
times, that public intervention is not the right approach, and that we
should sit back and let things take their course; they have no idea of
the key role of Government and local government in ensuring a good,
well-thought out strategy for the future or of what it could do for the
economy.</div>
<a name="0906177000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
traditional position that the Conservatives have adopted is a return to
the free-market economics that let people down in previous economically
difficult times. The Liberal Democrats simply cannot make up their
minds. I hope that the Committee will support the amendment, as it is
incredibly important to the country&#146;s future.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000503"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b><b class="B"> </b>As the hon. Member for Wycombe said
earlier, we return to a continuing theme. As we move through the Bill,
many of our debates will relate to the same theme. I was intrigued to
hear the Minister describe any position between defending the existing
regions as they stand and having no regions as sitting on the fence, as
if there can be no middle ground between those two
views.</div>
<a name="0906177000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000504"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> It is very easy to describe it that
way.</div>
<a name="0906177000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000505"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The Government&#146;s position is now on the
record, and I am sure that it will be evaluated by all. No regional
policy can move forward along any other line than that relating to the
boundaries that were set fairly arbitrarily a decade or so
ago.</div><a name="0906177000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
we now move on to a discussion about leaders&#146; boards that began
briefly on our last amendment to the previous clause. The issue is
whether leaders&#146; boards represent the appropriate mechanism for
all areas of the country to have input into any emerging regional
policy, or strategy. On reading the Bill, our view is that saying that
a leaders&#146; board must be the way to go for everybody is too
prescriptive. That is why we suggest taking out the word
&#147;must&#148; and inserting the word &#147;may&#148; in its
place. There might well be other ways in which we can have a
representative element to considering regional policy that would work
alongside the regional development agency, interact with it and
reassure people that elected representatives have a say in what the
policy is. To that end, I am happy to move amendment 102, which seeks
to allow greater flexibility in determining what the democratic
arrangements should be in terms of moving forward with regional
policy.</div><a name="0906177000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000506"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I will be extremely brief because I am speaking
only to this particular amendment and will make substantive comments on
the clause later during the stand-part debate. We are inclined to
support the amendment because generally the powers contained in the
clause are too draconian, too sweeping, take insufficient account of
the role of local authorities and give way too much power to the
Secretary of State. On that basis, &#147;may&#148; instead of
&#147;must&#148; is the correct way
forward.</div><a name="0906177000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000507"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I urge the Committee to reject the amendment
because it is important that people are able to see the arrangements
that have been put in place for how leaders&#146; boards are to be
established. It will be for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>participating authorities to decide how they wish to organise
themselves, but, as I have said, it is important that people are able
to see what those arrangements are. Having a scheme in place is an
important part of that process as it means that leaders&#146; boards
will be streamlined and manageable, and that there is clarity about how
participating authorities will work together with the RDAs to fulfil
their duties, including in relation to how they resolve any
differences. That is important because, in a sense, it goes back to the
points that I am sure will be made about how the process takes place
and how people understand it. Without a scheme in place, it is
difficult to see how there would be that transparency. That is why the
amendments are not the right way
forward.</div><a name="0906177000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000508"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I hear what the Minister has to say about there
being flexibility for regions to come up with their own arrangements,
but it strikes me that there is freedom for them to come up with their
own arrangements as long as there is some form of leaders&#146;
board. That is a bit like Henry Ford saying that people can have a car
in any colour they want as long as it is black. That is the problem for
us; the measure is too prescriptive. On that basis and given that there
seems to be some support on the Committee for pressing the matter to a
vote, I will seek to do
so.</div><a name="0906177000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000525"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Again, the amendments refer to what the
democratic accountability will be within the future regional structure.
Although their aims are the same, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>the amendments have two elements. They seek to be less restrictive about
what the democratic oversight should be. The term
&#147;Leaders&#146; Board&#148; should be replaced throughout the
clause with &#147;the Responsible Regional Authority&#148; and
allow such authorities to be defined as local authorities coming
together to set priorities and draw up regional proposals along the
lines that we discussed&#151;that regions are made up of the local
authorities in the area rather than imposed from above. Therefore,
local authorities need a far stronger role in determining strategy and
policy.</div><a name="0906177000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000526"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Does he propose taking the leaders&#146; board
out of clause 68 due to the Hitchin and Harpenden consideration raised
on Second Reading? He may be more expert than I am, but, as far as I
can tell, nowhere in the Bill are the &#147;leaders&#148; who will
sit on the board defined. Are they local authority leaders or nursery
group leaders? Perhaps the Minister will tell
us.</div>
<a name="0906177000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000527"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an excellent point
and, indeed, what mechanisms determine how many representatives of
districts, for example, there are in two-tier areas? That also remains
to be clarified.</div>
<a name="0906177000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
element to the amendments is removing the regional development agency
from who the responsible regional authorities are. The regional
development agency should be more of a delivery arm for regional
strategy than a body equal to local authorities in determining what
that regional strategy should be. That is the approach that my party
would take. Those who take decisions about spending large amounts of
money and drafting strategy ought to be democratically accountable.
People employed through the regional development agency are there to
deliver that strategy and ensure that that vision becomes a reality,
rather than be on an equal footing.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000528"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> We are not minded to support the Liberal Democrat
amendments because they are not sufficiently robust and do not further
our knowledge of how the clause would work in practice. In fact, they
go against the Liberal Democrat protestations about wishing to focus
primarily on a bottom-up process. The leaders&#146; board is an
imperfect system, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe made clear,
and we will debate that in detail in the clause stand part debate,
However, surely replacing the leaders&#146; boards is better than the
opaque concept of a regional body, notwithstanding the problem that too
much power may be vested in, for instance, one or two individuals in a
local authority or in all the local authorities in the south-west.
Therefore, we do not feel disposed to support the amendment and will
have plenty to say about particular aspects of the clause in the clause
stand part debate.</div>
<a name="0906177000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000529"></a>Ms

you give me some guidance on whether we are also addressing amendment
110? I am not sure that it was referred to, or
moved.</div><a name="0906177000238"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000530"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The Minister would be entirely right to address
remarks to amendment 110. It was part of the group, and I thought that
the hon. Gentleman referred to it
obliquely.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div><a name="0906177000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000531"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I must have missed that nugget.</div>
<a name="0906177000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Committee to reject these amendments, because it is not clear what they
would achieve. It appears that they would make local authorities the
responsible regional authority without the involvement of regional
development agencies. When we come to the stand part debate, I hope
that it will become clear that we envisage a partnership between the
local authorities and RDAs in drawing up the strategy. We think that
that is particularly important given the focus on the economy, but the
amendments would limit that
partnership.</div><a name="0906177000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 110, I hope that I can reassure the Committee that following
amendments in another place, the Bill now requires that the access to
information provisions in the Local Government Act 1972, with suitable
modifications, as required, be applied to leaders&#146; boards as
constituted by local authorities. We are exploring, with RDAs and local
authorities, how best to manage access to information for their joint
working on regional strategies outside legislation. With that
reassurance and explanation, I hope that the Committee will reject the
amendment.</div><a name="0906177000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000532"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Through the amendments, we sought to identify
ways to allow for democratic involvement other than the leaders&#146;
board formula proposed by the Government. I do not think that the
Minister seeks to be prescriptive, but the provisions talk only about
leaders being represented. It would have been good to have slightly
more leeway for local areas to come together and work out appropriate
arrangements for their particular circumstances. I have no problem with
the concept that RDAs and local authorities should work in partnership.
However, there is sometimes a slight power imbalance in that
relationship. We would seek to set up a democratic framework that would
put democratically elected people at the heart of decision making. The
appointed members and officers of the RDA should work alongside them,
but not have the same involvement in decision making. That is an
important principle that I would have liked to have seen in this Bill.
However, we can discuss in more detail, during the clause stand part
debate, what leaders&#146; boards are for and what they will do. On
that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0906177000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="0906177000368"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000533"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I beg to move amendment 109, in
clause 68, page 51, line 26, leave out subsection
(8).</div><a name="0906177000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are moving into the area of the powers of the Secretary of State.
Clause 68(8)
states:</div><a name="0906177000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the Secretary of State considers that a Leaders&#146; Board
established for a region is not operating effectively, the Secretary of
State may by direction withdraw approval for the scheme under which it
is
established&#148;.</div><a name="0906177000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is contrary to the view shared by my party in favour of a bottom-up
approach. We should be moving forward and creating confidence among
people in local areas and regions that their views matter and will be
taken seriously. I am also concerned that we are talking about stepping
in, where there is a problem, against the leaders&#146; board rather
than the RDA. The Government may have constituted this as a partnership
between the two, but it seems that the Secretary of State envisages a
greater likelihood of problems with the leaders&#146; board than with
the RDA. We might call into question that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>premise. My party hopes that we can remove this top-down measure, which
enshrines in the Bill greater power for the Secretary of State to
interfere in these local and regional
mechanisms.</div><a name="0906177000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000534"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> Again, I concur with the hon. Gentleman. We will
support his amendment. We believe that subsection (8) vests
disproportionate power in the hands of the Secretary of State,
particularly the power to remove a leaders&#146; board from the
plan-making process without new primary legislative authority. These
powers are open to the possibility of abuse&#151;I use that word
because it could well
happen.</div><a name="0906177000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also seems that accountability is only one way. The question must be
asked why the power is not used in respect of RDAs. Why is it used only
for leaders&#146; boards? It speaks volumes about the disregard and
disdain for people at the cutting edge of local government that the
Secretary of State can invoke pretty significant powers to disregard
the leaders&#146; board and not have concomitant powers applying to
the
RDA.</div><a name="0906177000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry that the Government, when drafting the subsection, did not
seek the advice, for instance, of the Royal Town Planning Institute,
which made the very reasonable point that it would have been better to
establish a mechanism enabling the Secretary of State to identify and
direct, where necessary, improvements in service by a leaders&#146;
board and enabling equivalent action to be taken against the RDA if
warranted. The Government have been over-prescriptive and too
heavy-handed and, on that basis, we are minded to support the Liberal
Democrat
amendment.</div><a name="0906177000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000535"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The aim of the amendment is to remove the power
of the Secretary of State to withdraw approval for the leaders&#146;
board scheme. I want to assure the Committee that it is simply a
fall-back power to deal with situations in which the leaders&#146;
board is unable to function to the satisfaction of the participating
authorities. It is important that we have this provision to ensure that
if any difficult situations arise, we can ensure that leaders&#146;
boards function
effectively.</div><a name="0906177000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000536"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> In responding, the Minister was keen to point
out that it would be almost a petition from the local area&#151;from
the region&#151;saying that things were not working well and asking
whether the Secretary of State could therefore step in. That is not
what the provision says at the moment. It concerns me that something
might be set up that is functioning and challenging Government policy
on how the region should move forward, but the RDA is unhappy with the
challenge it is receiving from the leaders&#146; board, and therefore
the Secretary of State could step in and say that there was some sort
of dysfunction and we needed to go back to the drawing board.</div>
<a name="0906177000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s response hints at the fact that leaders&#146;
boards may not be the right model everywhere. In respect of the
previous debate, which I shall not seek to reopen, it shows an
acknowledgment by the Secretary of State that all might not be perfect
with leaders&#146; boards. Therefore, it is a shame that it is the
only model on
offer.</div><a name="0906177000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, the measure is unnecessary and gives too much power, which
could be abused, to the Secretary of State. I will therefore press the
amendment to a vote.</div>

Bill.</div>
<a name="0906177000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000550"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I shall endeavour not to revisit the debate on
subsection (8), which focused on what was probably our primary reason
for thinking that the clause is unsatisfactory. However, there are
several other reasons as
well.</div><a name="0906177000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is loosely written, in particular subsection (4)
about consultation. It is inappropriate to put in the Bill that the
Secretary of State should, in effect, be able to choose whom they wish
to be consulted with and by. No doubt the Minister will say that that
is normal procedure with Bills, and that it is how they are drafted by
people with more expertise than I have, but it cannot be acceptable in
a mature democracy that a central personality in, as I said previously,
a unitary state, can say that they will choose whom they seek to accept
consultation from on an important issue such as a regional strategy. We
are not happy about
that.</div><a name="0906177000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
we are also unhappy that subsection (8) is in the clause because it is
all very well for the regional development
agency&#151;</div><a name="0906177000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000551"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Perhaps the Minister will provide an explanation
of the point, if any, regarding consultation. It is a bit puzzling that
such a provision was not inserted in previous clauses that we
considered. For example, clause 66 on local authority economic
assessments simply requires that the Secretary of State should
consult.</div><a name="0906177000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000552"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> As ever, my hon. Friend is forensic and astute.
He is absolutely right, and the Minister should address that issue. We
need to know why the provision is considered to be appropriate in this
clause but not in
others.</div><a name="0906177000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also need to look at the concept of &#147;leader&#148;. The
definition of leader is loose, and we can see future legal difficulties
in respect of it. For instance, is a leader a directly elected mayor in
the south-west region? Is the leader the directly elected mayor of
Torbay or is it the Conservative leader of the administration? We have
mayoralties across the country&#151;in Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, and
Bedford. The issue of who the leader is needs to be considered. Will
the leader have a deputy, and will they always be the deputy leader of
the district council or the borough council? Moreover, the wording in
subsection (10) is very loose and massively open to interpretation. It
states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div><a name="0906177000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
application referred to in subsection (9) may be with such
modifications as the Secretary of State considers necessary or
expedient.&#148;</div><a name="0906177000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
vests enormous powers in the hands of the Secretary of State in dealing
with leaders&#146; boards but not with RDAs.</div>
<a name="0906177000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">This whole
clause fails to rise to the challenge of the sub-national review. We
Conservatives took the Government at their word when the sub-national
review was announced and enacted. It was about devolving power to
localities and giving more say to democratically elected local
councillors. This clause is an inadequate response to the consultation
that took place at the time. People in district, borough and unitary
authorities and other councils did not say, &#147;Abolish regional
assemblies and let us have this super-regional quango for the great and
the good.&#148; They said, &#147;Let&#146;s have real democracy
and accountability at a local level.&#148; Therefore, this clause
fails the test. We believe that it also fails in the context of joint
responsibilities for regional policy to address that democratic
deficit.</div><a name="0906177000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
it is appropriate to mention the British Chambers of Commerce, which
makes the point that the architecture being established by this clause
within the context of the wider Bill would weaken the sub-regional
planning role of local authorities and further undermine their capacity
to make decisions in the best interests of their local
residents.</div>
<a name="0906177000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, for
all those reasons, we are not minded to support the clause and we will
be voting against
it.</div><a name="0906177000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000553"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> We now come to the central dilemma at the heart of
the Government&#146;s policy. They believe that there has to be a
regional dimension&#151;an aspect of policy that is delivered in a
zone below that of the nation. The question is, how do we make that
dimension accountable? Ever since the election in the north-east, that
question has remained unanswered. A directly elected regional assembly
would have been an answer. That went down not just marginally but
hugely in the region that was assumed to be the most likely to vote in
favour of it. Some people might argue that it was defeated because the
powers given to the regional assembly were piddling&#151;about 6p in
the pound in terms of public expenditure. In fact the idea went down
for other reasons. It went down because people felt that there was
going to be another tier of politicians and they had enough tiers of
politicians already. Quite frankly, had the regional assembly been
endowed with the riches of Croesus and the wisdom of Solomon, I suspect
that it would still have been voted down in the
region.</div><a name="0906177000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000554"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Will the right hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="0906177000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000555"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> On the Bible or on the regional
assembly?</div><a name="0906177000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000556"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman think that part
of the reason why the assembly was voted down was perhaps that the
region did not make sense to the people who were being asked to vote to
make it democratically
accountable?</div><a name="0906177000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000557"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> What matters is that it was defeated. It was
defeated so heavily that that corpse will not come back to
life.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div><a name="0906177000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the
first outcome. The second way was to make the assembly directly
accountable to existing local democratic institutions. Broadly
speaking, that is a policy of my party, but the Government believe that
it is too diffuse and that one really has to have an alternative and
better form of accountability. The trouble is how to devise and deliver
it. If there is no regional assembly&#151;that has been removed from
the picture&#151;and one does not believe that local authorities have
the capacity or the scale to be able to do it, what is
left?</div>
<a name="0906177000369"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="0906177000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are now on our second or third attempt to find something left. We had
the regional assemblies with the nominated members, which have been
abolished by the Bill, and now we have the leaders&#146; board. We
envisage a somewhat curious mixture of a quango and people who are
indirectly elected to serve. They are not directly accountable; nobody
is going to vote for somebody to be a member of the leaders&#146;
board. They are going to vote for their councillor who may emerge as
the leader or, perhaps, as directly elected mayor, and they will then
represent them.</div>
<a name="0906177000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
immediately poses a series of questions, the first regarding the hybrid
of the quango and the elected councillors. Secondly, there is the
question of representation. I have already mentioned the south-east and
the existence of 77 councils, but I have just looked up another three
areas. In Yorkshire and Humber, which the Minister and I are most
familiar with, there are 22 councils. I suspect that two national parks
have to be added to that, so there are 24 elected bodies of one sort or
another. In the south-west of England, I make it 41
councils, and there will be national parks to add there as well. In the
north-west, we have 41 local authorities and they are quite different
in character. Yorkshire and Humber, in population terms, is weighted
towards the south and west of Yorkshire, which consists entirely of
metropolitan authorities. The district councils are very much
exclusively clustered in north Yorkshire. Much more scattered is the
south-west, where we have the new unitary councils, but the district
councils are much more predominant. In the south-east, of course, there
are huge numbers of district councils. The whole of old Lancashire is
still divided into district councils.</div>
<a name="0906177000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if
agreement can be made on who the leaders will be on the board&#151;in
Yorkshire and Humber I understand that the agreement is for eight
people to sit on it&#151;how do they then report back? It is one
thing for the leaders to have a congress of local authority leaders who
will choose their representatives to sit on the board, but it is quite
another for them to be accountable when they take decisions that might
not necessarily be popular. I am afraid that I am repeating myself when
I say that housing issues are always the most controversial. People get
most excited when they think that housing is being imposed on them. The
leaders have got to report back. How will that process of
accountability work? How will members be replaced if they do not
operate in, to use the Bill&#146;s words, an
&#147;effective&#148; way? I can see all sorts of difficulty with
that very indirect
accountability.</div><a name="0906177000291"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000558"></a>Ms

Gentleman promoting?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div><a name="0906177000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000559"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> There are a variety of alternatives. If a local
authority believes that it wishes to maintain an over-arching body, I
can see no reason why it should not be allowed to do that. We should
let 1,000 flowers bloom; we should not be deterministic in the
structures. If we are talking about the sub-regions, I would devolve
much more power to the city region. If we are going to have a city
region, such as Leeds or Manchester, it is absurd that the regional
development agency should not be specific to that area and co-operate
with other ones. It is nonsense that it should not have what it needs
to succeed. The learning and skills council can be brought under that
roof and, frankly, if I were the directly elected mayor of Leeds, I
would want my own police authority, because people would ask most
questions about law and order. The Government have not thought through
the relationship between the sub-regional strategy and the wider
regional strategy with which they are persisting. There is obviously a
lot of work to do to find structures that will work, but I would very
much want to invite local authorities to participate. They would
certainly want to work together. They are not going to act in an
entirely isolated
manner.</div>
<a name="0906177000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000560"></a>Ian
Stewart:</b> Some of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments resonate with my personal politics, but is he confident that
his Front-Bench team will agree with him and implement such a diverse
approach?</div><a name="0906177000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000561"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> It would be extraordinarily bold of any Back
Bencher to assume that his ideas have paramount influence with his
Front Bench team, but, if I may say so, I believe that the Tory Front
Bench is sensible and flexible, and that the experience of government
is a great educator. Given the task that would face any incoming
Government, it would be sensible to limit one&#146;s order of
priorities. I have every confidence that the policies will be
sufficiently pragmatic and that the emphasis will be on what is
workable. The Minister must not forget that we will be working with
predominantly Conservative local government, because even in Cornwall I
understand that the Labour party came fifth or sixth behind the Cornish
nationalists, which must be quite an achievement, even for that
party.</div>
<a name="0906177000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regional
development agencies are the other side of the equation. The truth of
the matter is that it is very difficult to say how successful they have

regeneration, I was always dubious about some of the claims that were
made. Characteristically they would be about jobs created; another
great claim was about jobs preserved. I always said, &#147;How do you
demonstrate that the actions of a regional development agency have
preserved or conserved jobs?&#148; It is somewhat speculative. How do
we know? No one has done any modelling to find out whether the money
devoted to regional development agencies would better have gone on
training, to try to enhance skills, or what would have happened if it
had gone into highways infrastructure. What would that have done for
the development of the region? We do not have that control, so we
should be cautious before making too absolute a claim for the regional
development agency.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div><a name="0906177000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, what
is being proposed, although it is quite bold, in a sense, is an attempt
to square the circle of getting some accountability into a
predetermined regional policy. I hope that, in so far as it will come
into effect before the next general election, and can show itself to be
workable, it can be seen in that perspective. However, I have doubts
about it.</div>
<a name="0906177000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000564"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Are my right hon. Friend&#146;s doubts
increased or decreased by the consideration of money? According to the
clause, the only money that the boards will have are sums delegated by
the Secretary of State. They will not have any control at all, that I
can see, over
money.</div><a name="0906177000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000565"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> That is certainly a factor, and there are also many
questions about how people are chosen, how the bodies will function,
and whether the meetings will take place in public. For example, one of
the perennial discussions in government is about whether there would be
replacements or substitutes, and a lot of that is left to the bodies to
decide.</div>
<a name="0906177000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000566"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am not quite clear whether the right hon.
Gentleman is agreeing with the point made by his Front-Bench spokesman,
which again is not quite clear to me. Is the suggestion being made that
the regional development agencies should be allowed to make a levy?
Otherwise, I do not understand the point about where the delegated
money would come from. If the suggested alternative is a levy, that is
interesting.</div><a name="0906177000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000567"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I am not aware of any policy that would endow the
regional development agencies with the ability to levy taxation, and I
am sure that my hon. Friend did not have that in mind, but if he were
to catch my eye I would allow him to clarify
it.</div><a name="0906177000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000568"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> The Minister has just demonstrated that she was
not listening carefully to an earlier part of the debate on the
economic assessments, in which we made it clear that, in her own terms,
this structure will not work. It is not a properly joined-up regional
structure. Were there to be one, we would, of course, not support it,
but like the economic assessments, which are completely free-floating
and do not feed into the machinery that she describes, these clauses
will not even have the effect that she
claims.</div><a name="0906177000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000569"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> The issue of accountability has not been cracked;
that is the top and bottom of it. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
No, because Yorkshire and Humber will have eight members of the
leaders&#146; board, and I think that I just quoted the number of
local councils as 22, which is relatively small. It is hugely more in
other parts of the world, and that will be a
problem.</div><a name="0906177000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
permit myself a small speculation about when the first great meeting
takes place. I assume that the members of the leaders&#146; board
will wear sashes, like French mayors, to show that they are members,
perhaps with a coat of arms, and there will be a fanfare. I can imagine
a suitable fanfare, and I think that, as they march up to the local
government office, the town hall, or perhaps the cathedral, choirs will
sing the &#147;Hallelujah&#148; chorus, &#147;Thus Spake
Zarathustra&#148;, &#147;Zadok the Priest&#148; or the triumphal
march from &#147;Aida&#148;, all of which will be appropriate music
as the members of the great local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>authority leaders&#146; board go to assume their great functions. I
should be pleased to hear about any other musical interpretations of
that
moment.</div><a name="0906177000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has simply got to answer the question. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>
I think we are going to come down in
tone.</div><a name="0906177000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000570"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I want the right hon. Gentleman to have the
opportunity to withdraw some sneering remarks about many of his own
councillors, who are doing a lot of work to make this structure
effective. They feel strongly about this and would feel insulted by his
dismissing them as wearing sashes, and all that
stuff.</div><a name="0906177000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000571"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> When I address the dinner of Conservative
councillors at the Local Government Association conference a week
tomorrow, no doubt they will tell me about it then, if they have
anything to be upset about. But the great virtue of the Conservative
councillors is their pragmatism, and they will work with the Government
of the day. The Minister is the last Labour Local Government Minister,
so they will, for the time being, work with her. When another Minister
comes along, they will work with him or her to develop structures that
they will, perhaps, feel are more appropriate. I have no doubt that
they might still invite me to address their
dinners.</div><a name="0906177000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000572"></a>Ian
Stewart:</b> Mr. Amess, you are aware that my
constituency of Eccles is to be abolished. We are abolished, as they
say. Nevertheless, it is my job, until the day of the next general
election, to represent the interests of my constituents. Therefore, I
want to ask the Minister some questions by way of
clarification.</div><a name="0906177000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
view, within my own personal politics, has always been that decisions
should be made at the most local, appropriate level. I am in line with
the choice agenda for individuals, but it is clear to every politician
of every party that strategic decisions need to be taken. Therefore the
most appropriate level needs to be found at which to make strategic
decisions as close to our constituents as
possible.</div><a name="0906177000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
sat on the Local Transport Bill Committee with my right hon. Friend the
Minister. That Bill not only took forward transport issues positively,
but it developed local democracy and decision making. My questions
relate to the impact of the consultation for integrated transport
authorities in respect of the clause. I would like to make three points
that I hope my right hon. Friend will take on board and perhaps
clarify.</div><a name="0906177000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
where two or more local authorities decide to undertake a review of the
Government&#146;s arrangements for both transport and economic
development in an area where there is an existing integrated transport
authority, the ITA should also be invited to participate in the review.
That is sensible and should be required because the ITA will have the
expert knowledge of the transport functions for which it is responsible
and which may be transferred to the new combined authority. Secondly,
the ITA is an existing sub-regional body and could bring valuable
knowledge and contributions on governance arrangements when operating
at that level. Thirdly, particularly where the review under the Bill is
for an area that encompasses only part of an ITA&#146;s area, the ITA
will need to advise on and understand the impact of any proposals. My
question, therefore, is that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>where the review area involves all or part of the ITA&#146;s
integrated transport area, will the ITA be invited to participate in
the
review?</div><a name="0906177000370"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="0906177000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point is designed to seek reassurance that the positive gains
made under the Local Transport Act 2008 are not diminished.
Where authorities undertake a review with the prospect of creating a
combined authority&#151;an authority that combines transport and
economic development powers sub-regionally&#151;I want them to take
into account any review of transport governance arrangements already
completed under the similar review provisions in the 2008 Act. That
would be required because a number of ITAs are already undertaking
reviews of transport governance arrangements for the sub-region. The
findings of those reviews will need to be considered in any review
under the Bill&#146;s provisions. A requirement to have regard to any
already completed review should make any further review more efficient.
I therefore want to ask whether authorities that undertake a review
under this provision will have regard to any relevant review of
transport carried out under the provisions of part 5 of the Local
Transport Act 2008 relating to all or part of the review area that was
completed in the 24 months preceding the commencement of a review under
this provision of the
Bill.</div><a name="0906177000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
will my right hon. Friend confirm whether those authorities that
commence a review of the transport and economic development governance
arrangements for an area will invite any authorities already
undertaking that for the same area, or part of it, to participate in
the review? It seems sensible not to have two reviews of the same issue
proceeding at the same time. If they are, it would make sense to have
joint participation and
co-ordination.</div><a name="0906177000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally,
the Bill&#146;s review of transport and economic development
governance should be informed by work already being undertaken by any
transport-only review under the Local Transport Act 2008. Again, for
clarification, my question is: where a review under this provision is
to be undertaken, and any part of the review area is the subject of an
ongoing review under part 5 of the Local Transport Act 2008, will the
authorities undertaking the Act&#146;s review be invited to
participate in the review to be undertaken under the
Bill?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000573"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> This interesting debate has given us an insight
into the perspectives of the different parties and, if I may say so,
the factions in one of those parties&#151;let me run through them.
The Conservative view was probably best expressed by the hon. Member
for Wycombe who said&#151;trenchantly I thought&#151;&#147;We do
not think this will work, but even if we were convinced that it would
work, we would still vote against it because we do not like
it.&#148;</div>
<a name="0906177000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000574"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Let me put it even more clearly for the right
hon. Gentleman: either there must be elected regional
assemblies&#151;and that is out
now&#151;</div><a name="0906177000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000575"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Oh?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div><a name="0906177000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000576"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I repeat that that is out now&#151;from
everyone&#146;s point of view. It always was from our point of view,
and now it is from the Minister&#146;s. Alternatively, there is a
bottom-up approach, but we cannot have this dog&#146;s breakfast in
the
middle.</div><a name="0906177000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000577"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I understand why the hon. Gentleman would like
to get away from his earlier formulation, but he will see it when he
reads <i class="I">Hansard.</i> It encapsulated the Thatcherite ideological
opposition to regionalism. We heard a rather different approach from
the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. It was characteristically
thoughtful&#151;</div><a name="0906177000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000578"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> Will the right hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="0906177000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000579"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Bear with me a moment. I realise that the hon.
Gentleman is probably miffed that I did not characterise his
perception, but I will give him a full opportunity to present it in a
moment. First, I shall give my view of the perception of the right hon.
Member for Skipton and Ripon. He understood the regional dimension and
that there are some matters that have to be dealt with at a level below
the national level and above the local level, so there has to be a
mechanism to allow that. However, he was not convinced that the current
proposal would work. I detected in that a traditional
Conservative Burkean approach of world-weary pessimism, which was
briefly lifted by a sudden ray of light when he had the vision of the
massed ranks of dignitaries gathering together in sashes,
with assembled choirs singing &#147;Hail the Conquering Hero
Comes&#148;, on his arrival to address the Conservative councillors
at their meeting next
week.</div><a name="0906177000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Liberal Democrats&#146; view, which was more or less shared between
the hon. Members for Falmouth and Camborne and for North Cornwall, was
that they liked the idea of regional government but not the current
blueprint. In particular, they do not like the current regions, and say
that until there is consensus between all local authorities as to what
constitutes the right region&#151;remember they have just advocated
an amendment suggesting that nothing should happen unless there is
total consensus&#151;nothing will happen, so they are the
&#147;nothing will happen&#148;
party.</div><a name="0906177000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against
this we have received in the post&#151;I hope all members of the
Committee have received it&#151;a very persuasive letter from the
chief executive of 4NW, the embryo leaders&#146; board for the
north-west region. It
says:</div><a name="0906177000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
am writing to let you know how 4NW has established itself as a Regional
Leaders Board in anticipation of the legislation that is being
considered by your
Committee&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0906177000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">not
my Committee, I hasten to add, but your Committee, Mr.
Amess. It
continues:</div><a name="0906177000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Local
Government in the North West has come together with senior
representatives from business and the third sector to form a genuinely
high level Regional Leaders
Board.&#148;</div><a name="0906177000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
includes the leaders of all the metropolitan authorities and county
councils in the area, the representatives of the chambers of commerce
and major businesses, the voluntary sector, trade unions and some
participating observers from other important agencies. That seems an
eminently practical way forward, which I
commend.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000580"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I was sorry that the right hon. Gentleman was not
able to speak in last night&#146;s debate in the House on business
rates because we missed his contribution. His argument does not take
account of the very simple fact that the Government seem to have tried
everything to meet the objections of my right hon. Friend the Member
for Skipton and Ripon regarding true local democracy. It is hard to
recognise the north-east of England as the ultra-Thatcherite wing of
the British people, but they had this debate in 2004. They discussed
the whole idea of regional government and comprehensively rejected it.
The Government are now inching towards some kind of compromise, but it
will not work.</div>
<a name="0906177000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000581"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I was much involved in that saga in the
north-east. On another occasion, when there is time, I will give a full
account of the reasons for the no vote. It was more complex than either
of the views of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and the
hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne. The particular formulation put
at that time, and the circumstances of the time, explain why the
north-east voted strongly no. It was not a rejection of regional
government per se, however, because, as the right hon. Member for
Skipton and Ripon recognises, there are important matters that need to
be dealt with at a level between the national and the local. Apart from
in London, where there was a decisive yes vote for a city-wide
authority&#151;to all intents and purposes a regional authority for
London&#151;there is no such mechanism in the
country.</div><a name="0906177000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
search for an appropriate solution is right. As I was illustrating, the
response of 4NW in the north-west seems to be an eminently practical
and pragmatic approach by the political leaders in that region to make
things work. I believe that it deserves our support. I am delighted
that they are approaching the matter in such a positive and inclusive
way. I commend their approach, and in particular support the
Government&#146;s persistence in recognising that the issue will not
go away and has to be dealt with. We must find practical ways to ensure
that those things that have to be decided between the national and
local levels are decided through an appropriate
framework.</div><a name="0906177000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000582"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before we continue with our debate on
clause 68, I wish to read something into the record concerning the
point that the hon. Member for Eccles asked the Minister to respond to.
I was not privy to a conversation that the hon. Member for Eccles had
with our excellent Clerk&#151;this is a get-out clause&#151;but I
was slightly confused when the hon. Gentleman moved from talking about
consultations to reviews. The main point that he clearly came on to was
entirely to do with clause 71. Quite what the Chair will do about that,
I am delighted to say, will be for my co-Chair, Mr. Eric
Illsley, to decide about later. I thought that I should put the matter
straight. We are debating clause 68 stand
part.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000583"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess. Perhaps I
ought to be absolutely clear with my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles,
because he raised some very important points about the relationship
with transport authorities. With your permission, I suggest that I
address the majority of those points a little later when we come to
part
6.</div><a name="0906177000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000584"></a>The

between the hon. Member for Eccles and the Clerk. The Minister is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906177000585"></a>Ian

would be worth hearing twice anyway. I assure my hon. Friend that we
shall come back to
that.</div><a name="0906177000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
that the debate has been interesting. It has shown the clear dividing
lines between what we are trying to do as a Government to support
economic development at national, regional and local levels, and the
attitude of the Conservative party, which seems to be to ignore
completely evidence about the need for intervention and strategic
planning at the regional level. Conservative Members&#146; objections
were, frankly, exposed as purely ideological and nothing to do with
recognising that it is vital that the measures that we are taking are
put into place, especially given the focus on the economic downturn. It
was disappointing that the Liberal Democrats could not even make up
their minds about what it was that they were trying to do, and just
ended up saying, &#147;Well, we sort of think that we might quite
like this, but actually let us vote with the Conservatives and put an
end to the real measures that we are trying to take in this
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="0906177000337"></a>
