<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000335"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that with this we are
discussing amendment No. 26, in clause 8, page 6, line 17, at end
insert</div> <a name="080624121000002"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and to the
provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child.&#146;.</div><a name="080624108000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000336"></a>The
Minister for Children, Young People and Families (Beverley
Hughes):</b> I had almost come to the end of my comments on
amendment No. 4. I was explaining how it would narrow the well-being
duty to a focus solely on safeguarding. We had an interchange about
whether the phrase &#147;having regard to&#148; diluted the
responsibilities under the duty. I shall clarify that for the
Committee.</div>
<a name="080624108000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the time,
I did not have a copy of the Children Act 2004 with me, only a copy of
the Children Act 1989, or I would have realised that subsection (5), in
referring to sections 10(2)(a) to (e) of the 2004 Act, simply refers to
the five elements of Every Child Matters, which I mentioned in my
earlier remarks. That adds weight to my argument that the clause
contains an unequivocal duty reflecting the five outcomes of Every
Child Matters as enshrined in legislation.</div>
<a name="080624108000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080624108000337"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): As the Minister
will be aware, the welfare checklist in section 1(3) of the 1989 Act
sets out not only the checklist but the &#147;have regard to&#148;
aspect as well. As a way of coming to a position where we are both
satisfied with the Bill&#146;s approach, it might be helpful for the
clause to say not only &#147;have regard to&#148; but, as in
section 1(3) of the 1989 Act,</div>
<a name="080624108000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have regard in
particular to&#148;.</div>
<a name="080624108000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems to marry
the proposed legislation with the reasons why it is proposed under
clause 8(5) in such stark terms as a responsibility and duty of the
Secretary of State. It would not only be consistent with previous
legislation, which contains a requirement to have regard in particular
to a certain aspect; it would also satisfy 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>Committee members from all parties in creating not only a duty but a
particular duty for the Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="080624108000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000338"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> Without embarking on a lengthy examination of
various Acts of Parliament relating to children, may I explain to the
hon. Gentleman that as we are talking about well-being, the relevant
piece of legislation is not the 1989 Act but the 2004 Act? Section 10
of that Act introduced a duty to co-operate to improve well-being. In
that measure, &#147;have regard to&#148;, which we debated earlier,
does not appear, so I am not quite sure what the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham was referring to when he seemed to remember
proposing it during the course of debates on that Act.</div>
<a name="080624108000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will simply put a duty on local authorities to promote well-being.
Without going too far into the minutiae and risking your censure,
Mr. Pope, I understand entirely what the hon. Member for
Crewe and Nantwich said. I simply say again to him that in terms of a
duty in respect of well-being, subsection (1) puts that duty
unequivocally on the Secretary of State, not a local authority or local
agency. Subsection (5) simply says that in executing that duty, the
Secretary of State must have regard to the five elements of Every Child
Matters, as listed in section 10(2) of the Children Act 2004. It is
like a double lock; the Secretary of State has a unequivocal duty, and
that duty must reflect the legislation as it applies to local
authorities and other agencies with regard to the whole
child&#151;not merely their safeguarding, important thought that is,
but also the other four aspects of the child&#146;s
well-being.</div><a name="080624108000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080624108000339"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): Clause 8(5) states
that the Secretary of State</div>
<a name="080624108000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must have
regard to the aspects of well-being mentioned in section
10(2)(a)&#148;.</div><a name="080624108000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not the same as discharging functions</div>
<a name="080624108000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in a manner
consistent with the objectives of safeguarding the welfare of
children&#148;.</div>
<a name="080624108000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could be argued
that the former is merely a guideline, with discretion on how to take
note of it, while the latter is a clear direction on how such discharge
functions should managed. Does the Minister not notice the
difference?</div><a name="080624108000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000340"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> We are turning words on a pinhead. I appreciate
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attempt to ensure that the Government are
serious, and I respect his right to do so, but I refer him to
subsection (1). As I said, it unequivocally states that it is the duty
of the Secretary of State to</div>
<a name="080624108000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promote the
well-being of children in
England.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
doing so, he has to have regard to the way in which well-being has been
defined by Members of this House in previous legislation. Together,
those two give us an assurance on how it will be undertaken.</div>
<a name="080624108000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that the record will show that, in introducing amendment No. 26, the
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said that we had not signed
up to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child.</div><a name="080624108000025"></a>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="080624108000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000342"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I beg the hon. Lady&#146;s pardon; I thought
that someone had said that we were not signed up to it. She will
know&#151;indeed, she may have said so&#151;that we have signed up
to the UNCRC. It was ratified a long time ago, and the present
Government do not demur from that international treaty. We therefore
have an obligation under international law to ensure that the rights
set out in the convention are given effect. However, the convention
does not include an obligation to meet the rights in any particular
way. It does not rely on provisions in domestic legislation, but the
obligation exists entirely independently. I am sure that the hon. Lady
will appreciate the fact that in practice UK law often goes further
than the convention in describing children&#146;s rights. The UNCRC
rights are set out in very broad terms, whereas our legislation gives
children specific rights on a range of issues.</div>
<a name="080624108000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We take the
implementation of the UNCRC seriously, but since ratification and under
Governments of different complexions our policy has always been that
the convention should be implemented through a mix of legislative
provisions and policy initiatives. Implementation of the convention
rights comes about through Government and devolved Administration
policy, taken as a whole.</div>
<a name="080624108000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We aim to
meet our duties under the convention through the totality of our
activities, rather than making reference to it in individual
legislative provisions. That is the stance that we have taken. Since
ratification, the Government have diligently pursued implementation of
the UNCRC through a raft of measures, including the Children Act 1989
and subsequent provisions, the Children Act 2004, Every Child Matters
and more recently the wealth of measures set out in the
children&#146;s plan. All those programmes are steadily improving the
well-being outcomes for all children and thus the fuller realisation of
their UNCRC rights.</div>
<a name="080624108000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000343"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> First, I assure the Minister that I did indeed say
that the previous Government had signed up to the convention, so I gave
credit where it was due. Is the Minister expecting a completely clean
bill of health when the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the
Child reports back on the evidence supplied by the Government and
others, including the four children&#146;s
commissioners?</div><a name="080624108000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000344"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> We will await the view of the UNCRC, but we have
certainly made a strong case that the Government have progressively
improved the position of children and young people in relation to all
aspects of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and aim to
continue to go further, so we will have to see the outcome of those
different points of view as they are put to that committee.</div>
<a name="080624108000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
Secretary of State&#146;s duty to promote the well-being of children
clearly encompasses the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights
of the Child, and I think that the duty, just as it stands, creates an
additional legislative vehicle by which the Secretary of State will
carry out activities and bring forward policy and practice that will
implement the convention. Therefore, what matters most is giving
children that good experience of childhood and having a Government who
progressively want to go further to promote the well-being of children,
rather than conforming by referring to the convention in every single
piece of legislation or going through the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>arduous process of incorporating it all together in one big piece of
legislation, which would frankly be a completely fruitless
task.</div>
<a name="080624108000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that the hon. Lady and I agree on the importance of the convention and
our desire to give children and young people rights that go far beyond
those of the convention, but I accept that we might disagree on how
best to demonstrate that that is being done, particularly if she is
arguing that references to the UNCRC are needed in every piece of
legislation. The Government do not think that that is necessary, but we
are none the less committed to those rights for our children and young
people and will continue to be so. With those assurances, I hope that
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="080624108000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080624108000345"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): I have
somewhat lost the train of thought from where we started before lunch.
Now that we are getting into the particulars of &#147;having
particular regard&#148;, which I thought was a particularly ingenious
suggestion by my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich and one
that showed the willingness of the Opposition to come to some
accommodation with the Government to improve the Bill&#146;s
terminology. I am still not quite convinced how the Minister deems not
replacing &#147;having regard&#148; with a clear positive duty to
promote the well-being is just as adequate. However, we have had quite
an interesting canter round the subject and should move on to something
fresh. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080624108000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000346"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> We have explored the Government&#146;s intention
in that regard and that Members, notwithstanding the previous debate,
welcome the fact that a parallel duty to promote young people&#146;s
wider well-being has been added to the Secretary of State&#146;s duty
to promote the educational opportunities for them. One consequence on
which we have not yet touched is the fact that the clause will enable
the Secretary of State to enter into legal contracts to promote the
well-being of
children.</div><a name="080624108000309"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="080624108000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080624108000347"></a><b class="B">Helen
Southworth</b> (Warrington, South) (Lab): I am pleased to
serve on a Committee so ably chaired by one who is such a strong
advocate of vulnerable children. I welcome the clause, because although
the well-being of children and young people is by all means the
responsibility of the Secretary of State, it is good to be part of a
Committee that is making that so explicit. The clause refers to the
Secretary of State&#146;s powers to promote the well-being
of</div><a name="080624108000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;persons
under the age of 25 of a prescribed
description.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister ensure that children and young people who have run away
from home or been thrown away from home are given consideration under
regulations in that respect, particularly in view of the excellent
runaways action plan launched by the Department last week and the
commitments that that will bring over the following months and possibly
years to support children who run away?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="080624108000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister take particular account of the &#147;Stepping Up&#148;
report, which was produced by the Children&#146;s Society for the
Department? Following extensive consultation, that document identified
the fact that some local
authorities</div><a name="080624108000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reported
unwritten policies of refusing any accommodation for thirteen to
fifteen year olds. Police were keen to emphasise that they would raise
concerns with social services but some local authority colleagues
reported that teenagers were unlikely to receive support unless the
level of risk was so high as to cause concern of risk to
life.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
appears to mean that if there is a valid cause for concern about the
well-being of young people who have run away from home but it does not
raise concern about a risk to life, those young people are, in many
local authority areas, not being considered for looked-after status and
therefore will not receive the benefit of many of the extremely
valuable measures being put in place by the Bill. Will the Minister
ensure that that set of young people is given full consideration under
subsection (4)(b)? Can she identify for us whether she will
be able to take that matter into consideration when regulations are
made under the
clause?</div><a name="080624108000041"></a>

Hughes:</b> I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution. It
was through her sustained, dogged and very committed work that the
action plan for young runaways was eventually brought forward. I
commend her involvement in that. Let me just point out a couple of
things. The prescribed persons referred to in subsection
(4)(b) will, by definition, be young people aged 18 to 25. Younger
people&#151;the 15-year-olds whom she was talking about in relation
to some local authorities&#146; apparently informal yardsticks for
intervention&#151;would be covered, as far as the Secretary of
State&#146;s duties were concerned, by the clause as it stands,
because they are under 18 and the Secretary of State will have a duty
to promote their well-being, as he will to promote the well-being of
any
children.</div><a name="080624108000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the prescribed groups in particular, we have no immediate
plans as to how that might apply, but as my hon. Friend implied, we
would have to introduce regulations if we were considering applying the
measure to any of those groups and we would consult on the regulations
before we did so. I hope that, with those assurances, she will accept
that this issue is very much in our mind. Young people under 18 will be
covered. In relation to any other groups, we are considering at the
moment how far they might be
included.</div><a name="080624108000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

the House of Lords, it deals with the mechanics of how children in care

where the child comes from and about trying to maintain continuity of
education and so on. That goes to the heart of what the Bill is about
and is very welcome to the whole Committee and to those of us who over
many years have drawn attention to the enormous disruption caused by
the lack of stability in the life of a child in the care system, which
can only exacerbate the many problems that such a child will already
have. We welcome very much the level of commitment that clause 9
indicates, but once again we want to try to tighten the provision to
get some greater definition in the

No. 6 relates to the proposed new section 22C(7) that
section 9 would insert into the Children Act 1989, which is about the
hierarchy of extended family members. Many of us would agree that some
such form of hierarchy is needed for children who must be taken from
their birth parents or parent into care, for however long a time, and
that wherever possible, the best alternative, if there is no threat of
harm to the child, is for them to be placed with another family member,
close relative or close friend&#151;someone with whom there is
already familiarity and a relationship of trust. Failing that, the next
choice would be non-related foster parents or perhaps specialist foster
parents, if the child has complex needs or disabilities, or other kinds
of foster parents, and then, if those were not available, and if it was
appropriate, placement in a residential care
environment.</div><a name="080624108000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
many cases, the residential care environment might be the best option.
I do not in any way mean to put it at the bottom of the pile, but many
of us have seen children who have been sent first to residential care
simply because of the unavailability of suitable foster care closer to
home. I hope that we can get the right balance in the future, but it
must be horses for courses, and a question of what is in the best
interests of the
child.</div><a name="080624108000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
proposed new section 22C(6) of the 1989 Act, the Government have set
out what they mean by an extended family placement, defining it
as</div><a name="080624108000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;placement
with an individual who is a relative, friend or other person connected
with&#148;</div><a name="080624108000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
child, who has been recommended by the local authority. We are trying
to make that the absolute default position, and to require that if it
is not possible the fact should be properly accounted for.</div>
<a name="080624108000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
finding a placement with a kinship carer has for some considerable time
been a preference&#151;kinship care is described in section 17 of the
Children Act 1989&#151;in too many cases, it is still not happening.
There have been various studies, perhaps the most definitive of which
suggested that only 4 per cent. of placements initiated by social
workers are with an extended family member who comes within the
provisions of new section 22C(6). I think that I pointed out
earlier the contrast with places such as Denmark, where some
45 per cent. of such foster care placements are with
extended family members. There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy. Yet
it has been estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 children in this
country are living 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>with relatives who are not their parents, and only a small proportion of
those are looked-after children. That has implications, of course, for
private fostering registration schemes, which we shall be returning to
later in our consideration of the Bill, if some of us get our
way.</div><a name="080624108000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
people acknowledge that there are clear advantages to kinship caring
and placements with family members. The Family Rights Group has set
some of those out in its brief, which it has provided to hon. Members.
The brief details well-evidenced advantages in children who cannot live
with their parents being raised by family and friends. It lists those
advantages:</div><a name="080624108000053"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Children
in family and friends care tend to be in more stable placements that
those placed with unrelated foster
carers.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Children
feel loved and report high levels of
satisfaction.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Children
appear to be as safe and their behaviour is perceived to be less of a
problem when compared to children with unrelated foster
carers.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Children
placed within their family can more easily maintain a sense of family
and cultural
identity.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Contact
with family members is more likely to be
maintained.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
that arrangement presses a lot of the right buttons. Familiarity with
the carers tends to lead to greater short-term and long-term stability.
For children who come from particularly traumatic family homes, a
second chance of a stable upbringing is absolutely what they
need.</div><a name="080624108000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are some difficulties, which the Family Rights Group has also pointed
out. A few of those
are:</div><a name="080624108000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Family
and friends carers are more likely to be older, in poorer health and in
more disadvantaged circumstances when compared to unrelated foster
carers, yet receive significantly less
support.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
family and friends carers incur large legal costs in securing the care
of children at risk of ill
treatment.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that many hon. Members will have had such cases in their
constituency surgeries, often grandparents who want to take on
responsibility for a grandchild whose parent has typically had drug or
drink problems and is unable to look after the child. However, they
face an uphill battle, struggling to make the case that they are
capable of looking after the child to a social worker, to the local
authority, and then having to go through the legal rigmarole,
especially if it may ultimately be an adoptive placement. We should
surely be making it easier rather than harder for people who are
prepared to step into the breach and take on a child who would
otherwise fall exclusively on the public purse, either with a
non-related foster carer or in a home, at much greater expense and with
much less chance of
stability.</div><a name="080624108000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
group also points
out:</div><a name="080624108000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are wide variations between local authorities in policies, support,
finance and attitudes toward family and friends care, and in numbers of
children placed with family and
friends&#148;.</div><a name="080624108000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Access
and entitlement to support, including financial support is based on
legal status and not on need, resulting in some carers suffering
significant financial
hardship.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Assessment
depends on legal status rather than need, thus risking inconsistent and
inappropriate assessments. Some family and friends carers are subject
to full fostering assessments that are essentially geared to non
relatives while others have no
assessment.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not make some of those placements as easy as we might, and there is
a big differential in how they are treated in different parts of the
country. Surely we need to send out a clear signal with this Bill that
that group 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>of people should be given preference wherever
possible, where it is in the interests of the child and where there is
no risk to the child. Obviously, if part of the reason for removing a
child from a family is the interference of extended family members who
have exacerbated the problem, such a placement would not be in the best
interests of the child. However, there are often other extended family
members who could step into the breach. It is a mystery to me why that
form of placement does not happen more readily in this country,
compared with other countries. I have already referred to
Denmark.</div><a name="080624108000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
brief we received from the National Children&#146;s Bureau presented
a few potential answers to the question of what the barriers to using
kinship carers may be. It mentions
that</div><a name="080624108000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;social
worker power can be lessened by kin
placements.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
some social workers see them as a bit of a challenge? Is it much easier
to take the child completely away from a family environment, to give
them a completely clean break in a placement with a foster carer
directly employed by the local authority and with no connection to the
family? The brief also mentions
that</div><a name="080624108000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
complexity of family relationships and kin
loyalties&#148;</div><a name="080624108000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">are
considered</div><a name="080624108000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;more
difficult to work with than non-kin foster
care.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
that because social workers have such an enormous work load? We
described earlier the great stresses on them and it is less likely to
be problematic if a child is placed with a non-related foster carer. In
many cases, do social
workers</div><a name="080624108000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;see
kin as part of the problem, rather than the solution, and therefore not
favour such
placements&#148;?</div><a name="080624108000310"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

NCB relates a number of studies that have been carried out, in both the
US and the UK. It claims that several studies show fewer reported
behavioural
problems</div><a name="080624108000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
children in kinship care compared to those in non-related foster care,
and kinship caregivers tend to see themselves in more of a parenting
role than do non-related caregivers and recognise the importance of
their role in facilitating the child&#146;s relationship with its
family.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
child has a better chance of returning to the family home with the
birth parents or parent if extended family members are used&#151;for
example, if a mother with a drink or drug problem goes through
rehabilitation and can take on the parental role
again.</div><a name="080624108000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
family drug and alcohol court being trialled in Wells street by
District Judge Crichton is an interesting experiment, which is based on
an idea from California. The Government, to give them their due, have
recently agreed to fund that pilot. I have seen videos from one of the
courts in Santa Barbara or Santa Monica and it is a very interesting
approach. The parents typically have a drink or drug problem and face
care proceedings. In the past, the parent may have been given a last
chance to get their act together or else the child would be taken into
care. However, to get his or her act together that parent needs
rehabilitation for the drink or drug problem, medical treatment, and
often housing assistance as well. If a person is not in stable
accommodation, they often go off the rails and other problems that are
symptomatic of the underlying difficulty may come into the
open.</div><a name="080624108000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
judge in the family drug courts assembles a group of professionals from
various agencies&#151;the local council, housing authority, health
authority, drug 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>rehabilitation service, social services and perhaps
somebody from an education environment&#151;to put together a package
of care that should enable that person to rehabilitate themselves, if,
when faced with the threat of losing a child into the care system, they
are serious about wanting to do so. That is the last chance saloon.
They will be enabled to rehabilitate themselves, and, if they show
themselves as being up to the job and take advantage of the package of
care, the child will be able to stay with that
parent.</div><a name="080624108000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
holistic approach is very exciting. I am sure that the pilots in Wells
street will be successful. Too often we look at the problems in
isolation and tackle the symptoms rather than the root causes, which
can result in parents in miserable circumstances facing the tragedy of
losing a child. Often the support of an extended family member, or even
respite care in a temporary placement, can aid somebody to get the
treatment and assistance that they need to get their act together so
that they can recover sufficiently to get their child back. Kinship
carers are key on all levels of temporary or long-term placement and
support.</div>
<a name="080624108000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment says that the default position must be that a far more
extensive pursuit of a family or friend placement should be undertaken.
If, after an exhaustive pursuit of that placement, it is not possible
to place the
child</div><a name="080624108000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with
an individual who is a relative, friend or other person connected
with&#148;</div><a name="080624108000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">them,
as set out in new section 22C (6), a written explanation should be
provided and made available to the relevant parties.</div>
<a name="080624108000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">We speak to
people whose children have been taken into the care system. I quoted
the Ofsted report, which said that birth parents do not feel that they
have been engaged in the process and do not understand why their
children have been taken away or why they have been placed with
somebody completely detached from the family, particularly if there is
a family member&#151;typically the child&#146;s
grandparent&#151;who is prepared to take on the responsibility. It is
perfectly reasonable to place a specific requirement on the social
worker responsible for the child to submit a written explanation if it
is not possible to place the child within the terms of subsection
(6)(a). They should account for why that was not possible and outline
under what terms it might be possible to do so in
future.</div><a name="080624108000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to strengthen what the Government are trying to do under the
connected persons provision and ensure that there is an increase in the
4 per cent. of placements that are currently made with kinship carers.
If that is not increased, we need to know why. I do not know, and I am
sure that the Minister does not know, why we do not have more kinship
placements. That is the reason for the amendment and I commend it to
the
Committee.</div><a name="080624108000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000350"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I genuinely have no difficulty with the spirit of
the amendment. I hope that I can explain how the extra leverage that
the hon. Gentleman proposes through the requirement of a written record
is accommodated in the care planning system that is being established.
According to the figures that I have been given, 9 per cent. of
looked-after children are placed with parents and a further 11 per
cent. live with related 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>foster carers. That is 20 per cent altogether. It is not enough, but it
is rather more than the 4 per cent. that he
mentioned.</div><a name="080624108000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is extremely important that local authorities make the right placement
decisions for the children that they look after. Such decisions go
right to the heart of whether they are providing the best possible
care. They will affect the ability of those children to maintain
relationships with their birth families, their friends and their local
communities. They will affect their chances of reunification. They will
also impact on their progress in the longer
term.</div><a name="080624108000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Enabling
children to live with people who they know and trust wherever possible
is key to influencing their life chances for the better. If they cannot
live with their parents, the arrangements should first and foremost be
with family and friends for those within and outside the care system.
The Bill provides a clear hierarchical framework to support such
arrangements while allowing flexibility for decisions that reflect
individual circumstances. We have to do that and I know that hon.
Members will appreciate why. The continuing role of family and friends
as carers is one the key factors that will be taken into account. Most
importantly, placement decisions should be made in the interests of the
child.</div><a name="080624108000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman said, clause 9 is the product of much consultation
and of detailed consideration by many experienced people in the other
place. As it is crafted, it will ensure that decisions are made in the
way that I have described. It includes much of section 23 of the 1989
Act, but it is much clearer about the kind of considerations that will
apply to placement
decisions.</div><a name="080624108000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
placement with parents is not possible, the clause requires a local
authority to place the child in the most appropriate placement
available. The determination of that is subject to a number of
constraints. First, subsection (7) requires that the decision be taken
in accordance with the local authority&#146;s other duties under part
III of the 1989 Act, with particular regard to their duties under
section 22 to safeguard and promote the child&#146;s welfare, to
ascertain and give due consideration to the child&#146;s wishes and
feelings and to those of other relevant
persons.</div><a name="080624108000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am setting out the sequence of the legislation and how it works
together to provide clarity. When considering the placement options
available to it, the local authority must give first preference to
placement with a relative, friend or other person connected with the
child. That reflects our commitment to the principle that children
should, wherever possible, be brought up in their own families and
communities.</div>
<a name="080624108000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes,
such placements will not be in the child&#146;s interests, and
although we recognise that they might not always be possible, we must
make a real push to ensure that local authorities always consider the
potential for relatives or friends to care for the child. They should
not only do that at the first stage of decision making, but revisit the
issue at every subsequent stage. That reflects the commitment that we
made in the &#147;Care Matters&#148; White Paper to put in place a
gateway approach, and that is what I want to see. At every stage of the
process, there should be a gateway mentality, with people asking
whether the child should be with family and
friends.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000351"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I am listening carefully, but could the Minister
outline the process from the point when we introduce the Bill? How will
this new culture&#151;the new regulations&#151;operate in practice?
Some authorities are excellent at dealing with such issues, but the
good practice is not spreading, and I do not feel that simply
introducing the legislation is enough. What back-up actions is the
Minister thinking of?</div>
<a name="080624108000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000352"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> That is an important point that goes to the heart
of my response to the amendment. The back-up procedures that we are
putting in place will start to inculcate what the hon. Lady rightly
calls a change of culture, which is what is needed in some local
authorities.</div>
<a name="080624108000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
as part of making the proposals a reality, we published the new volume
1 of the court order guidance in January. The guidance introduced a
requirement that relatives and friends should, as far as possible, be
considered as potential carers in all cases, as part of the care plan
that is lodged with the court at the outset of care proceedings. About
60 per cent. of children are looked after as a result of going through
court proceedings, so we have a potentially strong lever here. The
guidance that the courts now have makes it clear that they are required
to check that the care plan has thoroughly examined and assessed
whether there is a possibility of the child living with family or a
friend. If not, the courts are required to ask why not. That is one
important lever.</div>
<a name="080624108000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
important lever, which relates to the proposal in the amendment, is
that all local authorities are now required to use the integrated
children&#146;s system. That is an electronic system or template
setting out in great detail the content of the care plan. Under the
ICS, the care plan for a looked-after child requires the social worker
to record evidence of the wider family&#146;s capacity to care for
the child as one of the family and environmental factors. That includes
the practical efforts that have been made to ensure that such
placements could happen.</div>
<a name="080624108000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
intention is to make kinship care a reality in practice, and all of us
on the Committee share that intention. Under the ICS, we are requiring
social workers&#151;this is true of all the care plan, but
particularly where children do not go through the court processes and
the court does not examine these issues&#151;not only to mention
their assessment of the wider family&#146;s capacity to care for the
child, but to give evidence in a particular place in the care plan to
support that assessment.</div>
<a name="080624108000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000353"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Can the Minister tell us who that evidence will
be available to?</div>
<a name="080624108000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000354"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> It will be recorded in the care plan, so it will
be available to the social worker&#146;s supervisors, but it will
also be available and very clearly evident to the independent reviewing
officer, who will be able to see easily whether the questions about the
potential for family care have been examined thoroughly and, if the
child is not to be placed there, why
not.</div><a name="080624108000311"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="080624108000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000355"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I know that we will address this matter later
during debate on different subjects, but is there a case for making
that evidence available in some version to the potential kinship carers
too?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="080624108000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000356"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> The guidance that we produce&#151;we are
rewriting all the guidance&#151;will also require social workers to
notify the parents in writing about the care plan, as well as the
child, other carers, representatives of other agencies involved with
the child and others with a sufficient interest in the child. There is
an intention to notify them, if not of the contents of the document
itself&#151;I will get a specific answer on that&#151;certainly of
the conclusions of the care plan and why they have been
drawn.</div><a name="080624108000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that we agree completely that the decision-making process
relating to that question needs to be clearly recorded and easily
accessible by the other people within the system, including the IRO,
the court, the child&#146;s parents and carers and the child himself
or herself. Through those two processes&#151;the court process and,
more generally for all children, the requirement to record the care
plan in the ICS&#151;that record will already be included.</div>
<a name="080624108000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
will not stop there. As I have explained, the significance of clause 9
is that we are bringing together all the requirements for care planning
in one set of regulations. As we update the statutory guidance and
develop those regulations to drive forward practice&#151;that is the
issue, as hon. Members have rightly said&#151;as part of the delivery
of the &#147;Care Matters&#148; programme, we will ensure that the
requirements in clause 9 to consider family placements are fully
reflected in the new guidance and regulations and that they mirror what
we have included in the revised court order guidance where children are
subject to family proceedings.</div>
<a name="080624108000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000357"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I just want to check whether a particular
situation would be covered in regulations. I have a case involving a
grandparent who is too ill and too old to take on long-term care of the
child. The grandparent accepts that the child cannot stay. The child is
likely to go to foster care and maybe, eventually, to adoption, but my
constituent would like to remain the child&#146;s grandmother
throughout. It has been difficult to argue that with the local
authority. Can Minister tell me whether the regulations can give me any
comfort? It is another layer where a grandparent might lose their
status, and there is no reason why they
should.</div><a name="080624108000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000358"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> As the hon. Lady will appreciate, it is difficult
to comment on individual cases. I do not know why that child is in
care, whether there were any safeguarding issues with the family or
anything else, but it is in the spirit of what we are including in the
Bill and my passionate belief that we must enable children to keep
their links with their birth family wherever and whenever that is
conducive to their well-being. If that particular case gets to the
adoption stage, issues will need to be worked out about adoptive
parents and how that can be managed. However, in many cases, adopted
children, with the agreement of all concerned, now keep in contact with
their wider birth family. I would certainly like to see that trend
continued and
developed.</div><a name="080624108000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I agree completely with the two main arguments put by the
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about the importance of
enabling contact and enabling children as far as possible to live with
family members or friends and the importance of maintaining effective
records of decisions. The record should be one of the levers that keep
the system charged 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>and focused on the importance of the question and of
considering it carefully for each child. Although he was a little
sceptical and thought that I was going to brush aside his comments, I
hope that he accepts that I agree with the spirit of the amendment and
that we have provided for what the amendment would require in the
various recording arrangements that are already embedded in the system.
To require a separate written report outside that system would add to
the bureaucracy and the need to use laptops when we are trying to
streamline the system so that social workers can keep proper records in
a way that reduces the record-keeping demands on
them.</div><a name="080624108000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000359"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Before the Minister finishes, will she give her
view of why such record keeping is not happening now? We can agree or
disagree about whether it will happen after the changes, but why is it
not happening more
now?</div><a name="080624108000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000360"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I do not think that I can provide better evidence
than the speculations in the research cited by the hon. Gentleman. The
practice is very good in some local authorities. The reasons that he
cited from the NCH can be felt in some local authorities and one can
feel that it is more difficult for social workers in those authorities.
It is a reality that they have to untangle and make sense of what might
be long histories of relationships between adults in the families.
There may be difficulties between potential carers and the parents.
Within that, the social workers have to determine what is in the
child&#146;s interests. I am not arguing that social workers should
not try to work through those issues, but I can understand that making
good decisions can seem difficult for
them.</div><a name="080624108000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may be that there is genuine antipathy towards family care in some
places. We have to cut through that completely and make a very strong
statement that this is what children say that they want and that this
is what we know is in the best interests of children. I hope that, with
the support of Committee members, we will start to inculcate the change
of culture that is clearly necessary through the provisions of the
Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept those points and my
assurances and will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080624108000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000361"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> We have had a useful, short debate on this
important subject. I am pleased that the Minister shares my enthusiasm
for the concept, if not for the terminology of the
amendment.</div><a name="080624108000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are clear discrepancies in the evidence. I quoted from the Farmer and
Moyers research, which found that social workers initiated only 4 per
cent. of family and friends placements. I have seen other research by
grandparents&#146; groups, which suggests that it is as low as 1 per
cent. Other research suggests that the figure is 11 or 12
per
cent.</div><a name="080624108000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are also big discrepancies between local authorities, which is a real
problem. This issue goes back to the tables of differential multiple
placement records. A child who needs to be placed into the care of a
local authority faces the same sort of problems whether in Cornwall,
Stoke or Barnet, which are the three authorities that we cited earlier.
The problems may be of a different magnitude, but interestingly, the
research that I quoted suggests that there tends to be a greater
willingness for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>extended family members to come forward as potential
carers in more deprived areas. It is a problem on a number of levels
that certain local authorities have different experiences and produce
very different outcomes in how they place or look after the children in
the care system, whether in foster care, kinship care or whatever. That
merits closer assessment by the
Government.</div><a name="080624108000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am assured by the Minister that what I am trying to achieve is already
being put in place. However, it is important that the message goes out
from this short debate that this issue is a priority. It is not just
another piece of paper on which the social worker responsible is
supposed to tick various boxes; it is an important
priority.</div><a name="080624108000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000362"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Will my hon. Friend remind me of the
Government&#146;s figures that apparently balance his 11 per cent.
down to 1 per
cent.?</div><a name="080624108000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000363"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I cannot remember what the Minister said. Would
she like to remind us what the figures were, or has she forgotten as
well? [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Anyway, there are big discrepancies among
all the different figures. The Government might like to undertake
research to get to the bottom of it and why it is going on.
[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] We will read it in <i class="I">Hansard
</i>tomorrow.</div><a name="080624108000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
clear directive needs to go out as part of the guidance within the ICS.
A culture change is required, which is why the thrust of the amendment
was that it must be the default position, without which the responsible
social worker must be forced to make a serious assessment of why it was
not possible. The reason why I also queried whether that should be
available in some form to the parents as well goes back to the Ofsted
study that I quoted earlier. Parents and extended family members feel
very much in the dark about why decisions have been taken. Many of the
cases that we get in our surgeries involve grandparents who cannot
understand why they have been rejected as foster carers or even
adoptive parents when, on the face of it, they are the ideal person.
Are they just getting the brush-off from a social worker who may be
lazy, risk-averse or completely stressed out for all sorts of other
reasons and unable to give the priority suggested in the
directions?</div><a name="080624108000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basis that the Minister has said that there will be a culture
change and we will hopefully start to see a radical improvement in the
figures, which in turn will lead to greater stability among the
placements so that there will be fewer placements with fewer different,
unconnected bodies, I am happy to take her at her word. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080624108000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000366"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> It is me again, I am afraid. The amendments all
deal with clause 9, but now we move to the also vital subject of
siblings. Again, we may bandy around figures, but one thing is
accepted&#151;the Minister alluded to it just now, as did
I&#151;about connections with birth family members: it is absolutely
essential that wherever possible, a child should be able to benefit
from continued contact with a sibling, whether or not they are taken
into
care.</div><a name="080624108000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we know, in certain families, some children are taken into the care
system and some remain with the birth family. In the worst
circumstances, children can be spread among different care placements.
Surely it must be a fundamental principle that wherever possible, if
there is more than one child, it is in the children&#146;s best
interests that they should be placed together. That puts great pressure
on foster placements. If four children are taken away from a family, it
is not easy to find a specialist foster placement for them,
particularly if they have challenging behavioural problems or learning
disabilities or a particular ethnic background that needs to be taken
into account. However, surely the preferred position&#151;it is what
is supposed to happen&#151;must be that those siblings should remain
together.</div><a name="080624108000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause and proposed new section 22C(8) give a hierarchy of priorities.
A child should be able to be kept near their home and may be
prioritised for placement with a sibling wherever possible. The
terminology could be misconstrued. That is why amendment No. 7 suggests
adding the words &#147;or siblings&#148;. Technically, my reading
of it is that subsection (8) refers to only one sibling even if a child
is part of a group of three or more siblings. For completeness and to
avoid misinterpretation, we suggest that subsection (8)(c) should
state:</div><a name="080624108000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
C has a sibling or siblings for whom the local authority are also
providing
accommodation&#148;.</div><a name="080624108000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the technical purpose of amendment No.
7.</div>
<a name="080624108000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="080624108000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to amendment No. 8. Subsection (8) refers to siblings being able
&#147;to live together&#148;. What does that mean? Does it mean
that they are together for one day? Does it mean that they see each
other occasionally, that they are close by but are still
&#147;together&#148;? That, again, could be misinterpreted. What is
meant by the subsection is that the children should be placed together
in the same placement, with the same foster family or in the same
kinship arrangement, in the same premises. We therefore suggest that
instead of the siblings living together they should
be</div><a name="080624108000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;placed
together and maintain that placement for as long as is reasonably
practicable&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div><a name="080624108000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
a strict reading of the provision, an authority that put those two or
more children together for a day or a week would have fulfilled that
qualification. I am sure that it is the Government&#146;s intention
that they should be placed together for as long as possible, in order
to provide stability.</div>
<a name="080624108000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
points of clarification. The amendments would not take anything away
from the Bill, but they would make what is intended more

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000368"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The hon. Gentleman is being uncharacteristically
churlish. I started by saying clearly that the clause was welcome. It
has been rewritten and greatly improved. We very much approve and
support, as I have said, the hierarchy of kinship care. We approve of
the detail on putting siblings together. I am trying to improve it
further, in order to ensure that it is not open to misinterpretation.
The hon. Gentleman and I share the same goal. Although it is always
good to hear from him, he is being slightly churlish at this juncture.
I am trying to give credit where credit is due.</div>
<a name="080624108000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4
takes a belt-and-braces approach. It places a duty on an authority to
&#147;take all reasonable steps&#148; to ensure that if the
siblings cannot be placed together because of problems&#151;the
siblings may have suffered a traumatic time and cannot live together;
that may be one reason why the home has broken down&#151;whenever
possible there should be the means for those siblings to keep contact
if they desire it. Again, both sides have spoken of the desirability of
retaining some family contact whenever possible. The local authority
should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the child can
&#147;maintain contact&#148; with other siblings, but with the
get-out provision in subsection (3) that if the child does not want it,
it will not be forced on
them.</div><a name="080624108000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000369"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I rise to ask the hon. Gentleman about a welfare
get-out from contact between siblings. I very much support his
point&#151;indeed, I hope to speak in a moment to a new clause on
sibling contact&#151;but we would not want to force sibling contact
when it is contrary to a child&#146;s welfare. Clearly, we are not
going to force them to live together if it is against their welfare,
and new clause 4 recognises that point with its proposed new section
34A(1) of the Children Act 1989. However, the Bill does not say that
there would be contact subject to the welfare of the child. It refers
to &#147;taking all reasonable steps&#148;, and we could argue that
it would not be reasonable to enable contact if it were against the
child&#146;s welfare. However, that is not explicit in the Bill. The
hon. Gentleman just said that his proposal has a proviso about consent
but it is not the same as the welfare of the child. Does he agree that
there is a bit missing from the Bill?</div>
<a name="080624108000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000370"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Yes. That is a good point. The Minister has lots
of civil servants who could go through the detail of the Bill, and
somewhere the terminology will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>demonstrate that it involves the welfare of the child rather than just
consent. The hon. Gentleman is quite right to raise the issue, and I
can envisage a situation in which a young boy wants to see his sister
and has no objection to it, but the child may have been separated
because, for example, there was some inappropriate sexual behaviour
between the two and it would not therefore be in the best interests of
the welfare of the child for those two children to be brought together
occasionally. The question is not just about objecting because the
child does not want contact; there is a welfare factor in respect of
both children or more siblings. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right,
and perhaps in his amendment he will take account of it, too. I
entirely take his point on board.</div>
<a name="080624108000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
wider issue within the amendments, too. Local authorities should not
just enable contact; they should promote it. Other than in the
circumstances that the hon. Gentleman and I have just described, it is
in the best interests of the children to maintain such contact,
particularly if they are unable to maintain kinship contact with the
older generation of their family. A sibling may be the only family
member who comes into a child&#146;s environment at all, so there
should be a duty on local authorities not only to enable contact but to
promote it&#151;to make it a practical reality, particularly if the
siblings are not able to stay together. If the foster placement were in
danger of breaking down, perhaps because of insufficient support for
the family in respect of their special needs due to dealing with a
complicated set of siblings, the prime consideration should be whether
an alternative foster placement, which did not keep those two or more
siblings together, would be preferable to keeping the existing
placement.</div>
<a name="080624108000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The three
amendments, grouped with new clause 4, would only add detail and
definition to the Bill. They are absolutely intended to achieve the
objectives that I am sure the Government want to achieve&#151;quite
rightly and praiseworthily, having included clause 9. On that basis, I
hope that the Minister will accommodate me by saying that this is a
good idea and the Government accept it.</div>
<a name="080624108000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000371"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I rise to speak to new clause 30, which is grouped
with amendment No. 7. Like the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, the
new clause is about ensuring that local authorities facilitate contact
between siblings if they are not accommodated at the same place. The
formulation in the new clause is slightly narrower than that which the
hon. Gentleman attempted, because it would simply amend section 34 of
the 1989 Act. It already includes the full panoply of a local authority
allowing reasonable contact between a child and various groups of named
people, but it does not include naming siblings. The amendment would
include siblings on the list. The 1989 Act says that where a child is
in the care of the local authority, the authority shall allow the child
reasonable contact with parents, guardian and anybody with a residence
order, and the proposal would add &#147;siblings&#148; to show that
the local authority should also allow reasonable contact with a brother
or sister.</div>
<a name="080624108000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000372"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Does the word &#147;sibling&#148; include both
looked-after children and children at their
home?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="080624108000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000373"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Yes, because siblings are simply brothers and
sisters wherever they are. The local authority&#146;s duty is to the
child in its care, so if one child was in care and one was not,
allowing contact would be to allow contact with the child that was not
in care. I think that that is the point on which the hon. Gentleman
wants clarification.</div>
<a name="080624108000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The good
thing about amending section 34 of the 1989 Act is that it goes on to
provide many safeguards in order to ensure that the contact takes place
safely. For example, if the local authority had doubts about whether
contact was a good thing, it could refuse to allow it to take place.
The person who wanted to object could apply to a court, and the court
could make an order or refuse to make an order, depending on the
circumstances of the case. In that sense, everything is
protected.</div><a name="080624108000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 30 would make a similar amendment to paragraph 15 of schedule 2
to the 1989 Act to ensure that the two provisions are consistent, but I
read the measure more carefully when preparing to speak to it and I
found that the Children Act 1989 is inconsistent. Paragraph 15
states:</div><a name="080624108000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
a child is being looked after by a local authority, the authority
shall, unless it is not reasonably practicable or consistent with his
welfare, endeavour to promote contact between the
child&#148;&#151;</div><a name="080624108000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">this
is the point that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made
about
promotion&#151;</div><a name="080624108000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and&#151;</div><a name="080624108000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)

<a name="080624108000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) any

relative, friend or other person connected with
him.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
took the trouble to look at the definition of &#147;relative&#148;
in the 1989 Act. I see that it includes brothers and sisters, so
brothers and sisters are covered in a schedule to the 1989 Act, but not
in section 34&#151;the primary legislation that matters the most. I
should have thought that Parliament would be compelled to put that
right and make it
happen.</div><a name="080624108000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman made the case well on why sibling contact is important,
but it is worth pointing out to the Ministers that their Department
published its summary of responses to its consultation on the
&#147;Care Matters: Transforming the Lives of Children and Young
People in Care&#148; Green Paper last December. In the summary, it
said:</div><a name="080624108000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Many
of the children and young people we have spoken to thought that it was
vital to keep siblings together wherever
possible.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is where clause 9 helps. The summary went on to
say:</div><a name="080624108000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
this is not possible, maintaining contact with siblings is very
important to young
people.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a very welcome statement. It is an all the more compelling reason
for the Department to think that the amendment should be
made.</div>
<a name="080624108000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
children&#146;s rights director, Roger Morgan, published a report in
December 2007 that gave the views of 433 children on
improving care standards, which
said:</div><a name="080624108000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;care
placements should be designed so that brothers and sisters can stay
together&#148;.</div><a name="080624108000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the children&#146;s fourth main recommendation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div><a name="080624108000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the Family Rights Group has produced a briefing for members of the
Committee in which it stated that NSPCC research published in 2000
entitled &#147;Your shout too!&#148; found that more than one third
of children in care felt that they did not see enough of their brothers
and sisters. That is compelling evidence of the need for an amendment,
and new clause 30 is the right form for making that change rather than
the other proposals included in this group of
amendments.</div>
<a name="080624108000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000374"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I support both new clauses. The point has been
made clearly about the great desire for more sibling contact. It is
evidenced by a number of surveys, including one by A National Voice, an
organisation that is run by four young people in care. That showed that
83 per cent. of children and young people who do not live with their
birth siblings would like to see more of them. The critical point is
the difference between allowing something and facilitating and
supporting it, which is one step further. I would certainly want the
caveat of when it was in the children&#146;s interests for that
contact to take place and safe to do so, with welfare being absolutely
paramount.</div><a name="080624108000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="080624108000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within
those parameters, however, we should go that one step further to be
truly facilitating. Travel expenses might be provided&#151;I believe
that they are&#151;but sometimes more is needed. Making the first
contact is a big step, so perhaps a person might need some support to
undertake the journey rather than just the cost. I support the thrust
of both new clauses and hope that the Minister, should she find the
wording unsatisfactory, will be able to accommodate the views that have
been expressed with regard to sibling
contact.</div>

Hughes:</b> We are all aware of the importance that
looked-after children place on their relationships with their brothers
and sisters and the importance of those relationships for their
well-being and progress, and in that regard we are all coming from the
same point of view. These are the relationships that, for most
children, endure throughout childhood and beyond and can provide that
much needed stability and emotional support that we are seeking in a
child&#146;s life, so I share the sentiments behind amendments Nos. 7
and 8, which relate to the placing of siblings together.</div>
<a name="080624108000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to amendment No. 7, I have simply been advised that section 6 of the
Interpretation Act 1978, which applies to all other legislation, makes
it clear that in any piece of
legislation,</div><a name="080624108000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless
the contrary intention appeals,...words in the singular include
the plural&#148;,</div>
<a name="080624108000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">and vice versa. I did
not know that before today, but think that it deals with amendment No.
7, for absolute
clarity.</div><a name="080624108000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 8 relates to the placement of siblings together. For looked-after
children it can be all too easy for relationships with siblings to be
lost by being placed separately, either because the different needs and
circumstances of individual family members might lead them along
different paths in care or because there are too many children to
accommodate, at least initially, in one foster family. We are extremely
concerned to ensure that children are placed with their siblings
wherever possible and where consistent with the welfare of each child.
We expect those placements to be maintained as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>long as they remain suitable, in accordance with the overarching
responsibilities of the local authorities to safeguard and promote the
welfare of children for whom they are providing that type of
accommodation.</div><a name="080624108000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the Bill places an expectation on local authorities to ensure that
there is sufficient accommodation of a suitable type across the range
of accommodation needs. When we draw up the guidance on how local
authorities should fulfil that sufficiency duty and develop their
commissioning strategies, we will include references to the possible
need to accommodate sibling groups.</div>
<a name="080624108000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000376"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> The right hon. Lady&#146;s final comment
relates closely to the point that I was about to make about the
deficiency in the present system of foster carers who are able to take
sibling groups of three or more, which accounts for a fair proportion
of the children going through the care system. Will she clarify what
the Government propose to do to expand that group of foster carers to
ensure that sibling groups are not split up simply because there is not
provision, despite the spirit of the Bill, for them to remain together
within the care
system.</div><a name="080624108000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000377"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s views. As I
have said, we are emphasising the need for children to stay with
brothers and sisters where it is in their interests to do so, and we
are giving local authorities a duty to ensure that there is
sufficient suitable accommodation of various types. That duty is given
in the Bill, and in the guidance we will refer specifically to the need
to anticipate and make provision for a wider range of placements,
including those that will enable siblings to stay
together.</div><a name="080624108000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
siblings are separated on entry to care, perhaps because of a lack of
capacity or because it is physically not possible to place them
together at that point, we expect that separation and the reasons for
it to be included in the care plan. If it is not possible to place
siblings together, IROs should track the arrangements that are being
made to reunite them at the earliest opportunity, so that that is in
the interest of each child, and that appropriate arrangements are made
for contact in the mean time.</div>
<a name="080624108000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080624108000378"></a><b class="B">Miss
Julie Kirkbride</b> (Bromsgrove) (Con): Mr. Pope, I
apologise for not being here this morning and if I missed anything
important that is relevant to my question, but I wonder whether the
Minister has any figures that would help the Committee to understand
roughly how many children coming into care did so as two or three
siblings together. How many children came alone and how many came as
two, three or more together? My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and
Nantwich has suggested that, in his experience, a large number of
children coming from one family were more likely to be in this
position.</div><a name="080624108000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000379"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I do not have a breakdown of the number of
siblings and how many were in each grouping. The range is broad. Hon.
Members may be familiar with a recently publicised case where 14
children in one family were taken into care at various times. Clearly,
that is an extreme example of the sort of pressure that there can be on
local authorities. Much more normally, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>where siblings are involved it tends to be groups of two or three. I
shall see whether figures are available and if so, I shall let the hon.
Lady have
them.</div><a name="080624108000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
child&#146;s permanence record, which is prepared when a child is
being placed away from home long term, including for adoption, requires
an enormous amount of detail about each sibling to be recorded to
ensure that contact can be maintained or resumed in the future where
they are not being placed together. Our intentions are clear. Together
with the sufficiency duty that we are requiring local authorities to
take on, I cannot see that amendment No. 8 would make any difference in
practice to the duty in clause 9 in relation to placement.</div>
<a name="080624108000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment talks about maintaining the placement, but I cannot imagine
that local authorities would wilfully not support successful
placements&#151;indeed, there would be a huge financial disincentive
to doing so. As a further strength, both in the new Children Act
guidance that we are completely rewriting and in the first ever
statutory guidance to independent reviewing officers, we will reinforce
the considerations in respect of sibling placements and the importance
of supporting sibling contact.</div>
<a name="080624108000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Stafford, because the inclusion of new
section 22C(8)(c), which requires a local authority to provide
accommodation for siblings to live together, is a huge step forward. It
makes clear our intentions to local authorities, which we will support
and buttress in the guidance that we give to them.</div>
<a name="080624108000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses deal with contact between siblings. Obviously, we are all aware
of the difficulties that contact presents for some children and
families who are separated. It can generate difficult, mixed feelings;
it requires careful planning, organisation and in some cases
supervision for that contact to be maintained when they have been
separated. Paragraph 15 of schedule 2 to the Children Act
1989, which my hon. Friend had diligently researched, explicitly
requires local authorities, as he said, to be proactive in not just
maintaining contact, but promoting it&#151;indeed, it is
headed:</div><a name="080624108000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Promotion
and maintenance of contact between child and
family&#148;</div><a name="080624108000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Included
in that paragraph is a reference to &#147;any relative.&#148; As he
said, under section 105 of the Act, the definition of
&#147;relative&#148; specifically encompasses grandparents,
brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts and stepsiblings. The point is that
the law as it stands already requires local authorities to maintain
contact between siblings. I accept my hon. Friend&#146;s
argument&#151;up to a point&#151;that we have to work from section
34 to schedule 2 and on to the definitions in section 105 of the 1989
Act; none the less it is there in statute, and we would achieve nothing
more by accepting the
amendments.</div><a name="080624108000154"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000380"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Is there not a slight difference under section 34,
because if the local authority fails to allow the contact that it is
supposed to be promoting, as the Minister explained, the person who is
dissatisfied&#151;I am arguing on behalf of the other
sibling&#151;could apply to the court for an order to make it happen?
The one third or so of children in care who have no contact with a
sibling, and that sibling, could go to court to force the hand of local
authorities that are not doing what they are supposed to be
doing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div><a name="080624108000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000381"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. However, my argument
is&#151;I think that his point reinforces it&#151;that we do not
need further legislation or changes to it; what we need is the current
law to be implemented much more effectively. Although I recognise that
there is some very good practice in relation to sibling contact, I
agree with him and other Members that it is very patchy. I do not
believe for a minute that sufficient priority is given in practice to
ensuring that that contact happens. For that reason, we have included
the requirement that contacts are reflected in the child care plan, the
placement plan and the integrated children&#146;s system, and that
the IRO must pay particular attention to that matter. That is what we
are trying to do throughout the Bill. Where we need to strengthen
legislation, we are doing so, as in new section 22C(8)(c), but where
legislative provisions already exist, we should strengthen their
implementation.</div>
<a name="080624108000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
already mentioned the ICS in relation to another clause, and shall not
rehearse the details, except to say that there will be specific
requirements on social workers to include in the ICS care plan all the
details of siblings, including step and half siblings, arrangements for
contact and the practicalities of how contact will be maintained.
Guidance notices within the records will reiterate and emphasise the
importance of that contact. Those new provisions, together with
existing legislation, cover the intentions behind the amendments. The
real challenge is to use the other measures in the
Bill&#151;particularly those on the strengthening of the IRO&#146;s
role, which we will get to shortly, and the requirements through the
recording systems and the detailed guidance that we will insist on in
the care plan&#151;to achieve results in practice.</div>
<a name="080624108000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee accepts my assurances on those points. We have a job to
do that does not require further legislation, or changes to existing
legislation. We need simply to implement the levers in place to improve
the quality of social work practice.</div>
<a name="080624108000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000382"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Again, the Minister and I seem to be coming at
this from the same direction as far as intentions are concerned. I am
slightly nonplussed by the reference to the Interpretation Act
1976&#151;</div><a name="080624108000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000383"></a>Beverley

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000384"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I&#146;m terribly sorry&#151;that makes all
the difference. On that basis, will she explain a reference in new
section 22C(10),
that</div><a name="080624108000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
local authority may determine...the terms of any
arrangements&#148;.</div><a name="080624108000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely
to be consistent that should be &#147;arrangement&#148; on the
basis that the 1978 Act requires a reference only to the singular,
rather than the
plural?</div><a name="080624108000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000385"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> Far be it from me to question parliamentary
counsel. I simply refer the hon. Gentleman to what I said, which is
that unless the contrary intent appears, words importing the singular
include the plural and vice versa. It is a matter of decision in the
drafting as to whether the singular or the plural is actually written
down, but in either case, it always includes the
opposite.</div><a name="080624108000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000386"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I hope that is clearer than mud to people other
than me. Clearly that Act needs revisiting, because if a singular or a
plural can be used arbitrarily, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>without having any effect at all, something is a bit
wrong. What if one wanted to refer only to the singular rather than the
plural? Anyway, that is for another committee on another day, but I am
very grateful for the Minister&#146;s explanation of
sorts.</div><a name="080624108000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that the right hon. Lady entirely took my points about
amendment No. 8. She assumes that a decent social worker would clearly
want to maintain a placement with siblings for as long as possible, but
we cannot take it as read that the social worker would always do
everything to make it possible to keep siblings together&#151;not
just living together but placed together in a sustainable placement
that enabled those two or more siblings to live together in a stable
family environment for as long as possible. I think we might have to
agree to disagree. I do not think that what the Minister says actually
achieves our aim in amendment No. 8, but we are very much agreed on the
necessary intention.</div>
<a name="080624108000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
get bogged down in the Interpretation Act 1978, and I beg to withdraw
the amendment and the new

year.&#146;.</div><a name="080624108000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000389"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Not wishing to appear churlish, let me say at
the outset what another good addition the clause, and this particular
subsection of the clause, is to the Bill, and that we want to make it
even better. I hope that satisfies the hon. Member for
Stafford.</div>
<a name="080624108000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is one
amendment and a new clause dealing with the related subjects of
multiple placements and multiple social workers. They are on a similar
theme. I quoted earlier figures from a table showing alarming
differences in the local authorities who have children who have been in
three or more placements during the year ending March 2007, which is a
cause of great concern. The basic theme of all our discussions on the
Bill has been the need to maintain some stability, continuity and
familiarity with environment and carers. If a child has multiple
placements&#151;we have set a benchmark of more than three in the
space of a 12-month period&#151;that cannot be conducive to giving
that child a chance of regaining some degree of stability. It is
particularly important given the impact on education which is quite
rightly also part of the clause.</div>
<a name="080624108000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
constituency Members, we have seen foster placements breaking down for
various reasons&#151;in many cases it is because suitable and
appropriate support was not given to the foster family to enable them
to cope with perhaps a particularly difficult child who has particular
behavioural problems or needs&#151;so a new foster placement has to
be found. Given the shortage of fostering places&#151;we heard
recently that the Local Government Association has identified an
immediate deficit of 5,250 foster carers&#151;often 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>it is not practically possible to find an alternative appropriate foster
carer in the vicinity. That can mean, particularly within large county
authority areas, placing a child many miles away, often at the opposite
end of a large county, which makes the maintenance of that child at his
or her school practically impossible, or possible only at great expense
and with great time taken to ship them from an out-of-area placement to
a school. My local authority is West Sussex county council, and I have
no reason to think that West Sussex is any better or worse than other
authorities
are.</div><a name="080624108000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to do a lot more to ensure that multiple placements are avoided at
all costs. When one looks at the table that I quoted from this morning
showing that a quarter of children in the care system in Cornwall and
one fifth of children in the care system in Stoke-on-Trent had three or
more placements in the previous year, one becomes deeply alarmed. That
figure needs to be reduced considerably. That could mean sharing the
best practice of places such as Barnet, which are able to do something
about the number of placements.</div>
<a name="080624108000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two
issues are interlinked. Some years ago, Barnet very boldly decided to
invest in its social work work force, particularly child social
workers. It launched a recruitment campaign called, &#147;Got a new
Barnet?&#148; It attracted social workers, gave them special
allowances to enable them to live in the area and focused on the
welfare of its children in care. It developed a buddy system, whereby
every child in care was buddied up with an officer from the local
authority, from the chief executive down. That person would be the
&#147;pushy parent&#148; in the background looking out for that
child&#146;s educational achievement, health records and so on, and
asking awkward questions of the relevant department, social worker or
officer when that child appeared to be achieving less than expected.
The scheme proved to be very
successful.</div><a name="080624108000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Barnet, the number of looked-after children going to university or into
equivalent further education is about 12 per cent., compared with 1 to
2 per cent. of the looked-after children population as a whole. The
last time that I checked with the former director of children&#146;s
services, the vacancy rate in Barnet was less than 4 per cent.; it is
20 per cent. in other London boroughs. Barnet identified as a priority,
and invested in, a well motivated, well resourced and well rewarded
social work work force. That led to much lower turnover in the work
force, a much better service for the children they were there to look
after, and an investment in foster carers, which meant that more foster
placements were likely to succeed than to break down. Such action is
not rocket science and certain authorities are better than others at
doing something about the problems.</div>
<a name="080624108000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need an
extra safeguard to avoid multiple placements at all costs. I refer back
to the office of the children&#146;s rights director for
England&#146;s report that I and the hon. Member for Stafford quoted
from earlier. It is very rich in appropriate statistics on the
attitudes of young people in the care system towards social workers.
According to that report, children said that their social worker moved
them when they were just settling down&#151;a major gripe. Others
said that a big issue was that social workers kept changing. One child
is quoted as
saying:</div><a name="080624108000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have had around 30 social workers in 10
years.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
office of the children&#146;s rights director heard from many young
people about how important it is not to keep having new social
workers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div><a name="080624108000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned earlier, many children said that they had no say in the
selection of their social worker, even though they rightly identified
that it is important to get on well with one&#146;s social worker.
There was a way to change the social worker if the relationship was not
working from the child&#146;s perspective&#151;that might happen if
the child felt that the social worker was overpowering them, or if they
did not feel that their views, worries or feelings were being listened
to. The children&#146;s rights director also heard that careful
matching was needed to get the right social worker for each child. The
young people who proposed that said that they had not had any choice in
who would be their social worker, even though getting on with them and
trusting them was vital. One of the quotations says
that</div><a name="080624108000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;social
workers are like young people&#151;you have your good and bad
ones&#148;.</div><a name="080624108000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 9 would make it an absolute exception for a child to have more than
three placements in the space of 12 months. Ideally, they would stay in
the same placement and the local authority would do everything possible
to enable that. If a child had more than two placements in their last
year of compulsory schooling, when continuity is vital to their
achievement in their studies and examinations, a written explanation
would be required.</div>
<a name="080624108000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with the
earlier amendment, it may be that the Minister will tell me that this
provision will be included in new guidance. It would be reassuring if
it were required in a different form. If it is not, the aim of avoiding
multiple placements, which can be so damaging, is a minimum requirement
of
acceptability.</div><a name="080624108000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
new clause 3 would require that if a child had been looked after by
three or more different social workers in the course of a year, the
local authority must account for it. It should not just be brushed
under the carpet of all of the pressures on the social work department.
It may well be a requirement in the performance assessments of social
worker practices that they are assessed on how few placements they are
able to achieve for one of the children for whom they are being paid a
bonus, as was set out in the recommendations, or they could be assessed
on whether children have had the continuity of just one social worker
wherever possible. If it is likely, as I envisage, that these
terminologies will be applied to the new social work practices, surely
we should ensure that they apply equally to social workers within the
existing local authority
remit.</div><a name="080624108000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hopefully,
these are constructive and positive proposals that will give greater
definition and detail in the Bill to what the Government are trying to
achieve and the goals that we all share. They make it explicit that
multiple placements and the use of multiple social workers has been
unacceptable for too long. A very strong message must go to the
relevant departments that everything must be done to avoid those things
so that we get more figures comparable with the likes of Barnet, rather
than authorities at the other end of the
spectrum.</div><a name="080624108000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000390"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, stability is
critical for children in care. That is why stability is one of the four
key principles that underpin the &#147;Care Matters: Time for
Change&#148; White Paper and that are at the heart of the Bill. We
know from our own 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>children that they should be able to rely on stable relationships, and
that applies particularly to looked-after children. They should be able
to attach to people, to trust people and to gain consistent support
from their carers and social workers. That kind of stability is
essential in allowing looked-after children to thrive and
achieve.</div><a name="080624108000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is particularly crucial to minimise disruption during the two years of
key stage 4, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Such disruptions can have
a dramatic effect on the ability of children to achieve their
educational potential, particularly if they have to change
schools.</div><a name="080624108000314"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
<a name="080624108000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
children who remain looked-after for more than a year stay in the same
placement. We want to increase the proportion of children in long-term,
stable care placements, because we know that that leads to the best
outcomes. At the other end of the spectrum, we want to reduce the
proportion of children facing three or more placement moves in a year.
That is why both the measures are part of the national indicator set
for local authorities and feature as a part of many recently finalised
local area agreements. Since they have been part of the national
indicator set, it is gratifying that there have been year-on-year
improvements in relation to both&#151;not fast enough or big enough,
but the measures are none the less beginning to have a lever effect on
local authority practice. Coupled with clause 9, that will further
strengthen our leverage for ensuring continuous improvement at the
local
level.</div><a name="080624108000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Decisions
about a child&#146;s placement must be taken in the light of that
child&#146;s needs and circumstances. I have no difficulty with the
amendment&#146;s intentions, but I would like to put two issues to
the hon. Gentleman. The first concerns the amendment&#146;s practical
effect. It would enshrine in primary legislation an assumption that it
is normal or acceptable for a child to face three placements in a year
as long as there are no more than three. Clearly, that is absolutely
contrary to his intention, but to enshrine that figure in a Bill would
not be helpful. Indeed, for the large majority of children, it would
set the bar far too low. Where it is in their interest, children should
ideally have a single placement where they can develop relationships
and find stability and continuity. For a very small minority of
children, there can be good reasons why several moves in a planned
progression might be needed to prepare them for permanent
attachment.</div><a name="080624108000186"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000391"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> On that point, the Minister will acknowledge
that that is clearly not what I want to achieve. Ofsted&#146;s
figures provide tables concentrating specifically on three or more
placements. That has already been set down as a benchmark by her own
Department for what is not acceptable. We need to set a threshold
somewhere, whether at two, three or whatever, above which it is
absolutely not acceptable. With all the incentives to push it down even
further, we need to start
somewhere.</div><a name="080624108000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000392"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I agree with the spirit of what the hon. Gentleman
says. Arguably, if we were setting the national indicator set now, we
might have defined it rather more ambitiously than three or more
placements. He is right that that benchmark is enshrined in the
national indicator set and reinforced in guidance, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>my point was that I would be worried about putting that permanently in
legislation. We need to be more ambitious than that for most children.
Putting it in the Bill might, over time, normalise it as an acceptable
benchmark. We want to ensure that most children&#146;s number of
placements is far
lower.</div><a name="080624108000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000393"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Surely the Minister is aware from the figures
quoted by my hon. Friend that the number placed twice is far too high.
We know that the figures are low for one, but I am not sure that they
are low enough. Where are the rest? Are they like that or like this, or
somewhere in
between?</div><a name="080624108000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000394"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> The majority of children who remain in care for
more than a year stay in the same placement. We also know that a
substantial number of children&#151;about 40 per cent., I
think&#151;are in care for a year or less before returning home. We
are talking about a small minority of children, but none the less a
substantial one. As of 31 March 2003, 14.8 per cent. of
looked-after children had had three or more placements. By 2007, that
had fallen to 12.3 per cent. of children in care. It is a minority, and
it is falling, but it is still too many, and we want to reduce that as
much as we
can.</div><a name="080624108000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000395"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> It seems that there are three aspects of a
child&#146;s circumstances that might cause several placements.
Otherwise, the issue is the skill with which the placement is made, and
the pool of foster carers or of social workers, which we discussed in
depth. What is the Minister doing to encourage local authorities to
recruit a larger pool of foster carers, with a wide variety of skills?
That is an ingredient that we
need.</div><a name="080624108000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000396"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> The hon. Lady will be familiar with those aspects
of the &#147;Care Matters&#148; White Paper for which we do not
need legislation and which we are therefore not discussing here. There
is a wide variety of proposals there, designed to enable local
authorities to recruit a wider range of foster carers, and also to give
foster carers more training and more status within the family of carers
for looked-after children. The hon. Lady raises an important point,
because unless that situation is improved&#151;particularly in some
areas where the situation is worse&#151;the consequences will
ultimately be felt by the children themselves. We are trying to avoid
that.</div><a name="080624108000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remarked that there is a minority of children for whom several planned
moves may be needed, either because of their own circumstances or
because they are in special situations. I met a young man last week; it
was tremendous to meet him. He is in an intensive fostering project and
has been through three carers. He was about to move on from anti-social
behaviour to all sorts of serious crime. Having a series of moves with
trained people, and staying with the last set of parents for almost a
year, has transformed him. That was fantastic to see. There will be
special situations such as that, and we want to ensure that we allow
for those. Such planned placement changes are already required to be
reflected in a child&#146;s care plan. What we need to do here is to
reinforce the clear messages about stability, and as the hon. Member
for East Worthing and Shoreham said, we will do that again in the
guidance that is being rewritten.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="080624108000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3
will strengthen the reviewing process, to ensure that it is rigorously
focused on whether the care plan that the local authority puts forward
is the most appropriate and responsive way to meet the child&#146;s
needs. I am sure that Members are aware that independent reviewing
officers already have the power to report it to senior managers if
actions from review are not being carried out, including where a change
in social worker is delaying the implementation of decisions made at
review. There is already a requirement for regular reviews: three in
the first year and then every six months. That is a minimum
requirement. The IRO can direct further reviews as he or she thinks
necessary. Therefore I hope that Members will accept that in the
specific context of a child experiencing an unacceptable number of
changes in their social worker, we should strengthen both the reviews
that are already in place and the role of the IRO, rather than focusing
on triggering additional reviews. That will enable those who ought to
be examining those changes for children to do so much more effectively.
When we reach clause 11 we will perhaps talk about some of that in more
detail.</div><a name="080624108000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reviews
should always consider whether the child&#146;s placement offers the
stability that they need, with secure attachments. Holding additional
reviews in isolation from the focused activity that needs to take place
in the local authority to recruit and develop social workers, will not
necessarily address the real issue here, which is needing to increase
the number of social workers where there are shortages, and
achieving a range of expertise. As I said on Second Reading, my hon.
Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families
has taken measures outside the Bill to help local authorities address
some of the issues of vacancy and turnover rates of social workers.
There was a package of measures backed by substantial
resources to enable local authorities to do more of the kind of
work that authorities such as Barnet have undertaken with great success
in improving recruitment
and retention.</div><a name="080624108000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those assurances, I hope that the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham will feel that we agree with the purpose of the amendment. On
new clause 3, I do not think that adding further reviews to an already
demanding set of reviews with the potential for the IRO to demand more
would help with the problem. I therefore hope that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080624108000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000397"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am delighted and relieved that the Minister is
with us. Her favourite buzz word today appears to be &#147;lever
in&#148; or &#147;leverage&#148;. All of these measures are
beginning to lever in the extra requirements, which is
good.</div><a name="080624108000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to place greater bureaucracy on local authorities or on
social workers. The greatest incentive for local authorities or social
workers not to have to account for multiple placements or the use of
multiple social workers would be that bureaucracy. That is where the
incentive
lies.</div><a name="080624108000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister places great store by the IRO. Given that we have not reached
that part of the Bill, I think that we will have an interesting debate
on the exact nature of the teeth that the IRO will be given and how
accountable he or she will be able to make local authorities or social
workers who do not achieve the improvements in outcomes that we
want.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div><a name="080624108000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
has been another useful debate. It has teased out that the Government
are thinking along the same lines as us, but that these requirements
are taken care of elsewhere in the Bill. On that basis, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080624108000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000399"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> First, having chided the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham, it behoves me to say what a wonderful clause
this is. Congratulations to the Government and the other place for
getting it into its current order. It is a very welcome
clause.</div><a name="080624108000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will speak briefly to new clause 27. It goes along with the thrust of
the clause that in future, local authorities should think first about
supporting parents and other family members in caring for children who
would otherwise be in danger of being taken into the care of the local
authority. If local authorities have to step in and use their statutory
powers to take a child into care, they should immediately look at
whether they can rehabilitate the child back to the parents or other
members of the child&#146;s family and that should be done as quickly
as
possible.</div><a name="080624108000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 27 draws attention to the one lacuna in clause 9, which is the
practical support that will be given to family members who take on the
very important task of looking after one or more vulnerable children on
behalf of the whole family. It would deal particularly with physical
and financial support when it is most needed. When local authorities
take a child into care, whether they place the child with a family
member, a foster carer or in residential care, the panoply of support
and money is available to the people giving the care. When family
members rally round and take on that responsibility, there is no
entitlement or direct duty for them to be given support and money to do
that important
work.</div><a name="080624108000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
ensure that the practical aspect of the enterprise is not overlooked,
new clause 27 would require the local authority to carry out an
assessment of the needs of the family members who are looking after
those children at the outset and see what support, financial and
otherwise, would be necessary to ensure that they could do their job to
the best of their ability. Otherwise, the risk is that the placement
will break down and the local authority will have to come back and
exercise those statutory powers and take the child or children into
care.</div>
<a name="080624108000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="080624108000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have willed the ends in the clause, but at the moment we are not
willing the means to ensure that it is carried through into practice. I
hope that the Ministers can say that they are sympathetic to closing a
gap in what is otherwise an extremely welcome provision to ensure that
families are properly supported by the local authority when they rally
around to take on this awesome responsibility. Local authorities,
instead of exercising their care powers, would be exercising their
ability to support families and keep them
together.</div><a name="080624108000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000400"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman has
said, but I want to concentrate on new clause 1, which is grouped with
the clause stand part 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>debate. New clause 1 is intended to be helpful and constructive to the
Bill and is based on previous legislation, and I think it is quite a
good wheeze. It would place on the face and at the heart of the
Bill&#151;if it is possible to do both&#151;the equivalent of the
welfare checklist that is enshrined in the Children Act 1989, which
remains as important a piece of legislation as it was when it was
innovated under the last Government. Key to that legislation was the
concept of the paramountcy of the child and the focus of various
aspects of welfare on the wishes and feelings of the
child.</div><a name="080624108000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill has been criticised for not going far enough and for not
containing detail that is explicit enough to require local authorities
to pursue the legislation right up to the spirit in which it is
intended. In many cases, local authorities will be reluctant to spend
more or invest more resources than they need to in order to comply with
the new legislation, which is understandable, given the competing
requirements on their budgets from all sorts of other children&#146;s
services requirements. That is the reason for our previous arguments
over the term &#147;having regard to.&#148;</div>
<a name="080624108000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
suitable, appropriate and helpful for the Bill if a welfare checklist
giving the nine criteria set out in new clause 1 was used as a
benchmark against which a local authority could be measured in order to
see whether it had fulfilled the spirit of the legislation rather than
just carried out the minimum requirements. That would be measured in
relation to the impact on the welfare of the child, which is the most
important consideration and the reason we are all here. We thought that
it would be helpful to suggest a welfare checklist that cannibalised
the list from the 1989 Act and was made germane to looked-after
children.</div>
<a name="080624108000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
briefly run through the nine criteria listed in new clause 1. Item (a)
states that a local authority should have regard in particular
to</div>
<a name="080624108000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ascertaining
the wishes and feelings of the child&#148;,</div>
<a name="080624108000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">which we are all
familiar with from previous legislation. It is right that children
should be consulted on matters such as the appointment of their social
workers, as we mentioned earlier. Many children feel excluded from
decisions in relation to which they might have views of their own, and
which could be relevant to their being able to get on with their social
worker, which is in turn important for the success of the placement or
of their relationships that they are
building.</div><a name="080624108000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Item
(b), which deals with</div>
<a name="080624108000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
desirability of retaining the child in the family home wherever it is
the child&#146;s best interests&#148;,</div>
<a name="080624108000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">would back up the
kinship care priority hierarchy in clause 9, which we have debated.
Again, against the checklist, has a local authority pursued as fully as
is practicable the possibility of keeping the child within the family
rather than taking the child away? Item (b) contains the preventive
measure. As I have said, it is too often perceived that social
workers&#146; first contact with a vulnerable family is when care
proceedings are about to be initiated, not&#151;as should
happen&#151;when things are starting to go wrong in a family and they
need help and support, resources or
whatever.</div><a name="080624108000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Community
Service Volunteers, of which I am proud to be a trustee, has piloted a
project using voluntary social workers, whose role is to liaise with
the family as a family support resource, a relationship that is often 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>difficult when it involves dealing with somebody who also has the power
to initiate care proceedings to take a child away from a family. Social
workers are regarded with a degree of suspicion on the doorstep,
particularly on a first referral, so the role of voluntary social
workers can involve working with the family to ensure that everything
is being done and liaising with the local authority and the official
social worker to ensure that the family has support and can be kept
together wherever
possible.</div><a name="080624108000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a benchmark before care proceedings take place, the new clause asks
whether the local authority has done everything practicable to ensure
that the child can be kept with the family, that the family can be kept
together and that taking the child away from the family, however
temporary or permanent the basis, is not an obvious option. The
desirability of trying to keep the family together with the child in
the family is the second
benchmark.</div><a name="080624108000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third benchmark is</div>
<a name="080624108000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the likely
effect&#148;</div><a name="080624108000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">on
the
child</div><a name="080624108000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of
any change in his circumstances and environment, and the benefits of
his remaining close to home wherever
possible&#148;.</div><a name="080624108000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
9, although we have not debated it in detail, mentions the desirability
of keeping a child close to a familiar environment wherever possible
and in the best interest of the child and the child&#146;s welfare.
Even though things might have broken down with the family or birth
parents, it is in the child&#146;s best interest to retain some
accord with familiar friends, perhaps at the same school, or with
kinship carers.</div>
<a name="080624108000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
taking a child away from their environment, both in terms of their
personal relationships and their physical environment, has an
assessment been done of whether that is in the child&#146;s best
interest? In some cases, it clearly will be, such as if the child is
being victimised or bullied or is under threat of physical or mental
harm by remaining in a very damaging environment. Has an assessment
been made? That is the third
benchmark.</div><a name="080624108000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fourth benchmark will be familiar from the 1989
Act:</div><a name="080624108000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
harm which he has suffered or is at risk of
suffering&#148;.</div><a name="080624108000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
the welfare of the child is the basis for that. The fifth concerns
ensuring, as we have debated at length, that all options for kinship
care in the hierarchy criteria have been explored, including an
assessment of the kinship carer&#146;s parenting capacity. The
Minister has told us that that will happen under the new arrangements,
so that criterion should be quite easy to satisfy.</div>
<a name="080624108000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sixth
concerns</div><a name="080624108000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;maintaining
contact with siblings and other family members wherever practicable and
in the child&#146;s best interest&#148;.</div>
<a name="080624108000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, it replicates,
but on a benchmark basis, what we have
debated.</div><a name="080624108000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
seventh is</div>
<a name="080624108000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;maintaining
continuity of appropriate education, accommodation and standards of
healthcare&#148;.</div><a name="080624108000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have touched on the continuity of remaining at the same school,
particularly in the sensitive key stage years of exams. Stability of
accommodation should also be a factor, as well as standards of health
care, should the child have some illness, such as a long-term condition
or a disability, that would make any move harmful.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div><a name="080624108000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
eighth check
is</div><a name="080624108000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
appropriate level of access to the responsible social worker being
maintained&#148;.</div><a name="080624108000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
it deals with criteria that we have touched on, whereby the multiple
appointment of social workers is clearly detrimental.</div>
<a name="080624108000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
check is</div>
<a name="080624108000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where the
required changes have been specified and not
achieved.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a lot of repetition on the checklist, but it is meant to be held up
as a benchmark, so that when there is a question mark over whether a
child has received the very best support and ended up in the most
appropriate and beneficial placement, the onus will be on the
appropriate authority to measure its performance against that
checklist. Did it really pull all the right levers and exhaust all the
right possibilities before deciding that the child could not stay with
the kinship carer, or that it should be placed in a completely new or
physically distant environment?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000401"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned that there is already
a welfare checklist in the 1989 Act, but there is no reference in the
new clause to the way in which its checklist would interact with the
Act&#146;s checklist. What is his thinking? Why do we need two
checklists, with some checks that are the same and some that are
different? It would be a recipe for confusion if the situation either
was not clarified or was completely different.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="080624108000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000402"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Yes. Checklist or checklists. You say tomayto,
we say tomato&#151;it&#146;s all the same thing, is it
not?</div>
<a name="080624108000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman makes an appropriate point, however. I do not want to
replicate provisions so that one has to go through two different
checklists, but the checklist in new clause 1 is germane to
looked-after children. Clearly, the 1989 Act will retain its
appropriateness and its sections on the welfare of the child their
paramountcy, but we are dealing specifically with children in the care
system, whereas the 1989 Act deals with more than just those children.
The new clause has its place.</div>
<a name="080624108000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">No doubt the
Minister will say that she cannot accept the new clause for the reason
that the hon. Gentleman just gave&#151;that it causes confusion or it
replicates. However, it is a genuine effort to measure whether local
authorities are achieving what the legislation wants them to
achieve&#151;its spirit. With reference to &#147;have regard
to&#148;, they may have been doing less, and not achieving the very
best outcome for the child, than they would have done if they had had
to measure up to the checklist before
us.</div><a name="080624108000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000403"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s answer is wrong, and I
am sure that his hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich, the
family law barrister behind him, could tell him that the welfare
checklist in the 1989 Act relates to circumstances whenever a court is
asked to make a decision. It could take place in private family
proceedings or in public care proceedings. It could also take place
when a local authority seeks a care order, or when someone wants a
variation of an order, wants to bring an end to an order or wants
contact with a child who is already in care. So, when the hon. Member
for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>East Worthing and Shoreham says that his welfare checklist relates only
to children in the care system, and that the list in the 1989 Act
relates to some other children or to children generally, he is just
wrong.</div>
<a name="080624108000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000404"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
doing the Minister&#146;s job for her. It might be more accurate to
say that the new clause relates to children in the care system as set
out in the Bill&#151;that all the new factors that the Bill brings in
should be measured against the checklist. It is an innovative attempt
at being more appropriate to the changes that we all welcome in the
legislation, so that local authorities can be properly measured. The
welfare checklist&#151;with its vagueness in certain
areas, for obvious reasons going back now 20
years&#151;could be tightened up by the more detailed provisions
before us. I fully appreciate that competing priorities are a
possibility. However, when it comes to judging whether a local
authority has done its job in promoting kinship care or sibling care,
and in keeping children closer to home, which the Bill will bring
about, it is that checklist that will have to be used to see whether
local authorities have measured
up.</div><a name="080624108000316"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="080624108000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is right in so far as we are talking about the same pool
of children, but we are talking about new legislation and new
requirements. If we are serious about wanting to ensure that those
requirements make a difference, we need a test against which local
authorities should be prepared to be judged, one against which their
performance could be found wanting&#151;or found to be fulfilling the
real spirit of the legislation that we are all so eager to bring in. On
that basis, I am keen that the new clause should be considered by the
Committee.</div>
<a name="080624108000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000405"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I welcome clause 9. I have not yet had the
opportunity to express those warm words. It is significant that there
is so much common ground among Members. We all agree on the outcomes
that we wish to achieve, but it is the mechanisms that will ensure they
can be achieved that are under debate.</div>
<a name="080624108000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I speak in
support of new clause 27. The payments that might be made to kinship
carers vary between local authorities, but they are made at a time when
the carers desperately need support. I am aware that some authorities
can be more generous with the budget made available to them by social
services, and that others are not.</div>
<a name="080624108000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
all sorts of reasons why a kinship carer may be short of money at times
of crisis, and that might put pressure on the relationships that we are
talking about&#151;relationships that we want to flourish. I know of
an example in my constituency. A grandmother had to pay considerable
babysitting fees so that she could keep her one night out every week.
That did not seem unreasonable, but I was surprised at how much she had
to pay. It ate up the entire sum that she was given by social services.
I mention it because a grandparent taking on a 14-year-old girl and not
wishing to leave her at home unaccompanied is very worthy but
expensive. We need to consider the matter further. I imagine that we
will be discussing it again when we reach clause 24, but the new clause
fits in well at this stage because of the necessity, when appropriate,
of giving all the support that we can for kinship care.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div><a name="080624108000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
might also say a few warm words on new clause 1. The principle that the
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham is trying to achieve is
rather interesting. I am not sure about the exact details, and the
title seems to throw things into disarray, but we nevertheless need
more in the Bill than what we have now that will give a stronger
message to local authorities. Something like new clause 1, perhaps with
a different title, might become as significant as the welfare checklist
was in the context of the Children Act 1989, not least because the Bill
is meant to be another landmark piece of legislation in a highly
specialised area.</div>
<a name="080624108000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses deal with two different things, and they need to be approached
carefully. I hope that the Minister will pick up on them and not
dismiss them entirely.</div>
<a name="080624108000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000406"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> New clauses 27 and 1 are clearly intended to
ensure that, as we discussed earlier, local authorities should better
consider the needs of children being cared for by family and friends,
and when that is happening we need also to consider the needs of the
parents themselves. However, it is important to note that many
excellent services are already available in the best local authority
areas, whether provided by them or third sector partners. We have to
ensure that those services are available no matter which area of the
country people live
in.</div><a name="080624108000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chapter
two of &#147;Care Matters&#148; sets out how we intend to make
significant improvements to the support for carers who are either
family or friends. In particular it sets out in statutory guidance the
expectations of an effective service to those carers. That will address
issues that authorities need to consider when they are commissioning
services, such as widening support to include financial benefits to
which carers may be entitled, and an appropriate assessment process in
which the relative is approved as a foster carer. Obviously, we will
consult widely as we develop the new framework to ensure that we get it
right.</div><a name="080624108000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to remember that section 17 of the Children Act 1989
already places a general duty on local authorities to safeguard and
promote the welfare of children in need in their area and to promote
their upbringing by their families by providing a wide range of
services that are appropriate to children&#146;s needs.</div>
<a name="080624108000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned, we are already
seeking, through clause 24 of the Bill, to amend section 17(6) which,
at the moment, restricts the making of payments to exceptional
circumstances. We will no doubt debate that clause when we get there,
but the intention is to give local authorities a wider discretion to
provide financial support on a longer-term basis if they are satisfied
that to do so would safeguard the child&#146;s welfare.</div>
<a name="080624108000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
see more relative carers receiving financial and other support from
local authorities when it is needed. The serious problem with the
amendment is that it would, in effect, remove the discretionary aspect
of section 17 for this category of children and family carers and
effectively give family carers an entitlement in law that birth
parents, who may have similar difficulties, currently do not
have.</div>
<a name="080624108000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to
be very clear that it is not the role of local authorities to provide
general income maintenance for families, and nor are they resourced to
do so. Carers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>who are family or friends are already entitled to a
range of financial supports similar to those that parents are entitled
to when caring for their own children, such as child benefit and tax
credits. Neither of those are affected by any payments made under
section 17. Carers can qualify for other benefits on broadly the same
terms as parents generally. If they are bringing up a child on their
own and unable to work, they may claim income support on the same basis
as other lone parents. The main problem&#151;I very much understand
the intention here&#151;is that the measure would give an entitlement
in law to family carers that birth parents do not have. That is why I
cannot accept this particular amendment.</div>
<a name="080624108000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
new clause 1, there is a great deal to be said for all the principles
underpinning the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for East Worthing
and Shoreham. In fact, when we looked, they were nearly all included in
other pieces of legislation, particularly the Children Act. If they
were not, they were included in the Bill. I think that the hon.
Gentleman has put forward a very powerful proposition that all such
principles should all be brigaded in one place. We all reflect and
understand the way in which the welfare check list in the 1989 Act has
been readily understood and is on the tips of the tongues of everyone
who works with children; they know about all the measures because they
are in one place, in a list, and it has had a powerful impact. Although
I do not think that we should include this amendment in the Bill
because the issues already exist&#151;and I can send the hon.
Gentleman the collation that we have done&#151;in other pieces of
legislation, the idea of brigading all of the elements together in one
place is an excellent one. I assure him that, when we set out the new
care planning guidance, I and the Under-Secretary of State will set out
a list of key principles, including any that we might have missed that
might be elsewhere in legislation.</div>
<a name="080624108000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">That will
have the same effect as a check list, such as the one in the 1989 Act,
although in this case the list will be set out in guidance, given that
very specific provisions exist in law already. Brigading those themes
in one place will have a powerful effect by setting out very clearly
the principles that we think should govern every aspect of social care
work practice in relation to looked-after children. Indeed, the list in
his new clause underpins the Bill&#146;s four themes&#151;good
parenting, stability, the voice of the child and higher aspirations for
children. I hope, therefore, that he accepts my assurance that we will
set out that list at the beginning of the care planning
guidance.</div><a name="080624108000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000407"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> Will the Minister also look at proposed new
section 22C(6)(d) dealing with placements? According to the explanatory
notes, placements</div>
<a name="080624108000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">may include, for
example, supporting young people to live independently in rented
accommodation, residential employment, or in supported
lodgings/hostels.&#148;</div><a name="080624108000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
she make explicit whether proposed new subsection (6)(d)
will be subject to the Ofsted inspection process? Furthermore, a case
was brought to my attention of a 15-year-old girl placed be her local
authority in bed and breakfast accommodation. Will she make it clear in
guidance that accommodation under the subsection must be suitable and
appropriate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div><a name="080624108000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000408"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I understand the spirit of my hon. Friend&#146;s
interventions. I shall have to write to her on the technical detail,
and I shall do so before our next sitting, if she will accept
that.</div><a name="080624108000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080624108000409"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Mine was not the lead new clause, but I would
still like to reply briefly to the Minister, who gave a very gracious
answer. Whatever the mechanics of my proposal, and however it might
conflict with provisions elsewhere in legislation, it was a genuine
attempt to brigade&#151;as she put it&#151;the key principles,
which are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>appropriate for the children and affected in the Bill. If she is happy
to set out such a list in the front of the care planning guidance
protocols, I would be delighted, and I look forward to seeing the
fruits of our labours.</div>
