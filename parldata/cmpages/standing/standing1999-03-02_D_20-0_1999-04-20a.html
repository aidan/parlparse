<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> I welcome you back to the Chair,
Mr. Malins, and welcome the fact that our deliberations 
on the Bill are now on the home strait. We were 
making good progress until something happened late 
last Wednesday night, but we are now nearing the end 
of the Bill. Clause 51 and the amendments tabled by 
my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) 
and myself contain some important provisions relating 
to disability. We are getting to the heart of the Bill 
when we can consider whether it is fair to disabled 
people.
<P>
If I were the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford 
(Mr. Davies), who is good at being outraged and using 
colourful language, now is the time when I would use it. 
However, I am a milder person than the hon. Gentleman, 
so I shall leave it to him to say how disgraceful he thinks 
these provisions are. The proposals cause a great deal of 
concern among the disability sector. I hope that when the 
Minister and his colleagues address the Committee, we 
shall hear how they judge the changes. I believe that the 
Government want to be fair to disabled people, but these 
changes, specifically the changes to the timing and period 
of contributions, will have a great impact on individuals 
who receive incapacity benefit.
<P>
I am unclear about why the Government have proposed 
these changes. It cannot be for the benefit of those 
individuals whose contributions will be changed, so it 
must be the Government's desire to reduce the number of 
people on incapacity benefit. We have heard much from 
the Conservatives about Alastair Campbell being the force 
behind many of these changes. The changes seem to be 
led by a desire to establish not an appropriate welfare 
system, but a welfare system that is led by the Treasury's 
demands for cuts. It is interesting that the right hon. 
Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) said that 
the conservative party no longer regards welfare as an 
issue of saving money. That would seem to put the 
Government firmly out of place on economic issues. 
Clearly, these measures must be the result of a desire to 
reduce the cost burden of incapacity benefit.
<P>
During last week's sittings, the Minister said that he 
did not believe that the change from the all-work test to 
the capability test would reduce the number of individuals 
who would be eligible for benefit, so we can only 
conclude that the Government think that the proposals are 
a way of taking people off incapacity benefit. When we 
discuss later amendments, I want to explore whether there 
might not be a better way to achieve that.
<P>
The proposals have been widely criticised by the 
disability sector. Ironically, in relation to certain 
amendments last week, we were all singing the praises of 
disability groups and saying how invaluable their 
contributions were. Although no Opposition members 
would expect the Government completely to buy in to the 
points made by such groups, we would have expected 
some of their very valid points to have found more of a 
listening ear.



<P>
It is not only the disability sector that has raised concerns 
on this issue. On Second Reading, on 23 February, the 
Government Benches were packed with rebels that is the 
best way to describe them eager to intervene and get in on 
the debate. Their concerns about those changes were led by 
the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). During 
that debate, when the changes to the contributions outlined 
in this clause were being discussed, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is impossible to square the provisions on incapacity benefit 
with the despicable phrase about something for nothing. We are 
talking about people who, through their working lives, have 
persevered and struggled to get back to work, often many times, 
after suffering disability. They did that in the knowledge that their 
contribution conditions were safe they had to make only one year's 
contributions in the whole of their working lives but now that is 
to be changed and they will have had to make one year's 
contribution in the past two years." [Official Report, 23 February 
1999; Vol. 326, c. 247-248.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the opposite of what the Labour party said before 
or during the election, and even once in government and 
presenting the Bill. The right hon. Member for 
Birkenhead sums up the concerns of Labour Members, of 
the disability sector and of the Liberal Democrats. It is 
not only politicians who have a reputation for caring about 
these issues. The Law Society, in its briefing on the Bill, 
said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the tightening of the contribution conditions for incapacity benefit 
to restrict entitlement to claimants who have recently been able to 
work will merely result in people with long term disabilities having 
to depend on income related benefits."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is therefore widespread worry about the proposed 
changes.
<P>
What has happened to the Government's principle of 
something for nothing? There will be many cases where 
individuals have made contributions and will now get no 
benefit in return. In some cases, these changes could lead 
to individuals with a contribution record of 10, 20 or more 
years, who become disabled after a period of 
unemployment, being unable to get anything back from 
their contributions.
<P>
Under the new criteria, there could be an illogical case 
of a person who has made 15 years' worth of 
contributions being unable to get incapacity benefit, while 
someone who has made contributions for just one year is 
able to get that benefit. That seems fundamentally unfair. 
Even if we shared the Government's aim of trying to 
reduce incapacity benefits by changing the contribution 
requirements, there must be a fairer way of doing it. I 
shall be interested to hear whether Ministers will 
acknowledge that point.
<P>
We believe that the two-year period is inappropriate. 
However, if the Government must go down that route, 
perhaps they will consider a different benchmark or 
measurement. If the contribution requirement were set 
at two years out of the previous 10 years, that would 
make the system fairer. Alternatively, as we suggest in 
amendment No. 139, the amount of contributions made 
over a life period could be the trigger for benefit 
eligibility, rather than the dates between which the 
contributions were made. For example, if a person had 
made 10 years' worth of contributions, it would not 
matter when in their working life they had been made. 
It would matter that they had built up those 
contributions.
<P>
Another group of amendments deals with the fairness 
of the system relating to people who might now be 
ineligible for incapacity benefit. I am pleased that the 
Government have recognised that there are groups of 
people especially carers and parents who will find it 
difficult to build up the contributions required to obtain 
benefits under the provisions. Amendments Nos. 137 and 
138 probe the Government to see whether they have fully 
thought out the mechanisms by which they will allow 
carers and others to bypass the contribution requirements.
<P>
The wording of the Bill needs to be much stronger. It 
allows for exemptions, but we would like to see the 
provisions tightened up so that people receiving invalid 
care allowance would be exempt from the contribution 
requirements. I ask the Minister to clarify how the 
government will address this matter, and to ensure that 
those receiving the care allowance will not be affected by 
the clause.
<P>
Our concern goes further than that. We welcome some 
of the indications that the Government are prepared to 
consider the matter. However, we need not only to have 
protection firmly incorporated for those on invalid care 
allowance; we also need to know the Government's plans 
for other carers or parents who do not get invalid care 
allowance. That cannot be the only factor by which we 
measure whether someone is a carer. About 400,000 of 
the 6 million carers in the country receive care allowance. 
Many carers, therefore, are not receiving care allowance 
and cannot build up contributions. How will those people 
be affected by the changes? Have the Government thought 
of ways to allow them to receive the benefit to which they 
should be entitled? It is not their fault that they have been 
helping out the state by being carers and have not been 
able to make the necessary contributions.
<P>
The Government have made few concessions. The 
amendments, particularly those that relate to the fairness 
of the changes with regard to disabled people, allow the 
Government to make concessions. If the Government are 
not prepared to accept the fundamental principle that they 
are taking the wrong line, the narrow matters of the period 
in which contributions are built up and of the guarantees 
for those carers who have not been able to make 
contributions, are ideal for reconsideration by Ministers. 
They should give concessions to disability groups who 
believe, as I do, that the changes are unfair to disabled 
people.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): We 
have now made a great deal of progress on the Bill. We 
have been sitting for nearly two months and have seen 
different aspects of the new Labour Government's regime 
under which we have been living for the past two years. 
Stakeholder pensions, with which we began, showed us 
the amusingly shambolic face of new Labour, which had 
devised a wonderful new compulsory and universal 
pension scheme based on the Australian model. At the last 
moment, new Labour removed the compulsion and left us 
with a structure that did not make sense. The trusts and 
supposed cheapness of the scheme, on which there was 
no need to take advice, no longer applied. We have seen 
new Labour as a shambolic party.
<P>
Our debate on pension sharing on divorce showed the 
politically correct new Labour party enforcing some 
unpleasant elements of unfairness on the public. We saw 
the disagreeably discriminatory treatment of those who 
were losing pension under a split.
<P>
This last part of the Bill brings us to the particularly 
unpleasant aspect of new Labour as the party of the means 
test new Labour, new means test. We discussed the 
abolition of the widow's benefit and its replacement by 
the means-tested bereavement benefit. We saw some less 
attractive aspects of what the new Labour Government are 
doing, but I am afraid that in clauses 51, 52, 53 and 54, 
we reach the nadir of unpleasantness.
<P>
I shall not be making jokes this morning or, indeed, 
this afternoon about Alastair Campbell or anything else 
because we are in difficult country. The Government are 
proposing sinister measures. Let us be clear about the 
reality. They are trying to claw back a large amount of 
money from people who would be entitled to it under the 
national insurance system. They cannot get away with 
that. The Government clearly stated the amounts in the 
explanatory notes. When the savings take full effect, they 
plan to save £700 billion a year on incapacity benefit 
[Hon. Members: "Billion?"] I am sorry. They plan to save 
£700 million on incapacity benefit and £100 million with 
the abolition of the severe disablement allowance. Some 
charities that work with disabled people calculate the 
former figure to be £750 million. Whatever the amount, a 
lot of money will be withdrawn from a vulnerable group 
of people.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Any humane or sensible Government would avoid a 
measure that is so obviously inhumane and vicious. Most 
Governments who are obsessed with their image would 
at least do the right thing for the wrong reasons. Most 
Governments would say, "We are going to make massive 
savings in our welfare system. We shall run down the 
national insurance aspects of our welfare system, which 
is the inheritance of Beveridge and his successors, but we 
shall do so in such a way that we are not seen to be 
penalising those who are most vulnerable those who are 
disabled and who, in many cases, will never again be able 
to work or to lead an ordinary life.
<P>
Why did the Government, who are so sensitive about 
their image, stoop to advancing those proposals? There is 
a clear, but unpleasant explanation. A hard-headed, 
cynical calculation has been made. If a Government 
reduce the disposable income of any group of people, they 
will pay an electoral price, which will be reflected in 
discontent and in a fall in their standing in the opinion 
polls. If they increase taxes, let inflation run, increase 
mortgage rates or do anything else to reduce people's 
current purchasing power, they will pay a price.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms): </b>A moment ago, the hon. 
Gentleman suggested that people on incapacity benefit 
may not work again. Does he acknowledge that a large 
number of people on IB will work again? Is not the 
problem with the system that we inherited the fact that it 
abandoned people on benefit? The help and support that 
the Government's proposals offer those people mean that 
they may be able to work again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister obviously does not like the 
theme that I am developing, and he is trying to deflect me 
from it, although he will not succeed in doing so. 
However, I shall give a straight answer to his not entirely 
relevant question. Of course, we all hope that people who 
are invalided at some stage in their life will ultimately be 
fully cured and restored to full health and vigour. 
However, in many cases, that is not even a theoretical 
possibility. Some people may be restored to sufficient 
health and vigour to enable them to work again, but in a 
different role. The Minister should put himself in the 
position of people who are disabled and who bravely fight 
back. They may take a job and go out to work in the 
morning, but they may be in pain when they do so. They 
will not go to work with the confident enthusiasm that 
they previously felt. They will not know when the 
symptoms of a particular problem will reappear 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford) rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in 
a few moments, but not in the middle of my sentence 
or paragraph.
<P>
I hope that Labour Members are capable of the 
elementary effort of empathy that is needed to put 
themselves in the situation that I have described. Many 
people who return to the labour market will never be 
able to play the role that they had before. They will 
have had to abandon their lifetime's aspirations and 
their settled way of life. They will have had to abandon 
their aspiration for a higher income. The Minister 
should not think that, because 50 per cent. of those 
who have been disabled manage to return to some form 
of employment as a result of a complete cure a 
completely satisfactory solution has been found to the 
problem that has afflicted those people's lives. That is 
not the case. Many people's lives, hopes and plans will 
have been permanently shattered, even if they are able 
to return to work to a limited degree. According to the 
Minister's figures, 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. of such 
people will never work again.
<P>
There are moments when the Minister of State tries the 
Committee's patience. I shall be blunt can he imagine 
how it would feel to suddenly find himself blind, deaf or 
crippled in a wheelchair? Can he imagine how that would 
affect his life? Can he imagine how he would respond to 
being told that he could still obtain some kind of 
employment, even though he was blind? He made a cruel 
and thoughtless remark, which I am afraid expresses 
all too clearly the spirit that pervades the new Labour 
Government. That spirit has led to these pernicious 
proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> The hon. Gentleman was saying that one 
of the problems of people with disabilities is having the 
confidence to find work. If they find work, they may 
worry about losing their benefits if they are unable to 
sustain that work. Our extension of the linking rule from 
eight to 52 weeks will give people the confidence to find 
new work, as they will be able to return to benefit if their 
new work is unsustainable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I want the hon. Gentleman to think 
through carefully perhaps not in the Committee, but in 
the silence of the night the point that I have just made. 
The kind of work that people may be able to do in the 
circumstances that he describes may be very different as 
a result of their affliction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt (High Peak):</B> I note in passing that the 
hon. Gentleman is referring only to incapacity benefit and 
not to all the other disability-related benefits, for which 
the people he described would still be eligible. People 
who suddenly become deaf, blind or otherwise disabled, 
and who lose their employment as a result of their 
disability, would qualify for incapacity benefit within the 
two-year period. We would not merely wish such people 
to return to employment, but pious hopes aside help 
them to do so. Furthermore, we would help them to stay 
in employment when their disability hits them. The hon. 
Gentleman is missing the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I have clearly touched a nerve. A 
systematic attempt is under way to deflect me from my 
line of my argument. It will not work. The hon. 
Gentleman's point is a complete red herring I did not 
mention benefits other than the incapacity benefit because 
we are not discussing such benefits. You would have 
corrected me, Mr. Malins, if I had done so.



<P>
I have already explained to the hon. Gentleman that, 
although such people will be able to return to work, that 
does not mean that they will be able to return to the 
position that they were in before the initial affliction that 
caused their disability. Clearly, I am in favour of every 
serious effort to help people who are willing and able to 
return to the labour market even if only to a limited 
extent to do so. However, that is not a reason for 
proceeding down the Government's line, as I shall 
demonstrate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna </B>(Cumbernauld and 
Kilsyth) rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I see that the Labour party is now calling 
on its Liberal Democrat allies for assistance. I look 
forward to hearing what the Liberal Democrat party has 
to say, but I shall first give way to the hon. Member for 
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna).
<P>
<B>Mrs. McKenna:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong to think 
that he has touched a nerve: he has totally distorted the 
facts, which is why Labour Members are incensed. Many 
young people are desperate to get back to work, but they 
do not have access to the support that is needed to help 
them to achieve that. Professional people have always had 
access to professional organisations, executive agencies 
and so on, but young people with little experience who 
are disabled, or who suffer a debilitating illness have no 
such opportunity. They will now have the chance to get 
back into work, because we shall have given them the 
support that they desperately need.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Lady makes a completely 
unexceptionable contribution to the debate indeed, it is 
most sympathetic but it has nothing to do with what I 
am talking about. She knows that we are at one in hoping 
to improve the services that are available to young people 
and others who are disabled. I have shown my good faith 
by endorsing the idea of job-orientated interviews and so 
forth so long as it is genuine help and the adviser is not a 
stooge from the Benefits Agency trying slyly to withdraw 
benefit. We discussed that issue the other day. I made it 
absolutely clear that the Opposition support genuine 
initiatives designed to help people back into work, if they 
are willing and able.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
giving way, particularly as he assumed that I was about 
to support the Government. In fact, the opposite is the 
case. I wish to make a point supportive of the hon. 
Gentleman's argument. Surely, if the Government are 
genuinely trying to help those people who have perhaps 
suffered some incapacity, the very worst thing would be 
to remove their incapacity benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a strong point, 
and I apologise for my false assumption about the reason 
for his wanting to intervene.
<P>
Labour Members may well be incensed by the time that 
I have finished my analysis of why the Government have 
gone down this road. I look forward to hearing from them 
if they think that they can persuade the Committee that 
my analysis is wrong. I shall not be deflected from asking 
why the Government have introduced this extremely 
unpleasant and invidious policy. How did a Government 
who are notoriously conscious of their image find 
themselves in such a situation? I shall answer that 
question with a hypothesis; if Labour Members can 
persuade me that I am wrong, I shall withdraw it.



<P>
The hypothesis not only makes theoretical sense; the 
Government's record shows that they have made an 
entirely cynical decision, of which they are perhaps 
secretly proud. The hypothesis is that, if one reduces 
people's disposable income for example, by, increasing 
taxes or reducing public expenditure one will pay a 
political price in the short term, but if one can claw back 
that money in such a way that it does not affect people's 
immediate disposable income, they will not notice.
<P>
People will not look at the value of a future reduction 
in their disposable income or of the benefit income to 
which they might otherwise have been entitled. The 
pensions tax, which is relevant in other parts of the Bill, 
and the abolition of the dividend tax credit enabled the 
Government to claw back no less than £5 billion a year, 
year in year out, from our pension funds. Perhaps the 
Government thought that the public were too innocent or 
too foolish to realise that the money was being taken out 
of their pockets because it reduced future incomes rather 
than today's because the pension funds are still 
accumulating and because people are not yet in receipt of 
those pensions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the 
Conservative Administration's change to the state 
pension, basing it on prices rather than earnings, is a 
parallel example?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman realise that 
his attempts to deflect me from my course with red 
herrings and irrelevancies simply reinforce the credibility 
of what I am saying? He is doing his Front Bench no 
favours by making such irrelevant interventions.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to address my analysis 
head on, let him do so. If he wants to tell me why I am 
wrong, let him do so instead of which he tells some sort 
of story about what a previous Conservative Administration did, which is completely irrelevant. Mr. Malins, you would not want me to pursue that matter; 
it would not serve the Committee to do so. I am talking 
about enormously important matters.
<P>
People in the Committee Room perhaps there are 
such people behind the Barrier who either work with 
disabled people or are disabled, will find it equally 
insulting that Labour Members make such irrelevant, 
cheap political jibes when we are discussing such an 
eminently serious matter for the future of disabled people.
<P>
My point is made because no one has risen from the 
Labour Benches to show that my analysis is wrong. Why 
have the Government decided to claw back £700 million 
under the clause, and another £100 million under clauses 53 
and 54, from disabled people? Of course, the Government 
hope that disabled people will not realise that they are the 
victims of that reduction.



<P>
None of us knows when we may become disabled. 
None of us knows when we may need to call on the 
national insurance benefits for which we pay all the 
time at least, all those of us who are lucky enough to be 
in work. No victim has been identified, so no group of 
people is prepared to tell the Government, "You are taking 
£700 million away from us and people like us."	 To show 
the magnitude, we know that about 2.5 million people in 
this country are disabled, but significantly less than
2 million people receive incapacity benefit.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making several 
varied points and is in danger of straying towards a clause 
stand part debate. Depending on how the debate develops, 
I shall make up my mind whether to have a clause stand 
part debate. The amendment is fairly narrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for that guidance. I should 
not like to deprive the Committee of an opportunity to 
have a clause stand part debate on a matter of crucial 
importance. In fact, together with clause 42, the clause is 
the worst aspect of what is a pretty bad Bill. Sometimes 
it is bad merely in that it is incompetent sometimes 
funnily so but no other clause is as savagely inhumane 
as this one. I shall not be drawn further down that road, 
despite the fact that Labour Members are tempting me. I 
shall reserve some of the remarks that I might otherwise 
properly have made in an introductory speech on the 
clause for the stand part debate. I shall go further in that 
good faith: I do not intend to move amendment No. 198, 
which would delete clause 51(3) and under which we 
could have dealt with some general matters. We shall 
confine ourselves to the specifics of the amendments in 
this group.
<P>
I shall speak to amendments Nos. 179, 231 and 289, 
which are crucial. My hon. Friend the Member for 
Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) has pointed out that 
there is an error probably a misprint in amendment 
No. 289. Instead of "line 7"	, it should read "line 11"	. 
I apologise to the Committee if my handwritten draft is 
responsible for the error. If it was introduced further down 
the process in the editing or printing stages, that is 
something that is almost bound to happen. I must say that 
the papers have been produced admirably accurately and 
on time, given the complexity of these matters and the 
pace at which we have been moving in Committee.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley):</b> I am grateful to the 
hon. Gentleman for his clarification. It is obvious that the 
amendment should read "line 11". When I marked my copy 
of the Bill, I put the proposed new paragraph (aa) at line 11. 
It could have been put in at either place, so it need not 
change the flow of the hon. Gentleman's argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Under-Secretary is extremely kind 
and gallant. I appreciate his remarks and am sorry if I 
have caused him to spend even a moment longer on his 
homework on the clause than he would otherwise have 
done.



<P>
I must make two general points about the 
Government's proposal to make sense of the amendment. 
Money will be reclaimed in two ways. Clause 51 changes 
the contribution rules, or the qualification rules, to filter 
out a greater number of people who qualify for incapacity 
benefit at present. Clause 52 will extend means-testing to 
incapacity benefit. To qualify for incapacity benefit, there 
are two contribution rules: first, if one has made a year's 
contribution to national insurance, and secondly, if in the 
past two benefit years, one has either paid or been credited 
with contributions. The Government want to change that, 
so that claimants will qualify only if they have made 
contributions not been credited with them in the past 
two years. The second criterion will continue to apply, 
which is rather strange, so that contributions or credits 
must have been made in both of the past two years. It 
might have been more straightforward and rather more 
honest certainly more helpful if, instead of continuing 
to have two contribution rules, the Government said that 
there is only one contribution rule: a claimant must have 
credits or contributions in the past two years, but 
contributions must have been made in one of those years.
<P>
I could not explain my amendment without making 
those remarks first, for reasons that the Committee will 
now appreciate. What is the difference between the two 
current contribution rules and the two new ones? Who 
will be filtered out by the new rules, but would have been 
admitted by the original rules? The amendments are 
intended to allow us to consider the categories of people 
who would pass today's contribution rules, but who will 
fail them if the Government get their way in the clause. 
They have said that, in addition to the filtering out 
exercise, they will take reserved powers by regulation 
under subsections (3) and (4) to enable them to make 
derogations in favour of one or two categories of 
claimants who are specified in the explanatory 
memorandum. Today, certain categories of people will 
pass the contribution test. Tomorrow if the Government 
have their way people will fail the test, yet there is the 
provision for the Government to use regulations to put 
some of the second category of people back into the first 
category and enable them to pass the test after all.



<P>
The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that two 
categories of people will benefit from the Government's 
apparent generosity or mercy and will be allowed back 
even though they will fail the Government's new criteria.
The categories are those who are in receipt of invalid care 
allowance for caring for a disabled person and, secondly, 
as set out on page 93 of the explanatory notes, those who 
were in receipt of invalidity benefit
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in the tax year before a new claim; without this protection, they 
may be unable to re-qualify for benefit after short breaks in 
entitlement."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are grateful for that degree of largesse in respect of 
those two categories. The Government have mitigated the 
impact of their new criteria in respect of those two defined 
groups. They do not go beyond those groups, however, 
and it is our contention that other equally deserving cases 
should not be filtered out in such a way. Given that we 
debate amendments before clause stand part and we set 
much store at having the chance to debate the clause and 
to vote against it, we must proceed on the assumption that 
the Government will get the clause. I hope that that will 
not be justified, however, because we do not want such 
changes.
<P>
We shall try, therefore, to reduce the damage of the 
clause to protect certain groups that are eminently worthy 
of protection. Otherwise, they will be excluded from 
incapacity benefit and will not be protected by the two 
derogations that the Government intend to make under 
regulation. It goes without saying that they have chosen 
narrow, deserving groups for those special retrospective 
concessions, no doubt because the final implications of 
letting them back within the fold of incapacity benefit will 
not frustrate the Treasury's intention of clawing back the 
full £700 million to which I referred earlier.



<P>
The groups that will be left out by the clause include 
those that any sane, let alone humane, person would have 
thought should not be excluded from incapacity benefit if 
he or she is disabled and has a record of contributions. 
Let us take the case of a mother who is looking after small 
children. She gave up work, looked after her children at 
least full time until they were five years old. She was out 
of the labour market for more than five years depending 
on the age gap between the children, that might have been 
between five and 10 years. She has a record of 
contributions and has national insurance credits. The 
scheme was devised humanely by a coalition Government 
to make sure that the role of motherhood was recognised; 
its whole point was for people to receive credits.
<P>
Now the Labour Government are saying, "That is no 
good. We shall not honour credits. It is no use your saying 
that you contributed in the past and now have credits. That 
is not good enough. We are changing the rules. You must 
have made a contribution in one of the past two years."	 I 
saw you taking advice from the Clerk earlier, Mr. Malins; 
I hope that he thought that my reading out the rules was 
relevant to the amendment, otherwise my argument would 
make no sense.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
That principle is inherent in the national insurance 
system. Indeed, national insurance started partly because 
it was recognised that motherhood is a good reason no 
longer to work; those who pay the contributions receive 
the credits. Through clause 51, the Government are 
subverting that system. I see that the Under-Secretary of 
State for Social Security has the honesty to nod his head.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman welcome the 
Government's proposal to give credits for the state second 
pension to those out of work who care for children under 
the age of five? That was not the case previously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> You see what happens when Ministers are 
cornered, Mr. Malins. They no longer want to answer the 
question. The Minister did not want to answer the 
question; he wanted to talk about something else. Labour 
Members will soon be asking about football something 
about which I know nothing so desperate are they to 
deflect attention from the Government's proposals.



<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): I shall ask the hon. 
Gentleman a precise question about national insurance 
contributions and credits. Is it not the case that for 
credited contributions subsequently to qualify for the 
benefits that we are discussing, there must have been a 
qualifying period of paid contributions? Credits on their 
own have never qualified for those benefits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Lady repeats what I said. It was 
a good thing that I described the present contribution rules 
and contrasted them with the contribution rules proposed 
by the Government. However, it might have been better 
if I had done it three or four times, because the hon. 
Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) clearly did 
not grasp the point on the first occasion. I shall tell the 
hon. Lady again, in case she does not know. The present 
rules make it clear that no one qualifies for incapacity 
benefit without a record of contributions. I agree with that. 
All Opposition Members believe in the contributory 
principle.
<P>
The present rules state that, regardless of how many 
credits one has, one must have paid one year's 
contributions. One must have been working for at least a 
year. One does not receive credits unless one has made 
some contribution. It does not matter that that statement 
has an element of tautology. Everyone must have a direct 
relationship with the national insurance system and have 
contributed for at least one year. One can qualify for 
incapacity benefit or other contributory benefits only if 
one continues to pay contributions or if one has credits.
<P>
Society has always recognised that certain activities 
should be given the same status as paid employment, 
because those activities are as valuable or more valuable 
to society, but that will not be recognised in new Labour 
Britain once the Bill is enacted. One of those activities is 
looking after small children. We therefore have the 
principle of national insurance credits, under which 
mothers who have given up work rightly in many 
cases to look after small children 
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): Will my hon. Friend 
give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Of course I shall give way, but I shall first 
finish the sentence.
<P>
It is a priority that mothers looking after small children 
should be treated as though they were continuing to 
contribute. In case the whole of new Labour has forgotten 
how the national insurance system works or is trying 
rapidly to forget how it has worked, because the 
Government now want to replace it let me tell the hon. 
Member for Colne Valley that that has always been the 
principle of the national insurance system. I hope that the 
hon. Lady is not proud of the Government for trying to 
destroy it.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall first give way to my hon. Friend 
the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier).
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point 
with customary passion. It goes to the heart of new 
Labour values that earlier in the Bill we discovered that 
young mothers with pre-school age children who dump 
their child-rearing on the state by getting state-funded 
child care in some cases, it is very expensive 
state-funded child care and who subsequently want to 
claim benefit will be eligible for it, but that those who 
decide to do the rearing themselves, should they be 
unfortunate enough to need benefit, will find that they do 
not qualify for it.



<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that 
intervention. He has a strong record in the House of 
standing up for the traditional family, which is of 
enormous value to individuals and society. I have much 
respect for his contributions in the House in debates on 
many Bills some of which he has promoted himself 
and in other contexts in support of that absolutely cogent 
theme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Pond (Gravesham):</B> Will the hon. 
Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall deal with the point made by my 
hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, but I shall take 
interventions from the Labour Members who are trying to 
interrupt me if they will be a little patient.
<P>
My hon. Friend and I may differ slightly on the 
nuances; I think that, in many circumstances, it is entirely 
responsible, reasonable and not at all psychologically 
damaging for children if their mothers either go out to 
work or return to work rather earlier than he would think 
ideal. It is important that people are allowed to make their 
own choices. Most people love their children they are 
their major priority. It is depressing and worrying that 
we occasionally hear of examples in our constituencies or 
otherwise where that is not the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Just a moment the hon. Gentleman must 
be patient. I shall take interventions from Labour 
Members in order in just a moment, but first I shall deal 
with the important point made by my hon. Friend. He and 
I would agree that it is wrong for the Government to bias 
people against looking after their own children, pushing 
them in the direction of returning to work prematurely in 
the eyes of the mother or the parent with care. That is bad 
enough, but the new Labour Government are, as I have 
said, not pushing those people; they are using crude 
economic sanctions to force that choice on vulnerable 
people.
<P>
I think that the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond) 
caught my eye first, so I give way to him if he still wants 
to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I was pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman 
disassociate himself from the comments of the hon. 
Member for Canterbury, who spoke of parents dumping 
their children on the state. Many working parents in 
Canterbury and elsewhere will take the phraseology that 
he used as an insult. I hope that the hon. Member for 
Grantham and Stamford will have a quiet word afterwards 
with his colleague on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman has rushed in, and 
other Labour Members have done the same at any price 
on any subject using any excuse to try to shield 
themselves from the Opposition's revelations about the 
content of the Government's proposals. If the hon. 
Gentleman has any concern for young families, I am sure 
that in his heart of hearts he will sympathise with my 
remarks, not with the Government's thoroughly 
disreputable, Treasury-driven intention to make savings at 
the expense of such people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> For the sake of coherence, I must give 
way in the order in which my eye was caught. I was about 
to give way to the hon. Member for Colne Valley, but she 
is deferring to the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and 
to my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Colne Valley. The 
hon. Gentleman spoke of revelations. I am sure that he 
would agree that those revelations should be factually 
accurate. When he was responding, with some passion, to 
my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Colne Valley, he 
suggested that women who are bringing up small children 
receive national insurance credits. That was the basis of 
his argument. In fact, he is wrong on that score. Women 
bringing up small children do not receive credits to 
incapacity benefit. As my hon. Friend said, he is mistaken 
on that point, so will he reflect on it and withdraw his 
argument?



<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No, the Under-Secretary is mistaken. That 
is the whole point of national insurance credits. Of course 
they are available for women with family responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> There are credits for the state pension in 
certain circumstances, but not for the wider range of 
contributory benefits. I am being as gentle and kind as I 
can to the hon. Gentleman, but he is wrong and I hope 
that he will desist from advancing an argument based on 
a misunderstanding of the contributions system that has 
existed for many years under his party when in 
government and ours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have every 
opportunity to set the matter right by voting for one of 
my amendments.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The national insurance principle 
always linked the benefits accrued from the national 
insurance paid to the benefit for which it was paid. For 
example, in the case of unemployment benefit, the 
national insurance had to be paid in the relevant income 
tax year. To keep that principle of connecting the benefit 
to the contribution, is it not right to look more closely at 
the qualifying period of paid contributions? Credits on 
their own without any period of paid contribution have 
never qualified people for unemployment or incapacity 
benefit. Is that not correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No, it is not. The hon. Lady is making 
the same mistake as the Under-Secretary. I have made it 
absolutely clear that the present system is one under 
which and rightly so credits alone will not qualify 
people for incapacity benefit. I think that that is the origin 
of the misunderstanding. I said that clearly when I set out 
the existing two contributions. To qualify, it is necessary 
that a claimant should have a year of actual contributions. 
I do not know whether the Under-Secretary thinks that I 
am unhappy with that. I am not. Today, there is a direct 
link between contributions and incapacity benefit. Anyone 
who wants to qualify for incapacity benefit must have 
credits over the past two years and a year of actual 
contributions. I am not seeking to change that.
<P>
As the hon. Lady said, there must be a link to the 
system involving not merely credits, but contributions. 
Indeed, a person would not qualify for credits unless he 
or she had made contributions. There is an element of 
tautology in the present rules. I am not seeking to change 
them. The Government are seeking to do that and to 
produce a system whereby only people who have a 
contribution record in one year out of the past two will 
qualify. The clause refers to a full year of contributions 
and anyone whose contribution record stopped more than 
13 months ago would no longer receive incapacity benefit.
<P>
Before I was subjected to a systematic attempt to push 
me off my course, I was going through the most deserving 
categories of people who would be excluded from 
incapacity benefit as a result of the change.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> May I reassure my hon. Friend that there 
is absolutely no difference between us on this point? I 
have never argued, in any forum or speech, as Labour 
Members have frequently tried to suggest, that women 
with small children should stay at home. My wife worked 
part-time when we had small children. The fact remains 
that many women would like the choice of being able to 
stay at home. There is another important category those 
for whom the only form of work available involves hours 
that are incompatible with child rearing. The Bill is 
providing taxpayer-funded child care for those mothers 
who choose to go out to work, with no balancing 
corrections. Ladies who apply for incapacity benefit will 
find that they are again disadvantaged. They will be 
unable to get it, whereas people who are subsided by the 
taxpayer for child care will be eligible. That is one more 
example of the system being biased against people who 
opt to look after small children or disabled relatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> During the intervention of my hon. Friend 
the Member for Canterbury, my hon. Friend the Member 
for Brentwood and Ongar has been consulting the rights 
guide to non-means-tested benefits, published by the 
Child Poverty Action Group. He has passed me the book 
saying, "You're right"	, but I shall have to ask him later 
for the page reference. I am glad to know that I am right. 
If I were wrong, I would be in very good company, as 
few people in the country know more about the benefits 
system than the Child Poverty Action Group.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for 
Canterbury, who has set the record straight. There is no 
difference between us on this matter. The attack made on 
him by the hon. Member for Gravesham was 
misconceived and misdirected, and I hope that the hon. 
Gentleman will withdraw his attack, which was 
unjustified.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel: I generally support the hon. Gentleman's </B><P>
theme, but will he consider the difference between 
amendments Nos. 197 and 289? Amendment No. 289 
refers to the need to include parents of children under 
five. Amendment No. 197 refers to replacing the 
restriction from
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"one of the last two complete years"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"one of the last five complete years"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which, I should have thought, would cut out those who 
had decided to stay at home for a while to look after their 
children. Our amendment No. 140, which would insert 
the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"two of the last ten"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would include such parents.
<P>
If I can draw the hon. Gentleman's attention from 
the interesting reading matter that he has in front of 
him, will he comment on the difference between 
amendments Nos. 140 and 197? Does he agree that 
amendment No. 140 would tend to include parents who 
have taken the opportunity to look after their own 
children at home, whereas amendment No. 197 would 
tend to exclude them? The hon. Gentleman might care 
to think about supporting amendment No. 140 in 
preference to amendment No. 197.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I noticed that the Liberal Democrats had 
been rather more generous than us and I accept that their 
amendment would protect a wider range of people. I am 
happy to support it and to urge my hon. Friends to do so 
if it is put to the vote.
<P>
A matter that is not entirely germane to my 
amendments has been raised. I think the phrase was that 
I had got my facts wrong. It is parliamentary custom that 
if one is so accused, one is allowed to justify one's 
remarks and set the record straight. My hon. Friends have 
found in this extremely helpful and authoritative book the 
two sentences that set out the rules for obtaining credits. 
They are the same rules that I referred to earlier, so I have 
already used the material.
<P>
There is plenty of evidence that the Government want 
to talk about anything under the sun, except what they 
are doing to incapacity benefit. They want to think about 
everybody under the sun, rather than the people who will 
be excluded invidiously from incapacity benefit. We 
cannot let the Government do that. We will force the 
Committee to focus on the groups of people who will be 
deliberately excluded from incapacity benefit under the 
Government's proposals. The people who have worked 
and contributed to national insurance in the past and who 
currently qualify will now be told, "If you become 
disabled, you will not qualify for this benefit. All you get 
are means-tested benefits.".
<P>
The Government want to throw everyone who currently 
receives a contributory benefit on to means-tested 
benefits. We know that that is part of their grand strategy. 
It is important for the Committee to focus on, and think 
carefully about, some human examples. What about 
mothers who give up work to look after their children? I 
must be repetitive, because the Government do not even 
recognise the facts of history: until now, the national 
insurance system has recognised that mothers who look 
after their children are as valuable and precious to society 
as people who work, and are equally deserving of national 
insurance contributory benefits.
<P>
For the past 60 years, we have had a system of national 
insurance credits. Perhaps I should explain to the new 
Labour party that national insurance credits represent a 
right to national insurance contributory benefits even if 
the claimant has not paid national insurance contributions 
or if his or her employer has not paid contributions for 
class 1 employed persons. National insurance credits are 
notional entitlements they could be described as 
warrants that are provided by society in recognition of 
the fact that the role of mothers looking after small 
children is equivalent to, or even greater in value than, 
that of those who work. It would be unreasonable to 
exclude them from any contributory benefits for which 
they would otherwise qualify for example, incapacity 
benefit under the all-work test, which is to be replaced 
with the personal capability assessment.
<P>
The Government do not believe that mothers should 
qualify. The Opposition believe that they should. People 
who look after their small children have a back-breaking 
task, which must be done properly, consistently and every 
day, including Saturdays and Sundays, and sometimes in 
the middle of the night if a child is ill. We have always 
valued that and the consensus in this country has been to 
give that occupation at least the same value as paid work. 
Amendment No. 289 specifically recognises that.
<P>
Other categories of people will be excluded from 
incapacity benefit under the Bill, and the purpose of the 
amendments is to include those also. We shall vote 
against the clause because we do not want it in the Bill, 
but if we must have it, we want to mitigate its effects by 
protecting specific categories of people beyond the two 
small groups that the Government say they will protect 
by way of regulation.
<P>
One group covers those who were employed until 
recently before, or perhaps until, they became disabled or 
applied for incapacity benefit, but whose earnings were 
below the lower limit. It has always been a feature of the 
national insurance system that if earnings are below the 
lower earnings limit for contributions, they do not qualify 
for benefits. That has always been the case and it is harsh 
on someone with a low-paid job, but I am not seeking to 
complain about that now. I do not seek to rewrite that 
measure. However, under the present system the details 
of which I do not need to repeat a third time if someone 
who earned above the lower earnings threshold, and 
therefore paid contributions, subsequently falls below that 
threshold, he or she is still protected.



<P>
That is particularly relevant in the case of the disabled 
because many disabling conditions are progressive 
perhaps regressive is a more appropriate term; people's 
health and faculties gradually decline. So what will 
happen under the Government's proposals? If someone 
finds that he or she can no longer work full time or earn 
the same salary, he must do something else; the 
Government are saying that anyone who can work must 
do so, that they are going to push people out the door. All 
the provisions in the Bill are designed to do that. What 
will be the effect on incapacity benefit? The Government 
are sending a signal to disabled applicants that if they 
have an up-to-date contributions record for one complete 
year of the previous two, they will receive incapacity 
benefit. However, if they have allowed their earnings to 
fall below the lower earnings limit, they will not qualify 
because they do not have that full contribution record. 
Credits in such cases will be disregarded. One must have 
a complete year of contributions; nothing that happened 
two years or more ago will be recognised.
<P>
As I said Labour Members did not contradict it if 
one's earnings, even as recently as 13 months previously, 
fell below the lower earnings threshold and one ceased to 
contribute, one is done for one has lost all entitlement. 
One might have had 20 to 30 years before that of paying 
constant contributions to national insurance, year in, year 
out, because one has had a full employment record and 
one has lost the lot. One is told by the new Labour 
Government, "Ha, ha! You've lost it we've got your 
contributions in our pockets and we are not going to pay 
you the benefit now, no matter how badly you are 
disabled."	 That is the new Labour Government and that 
is what will happen under the clause.
<P>
We should be sympathetic and supportive of someone 
who finds that his or her capacities, faculties and energies 
are failing but who hangs on in his or her job, perhaps 
hoping that things will get better; that is a reasonable, 
sensible and responsible and, in many cases, 
optimistic line to take. We do not want to discourage 
people or to clobber them in the way that the Government 
propose. Amendment No. 289 would protect people, 
providing for regulations to be made for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the contribution conditions to be deemed to be satisfied in the case 
of persons who in any complete twelve month period in the course 
of the two years before becoming disabled had been credited with 
contributions of a relevant class...or who had over such a period 
been regularly employed on a level of earnings below the Lower 
Earnings Limit."	<P>

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford:</B> We have had an interesting discourse 
about the principles behind national insurance 
contributions. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the 
lower earnings level has always been a point below which 
a person does not qualify for benefits, because those 
payments could not be paid or deemed? The Government 
want the lower earnings level to stay the same and the 
threshold of payment to rise, which will bring significant 
savings to low-paid workers.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> There is something unreal about our 
debate, which will be clear when Hansard is published. I 
say something, after which an Opposition Member asks 
me to recognise exactly what I have just said.
<P>
I have always recognised the fact to which the hon. 
Member for Colne Valley alluded and I asked my hon. 
Friends to correct me if I was under an illusion. I 
explicitly stated that I accept that if a person's lifetime 
earnings are below the lower earnings limit, he will not 
qualify for national insurance benefits, although I 
appreciate that that can be harsh. I am beginning to repeat 
myself, but I have to do so. The hon. Lady does not or 
affects not to take on board what I say the first time 
that I say it. It would be peculiar if I did not endorse her 
comments, because she asked me to agree with something 
that I had said five minutes earlier. She is right about the 
lower earnings limit.
<P>
Perhaps I can remove the source of the hon. Lady's 
genuine confusion by making it clear that, in relation to 
the categories that are contained in amendment No. 289, 
one need not have benefits from credits or notional 
entitlement I used the word "deemed"	 if one has a 
record of five years' actual contributions. Perhaps she did 
not read to the end of amendment No. 289 and it might 
be helpful if I read it out for her.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is entirely unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> With your permission, Mr. Malins, may I 
read the amendment's last two lines?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall compromise on that. The 
hon. Gentleman knows that our debate is in danger of 
becoming slightly general.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I accept that, but the alternative is to allow 
Labour Back Benchers to try to throw dust in my eyes 
and to distract me from my arguments, which leaves me 
with the invidious choice 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are in danger of straying 
into interesting areas. The hon. Gentleman should stay in 
order and restrict his remarks to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I shall stay so closely to the amendment 
that I shall quote from it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes </B>(Doncaster, North): The hon. 
Gentleman has just been told that he cannot do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I think that I can quote the last two lines 
of the amendment, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provided that any such person had actually paid contributions of a 
relevant class for at least five complete years."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It should be clear by now to the hon. Member for Colne 
Valley that we believe that to qualify for national 
insurance benefits one must have maintained payment for 
five years, which is a stricter requirement than that which 
currently applies. I suspect that the hon. Lady will vote 
for extremely restrictive clauses that will limit people's 
right to incapacity benefit, compared with their present 
entitlement, and that she is happy with any proposal that 
restricts rather than entitles. That is the new Labour 
Government's stance.
<P>
Amendment No. 289 mentions several categories. I 
have already discussed mothers Labour Members 
maintained an embarrassed silence or made irrelevant 
interventions when I did so and the lower earnings limit. 
[Interruption.] The Minister of State will have many 
opportunities to advance his own arguments and he can 
intervene now if he wants to.
<P>
Amendment No. 289 would also protect people who 
have been
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"engaged full time over such a period in caring for a disabled 
person"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>


<P>
The arguments that were relevant to mothers are also 
relevant in this context. Although it was not part of the 
original Beveridge corpus, we have come to recognise that 
caring for a disabled person is as valuable a task socially 
as going out to paid employment. If a person cares for a 
relative, close friend, spouse or partner, the state is in a 
sense relieved of the need to provide care for the person 
who can no longer look after himself or herself. Asking 
whether the state wishes to encourage such displays of 
family solidarity goes to the heart of the matter. I am sure 
that my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury also has 
strong views on that.



<P>
People with caring responsibilities, who have a 
contributions record and who gave up paid work to care, 
should not be cruelly told if they, too, become disabled 
that they will be cheated of the national insurance 
premium that they paid over many years. But that would 
be the effect of the Government's proposal, except in 
relation to carers who are in receipt of invalidity care 
allowance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) was right 
to make the point that not all carers qualify for ICA. This 
is another Government sleight of hand, There may be 
good reasons why people do not qualify for ICA. Some 
carers may not have even applied for it. Why should 
people be denied their entitlement to a contributory 
benefit because they have been good enough not to claim 
another benefit to which they might have been entitled? 
Many people deliberately do not claim the benefits to 
which they are entitled.
<P>
Another reason for not claiming ICA is the condition 
that the carer the Minister of State will correct me if I 
am wrong must be formally resident in the same place 
as the person for whom he or she cares. The carer may 
live next door or down the street, or we have a good 
reason to retain a house or flat of his or her own. That 
would exclude the carer from claiming ICA even if he 
was engaged full time in looking after a disabled person. 
If the Government are sincere in their intention to protect 
carers, they should say so; they should not limit protection 
to carers who receive ICA. Our proposal would protect 
all carers.
<P>
Our amendments would protect another group that 
deserves our sympathy, not our rejection. Some people 
who become disabled while unemployed have a 
contributions record. The new Labour Government have 
little sympathy for the unemployed. I accept that some 
people may be shirkers and are reluctant to get back into 
the job market. They are the non-deserving unemployed. 
That is why we approved the Government's attempt to 
strengthen the jobseeker's allowance, which we 
introduced, through work-focused interviews and other 
measures that provide a necessary element of discipline.
<P>
Let us assume that shirkers who are trying to sponge 
off the state I suspect that their number is not as great 
as the Government believe will be filtered out by the 
new processes and disciplines. That leaves us with the 
genuine unemployed. All hon. Members know from their 
constituency experience how difficult it is for people who 
have been made redundant, through no fault of their own, 
to get back into the job market. It is especially difficult if 
they are over 40 or 50 or, in some cases, even 30 or 35. 
It is pathetic. We all know of people who have made 
hundreds of job applications in a desperate attempt to get 
work. The Government will cut off those people, who are 
earning credits, from the right to claim incapacity benefit 
because they are temporarily unemployed.



<P>
I take it that the memory of Labour Members is not so 
short term that, after five or 10 minutes, we have to repeat 
everything because they have forgotten it, so I shall not 
rehearse the argument on credits. Under the rules, an 
unemployed person with a record of one full year's 
contributions over a two-year period receives the credits. 
If that person becomes disabled during those two years, 
he or she is eligible for incapacity benefit. Under the 
Government's proposals, someone who, through no fault 
of his or her own, is unemployed at the relevant time 
when disaster strikes be it an accident, disease or 
whatever will find that he or she no longer qualifies. 
That is brutally inhumane. The amendment would 
reverse that.
<P>
I have set out what we are trying to achieve but, I 
repeat, we do not really want to accept any of the 
amendments, although we shall, of course, vote for them 
when we are given the opportunity to do so. We want to 
remove the clause from the Bill because it represents an 
entirely unjustified emasculation of an important part of 
our national insurance system.
<P>
The Government are trying to save money by excluding 
from the opportunity to receive incapacity benefit a range 
of people who, under present rules, are fully entitled and 
have always been entitled to incapacity benefit. Those 
people are thoroughly justified in believing that they have 
been paying national insurance contributions partially to 
insure themselves against a particular disaster in life, 
which incapacity, whether indefinite or medium term 
for more than six months inevitably means.
<P>
In respect of many conditions, even when people 
manage to recover somewhat, they will never be the same 
again. Therefore, we are talking about very vulnerable 
people. The Government are attempting to extract a lot of 
money from such people in future because they are not 
afraid to short change those who have been contributing 
to the national insurance system in good faith.



<P>
The Government are plumbing the depths of cynicism 
in these proposals, which do not deserve the slightest 
sympathy or support from anyone in the House because 
they are contrary to the principles that have guided our 
social legislation and social policy in the House of 
Commons throughout the century.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> Much of our debate so far has been an 
interesting one relating to whether clause 51 strengthens 
or weakens the contribution principle. In the process, we 
have had a valuable debate about the contribution 
principle itself. Members of the Social Security Select 
Committee, many of whom are also members of the 
Standing Committee, will have an opportunity to pursue 
that debate further in the months ahead. It is an important 
debate because, in recent years, there has been a 
considerable weakening of the contribution principle; the 
link between contributions and entitlements.
<P>
For example, under the previous Government national 
insurance rates were increased by 50 per cent. during 
a time when benefits were substantially cut. That 
included the £10 billion that was taken from the pension 
system by cutting the link with earnings and the 
reduction in state earnings-related pension scheme 
entitlement. Some £3 billion was taken from the 
unemployed when the entitlement to contributions-based 
unemployment benefit was halved with the introduction 
of jobseeker's allowance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford used the 
term cynicism, which is quite inappropriate to describe 
what the Government are trying to do. However, in 
relation to incapacity benefit, it is important to reflect that, 
in recent years under the previous Government, there was 
a cynical attempt to get people off the unemployment 
register and on to incapacity benefit as a mechanism for 
getting the unemployment figures down. That meant that 
many people, particularly the older unemployed, were 
written off. They were told that they were sick and would 
never work again, that jobs could not be found for them 
and that no assistance would be given to help them to 
find work.
<P>
We have a very different approach. The Government 
are not willing to write people off, but are saying that 
they will assist people into employment if they have the 
opportunity to do so. That is one of the purposes of the 
new deal for older unemployed people. The clause helps 
to strengthen the link between contributions and benefit 
entitlement, because it ensures that incapacity benefit is a 
work-based benefit, as it was always intended to be.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I ask the hon. Gentleman a similar 
question to the one that I put to Conservative Members. 
How will refusing incapacity benefit to people who 
become incapacitated, but do not have the correct 
contribution record help them to get back into work?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> The clause is not, in itself, a mechanism for 
getting people back into work. The purpose of the provision 
is not to push people into employment. The clause, and the 
amendments to it, must be seen in the context of the 
Government's other measures to assist those groups. Many 
of the amendments would institutionalise the breaking of 
the link between contributions and the entitlement to 
incapacity benefit as a work-based benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): Does 
the hon. Gentleman accept the Government's estimate that 
the clause will save about £700 million a year, after 10 
years? Which category of people will therefore no longer 
qualify for incapacity benefit? It cannot be true that 
everything is sweet and dandy and that there will be a 
saving of £700 million, while at the same time everyone 
is helped by the clause. Who will suffer as a result of 
the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> The hon. Gentleman must look at the 
overall expenditure implications of the Government's 
measures. The balance sheet shows that people with 
disabilities are coming out on top in that accountancy 
process.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool and Fleetwood): I 
thank my hon. Friend [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Order must be kept in the 
Gallery, otherwise steps will be taken.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Humble:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for 
Gravesham for giving way. I draw to his attention the 
regulatory impact assessment, which, on page 20, 
paragraph 8, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Overall spending on benefits for people who are ill or disabled 
has reached almost £25 billion a year and will continue to rise as 
the Government meet increasing demand and seek to do more for 
those in greatest need."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does my hon. Friend welcome the Government's support 
for those who are disabled and the substantial amount that 
is being spent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I certainly welcome the Government's 
approach. We have heard a lot of synthetic passion this 
morning, but the Government's approach is not 
patronising and it recognises that most people with 
disabilities want to make a contribution, to work and to 
build on their skills, aspirations and abilities. That is the 
intention of the measures.
<P>
I cannot support the amendments and I support clause 51 
as it stands. There is a provision that the contribution 
conditions will be based on a multiple of the lower earnings 
limit, which means that the number of weeks that a person 
will have to work to meet those contribution conditions will 
vary. Ministers know that I have a particular concern for 
people in low-paid work. Those who are ill or disabled are 
often more likely to be in low-paid employment.
<P>
I would like to press Ministers to consider the number 
of weeks that people on, for example, the minimum wage 
will have to work to fulfil those contribution conditions. 
The minimum wage will itself be most helpful but, as it 
is outside the scope of the Bill, I will not press your 
patience, Mr. Malins, by going into greater detail on the 
subject.



<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): It is a great 
pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Gravesham. I 
have sympathy with him. His knowledge of this matter is 
enormous, and it is always difficult for those who have a 
lot of knowledge to be put up by their party to defend 
the indefensible. I remember that the hon. Member for 
Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) once 
speculated that some hon. Members would put forward a 
case for the slaughter of the innocents if their Whips asked 
them to do so. We now know that the hon. Gentleman 
would be available for that difficult task.
<P>
Hon. Members: "Disgraceful."	
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> They are prepared to bomb Belgrade.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. No sedentary interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> This is not so much welfare reform as 
welfare dismantlement. I cannot compete with the 
immense passion and depth of knowledge of my hon. 
Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, so I shall 
make four narrow points on the amendments, which you 
have wisely grouped together, Mr. Malins.
<P>
The measure is designed to cut the number of people who 
can receive incapacity benefit, but the amendments would 
widen that pattern. We were fortunate to hear a contribution 
from the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt), who said 
that many unemployed people received incapacity benefit. 
The hon. Member for Gravesham suggested that there was 
a conspiracy. I think that the suggestion would have been 
worthy of the great American film director, Oliver Stone. It 
was suggested that, under the previous Government, 
messages from Downing Street filtered through to the 
Benefits Agency and that those who did not qualify for 
incapacity benefit were pushed on to it to reduce the 
number of people on unemployment benefit. Clearly, that 
is absurd.
<P>
All the experts say that the Government's proposals 
will reduce the number of people on incapacity benefit 
by about 170,000 so 170,000 people who would have 
qualified for incapacity benefit will no longer be able to 
rely on it. They will have to apply for means-tested 
benefits. If their wives or husbands work, or if they do 
not qualify for means-tested benefits, they will receive 
nothing, as the citizens advice bureaux brief states. The 
state will abandon them. Their standard of living will 
drop, regardless of their contributions, until their savings 
are eaten away and they qualify for means-tested benefits.
<P>
The Government suggest that no efficient link exists 
between employment and the benefit, or that it is tenuous. 
They say that those who are unemployed should not 
qualify for the benefit. In an excellent brief, the citizens 
advice bureaux state that it is quite likely that many of 
those people who become unemployed while off sick will 
be in receipt of statutory sick pay and that many sick 
workers will be dismissed early because of their period of 
illness. The citizens advice bureaux make another good 
point: those who become incapacitated while 
unemployed, especially those suffering from mental 
health problems, will be peculiarly disadvantaged under 
the clause. The amendments would ameliorate those 
effects.



<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and 
Stamford did not mention the fact that the clause is likely 
to have a perverse effect in that it will act as a disincentive 
for those on incapacity benefit to seek work if they are ill 
or disabled.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford referred 
to the 52-week period. I remember the statutory 
instrument by which that period was introduced, and we 
welcomed it. The hon. Gentleman is not in his place, but 
perhaps Labour Members will mention the point to him, 
so that he can respond to it later. With respect to him, 
what he said about the 52-week period misses the point 
in so far as any period of unemployment will affect a 
person's ability to claim incapacity benefit. Rather than 
strengthen the link to work, the provision will act as a 
disincentive to people to go into work. The Royal 
National Institute for the Blind said that it would have the 
perverse effect of someone who had been unemployed for 
two years, but who had worked for 10 years, not being 
able to qualify, but someone who had worked two years 
and was unemployed for 10 years being able to qualify.
<P>
The provision will break the link with the contribution. 
The contributions of people who had assumed that the 
state would look after them, or make a contribution if they 
were incapacitated because they made contributions over 
a lengthy period, will be cast asunder. The Government 
are not right in general, but if they are right that certain 
people are claiming incapacity benefit inappropriately, 
surely the way to solve that will be not to restrict a 
person's qualifications and reduce the level at which his 
or her contributions can be taken into consideration, but 
to use the gateway to benefits, such as the all-work test 
or the personal capacity test.



<P>
Ministers have spoken at great length about how 
important it is to ensure that claims are correct, are put in 
the proper order and that fraudulent or inappropriate 
claims are stopped at the point at which they are 
submitted. Why not apply that test to all-work or personal 
incapacity tests? After all, we know from last week's 
debates that there is no difference in the medical 
assessments.
<P>
Members of the Committee have been fortunate in 
receiving a high level of briefing. The Disability Benefits 
Consortium said that it was unacceptable to deny benefits 
to thousands of genuine claimants on the basis that some 
may be getting benefits to which they are not entitled. The 
consortium's briefing also contains an interesting example 
that has not been mentioned. It illustrates how the clause 
will operate and concerns a gentleman called Jack, who 
was a miner in south Yorkshire. It is good of the 
consortium to lobby on behalf of miners. There was a 
time when they were considered folk heroes by the 
Labour party, which would have done anything to help 
the National Union of Mineworkers. The gentleman had 
worked down the pit for 30 years since the age of 16. He 
was made redundant at the age of 46. The consortium 
continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"At first he was hopeful of finding alternative work and made 
strenuous efforts to do so for three years. As time went on he became 
increasingly depressed and was finally admitted to hospital with 
serious depression following a suicide attempt."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the current system, Jack would have been able to 
apply for incapacity benefit following his discharge from 
hospital. Under the Government's proposal, Jack would 
be excluded from benefit because he had not worked for 
the past two years, despite having worked hard for the 
previous 30 years. He would have to rely instead on 
means-tested benefit. That is what the amendments would 
ameliorate and change.



<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and 
Stamford was courageous when he said that he did not 
like any of our amendments, or even those tabled by the 
Liberal Democrats I suspect that in their hearts, the 
Liberal Democrats do not like their amendments. We 
should prefer not to have to table them, but given that 
the Government are determined to push their proposals 
through, we are trying to guide them away from their own 
folly. It is not them who will suffer I sincerely hope that 
all hon. Members will enjoy good health but the 
170,000 people who could otherwise claim incapacity 
benefit who will now be abandoned by the state.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Another statement from the Disability Benefits 
Consortium was so striking that it caught the eye of the 
person who put together the research document on this 
Bill. In commenting on the clause, page 73 of that 
document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This makes a mockery of the Government's promises not to 
harm the genuinely disabled."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I can think of no better way to end my speech because 
that sums up the dilemma. I hope that the Government 
will think long and hard about their proposals. It is about 
time that they started accepting Opposition amendments, 
which would improve the Bill and bring about the 
Government's original intentions. The clause makes a 
mockery of the Government's original statements of 
intent.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I was tempted to intervene so many times 
in the speech of the hon. Member for Brentwood and 
Ongar, but I thought that it would be more courteous to 
him and the Committee if I were to make my comments 
all at once afterwards. I was stimulated by his remark that 
under the Government's proposals, unemployed people 
cannot qualify for incapacity benefit. That is incorrect and 
it is not what the Bill says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I thought that I heard the hon. Gentleman 
say those words. We shall check Hansard tomorrow to 
find out whether my hearing or his memory is at fault.
<P>
The two-year qualification period covers two tax or 
contribution years, but it could be nearer three years if it 
were close to the end of the third year, say in March, 
when someone made a claim for incapacity benefit. The 
person could have been out of touch with the labour 
market for almost three years before making a claim, but 
he would still qualify. He need have worked for only four 
weeks in that period. If he was on average male earnings, 
he would have reached the contribution threshold nearly 
three years ago on the basis of only four weeks' work. In 
any case, it would be a maximum of only 25 weeks' work. 
Within that three-year period, the person would not only 
have access, through the new deal for disabled people, to 
assistance on appropriate work, but extra help would be 
triggered by the fact that he had been out of work for two 
years or more, provided that he was seeking employment.



<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar talked 
about the previous system and the allegations about 
whether it was a true representation of the situation. He 
should answer the question that I put to one of his
hon. Friend's in an earlier sitting. Does he believe that 
one quarter of all males between the ages of 60 and 65 
are incapable of any work whatsoever? That is what the 
present incapacity benefit statistics would lead us to 
believe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am interested in that point. It seems to 
be directly contrary to what the Government were saying 
last week, which was that they do not believe that those 
who are receiving incapacity benefit under the current 
rules are in any way cheating the system or that the new 
test is stricter or will cut out anyone who is currently 
eligible; they believe that the tests are being fairly and 
properly carried out. That is exactly contrary to the point 
that the hon. Gentleman just made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I am not suggesting that any of those 
people are claiming improperly, but a quarter of 60 to 
65-year-old unemployed males receive incapacity benefit. 
That proportion is double what it was 20 years ago. I 
cannot believe that the health of our nation is twice as bad 
as it was 20 years ago. A large number of those people 
are capable of some work and not, as the statistics would 
lead us to believe, incapable of any work.
<P>
Far from departing from the contributory principle, the 
Bill introduces elements to it, such as the measure that 
disabled people will, under the stakeholder pension 
scheme, get credits towards their pensions through periods 
of economic inactivity when their earnings are under 
£9,000 they may not have any earnings at all. That is an 
extension of that contributory principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument now 
appears to be that people who are capable of getting back 
to work are cut out by the new regulations. What evidence 
has he that the 170,000 people who will lose their 
eligibility to incapacity benefit are those who could go 
back to work and that those who will not lose eligibility 
could not go back to work?



<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> No one who is claiming will lose the right 
to any of the benefit that he or she is receiving. A package 
of benefits the disability income guarantee, the 
disability living allowance and the increased premium on 
disability for income support exists to give appropriate 
cover for all those people in all those circumstances. We 
may end up with a quarter of people aged 60 to 65 still 
qualifying for incapacity benefit; the important point is 
that if people in work become disabled, they are given 
maximum assistance to stay in work and that if they lose 
that work, they are given maximum assistance to get back 
into work if they are capable of doing so. Where they are 
genuinely incapable of work and not seeking work 
because of that incapacity, their dignity will be maintained 
through a proper standard of living.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): We have had an 
interesting debate. After the marvellous tour de force of 
my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, 
which was a classic Committee speech, there is little to 
be said. Given his past record, his passion on the matter 
is genuine. There is no point in repeating the many fine 
points that he and my hon. Friend the Member for 
Brentwood and Ongar made and I shall take a slightly 
different direction.
<P>
The point that I want to follow is how we are to reform 
incapacity benefit because it must be reformed. Are the 
Government reforming it in the right way, should we leave 
it alone or should we reform it in the way proposed by the 
two principal amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats 
and by my hon. Friend? To pick up the point made earlier, 
by May 1998 1.6 million people 7 per cent. of the 
population received incapacity benefit, which was three 
time more than when the Government came into power. If 
the Conservative Government had won the election, they 
would have radically reformed incapacity benefit. The 
Government's proposal is not the right way to reform it, 
because they announced ahead of time that they hope to 
save £700 million by such reforms. I have no idea how 
much less money would be saved by the Government if the 
amendments were passed, but one reason why those who 
look after the interests of disabled people took a dim view 
of the clause is that the Government said that they intend to 
save £700 million.



<P>
That is why the Disability Benefits Consortium said 
that people who have an extensive work record, albeit in 
the past, and who become unemployed might not even be 
covered by the amendments. It said that, under the 
changes, some people with a previous extensive work 
record who are unemployed before becoming disabled 
would not be entitled to incapacity benefit. Many will 
have paid contributions for many years on the 
understanding that if, in the future, they become 
incapacitated they would be entitled to benefit. Those who 
look after the rights of disabled people are making a fair 
point. It is not good enough for the Government to say, 
"We must do something. Clearly, incapacity benefit is 
being misused. The numbers receiving it have increased 
threefold; it is just being used as a replacement for 
unemployment benefit."	
<P>
Those may be valuable points, but the Government 
must take on board some of the points made by my hon. 
Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford. I do not 
know what the solution is. Is it to do nothing? Is it to say, 
"Well, if you worked for two years or for some time 
during the past 10 years paying your contribution, you 
will not fall foul of the clause"	? I am not convinced that 
what the Government are doing is right nor am I 
convinced that what is proposed under the amendments 
is right.
<P>
The amendments have been tabled to generate a debate. 
I accept that, but some time in our proceedings, on Report 
or in the Select Committee on Social Security, we must 
seriously debate what incapacity benefit is for and how it 
should be reformed. Something is very wrong with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making some 
important points. However, it might have made more 
sense to have waited for the Government's other 
initiatives on getting disabled people back to work, such 
as the new deal or other pilot schemes some of which I 
doubt will ever run nationally to be bedded in and see 
how effective they were before making the changes to 
incapacity benefit. Select Committees, such as that of 
which the hon. Member for Gainsborough is a member, 
could make valued judgments about whether the safety 
net of the new job measures in place was enough to make 
the changes to incapacity benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is a fair intervention and I accept it 
completely.
<P>
If someone has contributed all his life and becomes 
incapacitated, as happens naturally to many people under 
the aging process, should that person's incapacity benefit 
be removed simply because he made provision for a 
personal or occupational benefit? If that person receives 
an occupational pension of, say, £179 a week, he would 
lose his incapacity benefit. That is another philosophical 
question that I do not have the expertise or knowledge to 
answer. I do not know what the answer is.



<P>
How can the Government argue that people who have 
provided for a personal or occupational pension should 
lose incapacity benefit? Surely that is an unarguable 
proposition. We are not talking about people who receive 
a large occupational or personal pension £179 per week 
is not a fortune. If the clause is agreed to unamended, 
such people will lose incapacity benefit.
<P>
As has been said, often people do not become suddenly 
incapacitated and there may be a period of gradual 
decline. It is unfair that people who have worked all their 
life but have not managed to sustain their contributions in 
the previous two years will be hit by the Government's 
proposal.
<P>
The clause, if unamended, will be fundamentally 
unjust. Something must be done about incapacity benefit, 
however, and to that extent I support the Government. I 
am not making a party political speech. Incapacity benefit 
is not working and has been abused.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an important 
point. The critical point that he made a moment ago 
relates to the next clause.
<P>
Would the hon. Gentleman agree that an important part 
of the problem that he rightly identifies with incapacity 
benefit, is that someone who has been unemployed for a 
long time has a big incentive to become sick to graduate 
on to incapacity benefit? Would he agree that the system 
should not work in that way? It should provide 
encouragement to those who are capable of doing so to 
move back into work.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes. There should be no incentive to 
become sick. The Minister makes a fair point. I do not 
accept the proposition that those who have made 
provision should be denied a state benefit, or that those 
who have not maintained their contributions in the 
previous two years should be denied a state benefit, but I 
do accept that something is badly wrong with the benefit. 
The hon. Member for High Peak made a relevant point in 
that regard. Surely the country has not become three times 
more sick in the past 18 years. Labour Members may say 
that the Conservative Government made them feel sick, 
but I am sure that they did not become more physically 
sick.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): While I do not 
disagree with my hon. Friend's remarks, I hope that he 
will take into account the fact that the national health 
service has become cleverer at helping people to survive. 
As a result, the number of people with genuine long-term 
illnesses who would previously have died has 
increased.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is a fair point. More research on that 
matter is necessary. It is almost a feature of this debate 
that we assume that many people in their 50s, especially 
in the public sector, suddenly announce that they have a 
bad back and take the system for a ride. That may or may 
not be true there is always an element of truth in such 
arguments. Equally, there is an element of truth in what 
my hon. Friend says.



<P>
The only way through this morass is a better form of 
medical. That is also what the Government are trying to 
achieve, but I do not know whether their objectives will 
be met. Many illnesses and incapacitating conditions, such 
as a bad back, are difficult to diagnose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> That is the logic, but the Minister told us 
last week that he did not expect the change in the test to 
result in different individuals receiving benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That was a good point, which was made 
by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar 
in his speech. If the Government are not trying to take out 
of the system those who are using incapacity benefit as a 
replacement for unemployment benefit and if they do 
not assume that a better medical will take people out of 
the system the inescapable conclusion is that the 
proposal is Treasury driven and that the Government are 
simply trying to save money. They are using a 
sledgehammer to crack a very large nut, but they have got 
the wrong sledgehammer and they are wielding it in the 
wrong way. It is the many people, who have, through no 
fault of their own, become incapacitated, and who will 
fall foul of the clause's provisions, who will suffer, and 
that cannot be right.
<P>
I wish that I had a conclusion and that I could tell the 
Minister what to do, but, on this occasion, I cannot I 
have only made what might be called a think speech. I had 
better resume my seat, in the hope that my hon. Friend the 
Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) can 
help us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham 
and Stamford made some of the points that I wanted to 
make. I cannot believe that in their hearts Labour 
Members support the clause. It is immoral for several 
reasons, and the Chancellor's bullying lies behind it.
<P>
My first objection is that this is a devious piece of 
legislation and that the explanatory notes are a disgrace. 
The only example that they give of the clause's impact is 
that of a young person who qualifies for incapacity benefit 
and who was previously excluded. They make no attempt 
to describe the category of people who will suffer as a 
result of changes to the contribution qualifications. I 
support the amendments that were moved by my hon. 
Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), and the 
Liberal Democrat amendments, which go slightly further, 
although they are not the full answer.
<P>
In principle, IB is one of the strongest qualifiers for 
being a universal benefit. When it is properly 
implemented, it acknowledges the fact that if one is 
incapacitated, one's costs of living automatically rise. One 
needs additional aids and one's transportation costs rise. 
It is the classic case in which the welfare state's original, 
universal principles are appropriate. On a preference list 
it should not involve means testing.
<P>
My hon. Friends argued that the objection to the 
Government's position is that rip-offs occur and that too 
many older people qualify for IB. The solution must 
involve tightening up medical qualifications. The 
Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot argue 
that they will not change the terms under which people 
will qualify for IB on medical grounds and propose to 
change the relevant new medical arrangements. If the 
clause is designed to resolve that problem, it does not do 
so, and the Government are ducking the issue by saying, 
"Oh no, that problem does not exist."	
<P>
Some people who have paid contributions throughout 
their lives may suffer from progressive diseases. They 
may keep working for as long as possible, although during 
the year or two before they are no longer capable of work 
they may fall below the new short-term contribution 
levels. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and 
Stamford endeavoured to cite the categories of people 
who may be affected.



<P>
It would be helpful if Ministers explained where they 
believe the saving of £700 million will come from. Which 
people with which incapacities will no longer qualify? In 
this sensitive area, it is time for transparency. What I 
dislike about the clause is that it is devious, immoral and 
not transparent; it does not advertise what it wants to 
achieve or make clear whom it will affect.
<P>
The amendments would prevent those people who will 
be unjustly impacted by the measures from suffering. I 
know that the Government will not accept the 
amendments but, if the real objective of the clause is to 
cut out fraud and remove the ramps that are associated 
with incapacity benefit, they should return to the drawing 
board and redraft it. I cannot believe that they support the 
injustices that the clause will create.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I have a few points to make. First, 
amendment No. 140 is important because it refers to two 
years in the last 10. As I said in my intervention, the 
people affected are likely to include a large number of 
those who have had caring responsibilities for pre-school 
children. In a typical case, a mother may decide to take 
time off work after being in employment for some time 
to look after her children. In the case of the average 
family, that will probably be five, six, seven, or maybe 
eight years. She will then try to get back into work. If, 
however, for one reason or another, she becomes 
incapable of work and eligible for incapacity benefit, it is 
reasonable that she should be able to receive incapacity 
benefit at that time. The amendment, by stipulating two 
years in the last 10, would cover those people and others.
<P>
My second point concerns people who have a 
progressive disease. Several Conservative Members 
referred to progressive diseases, but no one mentioned the 
fact that the Government's proposals will give people who 
have such a disease a clear incentive to leave work and 
get on to incapacity benefit as quickly as possible. That 
will even be the case for people who have a progressive 
disease that allows them to remain in full-time or 
part-time work for a short time, because it will be in their 
favour to qualify for incapacity benefit within the period 
during which they have made the relevant contributions. 
That is contrary to the Government's aim of helping 
people with an incapacitating disease to remain in work 
for as long as possible and to return to it if they recover. 
People will be forced out of work at the earliest possible 
moment so that they remain eligible for incapacity benefit. 
The Government have not told us that that is their aim, so 
the proposal is illogical.
<P>
My third point relates to the Government's contention 
that the previous Government attempted to get people off 
the unemployment register in a phoney way by putting 
them on incapacity benefit. How many of the 170,000 
people whom they expect to be ineligible for incapacity 
benefit will go on to the unemployment register? Do they 
expect an increase in unemployment? As many people 
who will be ineligible for incapacity benefit will also be 
ineligible for jobseeker's allowance, the unemployment 
register will not change much. I am worried about the 
Government's argument that they want people to be on 
the unemployment register instead of receiving incapacity 
benefit. Although I suspect that the Bill will not achieve 
that, I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has 
to say.



<P>
There is a general point to be made about the aim of the 
amendments. The new restrictions seem to be an entirely 
arbitrary attempt to cut numbers. They do not seem to 
follow logically from the Government's professed aims. 
For example, the Government might say, "We want to 
take out of the incapacity benefit system those who are 
not incapable."	 That would be a logical way forward 
because they might think that some people who receive 
incapacity benefit do not need or deserve it. However that 
is not what they said, which is why we pressed them so 
hard on the issue last week. They accepted that everyone 
who receives incapacity benefit is eligible for it and 
genuinely incapable.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
They said that their new tests would not exclude any of 
those people who were now eligible and that they did not 
think that the doctors who carried out the relevant tests 
were in any way cheating the system. The cut is not based 
on excluding people who are not really incapable, nor is 
it based on getting people back on to the unemployment 
register. If the Government were saying, "Many people 
who receive incapacity benefit are capable of working and 
should be on the unemployment register"	, they would not 
simply cut out those people who have not made recent 
contributions. That would be an illogical way of trying to 
get people back on to the unemployment register.
<P>
Neither is the cut based on the level of contributions. 
One might think that if they were trying to be fair, the 
Government would find some way of giving incapacity 
benefit only to those people who have made contributions 
or done more in some way for the state or their families. 
However, the cut is not based on the level of 
contributions. That might have been one way of doing it 
and some of the amendments are aimed at making the 
provision more fair, so that the greater one's 
contributions, the more chance one has of receiving 
incapacity benefit. Instead, the Government simply base 
the cut on whether people happen to have become 
incapacitated after a recent period of employment during 
which they made contributions. That is an entirely 
arbitrary decision. What is the logic behind giving 
incapacity benefit only to those who have most recently 
been in work?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that 
the purpose of incapacity benefit is as a replacement for 
earnings? That has always been its purpose and that is the 
logic behind the change that is being made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Of course I recognise that. I am not 
suggesting that incapacity benefit should be given to 
anyone who would not, at that time, be ready to go to 
work were he or she not incapacitated. That is earnings 
related and exactly in line with my thinking, but I do not 
think that that is a valid argument against the points that 
I have been making about the Government's aims.
<P>
The questions should be, "Are you incapable of 
working and have you been making national insurance 
contributions?"	. If the answer to both questions is yes, 
that person should receive incapacity benefit. That is not 
what will happen if the Bill is approved in its current 
form. To sum up, the Government's policy in introducing 
the clause is "Work for those who can, but cuts for those 
who cannot."	



<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I shall focus on two points. So many 
points have been made so well, both by my hon. Friends 
and by the Liberal Democrat spokesman, that I do not 
want to bore the Committee or you, Mr. Malins, by 
repeating them. I embrace in total the overarching remark 
of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough that no 
one denies that there is a serious need for reform, but it 
should be medically based, not based on trying to catch 
people round the edges.
<P>
My first point is a new one. If Ministers are unwilling 
to accept either the amendments relating to greater 
flexibility in relation to the time period that we proposed 
or the slightly more generous one proposed by the Liberal 
Democrats, will they say what the position will be for a 
small but deserving group of people service wives 
whose earnings track record is frequently affected by their 
husbands' being posted to Germany, or elsewhere? I 
should like to reassure the Committee that I am not using 
this as a gimmick, simply because there is a threat that 
substantial numbers of our armed forces may be at war 
within the next few weeks. I dealt with the sad case of a 
disabled service wife, who came on a delegation to see a 
Minister some years ago with the late Anne Armstrong, 
who herself died of a chronic illness after years of 
campaigning on behalf of the service wives.
<P>
There is no provision in the Bill for service 
spouses I shall call them that as there might, 
exceptionally, also be cases involving the husbands of 
service women. If the clause is not amended in the 
ways proposed by either the Liberal Democrats or 
ourselves, what would be the position of a service wife 
with a record of many years' continuous earning, who 
will invariably have to give up her paid employment if 
she is sent to Germany? Her position could also be 
difficult in terms of residence, even if she is paying 
full national insurance contributions working in a 
NAAFI, or some other demeaning form of employment, 
which is often the only form of work available, even 
to highly qualified service spouses. I look forward to 
the Ministers' response on that issue.
<P>
I return to the point about mothers looking after 
children, and the parallel point about those who look after 
disabled people. I have two points one a historical one, 
the other a personal one. The historical point is that the 
bulk of the original measures designed to look after the 
long-term chronically ill were introduced by a 
Conservative Government the Heath Government. Since 
then, they have been through many changes of name and 
substance. I am still not clear as to the resolution of the 
dispute between the two Front Benches on the matter of 
fact. However, if my point were to break new ground, 
affecting relatively modest numbers of people, I make no 
apology for that.
<P>
My second point is personal and is addressed 
particularly to the hon. Member for Gravesham. In all the 
years under the previous Government that I drew attention 
to the bias against spouses it is not always the woman, 
in some cases it is the man who stay at home to look 
after children, no one raised any objection. However, it 
seems impossible for me to raise the point as an 
Opposition Member without at least one member of the 
new Labour model army leaping up to allege that I am 
proposing that mothers of small children should always 
stay at home. Nothing is further from the truth.



<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I will in a moment, but I want to finish 
my argument. I have never made any such suggestion and, 
in speaking to the amendments, I am not doing so now. 
My own wife continued to work part-time through our 
children's pre-school years and now that our third child 
has started school, she does two part-time jobs. However, 
not all mothers have the opportunity to do an attractive 
part-time job while their children are of pre-school age. 
Some are faced with either no opportunity to work, or an 
opportunity that is incompatible with what they regard as 
the duties of a mother, because it is a full-time job 
involving long hours. In the context of the amendments, 
this choice is especially sharp for disabled people or those 
with chronic illnesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way 
and I appreciate that he has partially withdrawn the 
comments that he made earlier. However, if the hon. 
Gentleman looks at Hansard when it is published, he will 
find that he referred to working parents dumping their 
children on state-funded child care. Labour Members find 
that insulting.



<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I have withdrawn nothing and I shall not 
withdraw those words. I am sure that you will rule me out 
of order, Mr. Malins, but I hope that you will allow me 
to respond to that point. The Conservative party voted 
collectively against the monstrous provisions in the Tax 
Credits Bill that will allow an almost unlimited blank 
cheque for state-funded child care for a range of people 
even next-door neighbours. Among those who will pay 
for those measures will be the category of people with 
which the amendment deals in a modest and reasonable 
way. A person who has not been aware of becoming 
progressively more disabled, who has had a long-term 
wasting illness or who had an accident overnight may, for 
whatever reason, have previously given up their career to 
look after children. The years of paying contributions 
would therefore have been interrupted to look after 
children of a marriage. That person may not be a 
woman in the household of one of my close friends, the 
mother earns the bulk of the income and the father looks 
after the remaining pre-school-age child. Both those 
parents are physically fit and the clause would not apply 
to them.
<P>
The Government may choose to reject not only the 
amendments that allow more general time flexibility but 
amendment No. 289, which looks after the interests of a 
particular group. Would it be fair to say to a woman 
or, in some cases, a man who has continuously made 
contributions for perhaps 10 to 12 years, "You chose to 
care for very young children or for a parent suffering from 
a chronic illness, which led to their death. Say goodbye 
to contributory benefit, and see what you can get on the 
means-tested second string"	.
<P>
I know that the Government have abandoned the 
pledges that they made at the general election. A great 
deal of fuss was made about the stakeholder pension in 
debate on earlier clauses you would rightly rule me out 
of order, Mr. Malins, were I to refer to it in any detail. 
Are not the people to whom I refer stakeholders? They 
are making a huge contribution to the state, and it is 
costing the state nothing. Surely, whether through 
accepting amendment No. 289 or reducing the tightness 
of the time arrangements by accepting our amendment 
or the Liberal Democrat amendment something must be 
done for those people.
<P>
Finally, I echo the point made by the hon. Member for 
Winchester. The clause has created a terrible muddle by 
introducing an unreasonably tight prescription for 
incapacity benefit. Other means of tightening up the 
benefit, such as the medical, would be much more 
effective. That is another example of what happens when 
a Government take three or, arguably, four Bills and 
try to ram them into one Bill and bounce them through 
together. A separate Bill is necessary every hon. 
Member who has spoken on this clause and group of 
amendments has agreed on that. Reform is necessary and 
the bad drafting of the clause shows what a bad job the 
Government have done by ramming such disparate 
elements into one hasty Bill.
