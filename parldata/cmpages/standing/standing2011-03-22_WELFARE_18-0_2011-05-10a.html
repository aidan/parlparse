                           </strong> I will continue with my comments on the
amendment. As I was saying before we adjourned, I was not sure whether
it was the intention of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff Central
to table an amendment that would allow an individual to have another
individual attend an assessment in their place, but that is what the
amendment would
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
face-to-face consultation will play a pivotal role in the assessment as
a whole, allowing the nuance of how a health condition or impairment
affects the individual specifically to be explored in a two-way
discussion. It also provides an opportunity to observe an individual,
consider their mental state and directly assess any physical
impairment, if relevant. As such, it is critical that the individual
themselves be part of the process wherever possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We recognise
the importance of ensuring that the assessment process is appropriate
to an individual’s circumstances and appreciate that
face-to-face consultations may not be appropriate in absolutely every
case—for example, when there is sufficient evidence on which to
make an assessment for those individuals with the most severe
impairments or those who are terminally
ill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend raised concerns about the work capability assessment and
the role of advocates within the system. I assure her that individuals
are encouraged to bring someone along for support if they feel that it
would be useful. Atos Healthcare, the organisation that provides the
work capability assessment, ensures that training includes guidance on
how to work effectively with advocates.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000019">&#160;</a>

                           </span> From my experience and
that of other hon. Members, I understand that there are instances in
which people have not been allowed to take the advocate into the
assessment with them, and other times when an advocate has been allowed
to go in but not to say anything, participate in any way or even assist
in the assessment. What will the

encourages advocates to go along, it would be helpful if that were to

work capability assessment, I assure my hon. Friend that we very much
believe that advocate supporters have an important role, and we
certainly see them playing an important role within the personal
independence payment scheme and the work capability assessment. There
could be circumstances in which advocates might not have a positive
role within an assessment process, but I am sure that such cases will
be few and far between.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to us that advocates have a role, whether in the PIP scheme
or the work capability assessment. If there were instances in which
that was not happening and my hon. Friend brought it to my attention or
the attention of my right hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell,
the Minister, I am sure that we would be interested in looking into the
matter further.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000022">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is, of
course, essential to get the PIP processes right. No conclusions have
been reached yet on the delivery model for the new assessment, and we
are therefore keen to work with disabled people and disability
organisations to develop appropriate processes that reflect and cater
for individuals. I hope that with those reassurances, my hon. Friend
feels that it is appropriate to withdraw her amendment and feels
encouraged that we are very much in the same place on this

an advocate as important in the process and that the Department is
“encouraging” their involvement.
“Encouraging” is a good word; it is positive and
proactive, and I am reassured that it reflects the Department’s
attitude. There are problems with how the work capability assessment
will be rolled out across the country. Given that the Minister has
highlighted her belief that advocates will play an important role in
PIP assessments, I hope that the Department will take on board some of
the issues with work capability assessment advocates when PIP
assessments are rolled
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000024">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment is about exempting some people from
the initial assessment. The Minister mentioned in her comments on the
previous amendment that the Government see that some people should be
exempt—those with terminal conditions, in particular. She
mentioned some other exemptions as well, so I will be brief, and
grateful for more
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the principle has already been accepted, the amendment is for teasing
out a little more what the Government are thinking. I appreciate that
the proposal does not need to be in the Bill, but it is a good
opportunity to raise some of the issues. Until now, some cases have
been exempt from regular assessments; a selection is set out in
amendment 218. I was trying to be less prescriptive about some cases,
but others are laid out clearly. Some disabilities are so
serious—people are born with certain conditions—that they
will never change. Assessing those in the most severe categories seems
a waste of time and money.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For some
groups, in particular those with various mental health conditions,
assessment worsens their condition. I have examples from casework, as I
am sure other Members have. In a work capability assessment, a GP may
in effect sign people off, by stating that it would not be appropriate
for them to go to regular reassessments for the purposes of continuing
their employment and support allowance, on the basis of the detrimental
effect on mental health. How that works involves a number of issues,
and it applies to a very small number of people, but through the
amendment I hope to explore whether there can be a similar mechanism
for PIP
assessments.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
of the disability organisations have suggested a tiered approach to
assessment, so that we start with the paper evidence in the
self-assessment and from medical professionals. If the evidence
justifying a PIP is already there, so be it; if more evidence is
needed, that person can go to a face-to-face assessment. That would
mean that not everyone needs to go on to that second stage and some
cases could be decided earlier, on the
paperwork.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are looking flexibly at the issue. Lord Freud recently said
in the other place that the Government would not insist that people
were seen face to face if that

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
218 would secure automatic entitlement to the personal independence
payment for the severely disabled. The emphasis that is different is
that those conditions would be the same as for those who already
automatically receive DLA because of the consistency argument and the
message around that. I hope that my argument will become clear as I
progress through my
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
remind the Committee that the categories are: severely mentally
impaired; double amputee; deaf-blind; undergoing haemodialysis;
severely visually impaired; and terminally ill, which is already
covered by clause 80. I understand the argument that I am sure the
Minister will make—she has already done so this morning: some
people believe that there should not be automatic entitlement because
the issue goes to the heart of the principle of what is trying to be
achieved. It is not about defining people by their disability, and it
is not about an impairment-linked disability benefit. I understand
those arguments, but my limited proposal would not undermine the
principle. I have had some interesting discussions with groups and
individuals about the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
amendment would improve part 4 of the Bill in two major ways. First, it
would greatly reduce anxiety among severely disabled people who fear
having a test to prove their disability, and would have to have one
again and again. It would provide a cost and administration saving on
the needless assessment. It is important to appreciate that the
amendment would give automatic entitlement for only six conditions. At
the moment, around 41,500 severely disabled people of working age
automatically receive DLA. In the grand scheme of reform, which will
affect 1.8 million people of working age on DLA, the change would be
small, but would make a massive difference to those who are incredibly
anxious about going through a face-to-face
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
put the matter into context, I had asked the Minister how many new
claimants of working age for PIP payment could be identified year on
year, so that we had some sense of the scale. She could not say; I got
that answer on Monday. However, if the number is 1.8 million
overall, around 600,000 will have to be reassessed per annum, which is
around 11,500 every week or around 2,300 every day. That is a
monumental exercise, so my amendment to exempt 41,000 is a small
matter. Given the circumstances in which the people involved live, it
is also
reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will know that there is widespread support within the
disability movement for an amendment to retain automatic entitlement
for those with severe disabilities that will clearly not change during
their lifetimes. Many organisations understand the social mobility
model and the arguments about people not being defined by their
impairment, and they argue their case strongly. The Disability Benefits
Consortium
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“PIP
will not have any ‘automatic entitlements’. However, if
it is clear that certain impairments will always meet the criteria for
PIP then PIP should include automatic entitlements in these cases, as
they provide an easy way of awarding benefit to people who are certain
to qualify and mean money is not wasted on assessments that could be
spent on supporting disabled people. PIP should include automatic
entitlements for those cases where an individual’s impairment
means they will always meet the criteria for the
benefit”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000575">&#160;</a>

case for the deaf blind and severe visual impairment higher mobility
provision is very strong. The numbers of visually impaired people
getting DLA (where visual impairment is the ‘main disabling
condition’) are broadly the same as the numbers registered, so
automatic entitlement based on registration and certification evidence
would be accurate, objective, administratively simple, cost-effective
and easy for claimants to understand. Existing experience of DLA, where
an assessment is carried out by a non-specialist, is that the
assessment is often inaccurate or clear medical evidence is
misinterpreted”.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000577">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
must address the stress and anxiety of face-to-face assessments for
those who clearly need help. Wholesale reform of DLA will have massive
implications for millions of disabled people, as I have already said.
We cannot underestimate or brush aside the level of anxiety that many
people feel about that. The prospect of going through a face-to-face
assessment and having ultimately to prove their disability to receive
help is incredibly stressful and worrying for many, many disabled
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000044">&#160;</a>

said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“My
other general concern - as someone with no sight at all and who is
registered deaf blind - is the withdrawal of automatic entitlement. I
can’t really see the point. Certification as vision impaired is
done by an eye consultant with whom one usually has a long-term
relationship and who knows your case history and the impact of your
sight loss intimately. I cannot see how a so called
‘objective’ assessment can replace
this.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000578">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Wherever
possible, we should do anything to try to ensure that the transition to
PIP is as smooth and calm as possible. Surely protecting the severely
disabled from facing an assessment is one way in which we can do that.
We know that the Government plan on spending £675 million on the
establishment and administration of PIP. That is a huge amount of
public money and I am sure that we will continue to talk about it.
However, just a small amount could surely go some way towards dealing
with my
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall refer to some of the points made in the briefing paper that the
Minister issued last week, which picks up some of the matters raised by
the hon. Member for Cardiff Central. The briefing note published by the
DWP last Friday suggests that some people may not be subject to
face-to-face assessments. It states that assessments will be carried
out with a trained assessor but, in some cases, a paper-based
assessment may be more suitable. Just to repeat the comments made by
the hon. Lady, I would be grateful if the Minister said what that will
actually mean. Although a paper-based assessment is better than a
face-to-face assessment, it is still an assessment and it means that we
are taking away that automatic entitlement and guarantee. The use of
such an assessment does not fundamentally address my points.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The briefing
note has also produced some draft indicators that are beginning to
shape our understanding of the Government’s direction in
relation to the assessment 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 812<a class="bkMark" name="Column812">&#160;</a>
                           </div>process—although, again, we are told that that process and
consultation on the assessment is ongoing and is by no means complete.
We have had that discussion and I will not repeat those points but,
none the less, many people face anxiety about the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
set of draft indicators that are causing concern are those that affect
the severely visually impaired. Of course, that is relevant to the
discussion on clause 78, as the severely visually impaired are one of
the groups that the amendment seeks to cover with regard to automatic
entitlement. I presume that Committee members know that the previous
Labour Government worked very hard and successfully with disabled
people and their organisations to campaign for those with severe visual
impairments to be automatically entitled to receive the higher rate of
DLA mobility. Under the current proposals, some 25,000 severely
visually impaired people stand possibly to lose out as a result of the
decision to discard a hard-fought-for and much-agreed-upon
policy development.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What is more,
according to the draft indicators before us today, it is becoming
increasingly apparent that the Government plan not only to stop
thousands of severely visually impaired people from automatically
receiving PIP, but to go a step further and separate claimants into two
specific groups: those who have adapted to their visual impairment and
those who have not. That raises ambiguity and questions about what aids
and adaptations will be taken into account. I ask the Minister for
clarity on that because a lack of clarity raises alarms and
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000050">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am obliged to note that the Minister supported automatic entitlement
for severely visually impaired people no later than June 2010, when she
indicated that she was: “committed to making sure that help gets
to the people who need
it.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>She

say:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000052">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
Minister was pleased that 22,000 people benefited from that. I cannot
understand how in June she was pleased, but she is now trying to take
away that automatic entitlement.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The core
point that I am trying to make is about the guarantee of the
entitlement, so that people know they will receive it, rather than
their needlessly having to go through an assessment that everyone knows
they will probably pass, with the administration costs that go with it.
It is important that we look at those issues and see whether we can
amend the Bill appropriately.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000054">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This is an
important amendment. It seeks to avoid needless assessment that will
both cost the taxpayer money and put unnecessary stress on the disabled
person who must now prove that they have a severe disability before
they are given support. Does the Minister think that people with the
conditions listed in the amendment, such as severe mental impairment
and those I have already described, should always have to undergo an
assessment? Currently the Bill automatically gives PIP to only one
group of people—those who are terminally ill. While we agree
with that decision and welcome it, we urge the Government to go one
step further. The issue matters fundamentally to the people in this
category

We have found an important point of difference between the
Government’s approach to the reform of DLA and the
Opposition’s approach. One of the firm, underlying principles of
what we are doing is to recognise each and every disabled person as an
individual. That is important. For too long, disabled people have been
labelled by their disability rather than considered as individuals.
Blanket assumptions have been made about what people can and cannot do
simply because of their conditions. We do not feel that that is an
appropriate way forward and the responses to our consultation would
tend to suggest that many others would agree with that
stance.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
recognise that people live varied and complicated lives and do not fit
neatly into boxes. Many people will have multiple conditions. The hon.
Member for Glasgow East referred to individuals who are deaf-blind.
That is a condition that deteriorates over time. There is a risk in
simply saying that an individual does not require some sort of touch
point with the Department to make sure that their needs are being met.
Individuals who are looking for support from various benefits should be
able to make sure that they are in receipt of the right level of
support for their
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000057">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady mentions individuals who are in
receipt of the highest support. I am not sure which conditions she is
thinking of. Those conditions might change over time. It is impossible
to say that one would just exempt people from having a reassessment
simply because they were in receipt of the highest support. I should
like to assure the Committee that, in some situations, individuals
might not need to come forward for face-to-face assessments. We could
assess them through a paper application process, with supporting
evidence that they did not need a face-to-face assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000059">&#160;</a>

in discussions about various other opportunities as well, particularly
for people with serious mental or cognitive impairments where it would
be difficult for them to go to an unfamiliar place. We are already
exploring opportunities for the potential of home visits or assessments
in more familiar places. The previous Government created this principle
so that lone parents could go to interviews while they were in receipt
of income support. They would go to Sure Start centres for
assessments—an extremely good way to ensure that individuals
regularly attended the interviews, being mindful of the restrictions
that might affect
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000060">&#160;</a>

impaired

                           </div>have an automatic entitlement to the higher rate of mobility component.
I think that she was seeking to make the point that, if someone is
reassessed, there is no further support if they are already on the
higher rate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
Minister seemed to imply that the Opposition did not seek to treat
disabled people as individuals. The point about automatic entitlement
is made in a joint submission for the visual impairment sector, which
speaks on behalf of a number of people dealing with visual impairment
and deaf-blindness. I do not feel that we are out of kilter with the
views of the disabled people whom we seek to
represent.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000062">&#160;</a>

Edinburgh East. I did not realise that she was particularly focusing on
those groups. When an individual is in ongoing receipt of the highest
benefit, there may always be ways in which we can assist people to look
for new ways to try to support them with their impairment. PIP might
have a role not in removing the support that is there, but in ensuring
that they get access to the right level of support.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000063">&#160;</a>

various groups. She may be aware that there is a difference of opinion
between groups on whether it is appropriate to look at an
individual’s impairment and passport them through as a result of
a specific impairment. That is a debate for another day. It is an
important principle that we look at the people first and foremost and
at the effect that the condition has on their ability to participate in
daily life.

We are in no way suggesting that the proposal is an attempt to reduce
or identify inaccurately the support that an individual needs. As we
move forward, it is right to explore different ways to assess
individuals. The hon. Lady might be aware that we already undertake
some home visits where appropriate—this is not a completely new
idea—but she is right to caution and to want to ensure that the
assessment is accurate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000066">&#160;</a>

hon. Members referred to the DLA blind measure recently put in place.
It is important that the Committee knows why the Government decided to
proceed with that. The previous Administration worked on that important
measure for a number of years, because of DLA’s failure to
tackle or accurately assess the needs of individuals who are blind. Our
decision to proceed with the measure underlines the DLA’s
shortcomings. Its assessment criteria simply do not accurately pick up
the needs of individuals who are blind. We talked earlier about
mobility and the fact that because someone could not walk, they will be
deemed as in need of further mobility support. The current

As the previous Administration had identified, DLA was not supporting
people who were blind. They proposed a measure that took an extremely
long time to introduce. The legislative structure of DLA meant that the
allowance was not easy to amend. Such provisions are mainly defined not
in regulations but in primary legislation. In a nutshell, the reason
why we have introduced this measure is that we want blind people to get

face-to-face consultation with a trained independent assessor will play
a key role in creating a much fairer, more objective and more
transparent assessment process. Such a consultation will also provide
individuals with the opportunity to put across their own views on how
their health conditions or impairments impact on their everyday lives.
We recognise the importance of having a system that is flexible to meet

flexibilities inbuilt in our system.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000072">&#160;</a>

take issue with my hon. Friend’s key point. It is important that
we help people as their conditions change and evolve over time and that
we have a real understanding of the multiple conditions that they face.
The way in which conditions change can be variable. Blanket treatment
of individuals opposes one of the key and underlying principles of PIP,
which is that of treating each person as an
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000074">&#160;</a>

broad condition types are listed in amendment 218, which was
tabled by the hon. Member for Glasgow East. They do not necessarily say
much about need and the impact that the impairment has on the
individual. We may not need to see some people with such conditions on
a face-to-face basis, but that may be the only way in which we can
truly understand the support that other people need.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000075">&#160;</a>

could have a far greater impact on the individual, but that may not be
identified simply because they are defined by the principal condition.

appreciate that face-to-face consultations are important for the

am glad that the Government accept that it is not appropriate for
everyone to have a face-to-face assessment. That principle is quite
important. I am also glad that they are exploring alternative ways of
doing an assessment, because those of us who have been Members for a
while are always coming up against cases where people have not been
treated appropriately for their disability. Taking that into account
and doing assessments in different places might make the system simpler
for people to participate in. Our recent debate on advocates is a
crucial example of why we need them to be encouraged to be part of the
system and for them to be accepted as part of it. If we assess a broad
range of people, it will be hard for many of them to get a fair hearing
without support and advocates working with them during the
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000083">&#160;</a>

assessment only, and the next amendment that  I tabled is about
the ongoing reassessment of people. I agree with the hon. Lady that an
assessment is not necessary for some people who should be entitled to
PIP. I understand where the Minister is coming from when she says that
she wants everyone to be assessed at the beginning of the system, but I
have some issues. Some people should be exempt, but the Minister has
made it clear that there will be some exemptions, and we have to see,
in time, who the Government include in those
exemptions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000085">&#160;</a>

hope that the Government will keep an open mind and see how the system
works in practice, because there is a whole world of difference between
the theory—the way that legislation and guidance are put
together—and how it is implemented. An awful lot of the cases
that we have seen as Members of Parliament, where people have had
difficulty with the structures currently in place, were never foreseen,
or the difficulty was caused by the way that something was implemented,
rather than the bare bones of the structure. It will be important to
see how the system is actually implemented on the ground. A lot of that
will involve working with Atos and how it implements the system. The
Department can have various policies in place, but if they are not
implemented by Atos, we have a whole load of

Government keep an open mind about who they might consider for running
the assessments as well. I hope that, in keeping that open mind and
learning from how the system works in practice, the Minister will
consider, over time, adding categories and conditions to the list that
would be exempt from initial face-to-face assessments. She referred to
flexibility. I hope that the Government will consider extending that
flexibility as we learn and possibly include other people in the exempt
category, so that we learn from the experience as PIP is rolled out.

to make them, it seems clear that the amendment is not needed; it is

                        <p class="tabbed">This
should be a brief debate, because we strayed into this territory in the
debate on the previous amendment. The amendment is designed to make it
possible for some people not to have to go for reassessment, so that,
after the initial assessment, they do not have to be reassessed
regularly. In some cases, it is a waste of resources to do that when
people have a condition that we know will not change, or will certainly
not get any better. Reassessments were raised with me by a constituent
whom I mentioned earlier and whose 29-year-old son has Down’s
syndrome and a mental age of less than six. That condition is never
going to change—it probably will not get much worse, but it
certainly will not get better. His condition will be constant
throughout his life. Reassessments seem to me to be a waste of time and
money, and it causes stress for him and his family to go through them
regularly.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That point
applies to a range of different conditions; there are degenerative
conditions such as Parkinson’s, motor neurone disease and
multiple sclerosis, where there will not be an improvement, and someone
will only get worse over time. I appreciate that the Government in
effect want to keep tabs on how somebody’s condition is
progressing, and I hope that the Minister can confirm today that they
will consider paper assessments in circumstances where people’s
conditions will not improve and they will not be taken out of
eligibility for PIPs.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
already discussed necessary exemptions for the initial assessment, but
slightly different criteria apply to regular reassessments. There is
probably a fairly limited group of conditions and a limited number of
people involved, and it should be possible to do an assessment using a
medical assessment, prognosis, GPs, consultants and so on, rather than
requiring people to come regularly for reassessment. Given that we have
had a lengthy debate about this issue, that is all I will add, but I
hope that the Minister can reassure us on those
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000133">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to make a few points. Although similar
arguments were made about an earlier amendment, there are a few points
of principle wrapped up in this amendment too, and I wish to draw
attention to them. I take the point that this is about reassessment,
and perhaps we cannot cover the principle of assessment itself.
However, enshrined in the amendment is the notion of categories of
people, not individuals, and that is not in step with what the Minister
has said, so I think that we need to resolve that issue. I support what
the hon. Member for Cardiff Central said, as it is reasonable to look
at categories. We are talking about a very limited number of people,
which will not undermine in any way the general thrust of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also discussed the Government’s intentions. The
implicit purpose of looking at individuals, rather than categories, is
to keep tabs on people with such conditions. I have not yet heard a
satisfactory argument about why it is necessary to keep tabs on certain
people, or what the purpose is of doing so. If it is to ensure that
people receive a range of support to assist them with their conditions,
I would accept that argument, but I do not regard that as a function of
the Department for Work and Pensions. It is more likely to be the
function of the health service, or social care support. If it is to be
the function of the DWP, that is a very significant development, which
should be clarified this afternoon. It is very important to try to
understand

                           </div>exactly what is in the Government’s mind. If there are other
benefits to which they think people are perhaps not entitled, perhaps
the Minister will explain that. We have not received proper
clarification about those matters at all, but the principle that the
hon. Lady is promoting in the amendment is worthy of consideration and
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000135">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not want to repeat the points that I made on
the previous amendment, but I will summarise our view for my hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff Central and reiterate some points that I
have made. Although we think that face-to-face consultations are an
important part of the process for most people, we accept that it will
not be appropriate in every case. In particular, where we have strong
enough evidence to make a decision on entitlement, a face-to-face
consultation may not add very much value, and in such cases, a
paper-based assessment of an individual may well be more appropriate.
All individuals should be assessed, but we want the process to be
tailored to individual circumstances and, most importantly, to be
carried out sensitively, as emphasised in Professor Harrington’s
review.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000136">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am trying to understand the Minister. She
seems to be saying that there will be a reassessment, albeit a paper
one. If people are in receipt of the higher rate of PIP and they have a
lifelong or degenerative condition, the purpose of the reassessment
process is not clear. For example, if they are deafblind or have
multiple amputations and are in receipt of the higher level, why do
they need to be reassessed at
all?<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000137">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Committee knows, we are indeed considering the detail and the
likely operational processes of the new personal independence payment.
We recognise the importance of getting it right, which is why we are
working with disabled people and their organisations as we develop such
matters, ensuring that we can cater for individuals and individual
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
we should decide—for example, as a result of testing the
assessment or in the light of operational experience—that we
need to deem certain individuals exempt, we already have the powers to
do so in clause 78(3)(a). For that reason, I cannot accept
the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff Central, because
it would duplicate an existing power in the Bill. However, perhaps the
hon. Members who participated in the debate can, in summary, accept
that it is our overwhelming desire to treat every person who applies
for or is in receipt of a PIP as an individual. That is the main
premise of this
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000140">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
fully understand the issues raised in the consultation and in
today’s debate. For some individuals, the standard approach is
not an appropriate way forward. We have already made provision in the
Bill to consider the matter further. In all cases, it is right to have
a tailored and flexible approach so that we can, wherever possible,
accommodate the needs of disabled people, in the way in which we would
accommodate the needs of every other person in this country, not simply
labelling them by their
condition.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have said, the Bill includes clear provisions on terminally ill
people. Those separate provisions, in clause 80, allow
people to be dealt with quickly. It is remarkable

                           </div>that, at the moment, the Department is able to deal with such requests
in less than six days, which is to be commended. I hope that my
comments and the existing provisions in the Bill to accommodate such
circumstances, if the need arises, will allay some of the concerns
expressed in the heated debate on the amendment. It is important that
such concerns are expressed and that we talk about general principles,
but it is also important that we touch on some of the practical
realities as we progress. With that, I hope that my hon. Friend will
feel it appropriate to withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000142">&#160;</a>

considering different and less intrusive ways of reassessment. I hope
that they make progress, because the process of reassessment can be
extremely stressful, generating significant anxiety for many people, in
particular those with mental health problems. For those with lifelong,
unchanging conditions, facing yet another reassessment seems more of a
drag. I am glad the Government are considering less intrusive

vote. I take the point that the Government are addressing some of the
concerns that have been expressed, but we need to take the opportunity
to make provision in the Bill and to resolve some of what we are
beginning to hear as contradictions, otherwise the people whom she is
describing and whose cause she has advocate will not get the
anticipated outcome. The best way to achieve that is to stick with it
and to press the amendment to a

                           </strong> First, the Minister has clarified the fact that
the issue is dealt with in the Bill. Secondly, if Opposition Members
wanted to press the matter to a vote, they should have tabled their own
amendment. They did not table any amendments on the matter, although it
was entirely in their hands to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000145">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that it will become clear as the process continues that there are
people whom it is simply not worth reassessing—it is not worth
if from their perspective and it is not worth it from the
Government’s perspective. I am reassured that the Minister
clarified the fact that the Government will look at that in future and
that the power is already in the Bill to take that into account. As the
power is there already, the process will need to adapt with time.
Strong views are clearly held across the House and by members of the
public that there are people whom it is not worth reassessing and who
should be exempt from the initial assessment. Given that the Government
have accepted both those principles and the power is in the Bill, I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000146">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
is a less controversial issue. The amendment is linked to the previous
amendments that I have tabled.  It is about the importance of
consulting disability organisations and individuals with disabilities.
I am sure that the Minister agrees that it is important to consult at
an early stage to avoid the mistakes made by the previous Government in
designing the work capability assessment. If we can make the system
better right from the start—particularly for things such as
fluctuating conditions, which are a perennial problem in the assessment
process—we can make life much easier for the people who are
undergoing assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
that the process is different from the WCA and that the system is
entirely new. The fact that it is an entirely new type of assessment
and a totally different benefit means that it makes sense to involve
disability organisations and individuals from the start to try to get
it right. I know that the Government consult constantly. In discussing
an earlier amendment, the Minister mentioned the consultation that has
already taken place with organisations representing disabled people. I
would be grateful if she were to reassure us that the Government will
consult both organisations and individuals, because they have an
important voice that needs to be heard. We should ensure that we do not
make the mistakes of the past, and that we design a system that needs
fewer changes once it has been put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000178">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am pleased that the amendment has been tabled,
for the reason highlighted by the hon. Member for Cardiff Central. It
is clearly important that we improve the process from the outset,
rather than having to catch up later by putting right badly designed
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000179">&#160;</a>

the Minister outline how the consultation process will be carried out?
Will there be written consultation, with an invitation for people to
put in written submissions? Will there be an opportunity for proper
detailed work to be carried out with disability organisations and
disabled people to design the detail of what the assessment will look
like, and not just a high-level and generalist consultation in which
those organisations and people express concerns? The lessons that I
learned from the early stages of attempting to design the WCA were that
that there were initial attempts to do that round table detailed design
work with disability partners. After a time, that process became more
difficult, and ultimately

                           </div>perhaps some of the organisations lost faith in it. Will the Minister
assure us that that will not happen? What processes and steps does she
intend to take to ensure that is the

Central and the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston that consultation
is at the heart of this programme of work, right from the start. The
latter asked for an assurance that this is not only about high-level
consultation. It is easy to reassure her on that, because we have been
working with a group of specialist advisers of disabled people,
representatives  of organisations and health care professionals
on the development of the assessment criteria, and we will continue to
work with them on testing the criteria to ensure that the criteria are
working in the way in which we want. As we move forward this summer, we
will be doing grass-roots consultation and testing, and we will be
talking to disabled people about our assessment and asking people to
take part in testing the criteria. That will provide the rich feedback
that hon. Members have discussed today to ensure that we get the new
PIP assessment right from the start.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We will
continue to work with disabled people and their organisations. We are
planning to involve them in a number of ways as we design the
operational processes—the way in which the assessment will be
carried out. We have set up a dedicated PIP implementation consultation
group specifically for that purpose. Membership has been drawn from a
wide range of national and grass-roots user-led organisations. My
officials and I have met many of them already, and we look forward to
the work they are going to be doing with us on this most important part
of the process. Many of them are people who have expressed an interest
in working with us on the operational processes, and I look forward to
progress as we move forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We will ask
the group to look at the practical way in which operational issues will
be developed. The initial list of issues will be discussed at the
group’s first meeting on 16 May. I hope that that reassures the
Committee that consultation and co-production are at the heart of the
development of PIP. I stress that our approach is not only about
meeting legislative requirements. The development of PIP will be, as
the WCA has been, an iterative process in which we actively seek out
opportunities to learn from our experience to ensure that we make the
changes necessary to make it the success that we all want it to be.
That is why we have already published initial draft assessment
criteria, which are available on our website. Members of the public can
access them now and e-mail or write in with their comments on the
assessment criteria. We are being open and transparent about how the
new support is being developed. We intend to publish a second draft of
the assessment criteria in the autumn, building on the comments that
have been made. I assure Committee members that we view this as an
ongoing process and we will continue to work with disabled people and
their organisations on the criteria after that point, as we work
towards finalising draft regulations to submit for parliamentary
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000183">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are

people. I hope that what I have outlined today will show that

integral to the way we work. I hope that given the reassurances about
the key role of consultation and engagement, my hon. Friend will feel
it appropriate to withdraw the amendments and continue to work with us
with her thoughts on how the assessment and the operational processes
work in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000184">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am reassured by what the Minister has said;
clearly, a lot of work is already going on and will be ongoing. I
appreciate that the work capability assessment is very different from
the PIP assessment, but I hope that we can learn lessons from it when
designing the PIP assessment—how it was implemented and what
changes have been needed since then—and in particular
incorporate the recommendations made by Professor Harrington. I am glad
that so much consultation is going on. Piloting is a really important
way of ensuring that the problems are ironed out before the regime is
implemented, rather than testing it on people and finding out that it
does not work when it has already been brought
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000185">&#160;</a>

“pilot”; I meant “testing”. It is crucial
to the credibility of the new assessment, as well as to having a system
that works, that it is well tested and worked through with individuals
with disabilities and the organisations representing them. If it does
not have credibility and is not seen to be fair, it will not work. It
is important to ensure that people are involved at an early stage and
throughout the process, so that they feel that their voices are
listened to and so where it does not work, the problems are identified
and changes are made. Clearly, those things are already

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment has two main purposes, both of which relate to the
individuals who will carry out assessments. The amendment’s
first aim is to require assessors to have access to sufficient skills
and expertise about the impairment type of the claimant whose
application is being assessed. The second half of the amendment fulfils
our second aim by requiring the Secretary of State to issue
clear guidance about the needs of different impairment groups, which
will be used by those who carry out the assessment
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000191">&#160;</a>

reason why an incorrect decision might be made is that the person
carrying out the assessment does not have enough expertise about the
impairment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000192">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Before
our debate today, we all received a briefing from the Disability
Benefits Consortium, from which I shall quote a couple of
sentences:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
is essential both for the applicants, and for the integrity of the
benefit, that the assessments are carried out fairly and effectively.
Studies have shown that various groups have been disadvantaged in the
past due to assessors not understanding certain conditions. This causes
distress to the applicant and their family; and can lead to a tribunal
process which is costly to the state and often ends in the initial
decision being
overturned.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000580">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is the point that the Disability Benefits Consortium made to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment applies to all types of impairment, but we are particularly
concerned about two particular types, with which we are becoming
familiar in Committee. The first is fluctuating conditions and how they
will be assessed—the hon. Member for Redcar raised the point
earlier today—because they may appear less severe than they
typically are on the day of the assessment, and there are plenty of
examples of erroneous assessments. If the person conducting the
assessment has access to expertise and guidance for dealing with the
impairment, there is a much better chance of being able to make a
correct assessment when it is carried
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second group, which we discussed during earlier debates, is people with
mental health impairment. We have been reminded that in his independent
review of the WCA, Professor Harrington found evidence that some mental
health conditions may be being inappropriately assessed at present. The
briefing notes circulated by the Government on PIP, which we all
received on Friday, strike me as muddled on what we can learn from the
WCA about the assessment for PIP. The Minister has touched on that a
couple of times today. The notes
state:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Employment
and Support Allowance and Personal Independence Payment are different
benefits paid for very different reasons. Any direct comparison between
the Work Capability Assessment…and the new assessment for
Personal Independence Payment is not therefore possible or
helpful.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000581">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It
is an odd turn of phrase to say that it is not possible, and then to
say that it is not helpful. Those couple of sentences from paragraph 8
on page 8 of the briefing note at least make the position clear. The
Government believe that lessons cannot be learned and that a direct
comparison cannot be drawn between the two.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
agree with the statement, but it is at least clear about the position.
Although the benefits are different, there is no doubt that the WCA and
the new assessment for PIP, given what we received from the Government
at the end of last week, have striking similarities, at least in how
they look. But the Government’s briefing is clear, and having
told us that the direct comparison is not possible or helpful, it
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“'We
are, however, seeking to learn from the experience of the WCA. As part
of this we are looking closely at the findings of the first independent
review of the WCA carried out by Professor Malcolm Harrington in order
to inform the design of the Personal Independence Payment claiming and
assessment processes.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000582">&#160;</a>

comparison is not possible or helpful, the Government go on to say
that, after all, they are making a comparison. That seems to be a bit
of a muddle.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let me
declare my position. I agree with the second part of that paragraph,
which says that there are lessons that we can learn, and disagree with
the first part, which says that it is neither possible nor helpful. It
is important that the design of the PIP assessment process responds to
the recommendations that the Harrington review identified and set out
for the WCA.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000200">&#160;</a>

supports the call for clear guidance for DWP staff carrying out the new
PIP assessment We know from our experience of the Work Capability
Assessment that DWP staff do not always have adequate knowledge and
understanding of the ways in which mental health problems impact upon

do they always carry out the assessments in a supportive or suitable
way, as the following quotes from Mind’s website
demonstrate.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000583">&#160;</a>

judgmental and not many assessors are

                        <p>I
am not proposing that the person conducting the assessment must
necessarily themselves have that expertise. Given the very large number
of people who will be assessed—my hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow East has talked about the number of people going through this
process—it may not be possible or practical for everyone
carrying out the assessment to have that expertise. None the less,
those conducting assessments should have ready access to somebody who
can guide and advise them on how to make an accurate assessment of the
various types of impairment that they will need to deal with. The
precise details of what would constitute access to or sufficient
expertise would be set out in regulations under this proposed new
subsection.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000207">&#160;</a>

new subsection (8) specifies that the Secretary of State must issue
clear guidance outlining the needs of different impairment groups for
the use of professionals assessing people under this section, which is
important for several reasons. First, it ensures that every
person

			Column number: 828<a class="bkMark" name="Column828">&#160;</a>
                           </div>conducting assessments has access to a basic standard of expert advice
to which they can turn. Secondly, the fact that the guidance would be
written down means that there would be a degree of accountability on
the assessor to ensure that this expertise is applied in practice.
Thirdly, having a universal set of guidance would help to eliminate
inconsistencies that might otherwise exist in practice between
different individuals or between different parts of the country. It is
possible that that guidance might also touch on the issue that the hon.
Member for Cardiff Central raised in her contribution about different
practices in different parts of the country on whether or not an
advocate or a friend can attend the assessment process along with the
person being assessed. The Minister helpfully clarified that that
should always be permitted except in exceptional
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000208">&#160;</a>

its 23rd report the Committee noted evidence that 40% of appeals

seems to be an example of a case where the lessons learned from the WCA
should also be learned for the assessment process for PIP. I hope that

at least some of the lessons that we have learned from the experience
of the introduction of the work capability assessment. As the Minister
has comfortingly acknowledged, we are discussing a test with a very
different purpose this afternoon. None the less, there are some
interesting points that we can draw on when we look at where some of
the discrediting of the WCA in the eyes of disabled people and those
who work with them has occurred. They perceive that the independent
assessors, the Atos assessors in the case of the work capability
assessment, are not suitably qualified or do not have a suitable
appreciation of or suitable expertise to assess the condition of the
person in front of them.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have heard
repeated reports from disabled people who have been through the work
capability assessment that it felt like a tick-box exercise, that it
was routine and that it was not focused on their particular
circumstances and condition. It is really important that for the
gateway assessment for the PIP we have professional, expert people who
can temper what will presumably be the structured approach to making
the assessment with their own expertise and experience in making
judgments and interpretations in relation to the answers and
information that they
receive.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is not just a matter of technical expertise. It is not just a matter of
having, for example, someone who assesses someone with MS being a
specialist in MS, or someone who assesses someone with a visual
impairment having a long-term specialism in blindness. Although that
might be useful, it is unlikely to be sufficient if the person making
the assessment lacks what in the business context are often called soft
skills. Those are the skills around empathy and the ability to
interpret and to communicate. Two-way communication was mentioned
earlier today, and it means that the way in which the disabled person
offers a response to a question or an 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 829<a class="bkMark" name="Column829">&#160;</a>
                           </div>investigation is placed in an intelligent context. That is something
that disabled people feel has not always happened in their experience
of the assessment for the
ESA.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that the assessor recognises that the setting in which
they meet the disabled people for the assessment is not necessarily the
only setting in which that disabled person will want to operate. We
talked earlier about assessing people in their homes. That could be
useful and appropriate, but it will only give the assessor a picture of
the way the disabled person works in that setting. The person carrying
out the assessment will need to be sufficiently expert and experienced
to translate what they can see in front of them in the home setting to
the wider social setting in which the disabled person may need to
operate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000214">&#160;</a>

I met Atos, the provider of the work capability assessment a few weeks
ago, I was interested to learn that it uses a whole range of
professionals to carry out the assessments. Those professionals could
be GPs or medical professionals with full medical degrees. They could
be nurses with a particular specialism, generalist nurses or
occupational therapists in some cases. The explanation that was offered
to us was that these people had had additional training by the company
providing the test, which in a sense rendered their initial
professional qualifications, as Atos saw it, as a matter of secondary
importance.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000215">&#160;</a>

is all very well if the training that the people carrying out the
assessments receive is good enough for them properly to carry out the

across. If it is not clear that the people carrying out the assessments
are trusted to understand and appreciate the conditions that they meet
and seek to assess, there will a real credibility
problem—Ministers might want to think about that at an early
stage. Will the Minister say something about the sort of standards that
will be put into contracts for the assessment process to ensure that
credibility in terms of the expertise, qualifications and skills
provided by the assessors is both perceived and real?<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000216">&#160;</a>

out by appropriately qualified experts and skilled professionals? Will
those processes be kept under regular review, and can she assure us

deal of thought

opening remarks, the right hon. Gentleman described PIP as a medical
assessment. It is not a medical assessment; it is more of an objective
assessment, and that is important. The hon. Member for Stretford and
Urmston said something similar on Second Reading, and it is an
important point because that is one of the things that marks out PIP
from other assessments. Now that we have a first draft of the
assessment criteria, we will look at the matter in more detail and link
it to our work on testing the criteria.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000219">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Early
thoughts suggest that PIP will not necessarily be administered by
doctors, and that a broader range of individuals may have more
appropriate skill sets and be better able to carry out the assessments.
Those include, for example, allied health professionals such as
occupational therapists or physiotherapists. We are exploring that
suggestion in our testing, and talking about it to disabled people. It
is an important part of building the trust referred to by the hon.
Lady.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000220">&#160;</a>

who is chosen, I assure the Committee that the assessments, including
face-to-face consultations, will be carried out by fully trained
independent and approved assessors. Assessments for ESA and the DLA are
currently carried out only by health care professionals who have been
approved by the Department’s chief medical adviser on behalf of
the Secretary of State. Those doctors, nurses and physiotherapists have
passed strict training and experience criteria and have received
additional tailored training approved by the Department. Similar
arrangements will apply for PIP and will include broad training in
disability analysis as well as training on specific impairments. As I
said at the start of today’s debate, disability is one word but
it has many thousands of different meanings. It is important to get the
training of health professionals in that area right, and we have

                           </strong> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his question.
The very fact that we are assessing such a wide range of different
disabilities means that we need a range of people available to assess.
Many people who have a more physical disability might have allied
mental-health problems, so I am not sure that one would necessarily
want to say that one set of individuals has one type of assessor and
that another set has another type of assessor.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000223">&#160;</a>

will forgive me, he is still falling into the trap of simply
pigeonholing people based on their assessment. Many disabled people
will have a physical impairment, a sensory impairment  and
perhaps even a mental-health impairment. I do  not think that
we can go down the route that he is
suggesting.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000224">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> People who have access to trained individuals who
have specialisations in mental health could well be how that problem
would be dealt with. This is one of the many lessons that we are
learning. Perhaps I can use the Harrington review as an example; the
right hon. Gentleman highlighted that he felt somewhat confused about
some of the information put out by the Department on Friday about the
policy documents that we have issued around the assessment criteria. To
clarify that for him, I should say that we are learning and will always
learn from what we are doing with the WCA. The policy document that he
was referring to discussed the assessment criteria. It would not be
helpful to try to learn from the assessment criteria of the WCA in
particular, because those criteria are to do with work, not everyday
living, which is what PIP will be looking at in future. We can learn
from the development process of the WCA and from its
implementation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000226">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
can particularly learn from the issue that the right hon. Gentleman
raises about the professional skill set of the people undertaking the
assessment. That is probably one of the biggest things that we have
learned from the whole Harrington process. Harrington clearly said in
his report that there is a need to ensure that those undertaking
assessments have good qualifications and access to the sort of expert
advice that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned. We are considering,
therefore, the use of mental, intellectual and cognitive champions to
support the assessment process for PIP in much the way that Professor
Harrington discussed developments in how we ensure that we have the
right assessment skills in place for the
WCA.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000227">&#160;</a>

make use of the expertise of specialist disability organisations in
offering training, particularly awareness training, to potential
assessors? For example, I know that the National Autistic Society has
offered to provide such training to the DWP and its contractors in the
past, but it feels that, from time to time, its offer has fallen on
deaf
ears.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000228">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There are two responses to that. One is
“absolutely.” Drawing on the experience of the WCA and
the role of some of the mental-health charities in supporting
development in that area, we will be looking to work closely with
specialist organisations in the training that is put forward. I would,
however, take that one step further and say that we also need to look
at the important role that user-led organisations can have in helping
disabled people in this whole process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000229">&#160;</a>

£3 million pot of money to help develop the role of such
organisations throughout the country. In some areas, such as Norfolk
and Essex, we have strong user-led organisations, but we do not in
other areas. It is that sort of user-led organisation that can provide
a great deal of support for disabled people through this process, and
that will be extremely important as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000230">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
great deal to be learned from Harrington, and I hope that the right
hon. Gentleman can understand where the mix-up has come in terms of his
interpretation of the policy document. Ensuring that an individual who
has been assessed has the opportunity to feed in properly and that
their voice is heard; that evidence is gathered from the right people;
that assessments are conducted by people with the necessary skills and
training; and that those assessors have access to expert support where
it is needed—we have learnt all those things very clearly from
the Harrington process, and we will take them forward to the assessment
and
PIP.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the other aspects raised by the right hon. Gentleman, I should say that
fluctuating conditions have come up consistently. All hon. Members
would expect that; it is very much to the fore of all our minds. It
clearly exemplifies why we need individuals who have the right sort of
training, but also have access to experts in other areas of disability
to ensure that they are able to identify accurately when somebody is
dealing with the realities of a fluctuation condition. We have designed
the draft criteria to take account of physical, sensory, mental,
intellectual and cognitive impairments, and it is essential that this
assessment also deals effectively with variable and fluctuating
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
assessment will not—I repeat, not—be a snapshot of one
day, but will consider an individual’s ability to carry out
activities over a period of time; we are suggesting a year. We will
consider impacts where they apply for the majority of the time. The
expertise of the assessor in looking at that on an individual case
basis will be an important part of getting the implementation of this
new assessment right. That is why we will continue to look at the skill
sets of assessors, with disabled people and their organisations, to
ensure that we get the balance right and that we have in place the sort
of expert training that the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston
talked
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I would like to turn my attention to the requirement to issue clear
guidance. As expected, we will shortly begin the commercial process to
identify who will be responsible for undertaking the personal
independence payment assessment on a national basis. I assure the
Committee that, whoever is successful in this process, clear guidance
on how specific health conditions or impairments should be assessed
will be available to staff undertaking the assessment. That guidance
will also be made available to the public.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We will also
ensure that there are clear monitoring and quality assessment and
assurance processes in place, in much the same way as we spoke about
earlier today in the debate about the provision of Welsh language
access. It is that sort of quality assurance process that can help to
ensure that we give every person who applies for the personal
independence payment the sort of quality assessment and experience that
we
expect.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000235">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Given
those assurances, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will feel that
we have a shared agenda. Given my clarification on what was included
within the policy papers that were issued on Friday, I hope that he is
assured that we will be learning very much from our experiences of the
WCA, some of which were as a  result of the work that he did
when he was a Minister in this Department. I hope, therefore, that he

amendment intends to insert in the Bill a requirement that the medical
assessment to ascertain eligibility for PIPs should be the subject of a

characteristics of the pilot. First, it should operate in one or more
specified areas. Secondly, it should assess the impact on specific
groups of people. Thirdly, it should be the subject of a formal
response from the Secretary of State. Although it is a relatively
modest amendment in its scope, establishing a proper pilot is important
for ensuring that the transition to PIP is not fraught with problems.

hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow East has already made it clear that
we do not oppose the establishment of an objective test to assess
eligibility for PIP, and we firmly supported the reform of the gateway.
None the less, the Government need to tread very carefully. We have
already heard some sensible suggestions, including those from the
Liberal Democrat members of the Committee. The hon. Member for Cardiff
Central, who is not in her place at the moment, was rebuked by the
Minister earlier for talking about a pilot when she should have
referred to testing. I am much more persuaded by the suggestion of the
hon. Member for Cardiff Central here. I am not quite sure what the
distinction is between piloting and testing. Perhaps the Minister can
clarify that in her answer. Perhaps the difference is in the scale and
the seriousness of the exercise that is envisaged, with piloting being
a step higher than testing. If that is the case, I feel that piloting
is the appropriate action.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000243">&#160;</a>

reminding the Committee again of the huge scale of the operation that
will be required to assess people for PIP. My hon. Friend has already
referred to this. Some 1.8 million working-age people who currently
receive DLA will have to go through the new assessment by the end of
2015 and beginning of 2016. On top of that, there will be a steady
stream of new applicants and a fair number of appeals. We are
considering a very large number of people having to be assessed for PIP
over a rather short time. If the Government get this wrong, or the
process starts to go wrong, the implications could be very far-reaching
and there would not be much time to put things
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000244">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The pilot for which I am arguing has the
characteristics set out in the amendment. However, as I said, it should
be in one or more specified areas, not just in one place or a
particular centre. The pilot should assess the impact on specific,
identified groups of people, including those with fluctuating
conditions and mental health conditions. After the pilot has taken
place, the Secretary of State should produce a written
response—an assessment—of the experience of it. If one
could have a test with all those characteristics, I would be perfectly
happy to say, “That’s fine and will do.” At the
moment, I do not know whether it does. Perhaps the Minister will set
out for us in a moment whether the test that she envisages will meet
those three
criteria.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000573">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
are several specific reasons for needing to be cautious about the
matter. First, and probably most importantly, we need to ensure that
the process assesses people’s circumstances properly. As we have
already discussed, we need to learn that lesson from the establishment
of the WCA. The Minister made the point that the process is likely to
be iterative. I hope that most of the iteration will take place in the
piloting before we start applying the assessment to people who
currently receive DLA. If we are still trying to modify the system once
we are in the large-scale process of putting existing benefit
recipients through the new assessment, that could be a recipe for
serious problems. I suspect that that point is likely to be made at the
rally and event tomorrow.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
certainly lessons to be learned from the WCA. Obviously, as the
Minister says, I was involved in setting up the employment and support
allowance and therefore in setting up the WCA. However, the Harrington
review pointed out that the process still needed further refinement.
For instance, Professor Harrington found evidence that some mental
health conditions might currently be inadequately assessed. It is
probably unrealistic to expect any new assessment process to be
entirely without fault at the beginning. That is why we need to do
everything possible to iron out the difficulties as early as possible

order to avoid the significant problems that have arisen with the WCA,
it is vital that the new PIP assessment is piloted extensively to
ensure that it is working fairly and effectively before it is extended
to all DLA claimants...it was only when the assessment was
independently reviewed by Professor Harrington that the DWP would
recognise the flaws in the process. It is of fundamental importance
that an assessment of this kind is both valid and reliable, and that
any issues flagged-up by such a pilot are properly addressed before
moving forwards with full
reassessment.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000592">&#160;</a>

half years’ of experience now, and in the light of that we are
able to make some changes to it. I am suggesting that there needs to be
something comparable to that with the assessment process for the
personal independence payment. Otherwise there will be serious problems
when severely disabled people have the new assessment applied to them

                        <p class="tabbed">I agree with
the hon. Gentleman—I am glad that the Minister has accepted it
as well—that we do need to learn lessons from the WCA process
for the one we are embarking on. It seems that the stakes are a lot
bigger here, because many people who are financially dependent on DLA
feel a good deal of uncertainty about their position once they have
been through the new assessment for PIP. Some extra work to reassure
them at this stage would be well worth doing. That is the aim of the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Now that the
hon. Member for Cardiff Central is with us again, I will repeat the
point that I made earlier, that I agree with her about piloting; I am
less convinced by what the Minister said about testing. I think she was
right to use the word “piloting”, although it may be that
we mean the same thing. I look forward to the Minister’s
explanation of the testing she has in mind. This needs to be a serious
exercise because of how much is at stake. The case is strengthened by
the fact that on paper the new gateway looks very like the work
capability assessment. I have some sympathy with the assumption made by
the hon. Member for Cardiff Central that Atos would apply. She was
rebuked by the Minister, because of course there has to be a tendering
process. It is difficult to understand who might do it, other than Atos
in practice. That is certainly the view of the disability
organisations, too. I can understand why the hon. Lady made that
assumption.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
reason why the case for piloting is even stronger is the scale of the
exercise—the 1.8 million people to whom it will be applied from
the outset. Right from the beginning, the intention is that existing
DLA recipients will have this assessment applied to them, not just new
applicants. We have a later amendment on schedule 10, suggesting that
that will be ill-advised. I will not run through the arguments now.
However, that also highlights why the case for piloting is so
important. The stakes are very high indeed. If there are any doubts in
Committee today, they are likely to be vanquished by the rally and the
representations that all of us will receive tomorrow.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
also financial considerations to be aware of. There is a great deal of
concern from people with disabilities that the Government’s
approach to PIP is being dictated essentially by a cuts target. The
Government have decided that they need to make 20% cuts, and the finer
points of how they do that are a secondary consideration. That is the
worry for organisations that represent people with disabilities. The
truth is that too much is at stake for too many people. The Minister
assured us that her approach is principled, and I welcome that, but it
was not clear during the debate on ESA. I am pleased that she has been
able to affirm that, on this issue, the Government’s starting
point is principled, and that the budget consequences must be worked
out second, and not be determined up front, which is a worry because
that would be the wrong way of going about reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000268">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a danger of rushing ahead too quickly, before the assessment has
been properly worked through, and the difficulties identified and
removed. There is no point putting people through a flawed assessment
process, only for it to be necessary to assess them again, perhaps
through an appeal mechanism when the problems have been ironed out. If
the Government proceed too rapidly without the necessary safeguards in
place, they may waste a lot of money instead of saving it, as well as
causing a lot of unnecessary anxiety. The three compelling reasons for
proceeding carefully and starting with a proper pilot are to ensure
that people’s circumstances are assessed accurately and fairly,
to allow disabled people to have full confidence in the process, and to
ensure that we do not end up wasting money by implementing a flawed
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment proposes that the pilot should show three characteristics.
The first is that it should operate in one or more specified areas. In
that way, it should be possible to ensure that the pilot covers a
reasonable cross-section of the population demographics and the
different circumstances in different parts of the UK. That should be
possible by choosing areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
amendment proposes that the pilot should assess the impact of the
assessment process on people with specific types of medical impairment
or disability. This is a radical overhaul of access to disability
benefit, and there could be types of impairment that are not assessed
adequately at the first attempt. The amendment draws attention to two
that we have already discussed: fluctuating conditions and mental
health impairment. It is right to spend a fair amount of time and
effort to ensure that the assessment process works well.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The third
characteristic of the pilot is that it should be the subject of a
formal response by the Secretary of State. If the pilot is to be
effective, there should be a statutory requirement on the Government at
least to respond to its findings, and to put them in the public domain.
That would help to ensure that the lessons of the pilot were learned
and applied instead of being ignored. Perhaps more important, it would
help to give confidence to existing DLA recipients and others who will
apply for PIP in future that their concerns will be properly
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a strong case for a pilot of PIP, given the scale of the proposed
changes and the number of people who will go through the assessment.
The case for it is very strong and, like so much in the Bill, the
effects of precisely what the Government are going to do will hang on
the detail. I hope that the Minister recognises that the amendment
would take us in the right
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000273">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is important to look not only at a
test—the criteria against which people will be
measured—but at the whole assessment process. Some of the
discussion has been about the independent test in which people must
show how they cope with certain day-to-day activities, whatever they
might be. I fully understand that we need to get that
correct—deciding what ought to be measured and how to do
so—but we must also look at the assessment process, almost from
start to finish, to see how it works in practice. A pilot would enable
that to be
done.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000274">&#160;</a>

the process as a whole, including what sorts of information were looked
at, what weight was given to the Atos testing process,
Harrington’s criticism that there was too much rubber-stamping
of that test when decisions were made, what happened when decisions
were made and how few decisions seemed to be given a reconsideration,

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
we want to get this right, we ought to have the opportunity to see how
it works in practice. I suspect that looking at certain small bits and
consulting on others will not reveal some of those flaws. Many aspects
of the ESA probably looked okay or viable until the new applicants
became a pilot. I am not convinced that that was the right thing to do.
However, what gave rise to considerable concern among those who
experienced the process, the organisations supporting them and many of
us who met constituents and dealt with such issues was the fact that,
so often, the people who appealed were successful in those appeals,
thus suggesting —endorsed by Harrington, I
think—that a symptom of something flawed in the process. We
sometimes talk too narrowly about that part of the process which is the
independent
test.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
do not need to get precious, necessarily, about who did what and
whether it was right before. When I first encountered people having
difficulties with the ESA process, I agreed that we had to take action
to reach a situation in which people were not pushed into a siding for
a long time, on a benefit perhaps because it was more convenient for
them. However, when I recognised that individuals had serious
difficulties with the process that they were being put through and that
their lives were being made very difficult indeed, I realised that
there is a huge difference between having an idea—a good
idea—and the practice and
implementation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
we have the opportunity and time to carry out a pilot, it would be a
means of avoiding some of the unnecessary mistakes and expense. The
expense of the appeal process that might result from a flawed
assessment process could be avoided if the work was done in advance. I
hope the Minister is prepared to consider the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000278">&#160;</a>

objective test and for the reform of the gateway. I hope that, in this

the risk of being pedantic—I hope I did not rebuke my hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff Central, but if I did I apologise
profusely; it was not my intention to do so—I simply drew
attention to the fact that “pilot” and
“testing” apparently do not mean exactly the same thing.
My background is in marketing, and I

                           </div>used those terms interchangeably in my previous existence. However, in
Government circles, pilot takes on a different legal meaning.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If we piloted
PIP, we would have to take legal powers to reassess entitlement to
disability living allowance and assess entitlement to PIP by taking an
approach termed “testing” as opposed to
“piloting”. We could therefore examine the impact of the
new assessment on recipients of DLA without withdrawing their
entitlement to their current benefits. That is important because, as
the right hon. Gentleman drew out very well in his contribution, we are
trying to introduce an assessment that will enjoy the confidence of
disabled people and not in any way put them in a position of feeling
anxious about the support that they will receive.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One of my
concerns about taking the right hon. Gentleman’s approach, given
the legal implications of a pilot versus a test, is about what would
happen to individuals who were reassessed in the period during which we
were reporting on the pilot. If we set aside the word
“pilot” and consider the content of what he suggested, he
might find that there is little difference between our approaches other
than that slightly legalistic term. I think that that is the case, and
I am sure that he will let me know if it is
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000282">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
approach to testing clearly meets the right hon. Gentleman’s
first two criteria of being able to operate in one or more specified
areas and evaluating the impact of the new assessment on specific
groups, including people with fluctuating conditions. On the
third—to receive a formal response from the Secretary of
State—we will publish a report and provide an update to draft
regulations in time for that to be discussed in the other place, as I
mentioned earlier. We have similar objectives for the next set of
activities; perhaps we are just calling them slightly different
names.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000283">&#160;</a>

the clause. Is she saying that some of the testing will have been
carried out by the time it is debated in the other place? I am anxious
to establish that after the test or pilot, whichever it is—I,
too, thought that they meant the same, but I stand corrected by her
explanation—a report should be written about the lessons learned
from it. Will that document be available in time for the debate in the

of the WCA, our approach will give us far more flexibility than the
sort of mass-scale pilot that was done in the past. This week, as he
will know, we published an initial draft of the assessment criteria,
but that is absolutely not the end of our development work. We will
continue to refine those initial draft criteria as we move forward,
working with disabled people and their organisations to ensure that the
criteria work as they need to.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000286">&#160;</a>

test the criteria over the summer, to ensure that they accurately and
consistently assess individuals, and consider the impact of the
assessment. As part of that testing, we will consider the impact of the
assessment on specific impairment groups, such as those with mental
health conditions, learning disabilities and sensory impairments. The
exercise will provide a vital opportunity to learn, early on and
without affecting customers’ current benefit claims, how the new
assessment criteria will work on the ground. It will be a safe
environment in which we can understand how the new assessment will

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman brings up an important part of
the testing process, which will involve ensuring that the right
information is available. He will recall from earlier debates today
that the Government want to take a flexible approach to what
information is taken into account when an assessment is made. Other
members of the Committee will consider that issue, particularly as we
go through our testing
processes.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000292">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Alongside
that, it is important to pick up on  another point, as the
right hon. Member for East Ham did in his remarks. This is not just
about the assessment; it is about the operational post-processes as
well.  We are already involving disabled people and
their  organisations in the development of the benefit’s
administration, including the assessment process. We are setting up a
dedicated personal independence payment implementation consultation
group, as I mentioned, which will draw on a wide number of national and
grass-roots, user-led organisations. The first meeting will be held
next week. We want to ensure that we involve disabled people at all
stages of the operational design. It is no good getting the assessment
right if the operation does not work in practice for disabled
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000293">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The group will
form part of our development and testing process. That approach is
important and has been well thought through as a way of working
actively together with disabled people to refine both the assessment
and the operational processes with hands-on involvement, instead of
simply putting an assessment into a pilot area and then walking away
from it for six months and seeing what happens. We will work with
people on an iterative and hands-on basis to obtain solutions to the
problems that arise, instead of simply walking away and waiting for a
report to be written. I think that that is the right
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000294">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, we are seeking to learn from our experience of the WCA, and as
part of that we are looking closely at the processes used in ESA,
particularly the pilots around Aberdeen and Burnley. We are also
drawing further on Professor Harrington’s report to see how
we can ensure that we have maximised PIP’s design
beforehand.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000295">&#160;</a>

assurance that our testing is robust and will provide the sort of
evidence that the Government can have confidence in. I will write to
him with more details, but I anticipate that it will involve many
hundreds of people—several hundreds, I am told. He may be aware
that we have done some initial probing work with DLA recipients
already, as part of the initial criteria development phase. This is
something that we are putting at the heart of our
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000297">&#160;</a>

want to drive home the point that we are undertaking a more holistic,
end-to-end test of the process. Picking up on the points made by the
hon. Member for Edinburgh East, we are ensuring that we know how the
process will work end-to-end before it is introduced in April 2013,
again reflecting some of the lessons learned from the Harrington review
and involving co-production with disabled
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000298">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition to those assurances, the Bill requires the Secretary of State
to commission an independent report on the operation of the assessment
when it has been implemented and to lay that report before Parliament.
That thorough and fully independent review will allow us properly to
decide how the assessment is working and its impact, thus allowing us
to refine it if necessary. In contrast with DLA, providing the
assessment criteria in regulations will enable us quickly to change
things as and when we believe it would be prudent to do so. That is an
important innovation that PIP
offers.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000299">&#160;</a>

hope that my comments reassure the right hon. Gentleman that, although
we do not intend to pilot, we intend to achieve the objectives that he
set out in his amendment before we implement PIP, utilising the
experience of disabled people, and to evaluate its impact after
implementation. Adding formal pilots would delay these important
reforms and the important benefits that they will bring for disabled
people. On that basis, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will find
it appropriate to withdraw his amendment, but I will listen to his

with a flawed assessment would do so much damage. Nevertheless, the

that I was not aware of. I should like to reflect on what she said. I
do not know whether she will write to me, but if she does, perhaps she

independence. We have been told in the briefing that there are nine
such activities: planning, buying food and drink, preparing and cooking
food, taking nutrition and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000304">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Disability Benefits Consortium, which I think only saw that note
yesterday when it was made more widely available, is—as the
Minister will know—critical of that approach and has described
it as a “tick-box approach.” It has made it clear that it
would prefer what it describes as a more holistic approach. However, it
says that given the Government’s commitment to a set list of
criteria, it has proposed an alternative set of eight criteria, which
it argues assess the wider range of activities necessary to leading an
independent life. They provide a more accurate measure of the costs
faced by disabled people. Those eight criteria are, first, maintaining
a clean and safe living environment; secondly, preparing for the start
or the end of the day; thirdly, social participation; fourthly,
communicating with others; fifthly, preparing and consuming food and
drink; sixthly, maintaining health and condition management; seventhly,
dealing with utilities, such as gas and electricity; and eighthly,
adaptations.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000305">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Looking at
the consortium’s list of eight there clearly is not surprisingly
some overlap with the Government’s list. However, it is clear
that the consortium’s list is wider in scope than that of the
Government. It could be argued that the consortium’s list
contains a more rounded appreciation of what is involved in securing
independence and is perhaps a fuller list of the things that ought to
be considered when dealing with what the Minister has said she wants
the assessment to take into account. The Government’s list,
which was sent around at the end of last week, by contrast, is rather
narrower. The consortium’s list is a more rounded
set.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000306">&#160;</a>

list of nine is better than the consortium’s list of eight? I

in the context of the activities of daily living. Can the Minister say
something more about the rationale for the list of nine that the
Government have come up with in contrast to the alternative
proposal?<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000307">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for initiating
this stand part debate and for giving us the opportunity to talk a bit
more broadly about such matters, although I will focus my remarks on
the issues he has raised about the activities that are included in the
assessment criteria. The assessment criteria that we have put forward
have been developed by an independent group of specialists in health
and social care and disability. That group includes a wide-range of
professionals who have looked at what they feel are the most important
proxies for assessing somebody’s care and mobility needs. The
activities that they have chosen—and I emphasise that they have
chosen them, because we wanted that sort of independent advice on
this—provide a more holistic assessment of the impact of
disability than the existing DLA criteria, considering the impact of
the full range of impairment types. For example, the introduction of
communication, as has been mentioned, is a significant
departure.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000308">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have only just seen the Disability Benefits Consortium submission, but
we welcome the active involvement of such groups in the discussion that
we will have on the assessment criteria. I welcome the time that the
consortium took to look carefully at our proposals to see whether there
are other areas that might need to be addressed. I can assure the right
hon. Gentleman that we take all such submissions very seriously, and we
are looking carefully at whether there are other ways that we can hone
and shine our assessment criteria to ensure that they are the best that
they can be. I underline, however, that we are not trying to be able to
take into account every aspect of an individual’s life, and I am
sure that the right hon. Gentleman would agree that that would be
unmanageable. We are looking for a reasonable set of proxies to assess
the abilities of an individual to participate in everyday
life.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000309">&#160;</a>

new—of course, I think that the consortium did not see the
Government list until yesterday. The consortium list contains
communicating with others, which is also in the Government list, but
separately, its list contains “social participation”. It
struck me, looking through the other items on the Government list, that
there is not really anything that addresses that, apart from the point
about communicating. I think that one can see the reasons why one might
want to consider the ability for people to participate socially in a
broader way, and I wonder whether the Minister thinks that there may be
some merit in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000310">&#160;</a>

the very issue that he raised—the ability for an individual to
communicate with people who they know well, and those who they know
less well. Some innovations that we have been discussing on mobility
will also have a beneficial effect on people’s ability to be
part of their community. An important part of that is being able to
have that social interaction, and, because the DLA does not adequately

throughout this debate, it is about getting this right. I believe that

                           </strong> The amendment would retain the three-month waiting
period that claimants must wait before they are eligible to receive the
personal independence payment. However, the proposals would go on to
extend the period that the claimant must show that they will 
be with that disability to nine months, rather than six months, which
is currently the case with the disability living allowance.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000320">&#160;</a>

repeat the point that this change is a part of the reform process that
we support. There is a clear case for reforming the gateway to the
personal independence payment, to ensure that the new benefit goes to
those who need it. I think that we all agree on that. Unlike the
Government, however, we do not believe that the right way to do that is
to make disabled people wait for six months before they are given the
support that they clearly need to help them to meet the extra costs
associated with living with a disability. We do not think that that is
the right way to go about
reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000322">&#160;</a>

believe that it would be better to keep the initial three-month waiting
period before people can apply for PIP and instead extend the time
after they receive the benefit during which they must show they have

			Column number: 846<a class="bkMark" name="Column846">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To be clear,
we would also extend the required period condition that currently
exists around DLA, extending it from nine months to a year under the
PIP. However, we would extend the provision after the receipt of the
benefit rather than at the beginning. That is the fundamental point,
because we believe that extending the waiting period at the beginning
unfairly penalises those disabled people who need extra help to cope
with their disability early on in their treatment. Ultimately, the
change that we are proposing could lead to a reduction in costs. If we
move in quickly to help people and give them the support they need,
that can stop their condition deteriorating. If their condition
deteriorates, that would sometimes require other expenditure from other
parts of the state, as it were.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000324">&#160;</a>

question. I was feeling very neglected by him. He had not intervened on
me once and I was feeling very disappointed about that. I am glad that

question.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000326">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Of course,
the hon. Gentleman is raising a very serious point and in preparing the
amendment we have of course given some serious thought to the
associated costs. There are two points that I want to raise with him.
First, I pursued the Minister and the Department to try to get some
figures about the cost of these measures but the cost is quite hard to
determine, because we cannot actually determine the costs. If someone
claims the benefit at three months, how would we then assess the costs?
What would the journey be to six months? That information is quite hard
to extract. What we have tried to do is to balance the fact of earlier
application and earlier eligibility by extending the period after an
application to nine months. I will go on to say that a number of the
organisations in the sector substantially agree that we can save money
if we intervene early. That is prevention. Sometimes, if we do not
intervene early, a person’s condition deteriorates and we might
have to provide substantially more support, particularly social care
support. So there is a complex argument about costs that the
Government, a number of organisations and I myself are involved
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000327">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
many charities are deeply concerned by the Government’s decision
to make disabled people wait for six months before they can apply to
receive help. The Centre for Mental Health, Mind, Rethink, the Royal
College of Psychiatrists and the Scottish Association for Mental Health
issued a joint statement, which said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“We

the time that they are able to apply for PIP, the period of the

                        <p>That
quote from the Multiple Sclerosis Society makes it clear that this
issue is not just about ensuring that people get the help they need
when they need it. There is also an argument for preserving the
preventive mechanism, to ensure that the impairment of a disabled
person is not allowed to worsen as they sit and wait for half a year
before the Government take note and help them. It is not only an issue
of cost but a health issue, in terms of assisting disabled
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000330">&#160;</a>

particular group who are deeply worried—I am sure that the
Minister is aware and has had representations as we have had on this
side of the House—are cancer charities. In an open letter to the
Secretary of State, a group of cancer charities highlighted why the
change is especially problematic for cancer patients:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Firstly,
we are very concerned by the proposal that people with cancer will have
to wait six months before they claim the new Personal Independence
Payment (PIP), which will replace DLA. We know that even the existing
three-month wait for DLA is extremely problematic for people with
cancer. Cancer treatment often starts very quickly following diagnosis
and the needs associated with cancer can escalate rapidly. In the first
six months following diagnosis, people with cancer face dramatically
increased outgoings to cover expenses such as travel and parking for
hospital appointments and extra fuel costs. Without support for these
costs as soon as need arises, people with cancer will face increasing
levels of hardship and some will get further into
debt.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000595">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
briefing note from the Department has released further details about
that and about the required period condition. I think that the Minister
will argue that they will go some way to address the point I have just
made about up-front costs, particularly for people with hospital
appointments. The Government acknowledge that there are extra costs at
the start, particularly in cases of a serious illness such as cancer,
or indeed a disability. The briefing note goes on to
say:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000333">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“While
we acknowledge that some impairments or conditions may appear long-term
at their outset, and that additional costs may arise as a result, this
may not always be the case. Where disability-related costs do arise
early on, for instance as a result of having to make frequent hospital
visits for treatment, additional support mechanisms provide an element
of coverage before the qualifying period is satisfied, for example
through the NHS travel costs scheme or other social security
benefits.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000596">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Of
course, other interventions are there through the NHS and through other
benefits and such like, and we recognise that. The cancer charities,
however, will tell us that that is a particularly narrow example and a
very limited definition, which shows a very limited understanding of
the costs involved when people experience cancer, sadly. They
particularly emphasise issues such as new clothes, extra fuel costs,
aid adaptations and things like wigs, shoes and special diets, which,
if someone is experiencing cancer and having to pay those costs without
much money, really do matter. I ask the Minister for her thoughts on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000334">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
and the Government argue that this is a proper recommendation because
it aligns DLA with the waiting period for attendance allowance. I have
to ask whether it is right to apply that to people who are working,
many of whom face sudden onsets of conditions that no one was
expecting. I do not know whether that parallel is quite as sound as the
Government suggest. Many we know would argue that it should be the
other way around—that the attendance allowance should be aligned
to the three-month period, rather than doing it the other way around. I
am sure that the Government and the Minister are aware of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000335">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Elsewhere in
the briefing note it states that, in practice, most people will have
completed some or all the qualifying period of the required period
condition when their claim is submitted. I am not quite sure what is
meant by that. Is that the six months, or the three months? I presume
that that is the three months, but even if it is,  I think that
adding another few months to that exacerbates some of the conditions
that many people face. Throughout the briefing note and, as I said
earlier, throughout many Government submissions on the introduction of
PIP, the emphasis is on those with the greatest need. If the Government
intend to shift the goalposts with DLA eligibility fundamentally, they
must move the supporting structures that go with that, and shifting the
waiting time from three to six months does not do that and, in fact,
could undermine and counteract the proposal for people with the
greatest need, because sometimes those with the greatest need are
captured within that three-month period.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000336">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Essentially,
we recognise the overall framework that the Government are introducing
within the year. I think that some of the charities recognise that
shift. We would be willing to go with that shift, but there is a
question of balance. It is that critical period of three months. We
will lose many, many people. Many people will go into debt. Many people
will face enormous difficulty at a time when they are already facing
difficulty in terms of disability and ill health. I do not think that
there is a proper balance and that underlines yet again the deep
concern people have about the scale and pace of change. The amendment
asks the Government to reconsider.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000337">&#160;</a>

Friend’s remarks. Often, for people who experience a sudden
catastrophic event, the costs come up front in the first three months.
I will give an example of someone who is personally known to me who was
mugged and dragged in front of a car. She suffered a serious brain
injury. Not only did she have to cope with the costs of dealing with
that and adapting her house, but her mother had to give up work to look
after her. They waited three months, the qualifying period, before her
mother could claim carer’s allowance for looking after her. To
wait six months would have meant an incredible and catastrophic drop in
their
income.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000338">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
qualifying benefits that people get from carer’s allowance and
from local authorities are important in that time, and the loss of
income by anyone who suffers an illness can be very detrimental.
Citizens Advice has said that one fifth of people who get into debt,
and such serious debt that they end up in court with mortgage arrears,
do so because of an illness. To extend the qualifying time to six
months at a time when there are extra expenses and when extra emotional

measure to increase the existing qualifying period from three to six

access to support. It is our view that support in the short term should
be met by existing, albeit mainly means-tested, support mechanisms,

to all regardless of income. It is about balancing the needs of those

                           </strong> I will be honest and open with my answer. I would
like to reassure the hon. Lady and my hon. Friend the Member for Dover
that the principal aim of extending the qualifying period from three to
six months is not about savings. We do not expect the measure to
provide any significant savings. It is a principled measure to bring
PIP in line with the common definition of disability used in the
Equality Act 2010, to provide an appropriate measure of long-term
disability that can be robustly assessed, and to align with the
qualifying period for attendance allowance. The hon. Member for Glasgow
East asked in the beginning what I have learned from the consultation.
What we learned was that people appreciated and welcomed the
simplification of the definitions, which is important for the Committee
to
note.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000343">&#160;</a>

should thank Macmillan Cancer Support and Disability Alliance for their
immense work in providing briefings for hon. Members who are
participating in the debate. I would like to thank them for
actively doing that. I would also like to thank the hon.
Member for Glasgow East, in tabling the amendment, for so explicitly
accepting the principle that PIP is to be paid to people who have
long-term conditions. PIP cannot be all things to all people. It is
there to provide support for people who have long-term conditions and
who are facing some additional costs associated with that, and PIP will
go some way to try to ameliorate that
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000344">&#160;</a>

disability living allowance, people must satisfy a three-month
qualifying period, as the hon. Lady pointed out, and a six-month
prospective test. Those rules were put in as something of compromise
when the old attendance and mobility allowances were merged in 1992,
and, as the hon. Lady pointed out, attendance allowance continues to
apply a six-month qualifying period to this day. While those rules have
operated for nearly 20 years—much longer in the case of
attendance allowance—we must consider what an appropriate
measure of long-term disability is in the 21st century, which should
form part

                           </div>of the gateway to a valuable and universal cash benefit. It is our view
that the proposed six-month qualifying period and the six-month
prospective test meet the appropriate criteria and are consistent with
the definition of long-term disability used for the purpose of the
Equality Act 2010 and recently issued guidance connected to it. I know
that the increase in the qualifying period has caused a great deal of
comment and concern among disabled people and their representatives.
Equally, as I have said before, it has actually found some support as
well, because of how it simplifies the approach to how we define
disability.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000345">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to take the opportunity to stress that most people will not have
to wait six months before they start to receive PIP. That is because
the six-month qualifying period starts at the point when somebody is
first entitled to PIP, regardless of whether a claim has been received.
Perhaps I can provide a practical example of how that works by using
the case of somebody who suffers a serious stroke. From the point of
the stroke onwards, they could be meeting the conditions of entitlement
for PIP and would theoretically pass the assessment conditions. In my
example, the person has had a stroke, but does not submit their claim
form until they have completed extensive in-patient hospital treatment
and rehabilitation, which may take five months. That would mean that
five months of the qualifying period have already elapsed at the point
that they make their claim, and they would be in receipt of the benefit
soon after. It is an important point, and one that is often
misunderstood, that most people will not be submitting a claim on the
day that they become entitled to that benefit. In fact, the research
that we have suggests that few people currently make a claim for DLA
before the existing three-month qualifying period has been met, and
many put their claim in long after that. We would expect the same sort
of pattern of behaviour with
PIP.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000346">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we have heard today, there have been examples of how those rules
already affect many disabled people, and I appreciate that, in some
instances, there may be immediate costs that people incur in the early
months when a disabling condition or impairment begins to have effect.
Clearly, that is something that we need to take into account, because,
as I said at the outset, it is our view that support in the short term
for people who have sudden-onset conditions can and should be met from
existing means-tested support, leaving PIP to do the job that it was
designed for, which is to ensure that the financial support is in place
when those costs become too burdensome for somebody to deal
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000347">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">After
having set our thinking out, I hope that I can provide the hon. Lady
with the reassurance that this is an absolutely clear way to pull PIP
and attendance allowance into alignment with the Equality Act 2010,
which was enacted under her party’s Government. That provides
some consistency, which is unfortunately not always the case in this
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000348">&#160;</a>

fairness and equalities have been prayed in aid of certain changes. It
would be equally reasonable to equalise things in a different way. Just
because attendance allowance has a six-month period, why is that being
equalised to six months rather than attendance allowance being
equalised to three months? Has the Minister also considered the concern
of cancer charities that there are considerable additional expenses
that are not met by other sources?<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000349">&#160;</a>

pointer in the way that Parliament has chosen to define disability in
the past. The hon. Lady may not agree with the Equality Act—I do
not think she was in Parliament when we debated it in detail before the
general election—but that is certainly the principle that we are
following. I hope she will think that is an appropriate thing for us to

that I should clarify, as it is something that the hon. Lady picked up

pertinent for individuals whose condition may deteriorate following a

fulfil the qualifying period again. Hon. Members may be aware of that

good manners. I should also thank all the organisations for their
briefings. The Opposition do not enjoy the same level of support as the
Minister does from her officials, so those briefings are greatly
appreciated. That is evident today from the way we have used them. May
I also thank the Minister for clarifying the point about savings? This
is a debate about how we manage the reform. There is some disagreement
between us on that, but I appreciate her clarification that this is not
a drive to save money and that essentially we are having a different
discussion about

am not broadly persuaded by what the Government are doing. With the
greatest respect to the Minister, I do not think that she realises the
scale of concern that organisations have about the measure and the
personal impact it will have on a number of people who have had
experiences in this area. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield made
a significant point and gave a graphic illustration quoting the
evidence from Citizens Advice about the reality that people face. The

the argument is about what is short term and what is long term. It

nine months. As I understand it, we would be consonant with the
requirements of the Equality Act if we went for three months and nine
months, rather than six and six as the Government propose. The Minister
made my argument for me in some ways with her example of a stroke
victim. I have not heard anything to convince me that it is reasonable
for a stroke victim to wait six months rather than three months. If
someone has the full impact of a stroke and it has incapacitated them,
it is reasonable for us to continue to set their eligibility at three
months.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000354">&#160;</a>

think that my hon. Friend was making a slightly different point,
although it was
connected.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000358">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does my hon. Friend share my puzzlement at that
remark from the Minister? DLA and PIP are not means-tested, as the
Minister said, yet she implied in her remarks earlier this afternoon
that need in the first three months will be met by means-tested
support. I am not sure what she is talking
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000359">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That question of other support is why I am so
troubled by the Minister’s contribution. It is clear to
me—it is a hard reality that we were obliged to address in
government—that many people in that three to six-month period
will have no other support available. That is what the cancer charities
have laid out in graphic detail. Some support might be available, such
as NHS support for travel costs, but substantial support is not. The
charities tell us directly that if we take away that benefit, restrict
it even more or change the period from three months to six months,
people will be in substantial need and will fail to have that need
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000360">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister said that the measure is not about savings and that there is
no drive to make the Government do it. I cannot see that there is any
strong rationale for the measure other than tidying up, which seems to
be the argument that she is making. Given that, I do not think that we
should take this step. It would have such a negative impact on the
circumstances of people in particularly difficult
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000361">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to pick up on the point about
consistency with the Equality Act. Is it not the case that conditions
including HIV, cancer and multiple sclerosis are automatically included
in the definition of disability under the Act from the point of
diagnosis, with no waiting period of three, six or 12
months?<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000362">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes. That reinforces the point that I was about to
make in conclusion. The measures are a significant part of the Bill and
have raised considerable concerns, as the Minister recognised in her
introduction. Disabled people will be looking closely at what we decide
today. On that basis, I will push my amendment to a vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000363">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will be brief. The amendment looks specifically at people with a sudden
onset condition, such as a cancer diagnosis, a car accident or a
stroke. As has been discussed, there is a clear start to the condition
rather than a slow build-up. It is already hard for people with sudden
onset of a disability to have to wait three months to get disability
living allowance. Only a small number of people are affected, but I
want to read briefly an account by Karen, who has been diagnosed with
cancer, which was passed to me by Macmillan. It clearly explains the
issues:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000394">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“When
you are diagnosed with cancer the last thing you need is money worries.
You need to focus on getting better, but cancer is expensive. I had to
leave my job when I started chemotherapy and immediately the costs
started to mount up. I was paying to travel to and from hospital to get
treatment and had higher energy bills because I was at home more.
Before long I was really struggling to pay my bills and was getting
into more and more debt. Despite needing help straight away, I had to
wait three months before I could get my DLA. Eventually I got my DLA
and it made a massive difference. As well as the DLA I was able to
qualify for the disability premium on tax credits and got more council
tax benefit and housing benefit. If I had had to wait six months there
is no way I would have been able to cope financially. I would have got
further in
debt.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000597">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
many people with a sudden onset condition, the first six months is when
the costs are greatest. That is why there is concern about the
proposal. For example, cancer patients have to pay for travel and
parking at 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 854<a class="bkMark" name="Column854">&#160;</a>
                           </div>hospital. The average cancer patient makes 53 trips to hospital, costing
on average £325. That is a huge amount of money for a lot of
families. For children with cancer, specialist units are sprinkled
around the country, and there is often much further to travel, which
increases the cost of petrol and brings additional potential costs such
as accommodation, child care for siblings and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000395">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
also the other costs associated with having a disability. However, for
people with a sudden onset condition, items such as special adaptations
come all at once and at the beginning. They have a very heavy up-front
loading of the costs associated with their condition and disability.
Such costs—travel, extra heating bills and
adaptations—are exactly the sort that PIP is designed for. We
have just had a discussion about whether PIP is an income replacement,
which clearly it is not. The considerations I am talking about are the
things that PIP is designed to
cover.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000396">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government said in their consultation on PIP, and the Minister has
repeated today, that there are other sources to pay for those
additional costs in the first six months, such as NHS travel costs,
employment and support allowance, social services support and so on.
However, they are either means-tested or are not available for people
who are in work or on statutory sick pay. It often takes a long time to
get through the assessment process for social services support from
local authorities. Extra support at the beginning would not be there
through those methods
either.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000397">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is only one way forward; I accept that there other ways. I
also accept that the wording is probably not perfect. I found it
difficult to express in a helpful way. It is not the wording one would
want to see in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000398">&#160;</a>

                           </span> My hon. Friend makes a point
that has been made to many of us in representations. Although it is
welcome that the Government are consulting separately on DLA for
under-16s, it has been highlighted to me that for those in the 16 to
18-year-old bracket, all the things described by my hon. Friend can
affect a whole family. Most 16 to 18-year-olds are, in reality,
children living at home; particularly if they have a sudden onset
illness, they would be treated in that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000399">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is right. There are many issues
that go alongside, not just the cost, particularly when children or
young people are affected. The financial and emotional implications for
the family as a whole are significant. The amendment would require the
Government to define a sudden onset condition, which I suspect is
easier said than done. If a claimant fits those criteria and can show
that they are likely to have the disability for the following 12
months, they would become eligible for PIP immediately. The amendment
would retain the requirement to show that the disability will remain
for 12 months, but it enables people to claim PIP up
front.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000400">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has said that cost is not an issue, but it might be,
particularly if people are given the benefit up front, as an extra six
months would have to be paid. The amendment would leave open the
possibility to vary payments over that time. Payments could be reduced
later on, for example, so that they were cost-neutral. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 855<a class="bkMark" name="Column855">&#160;</a>
                           </div>People could claim earlier, but the payments would be withdrawn at a
slower rate later on. That would enable people to get the money up
front when they need it most, but it would put them on the same footing
as other people who are receiving the benefit. Over time, they would
receive the same
amount.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000401">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
appreciate that this is a difficult issue. As I have said, I am not
sure that the wording of the amendment is the right vehicle, but I want
to raise the issue. Many people have concerns about this group of
people. It is a small group, but they are in a particularly difficult
predicament. I would be grateful to the Minister if she told us what
discussions she has had with the relevant organisations, which are
concerned about this. Are the Government looking at alternative ways of
taking such circumstances into account and doing something for those
people?<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000402">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for the amendment. Unlike
the previous one, this amendment seeks to vary the required period
conditions, so that people who experience a sudden onset condition can
access PIP immediately without having to satisfy the six-month
criteria.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000403">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend knows this, but PIP is not about children at this point. I
will look at the issues that she has raised when we consider how PIP
affects children in future. Officials and I have had good discussions
with the various cancer support groups and other organisations that
have expressed opinions on this issue, and we will continue to do so.
Such discussions are an important part of the Bill’s
progress.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000404">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am aware that for some people with sudden onset conditions, such as
those described by my hon. Friend, there may be immediate costs
associated with their condition, but, equally, there may not. That gets
to the heart of the issue. As she heard me say earlier, PIP views
people as individuals, rather than labelling them by their
condition.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000405">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are getting to some tough decisions. Achieving the consistency that I
am looking for requires us to take some tough decisions. I want to stay
true not to labelling disabled people by their conditions, but to
treating them as individuals. This is a case in
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000406">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am now puzzled by the nature of those tough
decisions. The Minister indicated earlier that cost is not the reason
for this provision. Is consistency a tough decision? Is consistency
always to be favoured over fairness or
humanity?<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000407">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sure the hon. Lady would expect the
Government to try to be consistent. We are trying to make it easier for
people to understand the premise from which we start. I understand the
point she is making, but, equally, I hope that she understands that we
have to operate within a framework. That is what I am discussing
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000408">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to labour the arguments that have already been made, but
many of them are similar, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff
Central has said. As with the previous amendment, the key here is that
neither the existence of a condition nor a diagnosis tells 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 856<a class="bkMark" name="Column856">&#160;</a>
                           </div>us anything of the effect that that condition has on an individual or
how long those effects will last. That is a response to the
intervention of the hon. Member for Edinburgh East, too. We must have
some principles by which we develop this new assessment, one of which
is that this is a benefit for individuals who have long-term
conditions. We have drawn our definition of “long-term”
from the Equality Act
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000409">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to detain the Committee any longer with my explanation, but
in winding up, I want to reiterate that the required period condition
is a necessary, proportionate and pragmatic measure to distinguish
between short-term and long-term need. PIP is not, with the exception
of the rules for terminally ill people, designed to meet needs over the
short term, even where they can be assumed to be long term eventually.
Our view is that the existing support mechanisms to meet shorter-term
needs provide adequate and focused support for the vast majority of
individuals. I urge my hon. Friend to consider withdrawing her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000410">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister and appreciate what she is
saying about the varying impact of different conditions on individuals.
I am slightly disappointed in the response, although I understand where
she is coming from. I hope that she will look at whether anything can
be done to help such individuals. There is a bit of a gap here. In the
past, everyone had to wait for three months before they were eligible
to apply, but the gap between three and six months can be significant.
I do not have any wish to press the amendment to a vote; I am not
convinced that the wording is the way forward. I am glad that the

                        <p class="tabbed">There are no
surprises in what the Opposition will say this afternoon. The
Government are well aware that we do not believe that the DLA mobility
component should be removed from those in residential care homes. We
believe that the Bill fails the compassion test because it contains
this clause, which will remove the mobility component of DLA for people
in residential care homes and put nothing appropriate in its place. We
support sensible, careful and compassionate reform to DLA, but this
measure will leave many disabled people trapped in their own
homes.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000434">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
have been various developments in the story of the DLA mobility
component cut, so it might be helpful to the Committee if I provide a
brief summary of how we got here and try to clarify exactly where we
are now. Originally, the Government stated that 60,000 people would be
affected by the decision to remove DLA mobility from those in
residential care homes:<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000435">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
estimate that approximately 60,000 people who claim DLA and live in
residential care will be affected by this measure in Great
Britain.”—[<em>Official Report</em>, 3 November 2010; Vol.
517, c. 819W.]<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000599">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have since updated that estimate, and they are now on record
as stating that the change will affect about 80,000 people, at a cost
saving to the Exchequer of £160 million. I am sure that people
are familiar with that figure. On 23 March, the Prime Minister told the
House that the Government would not remove the mobility component of
DLA. When pressed by the Leader of the
Opposition—<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000436">&#160;</a>

Red Book, which I know that Members have here today, flatly contradicts
the Prime Minister’s statement on two key points. It confirms
that the Government plan to remove the mobility component of DLA from
claimants in residential care, with £475 million
taken from people in residential care by 2015-16 and a cut of
£150 million more from the mobility component of DLA than
originally forecast in the comprehensive spending review last
year—of course that reflects the 20,000 extra people who will
lose the mobility component.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000438">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, this element of the Government’s proposals has been
subject to great controversy and has been heavily criticised. The
goalposts have changed significantly over the past four months: first,
there was the issue of double funding; then there was overlap and
chaos, and everything we heard in the oral evidence sessions showed
that there was no shred of evidence for that; and then there was the
review and the real concerns about how it has been
conducted.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000459">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
fact, some people would have us believe that no cut is taking place at
all. If that is so, why are we having to deal with this provision in
the Bill and why is that saving still flagged up in the Red Book?
Unless the Minister makes another announcement today, which would
stretch credibility a bit far, that is my understanding. If there is no
cut, supporting the amendment to make that clear should not pose any
difficulty. I have heard Committee members welcome the review in the
sense that there will no longer be a cut and that the benefit will
still be protected for disabled people. If they believe that to be the
case, they should categorically support the amendment, which would send
a strong signal. The removal of the clause from the Bill would also
have the advantage of reassuring people such as Mr Greenwood, who are
so
worried.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000460">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
there are inconsistencies, the Government should sort them out with the
proper authorities—the care homes and local
authorities—but they should not make disabled people the victims
of those inconsistencies and of any overlaps in the system. If we care
about the evidence that we have all received, the only option is to
support the amendment. It would categorically protect the interests of
those living in residential homes and ensure that they receive the
benefits to which they are entitled, because they receive precious few
benefits and they need
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000461">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This issue has been running for several months.
Even before the consultation and the discussion about the need to
reform DLA, it appeared to be a one-off issue. Without a doubt, the
proposal appeared to be a savings measure. No less a person than the
Prime Minister repeatedly stated that the reason for it was to equalise
the position with people in hospital, whose situation is said to be
equivalent. That was either an example of equalising downward, to which
I referred earlier, or it was a misconception about what it means to be
in residential care and in
hospital.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000462">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
intervention made by the hon. Member for Dover suggests that he still
labours under the same misconception that people in residential care
are like people in what I describe as nursing homes—they are so
ill that they are nursed in bed. It takes a long time for DLA to be
removed. People in hospital, usually for a relatively short period,
clearly suffer from an illness that is over and above their usual
disability, which is why they are there. The days have long gone when
people spent long periods in hospitals that were equivalent to what are
now residential
homes.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000463">&#160;</a>

can participate, and are encouraged to participate, not only in social
activities, but in training, education and employment, and to meet
their care needs—rather than having round-the-clock 24-hour care
at home, which might be another option for some—they are in a
residential facility. We may have started from a misconception, but we
are now in a position where the longer we debate the matter, the more

personal experience of it. The hon. Lady makes a fair point, however,
about younger people’s residential care, providing there is no
double counting. Older people’s residential care is my concern,
because if the allowance is not used to get out and about, how can it
be properly targeted?<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000465">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> People have to apply for benefit under both the
DLA system and the proposed PIP, so it is not simply handed out, with
people saying, “Here you are, in residential
care—here’s your mobility allowance.” I understand
that people will still have to make an individual application and they
will doubtless have to demonstrate that they meet the criteria. My hon.
Friend the Member for Glasgow East referred to one of those criteria,
which is in a separate section that deals with people who are unable to
make use of a mobility payment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000466">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
measure, people will have to meet the criteria to enable them to
participate in society. We have heard much about what personal
independence payment is meant to be about. It is to enable people to
have the freedoms that the rest of us have. That might be to meet
friends and participate in clubs on a social basis, to volunteer,
or—especially for some of the younger, working-age people in
that situation—to hold down a job or undertake training. Any
concerns about people not needing benefit are addressed by the fact
that they have to apply for it, which they will have to do under the
personal independence payment, and as we have heard, there will be
tests in that process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000467">&#160;</a>

because we must look at people as individuals. It seems strange,
therefore, that the proposal suggests that someone should not receive
the benefit because of their group category—because they are in
a residential care facility. I argue that individuals in that situation
should be considered individually. Saying that someone clearly does not
meet the requirement or cannot make use of it is very different from
saying that anyone in that situation should not be covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000468">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It was
unclear what was meant by the review. The proposal has its own savings
category, which is quite separate from any other financial savings that
some people might feel will be made from this reform; it comes as a
distinct line in the Budget. I was left unclear some weeks ago about
whether there would be a review of the specific proposal or whether the
proposal was being put into the mix to be considered as part of PIP.

                           </div>In other words, would people who currently receive the benefit be
transitioned to PIP, at which time we would look again at their need
for and entitlement to that benefit, or at some point between now and

                        <p class="tabbed">If
there is double payment, and the evidence from many people is that
there is not, the only way to establish that would be for the
Department for Work and Pensions to contact local authorities up and
down the country to ascertain what people pay for and do not pay for,
and what their contracts with care homes cover. If there is an ongoing
process to ascertain whether there really is an overlap and a
duplication of payments, it is not clear that it is happening. It is
not clear that requests for information are going to local authorities.
Many allegations of double payment have been made, although little
evidence has been adduced. I cannot see an easy way of gathering it
without making contact with local authorities, though that will be an
expensive process, putting a lot of people to a lot of
effort.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000470">&#160;</a>

examined further, it is realised that the proposal is inherently bad.

                           </strong> I strongly endorse the comments of my hon. Friends.
I also want the Minister to be crystal clear about the
Government’s attitude to proposals affecting people entitled to
the mobility component or disability living allowance in residential
care homes. Like my hon. Friends, I am confused about what we are
reviewing, and why the savings identified by the Government remain in
the Budget Red Book.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000472">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to add
a few remarks about the reasons why this particular Government proposal
has excited so much concern across so many organisations and families,
and across all parties. I have been struck by the depth of concern
across the House about the matter, as I am sure the Minister has. There
are a few points about which we need to be crystal clear, to understand
why my hon. Friends tabled the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000473">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
we are looking at the position of care homes. Many care homes receive
their funding from local authorities in block form. It is not
necessarily broken down by the items of expenditure purchased, or by
the individuals and the items bought for them. Even if there is some
funding by local authorities of mobility for individuals in some
residential care settings, it is often extremely difficult to identify.
It is not the usual way that the funding package is constructed for
care homes. We are looking at a very murky and confusing picture, if we
start to read that kind of financial support into the existing
contracts.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000474">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
many residential care homes expect to receive people in receipt of DLA
as a precondition of taking them on. They know that they come with that
source of funding, to enable them to access their own mobility needs
and requirements. To be able to provide the quality of care that they
want, it is important for care homes to know that they have residents
who will be mobile because they have access to the DLA mobility
component. That becomes, in some instances at least, a precondition of
the acceptance of a disabled person to the residential care
setting.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000475">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 865<a class="bkMark" name="Column865">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to realise what could happen if those care homes no longer
receive those residents and the payments made for them by local
authorities. The overall financial impact on residential care homes
could be very damaging. It has been suggested that many of them would
be forced to reduce wages to care workers. We all know that poor wages
lead to poor care, which none of us wants to see for our most disabled
individuals.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000476">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friends have said, it has not been possible to uncover any
specific evidence of duplication of payments. All the witnesses who
gave us evidence on this matter, while accepting that it might exist,
had never seen it, despite their extensive experience in the disability
field. The Disability Alliance has made clear that, if the Government
were suggesting that there is a statutory obligation on local
authorities to fund mobility needs for residents in care homes, it is
completely unclear where such statutory obligation sits.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000477">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We know that
people in residential care settings are living in what is their home.
As my hon. Friends have rightly pointed out, a benefit to assist
mobility should not operate differently because of the nature of the
home setting. I remind the hon. Member for Dover that we must not
confuse profound disability with immobility. People may experience
severe levels of need and disability, but it does not mean that they
should not be entitled to move around in the community as part of their
daily
life.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000478">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me tell the Committee about Hamza, the profoundly disabled adult son of
my constituent Mrs Khan-Sindhu. He is in his early 20s and, as a result
of brain damage at birth, he is a wheelchair user. He is doubly
incontinent and has profound learning difficulties, but he loves being
able to go home to visit his extended family at the weekends. Without
the mobility component of disability living allowance, which enables
his family to afford specially adapted transport, he would not have
that pleasure. I am sure that no hon. Member would want people such as
Hamza to be unable to enjoy such quality of
life.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000479">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady makes a powerful point about
targeting, but let me give her another case based on my personal
experience. I had to look after my father for the last 10 years of his
life. He had Alzheimer’s and was in an elderly people’s
residential home. Holding his power of attorney, I was fiducially
obliged to claim on his behalf the highest amount that I could. That
meant the mobility component, but I did not want him to go anywhere. If
he went out for more than five minutes, he would forget who he was and
where he was and would become lost. That was the nature of his
condition. It is a serious issue. Surely the mobility component should
be targeted at need and utilisation, rather than being handed out to
everyone who wants to claim
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000480">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The problem with the Government’s position
is that it is a blanket withdrawal of the benefit from predominantly
working-age adults. People have to be of working age to make an initial
claim, although the payment may continue beyond retirement. We are
talking about predominantly working-age people, younger middle-aged
people. For many such people it may be right, in terms of their quality
of life and access to social and other activities, that they receive
the personal independence payment or the mobility component of
DLA.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000481">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Whatever
the merits of the hon. Gentleman’s argument for targeting to
avoid some of the money potentially going to people at the very end of
their life and who could in no sense benefit from mobility support, the
assessment process should be capable of determining whether there is an
entitlement to mobility payments, as my hon. Friends have pointed out.
It is utterly wrong to remove such payments wholesale from everyone
simply by dint of their being in residential
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000482">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am interested in what the hon. Gentleman said about the circumstances
in which it might be wrong for people to move out of their residential
care setting. Conversely, the National Autistic Society has pointed out
the damaging effects of people being confined to their home and being
unable to go out and undertake social activities. That can have an
extremely harmful effect on their behaviour and
well-being.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000483">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friends pointed out that some people in residential care homes,
none the less, leave their homes to access education or training. Some
are leaving their homes to access employment. The mobility component
can be used, for example, to assist them in acquiring a Motability car.
Removing the mobility component, which will remove their ability to pay
for transport, such as special taxi services or the acquisition of
specially adapted cars to drive themselves, will remove them from paid
employment. Not many people are in that situation, but surely we do not
want to remove from profoundly disabled people who are able to take
paid work the financial support that enables them to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000484">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">First,
I want to turn to another aspect of the amendments that the hon. Member
for Glasgow East tabled on her party’s behalf. Currently,
payment of the care component of DLA stops when a person is in a care
home, and payment of the care and mobility components stops when a
person is a hospital in-patient. That ensures that there is no double
payment for the same need. However, any mobility component of DLA
continues to be paid to people in residential care. Clause 83
replicates the existing rules for the daily living component for people
in residential care, and for both the daily living and mobility
components for people in hospital. In addition, the clause provides for
the extension of the non-payment of the mobility component for people
in residential care if there is an overlap of provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000487">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am somewhat
surprised that the hon. Lady has taken the approach she has with the
amendments, particularly given that it would reverse provisions that
the previous Government had formally supported—on ceasing to pay
the daily living component to people in publicly funded residential
care. I remind hon. Members that successive Governments have accepted
that the care needs of residents in care homes are met through local
authority funding, and that is why the care component of DLA currently
stops when a person is in a care home. Under the amendment, the cost to
the taxpayer last year would have been an additional £235
million. It cannot be Opposition Members’ intention to introduce
an amendment that would result in the taxpayer paying twice for the
same
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000488">&#160;</a>

that late amendment, and, in informal discussions with both sides of
the Committee, everyone seemed to agree that that was a sensible thing
to do. If we are discussing amendment 247 grouped with

for amendments 225 and 226. You have helpfully indicated, Mr Gray,
that  to facilitate debate on this matter tonight, which the
Government want and are perfectly entitled to have,

                           </div>you have enabled us to debate amendment 247. I  suppose that, to
avoid the rather misleading comments the Minister is now making, we
should have withdrawn amendments 225 and 226. I do not know, Mr Gray,
whether—<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000496">&#160;</a>

amendments that have previously been selected and are therefore on the
selection list. We are entering into a debate on this issue, and the
Minister is indicating that, had amendments 225 and 226, which it is
perfectly in order for the Committee to discuss, been moved by the
right hon. Gentleman, there would have been certain consequences. As
the Minister will understand, the Opposition’s intention was to
replace amendments 225 and 226 with amendment 247, but that is not what
occurred, and it could not occur under our procedure. All three
amendments, therefore, are on the Order Paper, and all three are being
debated. It is perfectly in order for the Minister to comment on
amendments 225 and 226, but she should bear it in mind, particularly
given the late hour, that the intention behind amendment 247 is to
replace amendments 225 and 226.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000497">&#160;</a>

couple of hon. Members questioned whether our approach has been
consistent, to which I assert that we have been absolutely consistent
from the start. Our contention is that this proposal is about reducing
overlaps in provision—something I am sure all hon. Members would
want to see. In a time of fiscal problems for our country, we do not
want to pay unnecessarily for the same provision twice, and that
applies not only in this area but in many other areas of government.
All hon. Members want that, as do our constituents and all disabled
people: they want to ensure that we are spending every penny piece most
effectively in their interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000502">&#160;</a>

about reducing the mobility of care home residents. We have considered
this issue thoroughly, particularly in light of evidence provided by a

                           </div>of stakeholders, which has been extremely useful in providing some of
the detail. The hon. Member for Glasgow East highlighted the fact that
the savings are still shown in the Red Book. Let me again make it clear
to the Committee, some of whom have been Ministers and will understand
the protocols involved, that the current position is that care home
support is being reviewed alongside the broader reform of DLA. The
figures in the Red Book make it clear that the savings will be made as
part of the Government’s overall programme of reform. That is
the situation we are in. I give way to the hon. Member for Edinburgh
East, who tried to intervene
earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000503">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to press the Minister further on this
point. Earlier, I asked whether this was a review of the proposal. The
initial proposal, without a doubt, involved the blanket removal of the
mobility component of DLA from people in residential care. I asked
whether the intention was to review that proposal or to include the
recipients within the overall transition from DLA to PIP. I now
understand the Minister to be saying that she intends that individual
cases will be looked at as and when people are moved from DLA to PIP.
People will have the opportunity to have their cases reviewed. If there
is overlap, the benefit will be removed; otherwise, it will not be.
However, surely the financial saving relating to this blanket proposal
remains within the Government’s budget, so is the Minister
saying that that proposal has now been withdrawn in its entirety, with
the financial
consequences?<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000504">&#160;</a>

fully to her point before she intervenes again. Regarding the finances
in the Red Book, it is clear that we have to make those savings. How we
make them will be down to the way the assessment is put together. Care
home residents will be part of that whole process, as we have discussed
for the last few hours. We still have a great deal of work to do on how
those assessment criteria will work, and care home residents will form
part of that. That provides the clarity that Committee members need on
this

Red Book will arise entirely because double funding will be identified,
and DLA and PIP payments will not therefore be made for those
individuals where double funding is in existence? Or is she suggesting
that some of those individuals will cease to qualify as a result of the
assessment? What she is not suggesting, I think, is that the mere fact
they are in residential care homes will, of itself, disqualify them in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000508">&#160;</a>

at this issue, we have discovered a number of things that need
addressing concerning the local provision of mobility support, and I am
not willing to walk away from some of the problems that we have
identified. There is clearly uncertainty about how mobility support
works in practice. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberconwy has
graphically described some of the work he has been doing by talking to
care homes in his constituency, and the different ways that individual
care homes identify and meet the mobility needs of their residents.
There are a wide range of different duties and contractual obligations
to meet those needs, and service providers and residents—and
their families—are sometimes very unclear about where the
responsibility lies for mobility funding. The issue might be difficult
and add complications to the debate, but it is an important part of
unpicking the problem. If we are to address the fundamental issue of
ensuring certainty about the provision and funding of mobility support
for some of the most vulnerable members of our community, we must
acknowledge that the system is far from perfect and requires some
intervention and remedial work.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000517">&#160;</a>

clarity, and to me that is unacceptable given that we are dealing with
some of

                           </div>the most vulnerable people in society. In reforming DLA and introducing
PIP, we must recognise the importance of mobility to residents in care
homes, and members of the Committee can be assured that all Government
Members take that issue seriously. We must ensure that we have a system
where disabled people are in control of their lives, whether or not
they are residents of care homes.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000518">&#160;</a>

care, my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow), to
personalised services for all disabled people, and I hope that that
will move towards clarifying and reducing some of the confusion and
opacity currently in the system. Those charities that have been vocal
about the issue have pointed out that current provision is patchy at
best and may not always work in the best interests of disabled people.
I do not find that situation acceptable and I give the Committee a
clear undertaking that we will not remove the ability of severely
disabled people to get out and about. We will always strive to remove
overlaps, and as we move towards introducing the PIP in April 2013, I
will make sure that disabled people are treated fairly, regardless of
their place of residence. I hope  that with those reassurances,
hon. Members will find it appropriate to withdraw their

measure, it certainly is not clear—no wonder people are
confused. I am not at all clear where the Government are coming from on
this matter, and as the evidence I gave in my opening speech shows,
Labour Members are not the only people who think that. This is not part
of a political agenda; the entire disability movement will agree with
us. My speech was based on evidence from the disability movement, and
the Minister has provided no evidence to support what I believe is her
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="11051170000520">&#160;</a>

of us is clear; we remain confused about the purpose of clause 83. Will

clarify tonight—although we are now told that a review will be

not quite clear in which direction they are going, because, presumably,
they are listening carefully to the concerns of disabled people and

originally came forward with a proposal that categorically said that,

a mobility component”, she could have drawn the comparison, as
the Prime Minister did, with people in hospitals. There was a huge
reaction to that comparison. The Government reasonably said,

different case and that there are differences. We need to look at this

with it, if I am being honest, but it would have been a reasonable,
consistent and clear approach. That is not what the Minister has said.
