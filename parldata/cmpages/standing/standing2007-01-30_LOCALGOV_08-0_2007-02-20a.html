							<b class="B">Andrew
Gwynne</b> (Denton and Reddish) (Lab): First, Mr.
Chope, I welcome you and everyone else back to the Committee. Before I
was rudely interrupted by the short recess&#151;I trust that yours
was good&#151;I was making a strong defence of the election by thirds
system. I wish to place on record my thanks to those who produce the
<i class="I">Official Report</i> of the Committee&#146;s proceedings. I
recalled that at the end of the previous sitting I was stopped
mid-sentence and, after many sleepless nights trying to remember where
I was in mid-sentence, I read with pleasure that my statement finished
with a full stop. I am happy for that to remain
so.</div>
					<a name="07022056000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike in
Tameside, where there has been a long period of Labour control, and
even in neighbouring Stockport, where, although the council currently
has a Liberal Democrat majority, it is more the norm for no party to be
in control, the system of thirds allows the officers to plan ahead. If
it looks as though the parties in control are likely to change at an
election, they can open up discussions with the opposition party or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 218</div>parties that are likely to take control after the election to talk about
manifesto commitments, priorities and budgetary issues. It is clearly a
system that is tried and tested, and one that works.</div>
					<a name="07022056000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge that, because
most of my local political experience has been of annual elections by
thirds, I am biased. I understand that councillors and Members of
Parliament from areas that use an all-out system often hold similarly
strong views about that system in the opposite direction from mine.
That is the real issue, because there is no wrong or right way in which
to elect councillors. Thirds is right for my area; others believe that
all-out elections are right for their area. When people believe that
the system is wrong for their area, why should they not be able to put
their case and, after careful consideration and a council resolution,
change it? That is what this part of the Bill will do and why I support
it.</div>
					<a name="07022056000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, why must
it be a one-way process? If it is okay for councils to move away from
elections by thirds to all-out elections, why can they not move the
other way? If a metropolitan borough, such as Stockport or Tameside,
can move to all-out elections, why should not a London borough move
from all-out elections to elections by thirds if it wants to? That it
cannot is the source of my objection to the provision. I agree with my
hon. Friend the Member for Wigan that if, after an acceptable period
such as eight or 12 years, perhaps more, the new system has failed to
bed down, why should a council after careful consideration and a
further resolution not be able to go back to the previous system? The
would be real devolution and real letting go, which is what I hope we
achieve through the Bill. I hope that the Minister will respond
positively to my
suggestions.</div>
					<a name="07022056000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that, I urge the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, a fellow Stockport MP, to
withdraw his amendments so that we can return later to the issue, with
renewed vigour if
necessary.</div>
					
					<a name="07022056000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022056000383"></a>
							<b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): I rise to continue the
Back-Bench rebellion that has been swirling for more than 12 days and
almost 15 minutes. I have 10 years&#146; experience in local
government at all three levels: four years as a parish councillors, two
as a district councillor and four as a county councillor. Like my hon.
Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, I have experience of both
election by thirds and all-out elections.</div>
					<a name="07022056000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not advocate that a
county council move to thirds because it would mean large multi-member
constituencies and, in any case, county wards are so big that they do
not equate to community boundaries; they are bigger. However, at
district level, I have had experience of both systems and I favour
elections by thirds. In Stroud district council, of which I was a
member for two years, that does not necessarily mean that each ward has
to be a three-member ward. It just means that a third of the
councillors, including one in each three-member ward or none in the
single or double member wards is elected each
year.</div>
					<a name="07022056000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said, voting by thirds means
that there will be no catastrophic change, leading to long-term
planning not being possible. It means that there is constant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 219</div>public scrutiny and annual accountability. When there is a problem with
a hung council, which is not always a problem, it can be resolved by
the electorate within 12 months. Voting by thirds means that the
parties have to find fewer candidates and that fighting elections costs
less, although over the cycle the costs would be considerably greater.
Although the turnout in any particular year can be shown to be smaller
for elections by thirds than all-out elections, the turnout over the
four-year cycle is considerably greater. Many people take the
opportunity to vote more than once in the four-year period, and many
more people have the opportunity to cast a vote.</div>
					<a name="07022056000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not arguing that thirds is
always the answer or that it should be the aspiration, but as others
have said, it should be an option. Councils have the option to choose
one method or the other and to change from one to the other, but very
few councils take that opportunity. Therefore, to make it implicit in
the Bill that a change in one direction is favoured over a change in
the other&#151;that one direction is right and the other is
wrong&#151;is almost to address a problem that does not exist. In any
case, it does not address the question of a local council having the
ability to decide. The unfortunate impression given by clause 31 is
that it will make the process a one-way street. I therefore hope that
the Minister will remove it. A former Secretary of State with
responsibility for local government, Nicholas Ridley, who was for a
time my Member of Parliament, described one-way streets as an
infringement of civil rights. He may have chosen the wrong target for
that comment&#151;he was Transport Secretary at the time, I believe.
However, in the Bill, a one-way street should not be the only way for
councils to go when considering their electoral arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07022056000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The downside of elections by
thirds is that they are more expensive for councils to run. They eat up
the time of officers because of the need to have elections in three
years out of every four. It means that councillors need to have one eye
on the electorate the whole time, not only during elections. Council
tax has to be set bearing in mind electoral consequences every year,
not once every four years. There are many reasons why councils should
avoid voting by thirds, but they are not particularly good reasons.
Paradoxically, the effect of passing the Bill as it stands could be
that fewer councils will move to all-out elections, because they will
not want to take the irrevocable step of moving in that direction. I do
not think that there should be an implicit bias one way or the other;
there should be a choice.</div>
					<a name="07022056000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, all-out election
clearly fits the model of an elected mayor rather better than election
by thirds. However, the tail should not be wagging the dog. We need to
look at a wider range of models of executive accountability, a matter
that we will come to later. As my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and
Reddish said, some members of the committee form a little cluster:
Denton and Reddish, Hazel Grove, and High Peak. I hope that the fourth
member of the cluster, our neighbour the Minister, will join us.
However, I hope that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove will withdraw his
amendment and allow the Government time to take into account the view
of both the Committee and of those who participated in the previous
scrutiny process.

							<b class="B">Sir
Peter Soulsby</b> (Leicester, South) (Lab): There is clearly
considerable enthusiasm on the Labour Back Benches for amendments Nos.
94 and 95. Like other hon. Members, I am sympathetic to the
Government&#146;s desire to see effective and stable leadership in
local government. That wish, which is clearly reflected in the Bill, is
to ensure that local councils engage with their communities and
electorates. If there were overwhelming evidence that effective
leadership and engagement with local communities could be significantly
enhanced by holding whole-council elections, I would support such
elections and welcome a move by the Government to ensure that they were
universal. However, there is no evidence that that leadership and that
engagement are achieved by the mechanism of whole-council elections;
therefore the Government are not proposing that that system should be
universal.</div>
					<a name="07022056000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like a
number of other hon. Members, I have served on councils that have had
whole-council elections and on those that have had elections by thirds,
and the experience is very mixed. In some circumstances, election by
thirds produces effective leadership and engagement with local
communities. In other circumstances, whole-council elections produce
the same results. Sometimes, the reverse applies: I have seen areas
that use elections by thirds in which councils have been out of touch
with the electorate and community, and areas that use whole-council
elections in which local communities have had little engagement with
their local councils.</div>
					<a name="07022056000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can understand why, in many
areas, local party activists prefer whole-council elections. I have
heard it argued quite powerfully in a council that is not unknown to me
and in which, against my judgment and my wishes, a choice was made of
election for the whole council. There is no evidence that that
accomplished anything other than a quiet life for party activists for a
couple of years, or that it in any way enhanced the quality of the
council&#146;s leadership or the engagement of local people with that
council.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000389"></a>Sir
Peter Soulsby:
						</b> I suspect that we all have party
inactivists as well as activists, and sometimes all parties feel that
the inactivists are in the majority.</div>
					<a name="07022056000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Very briefly, my argument, like
that of other Back-Bench Members, is that if it is possible to move
only in one direction&#151;from elections by thirds to whole-council
elections&#151;I suspect that, perversely, it will make councils less
likely to want to experiment. Knowing that there is no way back will
make them reluctant to move towards whole-council elections rather than
willing to grasp the idea on an experimental basis.</div>
					<a name="07022056000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to ensure that
councils that choose to make such a change are not able to do so at
short 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 221</div>intervals, or in ways that are difficult for a local electorate to
understand or that are confusing for the administration of the
authority. It is important, of course, to prevent rapid reversals of
direction, but it is also important to allow reversals of
direction.</div>
					<a name="07022056000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">My firm
view is that it is not the pattern of elections that is the determining
factor in either public engagement or in effective leadership. There
are different circumstances in different local authorities. For that
reason, I hope that it will not be necessary to press the amendment to
a vote and that the Government will listen and agree with the
overwhelming view that is being expressed from both sides of the
Committee that the matter is one for local discretion taking local
circumstances into consideration, and that it should be left to the
local councils
involved.</div>

							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I had not intended
to intervene in the discussion, but there has not been such an uprising
in the midlands since the pilgrimage of grace and as a southerner I
could not resist the temptation to encourage it a little and see
whether Labour Members would march to the gates of London and what
response they would get from Ministers. I believe that on the previous
occasion the gates were locked against the pilgrims. I hope that they
will not be on this occasion, because the points that have been made
are valid.</div>
					<a name="07022056000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
experience, like yours, Mr. Chope, is as a member of a
London borough council. I spent 16 years in a system of all-out
elections every four years. On the other hand, my wife has served as a
member of a unitary council elected by thirds. Working out who should
canvass for whom, where and at what time has been a matter of domestic
interest to us. She has not persuaded me any more than I have persuaded
her. I remain of the view that there is considerable merit in the
four-year cycle that we have in the London boroughs, ironically because
it permits long-term planning and enables a new administration to know
that it has a four-year run and officers to know where they stand. A
few years ago, when my party lost control of the London borough of
Bexley by one seat despite getting a majority of the popular vote, I
was briefly almost converted to elections by thirds, but as we gained
23 seats last May, all was put right in the
end.</div>
					<a name="07022056000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key test is
this: if we are serious about devolution, the decision ought to be for
a local authority to take. I take the point that that is true whether
an authority is a London borough or a district. The hon. Member for
High Peak made a valid point about the linkage with mayoral systems. In
the London boroughs we have a certain number of directly elected mayors
and it is clearly much easier in those circumstances to have all-out
elections coinciding with mayoral elections. I certainly do not
advocate electing the London assembly by thirds, although it might be
an interesting idea. It should surely be a matter for a local authority
to determine.</div>
					<a name="07022056000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
interested in the discussion about the effect of using thirds instead
of all-out elections on turnout and engagement. I am inclined to agree
that, by and large, that is not the determining factor. My hon. Friends
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 222</div>I will argue that other parts of the Bill miss opportunities to take
measures that would enhance turnout, but the real disincentive to
people to turn out to vote in elections is frequently the thought that
it will not make any difference because local authorities themselves
have very little discretionary power to make a difference. Enhancing
local authorities&#146; freedom of action would undoubtedly be the
greatest means of incentivising people to turn out to vote, and we have
not gone as far as we would like in that respect. However, the
electoral cycle is not the main determinant of
turnout.</div>
					<a name="07022056000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
sympathy with the Labour Members who have spoken on the point that the
clause is a classic one-way street. That cannot be right and I cannot
see any intellectual justification for it. If it is right to move in
one direction and if we believe that local authorities should as far as
possible have the power to determine their own administrative
arrangements, then surely to goodness it should be possible for them to
move in the other direction. I would argue against the London borough
of Bromley, for instance, moving in that opposite direction, but it
ought to have the right to do so. That is the key thing.</div>
					<a name="07022056000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we expect local authorities
to behave in a grown-up way, we must treat them as grown-ups and give
them the opportunity to come a reasoned decision to fit their own
circumstances. I have so far heard nothing to justify the provision, so
I hope that the midlands uprising succeeds in securing a localist and
devolutionary measure. I know the Minister to be a fair-minded man who
will take on board the points
made.</div>

							<b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): Thank you for my earlier temporary
knighthood, Mr. Chope. I do not believe that it was awarded
for being part of what my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak
described as a rebellion, nor for being part of an uprising, as the
hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst suggested it was. This is not
about uprisings and rebellions; it is about intelligent, thoughtful,
decisive, constructive, helpful contributions to the parliamentary
process. Our motivation is to improve the Bill and to strengthen local
government. We want to do it from the point of view of some experience,
much of it outside London, and from having seen some of the measures in
practice on the ground for a number of years.</div>
					<a name="07022056000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that others could add
to this debate by describing their likes and dislikes. The area that I
come from has had elections by thirds since the mid-&#146;80s. I
should mention that that is Bedford; I want to get the words
&#147;Bedford&#148; and &#147;Bedfordshire&#148; on the record.
I was a Bedfordshire county councillor when the county 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 223</div>had all-out elections every four years, alongside a district that had
elections by thirds. The two went together well. The Bedford borough
elections led to an increase in activity. There were elections every
year in that area, with county elections one year and three years of
borough elections. That led to a lot more contact with the electorate.
It also meant a lot more work, but those of us who are involved in
local democracy sometimes enjoy doing that, believe it or
not.</div>
					
					<a name="07022056000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022056000394"></a>
							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): One of the
consequences of the increased activity and interest in elections in
Bedfordshire has been the support for an elected mayor and the process
of electing a mayor. What does the hon. Gentleman think contributed to
that? Was it a failure of the major, best known parties in the
processes that he has described, or was it something else? What turned
off the people of Bedford borough in such a way as to lead to the
creation of an elected, independent mayor?</div>
					
					<a name="07022056000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000395"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman knows the answer to his own
question. I was very much involved in those matters. Before he came to
Bedfordshire and became the Member of Parliament for North-East
Bedfordshire, particular circumstances applied to Bedford borough; I
could go into in some detail, but will not do so as it would not be
appropriate. However, the argument is not about what happens in one
particular place. There are reasons for having an elected mayor in
Bedford. Colleagues have questioned whether having an elected mayor on
a four-year term runs alongside having elections by thirds; I believe
that in Bedford we have an example that shows that it does.
</div>
					<a name="07022056000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
was possibly alluding to strong leadership. I had concerns about the
leadership of Bedford borough council, but that was due to
personalities rather than the electoral system. It is important to
remember that whatever system we have, whether all-out or by thirds,
councillors are elected for four years. The question of whether we have
a person in a stable position who is able to lead is therefore not
necessarily determined by whether the system is elections by thirds or
all-out.</div>
					<a name="07022056000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ground
has been quite well covered by the debate so far. It does not come down
to whether anyone here likes or dislikes a system of all-out or by
thirds; what is important is devolution, local choice and local
councillors and people deciding the best way to run local affairs in
their area. The one-way street does not fit with that. There is no
doubt that that is the wrong approach. It is not devolution, and I hope
that Ministers will reflect upon that, although I understand that they
might not be able to do so on the spot today. I therefore add my plea
to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove to await Report, as I shall, and not
press his amendment to a Division, in the hope that we can make some
progress on the matter, which would be in the interests of local
government.</div>
					
					<a name="07022056000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000396"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> I thank all hon. Gentlemen for their comments on
the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak described
himself as part of a Back-Bench rebellion, which the hon. Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst was anxious to join. My hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 224</div>Friend the Member for Bedford made the point that it is important that
in Committee we scrutinise everything that comes before us, which the
Committee has done quite admirably in this debate. Indeed, almost a
third of the Committee has spoken on the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07022056000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have listened carefully to
all the arguments made in the debate and it is clear from the
contributions that there is a real commitment in the Committee to
ensuring that there is strong leadership in local government. The hon.
Member for Hazel Grove based most of his comments on the need to be
truly democratic, as he put it, so that local councils alone can decide
these matters. My hon. Friends the Members for Wigan, for Leicester
South, for Denton and Reddish and for High Peak also raised the issue
of ensuring strong leadership in local government. We are seeking to
achieve both those aims in the clause.</div>
					<a name="07022056000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, there are members of
the Committee with considerable experience of local councils. I have
eight years of experience in Essex&#151;I must mention Essex, as it
has not been mentioned yet, and we are touring the nation and I am the
House of Commons&#146; honorary Essex girl. Because of their great
experience of local government, we ought to take note of the arguments
made by members of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07022056000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government consider that
there are strong arguments that whole-council elections bring benefits
to councils and communities, creating greater accountability and
clarity for electors, and that such elections have the potential to
strengthen the democratic process. As I made clear to the hon. Member
for Hazel Grove during the evidence sessions, the Government preference
is for whole-council elections. However, as has been said in the debate
today, it is not that straightforward. It may help the Committee if I
describe the broader context, it is quite complex.</div>
					<a name="07022056000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current position is that
all county councils and London boroughs have whole-council elections.
In addition, all parish councils are required to have whole-council
elections. Shire district councils may request either whole-council
elections or partial elections, and 63 per cent. of districts have
whole-council elections. They may change their electoral cycle by
asking the Secretary of State to make an order. All metropolitan
districts have elections by thirds. That is clear,
then.</div>
					<a name="07022056000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
widely recognised for a considerable time that there is quite a
mish-mash of electoral arrangements, which can be confusing for
electors. It could be said that it is just an accident of history that
we have different arrangements for different councils. That was why the
Government invited the independent Electoral Commission to address
those issues in January 2003. The Electoral Commission responded a year
later, stating that whole-council elections would increase
participation and bring clearer accountability. The Government said
that they were minded to agree with the principal recommendation, which
was to move to whole-council elections for English councils. In the
2005 general election manifesto, we stated that</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 225</div>
					<a name="07022056000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the case for simplifying the
current local government election cycle by moving towards &#145;whole
council&#146; elections every four
years&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022056000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">would be examined.
That is what we have done, and that is what has been discussed in the
Committee today and in the previous sitting. That is the background for
adopting the approach that is outlined in the White Paper and the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07022056000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000397"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> With regard to possible confusion about councils and
council elections, certainly that confusion would arise in all two-tier
areas. Living in a two-tier local government area, I find that the
public do not care so much which council is responsible for which
service, nor what type of election it is; it is just seen as
&#147;local government&#148;, and that there is an election. The
only way to resolve that matter is to move to unitaries, which is not
the subject of the debate. I think that the confusion will always arise
in two-tier areas, regardless of whether the election is by thirds or
all-out.</div>

one particular year during the elections in the three consecutive years

four-year cycle, the number of people who vote at least once in local
elections is greater under the system of voting by thirds than it is
under all-out
elections.</div>

my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak makes his claims, and the issue
may be something that he will want to take up with the Electoral
Commission.</div>
					<a name="07022056000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms
of what was in the White Paper and what was put forward in the Bill,
first, as the Committee acknowledges, more discussion has taken place
about measures that are designed to be devolutionary, giving power back
to local authorities. We are devolving the decisions on this matter to
local authorities. That is generally welcomed by members of the
Committee. It would be for a local authority, not the Government, to
decide whether to move to whole-council elections. The process for
changing the electoral cycle should be a matter for local authorities
alone to decide; it is a fundamental principle of the Bill
that that is not a matter for the Secretary of State to
decide.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 226</div>
					<a name="07022056000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The initial approach reflected
the substance of the Electoral Commission&#146;s recommendations for
whole-council elections. The Electoral Commission&#146;s 2004 report
stated
that</div>
					<a name="07022056000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whole-council
elections every four years can provide a degree of inherent stability.
Whole-council elections give a clear mandate to representatives for a
programme of policies during the following four years, and allow time
for an administration to carry through its policies. At the end of the
four-year period the administration is held to account by the
electorate and can be judged by its record, its success or
failure.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022056000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission&#146;s findings led to our debate and to the
Government&#146;s proposals. The Government consider that
whole-council elections can create the best framework to support and
promote strong and accountable leadership if powers and
responsibilities are to be devolved to local councils.</div>
					<a name="07022056000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding the benefits,
the Government recognise that in particular places, the pattern of
local government elections can reflect long-held traditions valued by
hon. Members. My hon. Friends the Members for Leicester, South, for
Wigan, for Denton and Reddish, for High Peak and for Bedford and the
hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made the point that strong
leadership does not depend necessarily on the electoral cycles of a
local authority. It is not automatically the case that election by
thirds creates weak leadership or failing councils. Many successful
councils elected by thirds have strong
leadership.</div>
					<a name="07022056000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Electoral Commission recently stated that it would have preferred the
Government to be more prescriptive and to legislate for all councils to
move to whole-council elections with no local choice. I have made it
clear that we accept the case for participation and accountability, but
we have decided that local councils that elect by thirds should move to
all-out elections only if they choose to do so.</div>
					<a name="07022056000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">We conclude that there should
be a devolved process to allow councils, including metropolitan
authorities, to move if they choose from partial to whole-council
elections, but the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove
would also allow county councils and London boroughs to move to partial
elections, which is something not currently available to them. Our
proposals will allow councils elected by thirds to move to
whole-council elections, and our debate today has considered giving
those councils the option to move either
way.</div>
					<a name="07022056000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall reflect
on the comments made by hon. Members. The issues are quite complex. For
example, if the amendment of the hon. Member for Hazel Grove were
accepted and county councils that hold whole-council elections chose to
move to thirds, that would have an impact on the electoral cycle of
district councils in those areas. Also, because county councils are
based on single-member wards, it would create some difficulty in
organisation.</div>
					<a name="07022056000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, I have difficulty accepting the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment. However, taking into account the debate as a whole, a strong
case has been made for the Government to reflect on the issue. I do not
think that there is a case for rebellion on the part of my hon. Friend
the Member for High Peak. I welcome the discussion. It has brought
clarity and new thinking to the issue.</div>

on the Bill, and I welcome the tone in which she has presented her and
the Government&#146;s views to the Committee. I hope that the

It has been extremely
helpful.</div>
					<a name="07022056000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I thank
colleagues on both sides of the Committee for their contributions? I do
not think that there has been a hostile word so far against the
amendments that I tabled, other than the Under-Secretary&#146;s view
that they should probably not apply to county councils. That is clearly
a matter for further discussion. In the light of what she said, I shall
not go into some of the detailed responses that I might have done, but
I would like to thank the hon. Members for Wigan, for Denton and
Reddish, for High Peak, for Leicester, South, and for Bedford, all of
whom indicated their view that the Government should go one step
further with the clause. It was never any part of the argument that<i class="I">
</i>I deployed that there was anything wrong with what was in the
clause, but it is what is not in it that is wrong. If the Government
are prepared to look at how the matter can be made a process that will
work in the opposite sense and will come back and consider that in due
course, that will be a major step forward.</div>
					<a name="07022056000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was particularly struck by
two of the arguments that I heard. The first was deployed at our
previous sitting by the hon. Member for Wigan, who said that probably
the most powerful argument that the Government will ever hear is that
this is not a matter of great moment for the tabloids and that the
Government do not need to fear the press reaction. Knowing how
important that consideration is for the Government when they conduct
their business, I hope that that powerful argument will strike
home.</div>
					<a name="07022056000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that it
also clearly came through from hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee&#151;which is blessed with having people with a wide range
of experience in local government&#151;that nobody could point to any
evidence that going in one direction only would lead to a benefit in
terms of leadership, policy development or participation by the public.
The arguments are finely balanced and I was pleased to hear what the
Under-Secretary said. In the light of that, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendments.</div>

						<a name="07022056000406"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): Having debated the issue
generally, I would like to consider the specifics of the mechanism
under clause 32. Many local authorities do not have a political
majority: sometimes there are coalitions; sometimes there are ad hoc
arrangements; and sometimes there are formal arrangements for running
the authority. Decision making can change quite quickly, particularly
if people fall out, as has been known in local government.</div>
					<a name="07022056000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, in local government,
at any one time, there are vacancies. If one looks at the list of
pending vacancies for local government, sometimes there are 30 to 50
seats across the country that are not filled at any one time. Even
occasionally, when there are all-up elections, there are one or two
vacancies per council.</div>
					<a name="07022056000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, there are changes of
representation in wards as a result of by-elections and vacancies, and
there are also defections. The clause
says:</div>
					<a name="07022056000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
resolution of the council may reverse the effect of this
section&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07022056000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">but my point is
that there may be a situation in which, having passed a resolution in
the permitted period, the political control of the council changes
within a matter of weeks, and the council&#146;s opinion may change.
A coalition, perhaps involving independents, may change, and the view
of those who are responsible for running the council may change after
by-elections and defections. Many votes go through in local authorities
on casting votes of chairmen or mayors. Are we saying that when a vote
to change the electoral arrangements goes through on the casting vote
of the mayor and when two vacancies then return two members from a
different political party and that changes the view of the council, the
council cannot change a resolution once it has been passed?
Essentially, a decision could be taken without the express wish of
every member of the council because there may be one or two vacancies,
or filling those vacancies may lead to a change in the political
complexion.</div>
					<a name="07022056000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want to labour the point, but things change in local government. I have
been on hung authorities when one committee has voted in the opposite
way to another and it is total chaos. I therefore seek the
Under-Secretary&#146;s reassurance. Will guidance be given? Will
there be any rules or will it be purely a matter for the council and
the chairman&#146;s casting vote? If the leadership of the council
changes in the period concerned, will the new leader have any means of
changing the resolution? At what point does the decision become
irreversible? Is it on the council&#146;s vote, or after the
Electoral Commission has nodded to it? I appreciate that if political
parties have different views about the electoral benefits of a change,
which I suspect they may do in different circumstances, it may be a
matter of political discussion and disagreement.</div>
					<a name="07022056000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some councils have run
successfully for years with a majority of one and a casting vote. On
such a finely balanced council I am worried that an irreversible
decision could be taken, but a few weeks later there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 229</div>may be a very different majority able to take a completely different
decision on this very important issue. I should be interested to hear
the Under-Secretary&#146;s views on the
subject.</div>

							<a name="07022056000407"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the
clarity with which he expressed his views while seeking enlightenment.
I will say something about the clause and then respond to his
comments.</div>
					<a name="07022056000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
enables an eligible council&#151;that is, a district that currently
holds elections by halves or thirds&#151;to move to whole-council
elections. As I said, we will reflect on the amendment proposed by the
hon. Member for Hazel Grove. If a council wishes to make such a change,
it must do so in a specified period, because the date of whole-council
elections, as set out in clause 33, is different for metropolitan
authorities and shire districts. It is 2008 for metropolitan districts
and 2011 for shire districts. The specified period will run from 1
October to 31 December in the year before the elections are due and
will ensure that, to stabilise existing arrangements, members of the
public know about the change in good time but not too long before the
first whole-council
election.</div>
					<a name="07022056000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
also enables the Secretary of State to extend the periods during which
a resolution can be made, but we envisage doing so only in very limited
circumstances, perhaps to give a council a bit of extra time and the
flexibility to consider the proposals properly. The clause allows
councils to hold council elections if they wish to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07022056000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point made
by the hon. Member for Poole, there is a difficulty in hung, or finely
balanced councils, but they still have to make decisions on their
budget, which stands for a year. They have to stand by their decisions
in the same way as other councils. We have to accept the decision of
the electorate in choosing the council, and the decisions that that
council produces. When a council has taken a vote and made a
resolution, it will inform the Electoral Commission, but the commission
has no role in ratifying the decision, which is taken by the local
council. The council may want to consult and to have wide-ranging
discussions on the best way forward, but the council&#146;s decision,
as in many other issues, is binding.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000409"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> I should like to have a little canter around the
issue of metropolitan districts and councillors per ward. When I first
stood as a district councillor the ward had about 1,600 electors. The
number of electors for a county councillor was about 8,000. When I
fought a parliamentary seat in the midlands the ward populations 12,000
or 14,000. The average for Birmingham is about 18,000 to 20,000. Most
metropolitan districts have three councillors, elected in one thirds,
and they have very large wards.</div>
					<a name="07022056000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 37 allows additional
councillors&#151;a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, a seventh or an eighth,
the number is not specified. Presumably that means larger wards.
Alternatively, does it mean the same size wards but a larger council?
If there are 60 members and it goes to six members per ward there will
be 120 councillors. That has both cost and governance implications. If
one opts to have more councillors per ward but to keep the same number
on a particular metropolitan authority, it means larger
wards.</div>
					<a name="07022056000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
difficulties with our system is delivering literature in a very large
ward. I am sure that we all delivered to wards because no one else will
do it. We have almost killed ourselves by spending every waking hour
doing so. If the impact of clause 37 is to give us larger metropolitan
wards, I cannot see how it will improve general governance. There will
more councillors, larger wards and a bigger division between those at
the top and the bottom. I hope that the Under-Secretary can explain
exactly what the Government have in mind. With three-member wards,
elected on thirds, if one goes to more members in the authority there
could be two members standing for election. We need rather more of an
explanation. That is why we tabled new clause 5, which contains
proposals for a referendum so that there would be some check and some
debate on any increase in the number of
councillors.</div>
					<a name="07022056000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
are also questions of gerrymandering, which, of course, was named after
Governor Gerry of Massachusetts. Giving an extra representative to a
particular ward may have a political significance, as can having odd or
even numbers representing a ward. When southern Ireland went on to an
single transferable vote system, initially after independence, some of
the wards were sevens, nines or 11s, which meant that the quota for
winning was quite low. As the parties got control of the system the
size of seats came down to threes and fives, which benefited the larger
party under the Irish system. Clearly, under a metropolitan system, if
one starts to add representatives to wards under a particular formula,
unless it is totally within an electoral quota, it could 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 231</div>also have an impact. I should therefore like some reassurance from the
Under-Secretary about how the extras will be
added.</div>
					<a name="07022056000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
parliamentary boundary commission system one, cannot add on the basis
of projected growth. There is a base year when seats are determined and
as the review moves forward there is some scope for arguments about
change. However, in local government changes in growth in a ward may be
taken into account. That is the one difference between the two systems.
If districts can change the number of representatives per metropolitan
ward simply by predicting that there will be a new housing estate in a
ward and so extra representatives will be needed, it may have a
political implication. That is why I want to have a little run around
this clause.</div>
					<a name="07022056000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that the Under-Secretary can reassure me that all this is total
nonsense. However, I do think that changing the numbers, we will have
an impact on councils, ward sizes and, particularly if done on a
predictive basis, on the political
battleground.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000410"></a>Andrew
Gwynne:
						</b> Based on local knowledge, I think that the
proposal is the correct one. My constituency has two local authorities,
and one of them&#151;in Tameside&#151;was formed in 1974 when nine
very independent towns came together. To this day, they remain very
independent. Those towns are: the urban districts of Audenshaw, Denton,
Droylsden and Longdendale, and the municipal boroughs of Ashton,
Dukinfield, Hyde, Stalybridge and Mossley. When the borough was
created, it was divided into 18 wards reflecting those towns. To a
lesser extent today, those wards still reflect the townships of
Tameside. Things got complicated in 1980, however, when an extra ward
was given to the borough. Parts of the old boroughs of Dukinfield and
Stalybridge were cobbled together into a new ward called Dukinfield
Stalybridge ward, which confuses matters greatly because we also have
the wards of Stalybridge North, Stalybridge South and
Dukinfield.</div>
					<a name="07022056000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
in 2004, following the most recent boundary changes, the ward of
Audenshaw, which had 10,000 electors, and the ward of St.
Peter&#146;s, which had 7,000 electors, had their boundaries altered
because the average number of electors in each ward in Tameside was
8,000. To the great dismay of electors in Audenshaw&#151;admittedly,
a very small number&#151;who are proud of their Audwinian roots, they
were moved in to an Ashton ward, with which they have nothing in
common. So, first, they were moved in to the ward of Ashton St.
Peter&#146;s, and then, at the next election, in to the
Ashton-under-Lyne parliamentary constituency, despite the fact that
their area of Audenshaw has been in the Denton and Reddish constituency
since it was created in 1983, and in the same parliamentary
constituency as Denton in every election since 1916, I
think.</div>
					<a name="07022056000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some wards in
Tameside no longer reflect the township boundaries. For example,
Dukinfield is divided between the wards of Dukinfield and Dukinfield
Stalybridge. Dukinfield ward is in the Denton and Reddish constituency
and Dukinfield Stalybridge ward is in that of Stalybridge and Hyde. At
the next election, Audenshaw will be divided in part between Denton and
Reddish and Ashton-under-Lyne
constituencies.</div>

					<a name="07022056000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that the Bill is trying to achieve greater clarity and reflection so
that wards mirror communities better. The building blocks of wards in
metropolitan areas such as Tameside must have 8,000 electors, plus or
minus. As I understand it, it would be possible for the Dukinfield ward
to cover the whole of Dukinfield, perhaps with five instead of three
members. Audenshaw ward could also reflect the whole of Audenshaw with
four members instead of three. We might also have a smaller Ashton St.
Peter&#146;s ward with two members instead of three. In that case, we
could better reflect the communities with which people identify, rather
than create wards based on towns to which they do not belong. If the
Minister can clarify that that is the intention of this part of the
Bill, I give it my wholehearted
support.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>As a southerner, I never knew that I
would learn so much from the Committee about the north. I am very
grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish and
others. For a new Member, he has an encyclopaedic knowledge of his
constituency, which he has put to good use in the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07022056000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
grateful to the hon. Member for Poole for explaining what he intends by
his new clause, which is, I think, probing. The new clause would do the
opposite of what he wants it to, and the Government oppose it in the
strongest terms. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not mean
it&#151;his party, like ours, is wedded to democracy&#151;but the
new clause would allow a council to ride roughshod over the principle
of equality in elections. Under the new clause, the controlling party
on a council could increase the number of councillors in a particular
ward simply by holding a referendum of its supporters and members in
that ward, and thereby increase that ward&#146;s representation on
the local council. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Gentleman
intended, although I am grateful for his comments. He will not be
surprised that the Electoral Commission opposes the new clause, which,
it claims,</div>
					<a name="07022056000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;risks
undermining the established process of electoral reviews and the
principle of equality of representation across a local
authority.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022056000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to what I think that the hon. Gentleman intended by his new
clause. I am sorry that, having been so helpful on previous
clauses&#151;offering to take ideas away and reflect further&#151;I
cannot do so in respect of new clause 5. I think that the hon.
Gentleman intends to provide for local authorities to increase the
membership of wards by a consistent number, by multiplying the number
of councillors across all an authority&#146;s wards. If that were so,
there would not be the problems that I have mentioned of electoral
equality. However, decisions about wards and other such questions
should be taken by an independent body, not by local authorities, even
if they have the approval of the electorate. The independent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 233</div>Electoral Commission and the boundary committee for England are
currently responsible for electoral reviews. It is through such
electoral reviews that the number of councillors per electoral
area&#151;in district wards and county divisions, even though there
is no reference to divisions in the new clause&#151;and the
boundaries and names of electoral areas can be changed.</div>
					<a name="07022056000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the Committee that
clause 38 will allow local authorities to change the names of electoral
areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish might wish to
take that point into account if clause 38 is agreed
to.</div>
					<a name="07022056000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The total number
of councillors on an authority may be changed under electoral reviews.
The boundary committee will have to consider carefully the ability of
the authority to provide convenient and effective local government
under any council size. Allowing the local authority to change the
number of councillors in a ward would also change the number of
councillors on the authority as a whole, with no regard to the impact
that such a change would have on the council&#146;s ability to
provide services to local people. The new clause would also mean that
the total number of councillors for an area could be changed against
the wishes of the electors across the local authority area as a
whole.</div>
					<a name="07022056000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Poole was particularly concerned about whether the clause would
mean larger wards. No ward in England currently has more than three
members per ward: some have one, some have two and others have three.
The Electoral Commission&#146;s view is that having more than three
members in a ward would dilute accountability and affect relations
between electors and councillors. Clause 37 will allow flexibility to
recommend one and two-member wards. A number of Committee members will
already have a mixture of two and three-member wards in their
constituencies. The clause does not necessarily mean that councils will
be larger, but there could be smaller wards and fewer councillors per
ward. That decision will be for the Electoral Commission to make, in
consultation with the local
authority.</div>
					<a name="07022056000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish was right to say that the
clause would remove the existing inflexibility and allow the Electoral
Commission to better reflect communities. I think that his point is
sound. If communities feel disengaged from their wards, they are less
likely to vote. We want increasing participation and we want the
electors to feel part of their wards and part of the community. At same
time, we want to provide equality of
representation.</div>
					<a name="07022056000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that there is a strong role for independent bodies to play.
Although we are, throughout the Bill, looking to devolve decisions to
local government, in this case it is right that an electoral body makes
decisions in consultation with a local authority to remove the concerns
that the hon. Member for Poole mentioned about gerrymandering. The
right way to do that is for local authorities to seek a review from the
independent Electoral Commission. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
his
amendment.</div>

Syms:
						</b> This has been a useful debate. The hon. Member for
Denton and Reddish mentioned a perfect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 234</div>example of why the clause was relevant to his borough. Despite the
construction of many boroughs 30 or 40 years ago there are still lots
of local loyalties beneath the borough level. I am glad that the
Under-Secretary mentioned size decreases rather than increases, because
I would be concerned about the idea of a four-member ward. If an area
felt itself to have certain loyalties, it would be a better idea to
split it into two two-member wards than to add a ward with three
members and a bit to somewhere six miles away. If that is the idea
behind the Bill, fine. That would also inevitably reduce the size of
some very large wards, which would improve matters.</div>

							<a name="07022056000417"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> Names are quite often important in politics, not
least because there is usually a degree of history behind them. Wards
are sometimes named after ancient parishes despite having been overcome
by large housing estates. Nevertheless, I am nervous about changing
names, because sometimes they can indicate also whether a seat is
marginal, and a change of name can have an impact on that. Dare I say
that the name &#147;Basildon&#148; has on occasion been totemic in
people&#146;s
perceptions?</div>
					<a name="07022056000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I took
over a local authority and worked out that it contained five marginal
wards, the first thing that I would do would be to change all five
names, because that might convey a different view of whether some of
the wards were safe or marginal. Names are quite important in political
competition. People who live in a constituency with a particular name
may know that at a certain time it might not be marginal but that over
many years it might become so. For that reason I am nervous about
giving local authorities the right to change names of wards essentially
at will, and without reference to anybody else. Subsection (3) says
that that cannot
happen</div>
					<a name="07022056000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the
name of an electoral area is
protected&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07022056000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">but will the
Minister say what that means? I prefer to stick to names, so that
people cannot change them at will until an overall boundary
review.</div>

							<a name="07022056000418"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
contribution. I accept that names are important&#151;that is the
reason why the clause has been
proposed.</div>
					<a name="07022056000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may have
to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, because after the next general
election the constituency of Basildon will be no more&#151;it will
become South Basildon and East Thurrock, and will be divided in two. So
totemic election-night tears and joy around the country will be lost,
although I am sure that another constituency will take on
Basildon&#146;s
mantle.</div>
					<a name="07022056000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can give the
hon. Gentleman some reassurance, however. Currently, the names of
electoral areas&#151;county divisions and wards in district
councils&#151;can be changed only on an electoral review by the
Electoral Commission&#146;s boundary committee. However, local
authorities can change the names of their areas. They can change the
name of the council, but not of wards, under section 74 of the Local
Government Act 1972. That Act allows a district or county council to
change its name by a resolution passed by two thirds of council members
at a specially convened meeting of the council. That a local authority
can resolve to change the name of its area but not of its wards seems
to us a little daft. It can also change names of parishes, but not
wards, if a parish council requests it. We believe that local
authorities should be able to change the names of their
wards.</div>
					<a name="07022056000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point
to consider is that there is no set timetable for when the electoral
review takes place. Reviews can be between 10 and 15 years apart in
some areas, which can result in the names of district wards or county
divisions being out of step with real-world conditions. For example, a
new development built in a ward may mean that the ward would be better
identified by including the new settlement in its
name.</div>
					<a name="07022056000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be
occasions when a local authority wishes to resolve issues arising from
a ward name with which a community can no longer identify. In such a
case the clause will allow a county council, district council or London
borough council to change the name of the electoral area concerned. Any
change would need to be agreed by the full council, which would need to
pass a resolution at a special meeting held for the purpose. The
council would then have to inform interested bodies including the
Electoral Commission, the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance
Survey.</div>
					<a name="07022056000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
considering the clause in connection with the previous clause. We are
trying to ensure that local authority and ward boundaries reflect the
communities there. The point made under the previous clause about two,
three or one-member wards, alongside name changes, enhances the
identity that the individual elector&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I
hope that that is not for
me.</div>

					<a name="07022056000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Poole asked
about protected areas. If the Electoral Commission has given the name
within the past five years, it is protected, but if in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 236</div>protected period the commission agrees to the name change proposed by
the council, it can then happen. I am sure that when that appears in
<i class="I">Hansard</i> it will make great sense. The commission&#146;s power
to amend the names of local authority electoral areas will remain
unaffected, so when a council proposes to change an electoral area
within five years of a change made by the commission, the council must
seek the commission&#146;s approval. With such permission it can
override the
protection.</div>

Neill:
						</b> I rise to seek a little clarification. I do not
disagree with what the Under-Secretary is saying, and from a localist
point of view I see its logic. I wonder whether there is to be any
requirement to consult. How will we deal with the situation of people
being genuinely unhappy about a ward name being changed? In my
constituency, when the Electoral Commission changed a particular ward
boundary to create something called Mottingham and Chislehurst North,
there was an outcry. It was partly because people did not want to go
into Mottingham but more because everybody in Chislehurst North said,
&#147;We are actually called Chislehurst West&#151;they have got it
wrong.&#148;</div>

reason why we propose that the decision should be taken by local
councils. The Electoral Commission&#146;s boundary committee did the
same in my constituency, misnaming it Basildon instead of Basildon and
East Thurrock. By having decisions taken by local councillors we can
remove that problem. The normal consultation process will apply, but
having decisions taken by local authorities is the way
forward.</div>

the clause will give local authorities the power to make their own

								Alistair
Burt:
						</b> We now come to an interesting part of the Bill. The
Minister has indicated that he will respond, so we hope that he has
been refreshed by his break and we look forward to hearing what he has
to say. If we are to believe contributions that the Committee has
already heard from witnesses and Back Benchers, as well as from Back
Benchers on Second Reading, there is plenty of scope for amendment and
reconsideration by the Government of this part of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07022056000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">A couple of amendments to the
clause have been tabled. I will not steal the thunder of hon. Gentlemen
representing the Liberal Democrats, who have more fundamental
objections than we do to the concept of an elected executive, but I
will be interested to join the debate on the next set of clauses. There
is plenty of generic interest in the measures.</div>
					<a name="07022056000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the most difficult
thing that the Minister will have to deal with is the sense that this
is a top-down reform. For all the Government&#146;s talk about
devolving power and giving people more responsibility locally, the
clause is another example that shows that the Bill is intended confine
local government to a particular set of models at the
Government&#146;s insistence. From what we have already heard in
relation to previous clauses from colleagues on both sides of the
Committee, there is a feeling of concern that goes to the heart of what
we talked about during the witness session, which is the sense outside
of a degree of separation between the elected and those who elected
them, and a concern that there is control from the top down. That sits
uncomfortably in a mass participative democracy, in which people every
day have more and more opportunity to express their views. The approach
that the Minister is taking to the Bill on the back of the White Paper
is not quite doing what he would like it to do. I think that we will
have a number of discussions on a similar
theme.</div>
					<a name="07022056000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The limitations
of participative democracy have been illustrated over the past few
days, as we have seen the interest taken by the general public in the
opportunity to petition No. 10. They have taken that opportunity in
great numbers, only to have their desire for involvement slapped down
by the very people who created the opportunity. There are people out
there who are involved and interested, who want to say to the
Government, &#147;There are more ways of doing things than you are
letting us believe, and your attempt to nanny us and corral us strikes
us as an attitude of
concern.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022056000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are relatively small and I will not go into the larger
issues affecting the concept of elected executives until we debate the
next set of clauses. The amendments propose increasing from
three to five the number of councillors who can be involved in the
executive, so that the leader of a council would operate with four or
more councillors, instead of the two or more councillors suggested in
the
Bill.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07022056000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07022056000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The spirit of
the amendment is clear. It is recognition of the sense that things are
more likely go wrong in a local authority when matters have been held
by a small 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 238</div>group of people and not disseminated to the rest of the council than
when more people are involved. We maintain that a group of three
people, invested with executive authority in a system that does not
involve a directly elected mayor, is too
small.</div>
					<a name="07022056000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">That should
appeal to the Government&#146;s general sense of control. In theory a
group of one is by far the best number to make
decisions&#151;preferably the Secretary of State in a Labour
Government. How easy decisions are in those circumstances. Great
debates can be held. The issues can be examined fairly and objectively
and weighed up and of course, the right decision will inevitably be
reached. In the real world, however, more people have to be involved in
decision making. I am reminded of the story about John F.
Kennedy&#146;s dinner for Nobel laureates at the White House. He
stood up to address the dinner and
said:</div>
					<a name="07022056000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I think
this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human
knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White house,
with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined
alone.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022056000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
theory, one can create a special model where a very small number of
people may hold control, but unless those people are exceptional it is
usually wiser to expand the group. Just two or more councillors, as
under the Bill, are not sufficient. We have tabled our amendment, which
would make it four or more councillors, to diffuse that executive
control. There is a greater risk of cabals when there are only three
councillors. When things go wrong in local councils, it is usually
caused by a small number of people acting in a clique, often in
one-party areas where over time corruption has got in. The smaller the
number of people making the decision, the easier it is for such
problems to
arise.</div>

							<a name="07022056000428"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I have been following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument carefully. I think I understand it well. Does it lead him to
the conclusion that a mayoral system is potentially more open to
corruption than other
systems?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000429"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> There has to be a check on the power of the elected
mayor. Certain safeguards are built in about how much power a mayor has
when dealing with a local council elected at the same time and to which
he must refer. It is the concentration of executive authority that is
worrying. There is a balance to be struck. There are some cases where
the public have spoken and directly elect a mayor. The mayor is subject
to ultimate accountability by the people and in some cases we want to
try that model, provided that the public have an opportunity to express
their support and to change that system.</div>
					<a name="07022056000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another of our concerns about
the Bill is that it is too much of a one-way street and does not give
people enough power to move back from a system that they find
uncomfortable. There is always the issue of the concentration of
individual power, but directly electing a mayor and the way in which a
directly elected mayor must work with the rest of his team make that
less
likely.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000430"></a>Sir
Peter Soulsby:
						</b> Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that it
is the strength of the checks and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 239</div>scrutiny that are most important, rather than the numbers of those who
are being checked and
scrutinised?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000431"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> No, it is a balance between the two. There is a real
danger in having a group of only three invested with the powers.
Widening the number to five seems a better balance between scrutiny and
numbers than the Bill&#146;s
provisions.</div>
					<a name="07022056000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was
much discussion on Second Reading and among witnesses of the sense that
councillors were out of the loop. We will discuss that more when we get
around to considering whether there should be an option to allow
authorities to go back to a committee system or an enhanced committee
system if they want. We will support the amendments moved at that time
to ensure that local authorities are given that option. Much of the
evidence from witnesses and many of the comments made by Members
expressed concern that in local government people came on to councils,
but then found that they were out of the loop and not involved, so they
did not stay long. They did not feel that the council was something in
which they could participate. The smaller the number of people invested
with authority, the more likely that is to be the case.</div>
					<a name="07022056000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is a simple,
straightforward mechanism to widen the number of people involved; it is
safer to have five rather than three. I hope that the Minister will
consider the amendment appropriate to the spirit of the Bill, as it
would increase the number of people involved in executive authority and
involve more people in participatory local
democracy.</div>

								The
Minister for Local Government (Mr. Phil
Woolas):
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Chope. I also thank the
hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire for the manner in which he has
spoken to his amendment, which strikes at the heart of what three of
the amendments in the group seek to do. It gives me a good opportunity
to explain the Government&#146;s thinking on the executive
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07022056000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
have referred to the Bill as devolutionary. It is indeed a
devolutionary Bill, and it is a decentralising Bill. However, I place
caveats on that, on behalf not only of the Government, but of
Parliament. One could take a completely devolutionary attitude and say
that it is up to a council to make its own government arrangements and
to do whatever it wants, but Parliament would want some limits to
that.</div>
					<a name="07022056000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for North-East Bedfordshire made a point about political disconnection,
which also featured on Second Reading. As well as devolving power, we
believe that it is equally important that local authorities are given
power over significant sums of public money that cover not only local
authority spending, but strategic direction over other public spending
in the area through the duty to co-operate that the Bill provides, and
through the local area agreement process on which it builds. Strong
leadership is not merely a phrase or propaganda slogan. Strong
leadership, or what can best enhance strong leadership, goes alongside
the devolutionary
powers.</div>

different problem for Government. It is not only about the curtailing
of central power to make sure that local government works, but about
bending over a little further and taking a bit more risk to allow the
public the sense that centralism is genuinely being withdrawn. When
they see the Government&#146;s desire to enforce leadership
structures, the public do not feel that that necessary risk is being
taken. That point is at the heart of the clauses that deal with
executive arrangements.</div>

philosophy. I was trying to describe the process. It is necessary and
right for Parliament and Government to set a framework. Obviously, we
are discussing the best model and the best series of options for local
councils. If we reflect on a previous debate about all-out elections
and elections by thirds, we can see that strong leadership can be
provided by either system. That was the most persuasive argument as far
as the Government are concerned, which is why the Under-Secretary of
State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member
for Basildon, responded as she did.
</div>
					<a name="07022056000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">To add force to my
argument: so important does my party think that council leadership is
that it is mentioned on page 107 of our manifesto. I can claim, too, a
spectrum of political support for strong leadership, although not
necessarily using the boundaries in the models that we have proposed. I
often refer in public to the examples of Manchester and Kent where,
whatever one&#146;s views on party politics in those areas, there has
undoubtedly been strong leadership, not just of the council as an
institution, but of the place being represented&#151;that is the
crucial point. The leader of Manchester council is the leader of that
city, not just of the council. I would argue the same for Kent&#151;I
use that area because it is a bipartisan example, but I could probably
think of some for the Liberal Democrat party, too. In fact, I am
desperately trying to do
so.</div>

Woolas:
						</b> It was the 1945 Government who nationalised the
utilities and did most to take financial powers from local government.
But hey ho! Herefordshire&#151;I think&#151;is joining its primary
care trust and local authority budgets. That is a significant move back
from the other great centralising measure against local
government&#151;the national health
service.</div>
					<a name="07022056000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall set
out the proposed legal changes because authorities and their executive
officers will look at this debate, and before responding to the
amendment, I shall comment on clause 39 more generally. It provides for
changes to the executive arrangements that local authorities in England
can adopt&#151;the provisions refer to England only&#151;and does
so by amending section 11 of the Local Government Act 2000, which
provides that the executive of a local authority shall take one of
three forms: a mayor and cabinet executive, a leader and cabinet
executive or a mayor and council manager
executive.</div>
					<a name="07022056000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
record, in Wales, all things being equal, those three forms of
executive arrangement will remain unchanged, subject to any future
decisions by the Welsh Assembly and parliamentary approval of this
Bill. Clause 39 will provide for those three models in England: a mayor
and cabinet executive, a leader and cabinet executive or an elected
executive, which we will come on to when we debate the amendment tabled
by the hon. Member for Hazel
Grove.</div>
					<a name="07022056000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arrangements for a mayor and cabinet executive will be the same as they
are at present. A person will be elected mayor of an authority and will
then appoint two or more councillors of the authority to make up the
executive. That is the case at the moment. Changes to the arrangements
for a leader and cabinet executive made by clause 39 will strengthen
the role of the leader of the council. As happens now, the council will
elect a councillor to be the leader of that authority, but whereas the
existing legislation allows the executive to be appointed by the leader
or the council, in future, that decision will be in the hands of the
leader
only.</div>

noon</div>
					<a name="07022056000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill puts
the executive power of the authority in its constitution into the
office of the leader. In practice, whether a council is run by majority
control or is subject to arrangements if there is no overall control,
the process will not change much, if at all, in how the leader is
chosen and how his or her power is exercised. The clause provides for
the executive power to be in the hands of the person who is accountable
to the public 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 242</div>through the overview and scrutiny arrangements, an important point made
by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South. Those arrangements
are the other side of the coin and are not covered in these
clauses.</div>
					<a name="07022056000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
significant change is that in future English authorities will no longer
be able to adopt the mayor and council manager model of executive. I
correct my background briefing paper, which says that there is little
support for such a model: there is no support for that model. The
intention was to provide for strong executive power to be put in the
hands of a mayor and his or her council manager when circumstances
required it. In England, there is only one such example: the fine city
of Stoke-on-Trent. That is why I made the recent ministerial statement
to Parliament and why I am engaged in discussions with Stoke-on-Trent
about the interim arrangements should we pass the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07022056000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, there
is little or no enthusiasm for the model, which has the effect of
concentrating power in the hands of an unelected official. Instead, we
will make available the option of an elected executive whereby the
whole executive is directly elected by the electorate of a council
area. We may return to that point
later.</div>
					<a name="07022056000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
develop further the executive arrangements introduced in the 2000 Act,
which have done much to speed up and improve the transparency and
accountability of the decision-making process. The proposed changes
draw on the lessons of research into governance and delivery in local
councils, which shows strongly that the single biggest factor driving
local government performance is effective and dynamic leadership. The
need for such leadership can only grow; the ambitious agenda in which
local authorities develop a clear local vision for the future of their
area and have the ability to work with the partners we described in the
Bill to shape their local economies and social and environmental
circumstances can happen only if there is strong, stable and visible
leadership.</div>

that</div>

							<a name="07022056000442"></a>Mr.

						</b> Like the hon. Gentleman, I suspect, I have never
believed that radicalism and structural change are the same thing. Some
of the best councils have a traditional model of leadership. The Audit
Commission&#146;s comprehensive performance assessment scores for the
current round will be made available later this week. There is no
necessary cause and effect between an executive model and strong
leadership; it can depend on the individuals involved and the body 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 243</div>politic. New York is often quoted as an example of strong leadership
with a mayoral model. Under Giuliani, arguably, it was, but it also
went bankrupt under the same electoral model&#151;or nearly bankrupt,
but I will not go there. I am not saying necessarily that there is a
cause and effect, but I am trying to create the circumstances in which
that would be most likely.</div>
					<a name="07022056000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I believe that the
Government are not, as the hon. Gentleman implied, imposing a model. We
are trying to give a range of options within a framework within which
strong leadership is most likely to come
about.</div>

							<b class="B">
								Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): On the options that
are going to be made available, most members of this Committee will
have been lobbied by a number of groups, including the Local Government
Information Unit, which expressed concerns that the Government have
ruled out an option whereby the councillors themselves can choose to
elect the executive. Would my hon. Friend be good enough to explain why
that option was not
favoured?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000444"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> In practice, a council will be able to do that.
The changes that we are making put the statutory executive power of the
council into the hands of the office of the leader of the council. The
process by which the council leader and the executive are appointed
will, I imagine, be in practice as it is at the moment, through the
decision of the majority group and the delegation of power to that
leader and his or her executive.</div>
					<a name="07022056000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">What, therefore, is the purpose
of suggesting this change? It is to ensure accountability. It is
accountability for the policies and the delivery of the council and,
crucially, accountability for the policy and delivery of the
council&#146;s services and activities through its partner
organisations. They involve huge sums of money and require such
accountability. With devolution&#151;and this is an important point
at the heart of the Bill&#151;comes responsibility. To ensure that
responsibility, it is quite right that accountability to the electorate
and the back-bench councillors is there, more so than is currently the
arrangement where there is a greater balance of accountability through
the Audit Commission process and through Whitehall
powers.</div>

							<a name="07022056000445"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> The Minister will also be alert to the comments of
the Local Government Information Unit that leadership does not
necessarily mean the leader. My particular concern is this: he will
have seen the submission from the Commission for Racial Equality,
particularly paragraph 11, which expresses concern that the proposed
mayoral or elected executive model would make even worse the current
under-representation of ethnic minorities at council leadership or
cabinet member level. Is not a cabinet of at least five, with
opportunities for a leader to balance portfolios to reflect diverse
communities, better than one of
three?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000446"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> One of the interesting political and policy
developments as a result of the Bill is the failure of central and
national bodies to realise that when we say we are devolving, we mean
it. If Mr. Trevor Phillips 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 244</div>writes to me about that point, I will redirect him to send his letter to
the leader of a council. It is the council that will have to take such
decisions and be accountable for them. I can see circumstances in which
the hon. Gentleman is right and where there is a fall away in diversity
among executives. If that happens, who is it that should hold that
decision to account? Is it me, or more likely, my successor, or the
electorate and the elected councillors of that area? I know what is
more likely to be effective; I believe that it would be the people and
the elected executive.</div>

							<b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): Assuming a scenario in which a
leader is appointed, and he then appoints, with the tacit agreement of
the council, an executive, is it possible during his term of office for
him to change entirely that cabinet or executive, perhaps even picking
people from a different political party and for the council to be
powerless to do anything about
that?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000448"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> It is possible, as is the case at the moment.
There are councils in which executive power is shared even when a
majority group is in control. On Second Reading, we had a debate about
East Riding. The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness
(Mr. Stuart) intervened, and I pointed out that East Riding
was&#151;at the time he was referring to&#151;a very successful
Tory-Labour coalition. That coalition now involves the Liberal
Democrats and the independents as well. To answer the hon. Member for
Southport, that circumstance arises because of the accountability that
the council feels to the local electorate, particularly when
geographical areas within the local authority have different political
traditions. Many members of the Committee will be familiar with that.
Therefore, such accountability is more likely to come forward in those
circumstances.</div>

Gentleman&#146;s successor. May the king live for ever. He deserves

					<a name="07022056000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to bring
the hon. Gentleman back to his earlier comment about the models of
leadership and his not believing that he was offering a prescriptive
model. I bring him back to my central contention&#151;I do not think
that others see it as he and the Government see it. The LGA brief
states:</div>
					<a name="07022056000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
aim of the executive arrangements is clearly to enable strong
leadership. While we support that objective, we believe that there is
no single model or set of models suitable everywhere. Councils should
have the discretion to put in place arrangements to suit their
circumstances, including exploring new types of arrangements not
currently on the face of the
Bill.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022056000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LGA does not
feel that it is having a free and open choice even though the Minister
believes he is not being prescriptive about strong leadership. I ask
him to reconsider the point that the nature of the Bill is less
devolutionary than he thinks it
is.</div>
					
					<a name="07022056000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000450"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
He referred to the LGA brief. I think what I said previously&#151;and
certainly what I intended to say&#151;was that the Bill was not
unduly prescriptive. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 245</div>is quite right that there are limits to the devolution. One could
envisage circumstances in which some authorities may go for a
kibbutz-type of executive arrangements or perhaps even rolling
referendums by text message every day. Some of the proposals that I
have
seen&#151;</div>

							<a name="07022056000452"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman chides me by saying petitions.
His party would try to govern the country&#151;God forbid if it was
ever given the opportunity&#151;by decision through petition. That
would mean contradictory decisions every hour of the day. I was not
going to mention which party was responsible for some of the local
authority governance models that would result in the clogging up of
decisions. One can imagine what I am talking about.</div>
					<a name="07022056000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am teasing the hon.
Gentleman, but there is a serious point. If one was serious about
devolving power over executive decisions and public finances without
putting conditions on what executive arrangements there should be, the
majority of authorities would opt for an indirectly elected leader and
executive. In practice, the process of choosing that leader and
executive will be the same as it is at the moment. However, there is an
important change on accountability, which strikes at the heart of what
the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve when he talks about
reconnecting or connecting executives with the public. That is why I
refer to being unduly prescriptive.
</div>
					<a name="07022056000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the new
types of executive models, we again have to strike a balance between
allowing authorities to make innovative suggestions and not allowing
the irresponsible devolution of powers. As we will consider later, the
directly elected executive model, one of the three options in the Bill,
has come from local authorities. It did not come directly from the
debates within the Department, but from within the local authority
family.</div>

were?</div>

members of the LGA on many occasions&#151;worthy body that it
is.</div>
					<a name="07022056000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can but repeat
the fact that the idea of directly elected executives came from local
councils throughout the political spectrum. On the one hand, I am
accused of heavy handed centralism, while on the other I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 246</div>criticised for taking an open, devolutionary approach. However, I guess
that that comes with the
territory.</div>
					<a name="07022056000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would restrict councils&#146; range of options for the size
of their executive when they choose to operate either a leader and
cabinet executive or an elected executive. In the case of a leader and
cabinet executive in England, the range of options is the same as the
2000 Act already provides for the existing leader and cabinet model. It
is also along the same lines as the elected executive model. I listened
carefully to the arguments made by the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire for increasing the minimum size of an executive to five
from the current three. In essence, all the arguments are judgments
about what we think may be appropriate in particular
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07022056000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some
circumstances, five might be appropriate. In other circumstances, it
may be eight or four. One of the things that I have learned in this job
is just how important geography is to a local authority and to how
decisions are taken. Let us consider the example of Cornwall, which is
a significant geographical area, and compare it with the constituency
of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish in Tameside. The
geography&#151;let alone the history and culture&#151;changes how
decisions are made and rightly so, which means that models of
accountability must have flexibility. There is a fine
line.</div>

						<b class="B">

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000458"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> My argument concludes that greater flexibility is
required. We are teasing out some paradoxes. Here I am again being
devolutionary&#151;let them choose.</div>
					<a name="07022056000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman made a
serious point about corruption. He referred to circumstances in which
corruption would be more likely if there were only a small number of
people. I acknowledge the common sense of that view, but I refer him to
the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South that
accountability and scrutiny by the council and councillors individually
and, of course, the probity of the officers protect us all against
corruption in local government. The numbers that we propose under the
Bill are the same as the existing circumstances. I am sure all Members
join me in welcoming the probity of our local government, which in 99.9
per cent. of cases has proved to be very trustworthy. I am sure that
the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire would join me in
acknowledging that
point.</div>
					<a name="07022056000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The judgment is
balanced, but greater flexibility is important. I want to put on record
some of the principles behind the clause. Those that underpin the
executive arrangements under the Local Government Act 2000 and the Bill
are important. The Act provided for the first time a separation of the
executive of the council and what is called the back bench of the
council. I do not think it is appropriate to use a parliamentary term
in respect of a council, but I am sure that members of the Committee
will acknowledge the difference.</div>
					<a name="07022056000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2000 Act provided that most
council decisions were to be taken by a small number of high-profile, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 247</div>visible councillors whom the public recognised as responsible for those
decisions, rather than through the previous committee structure, which
I do not believe was transparent, visible or accountable to the public.
That was done to make it clear to the public who within the council was
responsible for those decisions. It was also done to speed up decision
making and to enable councils to give more effective leadership for
their areas.</div>
					<a name="07022056000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
that is important in the context of the Bill. It is not just a question
of speeding up decisions for the sake of it, or at the expense of
consultation or accountability. It is important for the coming together
of local authorities and their partners that decisions can be taken
effectively and speedily. The biggest single complaint against local
authorities from the private, voluntary and community sectors is the
lack of effective decision
making.</div>

Peter Soulsby:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that his point
about the division between the executive and scrutiny is actually an
argument for restricting the maximum size of the executive rather than
the minimum size? Problems with the status and effectiveness of
scrutiny are often a reflection of the perception&#151;at the
least&#151;that all the most effective members of a local authority
manage to become members of the executive and that scrutiny is
undertaken by those who are left
out.</div>

there is a
balance.</div>
					<a name="07022056000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea
behind the 2000 Act was to make executive decision making more visible,
more transparent and therefore more accountable, as well as to speed it
up. The Act also did something equally important that the Bill builds
upon, which was to provide for overview and scrutiny to hold the
executive to account and to facilitate policy development in the local
authority. The overview and scrutiny process does not merely
scrutinise. It can take up reports, investigate and make
recommendations to the council like our own parliamentary Select
Committees. Despite the pain they can sometimes cause a Government, it
is acknowledged by Governments and the House that they are a valuable
part of our democratic
process.</div>
					<a name="07022056000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">In building
overview and scrutiny&#151;one councillor described it at the
Birmingham conference as overscrew and mutiny, which I took as a
compliment to the concept&#151;we are building on the 2000 Act in the
Bill. We see it as an evolution, admitting that the council manager
problem has not worked out as intended. We seek to develop further the
governance framework for councils, both as regards the executive
and&#151;as we shall see when we come to overview and scrutiny later
in the Bill&#151;so that we can facilitate councils&#146; delivery
of the strong, effective and accountable leadership needed to shape the
areas they represent and not just the institutions of which they are
the executive controllers, as well as their delivery of higher quality
and responsive public services. One key point about leadership of local
authorities is the ability to work 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 248</div>with other partners from the business, voluntary and public sectors to
make a joint effort to implement strategies. That is why executive
models are so important in the new local government era.</div>
					<a name="07022056000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I have answered the
points that the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire made. He talked
about the nature of participative democracy as opposed to
representative democracy, and one must strike a balance, whether
through the Bill&#146;s measures to facilitate people&#146;s
involvement or not. It is obviously important to us all that actions or
explanations for inaction are given in response to public
involvement.</div>
					<a name="07022056000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point behind the Government&#146;s thinking is that although
opportunities for involvement and for influencing decisions are
crucial, we cannot allow participative democracy to replace
representative democracy. That would lead to a lack of decision making.
It is a tribute to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s imagination that the
idea of increasing two to four on an executive was turned into a
fundamental political philosophical debate, despite the fact that he
directly contradicted the contribution from the hon. Member for Poole.
However, I guess that they have to probe.</div>

							<a name="07022056000464"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I shall start by dealing with the question of
strong leadership. Everybody in the room is in favour of strong
leadership; the alternative would be to be in favour of weak
leadership. Similarly, we are all in favour of good government, because
the alternative is to be in favour of bad government. The Minister
introduced the idea that we should be in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 249</div>favour of good devolution, rather than bad devolution, or as he put it,
irresponsible devolution. I sign up to strong and good against bad and
weak. Let us be quite clear about that.</div>
					<a name="07022056000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would remove the
proposal for an elected executive. I welcome what the Minister had to
say about the continuation of the existing executive model. It, of
course, contradicted the Bill, but it was good to hear that there will
be no change. There will be a four-year term and increased
accountability, but councils will be free to wangle the new rules that
the Government impose on them, so that they can carry on as they do at
present. Accountable turns into fixed as normal.</div>
					<a name="07022056000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the heart of the
Government&#146;s proposals there is confusion based on the complete
misconception that strong leadership must mean strongly centralised
leadership. The elected executive proposal provides a clear example of
that confusion. The Minister referred to the examples of Kent and of
Manchester. I might have mentioned Somerset and Liverpool. All sorts of
examples show that neither the leadership model, nor the electoral
system, or anything tangible in the Bill, leads to a significant
difference in the performance of councils. Neither the number of stars
councils get, nor what Ofsted thinks about them&#151;or any of the
factors that the Government routinely take into account to judge
councils&#146; performance&#151;are affected, either for the better
or the worse, by the leadership models under which they function. That
is not to say that there is no diversity in the performance of two
councils with the same leadership model. Despite all the praying in aid
of strong leadership for the model under discussion, it falls to bits
if it is considered
seriously.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07022056000356"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07022056000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate on
clause 41 will probably go more to the heart of our criticism of the
Bill than will the discussion on this group of amendments, which are
designed to remove one of the models that the Minister is proposing.
When we get to that clause, I shall argue that, in the spirit of
devolution&#151;with open arms, as the Minister so clearly
demonstrated with his body language&#151;we should be aiming for
internal self-government for local authorities. We should have as many
different models as possible with the minimum of prescription.
Incidentally, I would not have supported the Conservative amendment,
because it would have restricted councils&#146; freedom and ability
to decide what to
do.</div>
					<a name="07022056000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am surprised and
disappointed that the Government are withdrawing the town manager
model. It is okay to say that there is no support for it, but what is
wrong with leaving it on the books so that a local authority can
consider it as a possibility? The Minister may ask why, if I am saying
that, do I want to get rid of the elected executive model? I should
explain that I want to do so because it is operationally fundamentally
flawed and unworkable. The Minister has had difficulty picking a
solitary local authority that wanted the system. One was provided for
him in the evidence session; it turned out to be Stockton. The response
of the LGA representatives was, &#147;Well, we do not have a whipping
system in the LGA, so Stockton can think what it
likes&#148;&#151;with &#147;However daft it is&#148; in square
brackets. That must have been a powerful piece 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 250</div>of evidence for the former Secretary of State, who has a constituency in
the neighbourhood. However, it was not a powerful piece of evidence for
the current Secretary of State, whose constituency is in the
metropolitan borough of Bolton, which has no overall majority of
members at the moment and has had changing leadership over the past
three years.</div>
					<a name="07022056000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need
to consider carefully the proposed model and what is wrong with it. It
is unworkable in the most basic way. Some of the problems will be
illustrated when we get to clause 41. A recent Conservative amendment
would have restricted the size of the executive. Under the directly
elected executive model, the size of the executive would have been
predetermined before the process got to the ballot box. That means that
it is not open to a Conservative party to say that it believes in a
limited, small number or, perhaps&#151;having just heard its views in
the debate&#151;a large number. Perhaps it would want a 14 or 15
executive member system&#151;following what the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire said&#151;as the way the authority should be
led in future. It would not be open to a Labour party, perhaps with a
more centralist view or a mini-mayor model, to say that it wanted a
slate with two members on. What is wrong in practical, working terms,
is the predetermination of the slate size, which cannot be a matter of
electoral competition between the
parties.</div>
					<a name="07022056000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
problems include the fact that, if the leader of a council goes under
the executive model, all the members of the executive are immediately
dismissed. I wonder whether the Government have considered what would
happen if the leader was hit by a bus a fortnight before the council
was to take a budget decision and all the executive members were taken
out. There will be no opportunity to change elected members who are not
up to the job&#151;no crop rotation. If we have a Home Office
situation&#151;I do not wish to wallow in the Government&#146;s
grief on that&#151;it will be impossible to move an executive member
who is failing in the job or has become discontented with their lot. Of
course there are all sorts of problems because, as has been mentioned,
it is not automatic that the party with the largest number of votes in
an area gets the largest number of seats. That is interesting in my
borough of Stockport, where it has happened on a number of
occasions.</div>
					<a name="07022056000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings
us to the matter of running elections for the council at the same time
as those for the elected executive. Using rational thought, it seems to
me that the leading councillors from each political group will be in
the slates for the executive. One of those slates will be
elected&#151;let us say for argument that it is the Labour
slate&#151;at which point the executive members&#146; council seats
will become vacant and there will be a set of by-elections to replace
them. In an authority such as Tameside, where there is a regular,
substantial majority of Labour voters in most wards, perhaps that would
not be a problem. However, one can perfectly well see that in a large
number of other places&#151;I could speculate on where they might
be&#151;the subsequent by-elections would result in non-Labour
members being elected and the majority of the Labour administration
being lost.</div>
					<a name="07022056000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">All those
issues are straightforward and practical, and the current model
completely fails to address them. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 251</div>There is also the small matter of the change in political composition
that takes place anyway as time goes on. Some 30 per cent. of local
authorities currently have no overall control and 40 per cent. have
experienced such a period in the past eight years. When we reach clause
41, I shall argue that it is void for want of certainty. It is
impossible to tell how it will work or is intended to work and what its
outcome will be, other than that all the predictions suggest it will be
error-prone and prone to catastrophic failure because of the
Government&#146;s inability to say precisely what they believe should
happen in each case. None of the situations in question is dealt with
in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07022056000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
spirit of our earlier debate, I ask the Minister to reconsider the
matter, reintroduce it in the Lords if that is what he wishes to do and
make some connection between people who know how local government works
and the person holding a quill pen who wrote the words in the Bill. The
clause is fundamentally and completely unworkable. That brings me back
to my first point: if the Government wish to introduce more and more
different models that councils can opt into, that is fine by me. I do
not have a problem with it, nor does my party. However, just as they
have now decided that they made a serious mistake with the town manager
model for Stoke, which they have withdrawn, they have the opportunity
to recognise the serious mistake they are making on this occasion
before they make it. They can have another go at introducing a model
that makes practical sense for local authority management and
leadership.</div>
					<a name="07022056000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could
wax lyrical and longer, but I have made my point as clearly and
explicitly as I can. The model is unworkable and would be completely
catastrophic for any local authority. Unless the Government can satisfy
us on a number of issues, it is clear that they or their successors
will come back to us and say, &#147;It&#146;s like Stoke mark 2. We
screwed up and we want to take it
away.&#148;</div>

							<a name="07022056000465"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I am interested in the observations of the hon.
Member for Hazel Grove and I have a lot of sympathy with him, gained
from my own experience in local government and from talking to other
people. I would prefer that the Government did not prescribe the
governance system for councils at all. I would prefer that it was left
for them to decide in a broadly devolutionary fashion, but if the
Government are going to do it, they should get it right.</div>
					<a name="07022056000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is noteworthy that a range
of the written submissions made to the Committee highlight exactly the
same sort of practical concerns as those the hon. Gentleman has just
described. The Local Government Association raised that concern and the
submission from Unlock Democracy went into considerable detail about
the practical implications. I do not want to repeat what the hon.
Gentleman has said, but there seems to be a real concern here. The
elected executive is a peculiar combination of a strong mayor model on
the one hand and the traditional executive leader and cabinet that we
are becoming used to on the other.</div>
					<a name="07022056000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see the logic of the strong
mayor model. It is not always appropriate but one sees the logic of
adopting the American pattern of one directly elected figurehead, with
some separation between the elected mayor and the council that
scrutinises him. In a Committee considering a different Bill, I
criticised the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 252</div>way we have not followed that logic through in London. Under those
circumstances, there is an argument for the mayor&#146;s executive
being separate from the council. That is what happens in New York where
there is a system of deputy mayors who are not members of the city
council. They form a legislature cum scrutiny body.</div>
					<a name="07022056000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">An interesting idea for a
directly elected mayor of London in the future would be to have a slate
and deputy mayors rather than some of the other bodies, but that is not
what we have now. The directly elected executive takes the worst of
that system&#151;it removes the executive from the membership of the
council&#151;but does not have the benefit of the strong, single
political figurehead with the strong electoral mandate that one has in
the New York or London style systems. It falls between two stools. That
is very dangerous.</div>
					<a name="07022056000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am just about old enough to have been elected to a London borough at a
time when it still had something that was referred to colloquially as
the aldermanic by-elections. There was a period when councillors
elected a certain number of aldermen and there were frequently
by-elections to fill their places.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000469"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> It certainly has a leader, but it is undesirable to
decouple the members of the executive from membership of the council in
the way that is proposed here and create by-elections. Although the
leader has some status, it is not the same in terms of public
perception and electoral legitimacy as that of a mayor. In the New York
scenario it would be &#147;Vote for Bloomberg for mayor&#148;
together with a list of his nominees for deputy mayor. It is not the
same in practice. That is the real problem
here.</div>
					<a name="07022056000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the days when
there were by-elections to fill vacancies created when councillors were
appointed to be aldermen, the turnout was usually minuscule. About a
month after the main election for councillors one would try to persuade
people to go out and vote again. Frequently turnout was down to about
10 per cent., which did nothing for democracy. The point is well made
by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. We have seen it in by-elections to
this House when Ministers have been sent to the House of Lords, such as
Lord Whitelaw of Penrith and others.</div>

							<a name="07022056000471"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> Exactly. The electorate sometimes react against
what they perceive to be a needless by-election. Funnily enough, the
Government are creating a needless hostage to electoral fortune in
requiring councils to go through that process. It is no good the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 253</div>leader of the council explaining that he did not want to have these
by-elections to fill the places of members who are now members of his
executive but that the Government require him to do so. That will not
cut much ice with voters who wonder why on earth they will have to go
through the rigmarole again a matter of weeks after they had had just
done so. I think it would damage the credibility of the electoral
system.</div>
					<a name="07022056000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I do
not think it is desirable for the elected members in this system not to
be people with constituents and constituencies. That is the difference:
with the mayoral system, everybody seems to understand the separation
of powers. The proposed system seems to hover between the two; it does
not quite go the whole hog of the separation of powers on the American
model, which might be intellectually justifiable, but produces some of
the downsides without some of the benefits.</div>
					
					<a name="07022056000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07022056000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is
also made about how important it is, if we are going to have somebody
who is called the leader of the capital, that that person can
demonstrate to the electors and the residents of the borough or
district that they command the confidence of the majority of the
councillors. It is very difficult for them to work otherwise. If people
want a directly elected mayor again, that is fair enough, as they do
not require that because they have their independent mandate. However,
to dilute that situation with the leader and the executive is
undesirable. Things do happen&#151;councils change control. A
practical example comes from my part of the world. Control of the
London borough of Bromley changed as a result of two by-elections
between the council elections, not this time but the time before. From
1998 to 2001, there was a change of control. What would happen if we
had had a leader and an executive ostensibly there for a four-year
term, but the majority of the council had gone the other way? That
clearly would not be sustainable. There has got to be proper provision
to prevent that
happening.</div>
					<a name="07022056000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
also a concern about the inability to shuffle the pack. When I was a
councillor in the London borough of Havering, the leader of the council
appointed the committee chairmen, and they effectively formed a
Cabinet. There came points when we thought that is was appropriate
within our four-year term to move members around, so somebody might
have been chairman of the housing committee for a couple of
years&#151;it might have been four years, and passed through an
election&#151;and wanted to bring people on. Somebody might have said
they were not going to stand again at the next election, and he might
want to bring somebody forward to get into that portfolio in time to
fight the next election. There is nothing to suggest how that would be
possible under the present system. Those are exactly the practical,
nitty-gritty bits of day-to-day local government practice which whoever
drafted the current proposal does not seem to have taken on board. That
is why I have real misgivings about the way the clause is currently
drafted. I really think that the Government should think about it
again.</div>

							<a name="07022056000472"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> I think we are engaged in creating undue disharmony
from over-prescription. I would like to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 254</div>illustrate that with reference to my local authority, of which you and
I, Mr. Benton, were members and, I think, leaders. I hope
that we were strong leaders; I am sure that we were.</div>
					<a name="07022056000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current system in Sefton is
that elections occur by thirds. The executive is established and it
reflects the balance of the parties and the balance of the whole area.
From square one, as long as there has been an executive, Sefton has had
that system. We are very sensible, mature people who are capable of
talking to one another, and habitually on the Cabinet, there has been a
Tory leader, a Labour leader and a Lib Dem leader, with the Lib Dems
currently leading the council&#151;for obvious reasons, connected
with electoral success. It does not lead to inefficiency: the Audit
Commission and comprehensive performance assessment bear that out. It
does not lead to hard decisions being dodged, and it does not lead to a
lack of ability to work together. In fact, this year, the budget, which
is normally agreed by two parties, was agreed by all three parties.
What would be a nightmare in that situation would be an executive slate
on a party basis. That would be profoundly distorting because of the
political geography of Sefton. I am not sure that it is as politically
diverse as Denton and Reddish, but it is certainly pretty diverse.
Labour wins seats only in Bootle, and nobody else does, despite sincere
trying from time to time, as you are all too clearly aware,
Mr. Benton.</div>
					<a name="07022056000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Central Sefton is a bit of a
mix, and Labour never wins anything and never has in Southport.
Whatever executive there were, including a directly elected executive
on a party slate, it would necessarily be seen as a colonial power in
some part of the borough. We could be saved by sticking with the status
quo, although that is not quite the situation, and choose the option of
leader and cabinet. Obviously, any leader in that sort of scenario
would be very wise to appoint an all-party cabinet. However, as I
understand it, there is nothing in arrangements currently before us
that would prevent a clear-out by the leader, a quick change in the
cabinet&#151;rather like the Prime Minister from time to time changes
his Cabinet&#151;that destroys that balance, so reducing the
authority to a state of comparative paralysis. Such things
happen&#151;if a leader went mad under the current four-year term
arrangements, there would be little option other than to shoot him.
There is an entirely workable and happy arrangement in Sefton, which
operates consensually and satisfactorily whereas, under the Bill, we
would be pinioned between two really quite unattractive
alternatives.</div>

was a permissive one&#151;similar to that of the hon. Member for
Hazel Grove, who said that he had had trouble with ruling things out of
the Bill, because if people want a directly elected executive, we
should let them have one. However, given the further remarks that have
been made by both him and others, I feel that the Minister needs to do
more if he is to satisfy the Committee that the proposal is a good
one.</div>
					<a name="07022056000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

came from. The illustrations of practical flaws that have been given by
those who have commented have been quite significant, and one wonders
which council has missed
them.</div>
					<a name="07022056000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me pick out
one of those flaws. It comes from one of the Minister&#146;s party
colleagues, so I think that he ought to answer it. Jeremy Beecham told
the witness sitting of the Committee that he was unhappy with the
proposal. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07022056000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;There
is...a question as to why it is necessary for the executive not to
be drawn...from elected councillors? Why do you have to treat
them, as it were, as a class apart within the
council?&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Local Government
and Public Involvement in Health Public Bill Committee, </i>30 January
2007; c. 19.]</div>
					<a name="07022056000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">He made that point
in answer to an issue that was raised by the hon. Member for Bedford
about the involvement of councillors, and to illustrate that one could
have all sorts of initiatives to involve councillors with a strong
leadership model, and yet, despite that, the directly elected executive
leadership model would produce a further barrier to involvement. Given
that a colleague of the Minister offered that concern, the Minister
might wish to think about
it.</div>
					<a name="07022056000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point is
one that has cropped up on a number of occasions and was made by Unlock
Democracy&#151;the &#147;one-way street&#148; argument. The White
Paper and the Bill presume that if the model adopted is that of a
directly elected mayor or a directly elected executive, then that will
be fixed and there will not be an opportunity to reconsider. That seems
contrary to the spirit of devolution in which the Minister has set
out.</div>
					<a name="07022056000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has
a tough set of questions to answer on the practical difficulties that
have been raised by so many people connected with local
government.</div>
					
					<a name="07022056000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022056000474"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I think particular praise should be given to you
in your Chairman&#146;s role, Mr. Benton, because
obviously you had to remain neutral when the hon. Member for Southport
made comments on your local council. The frozen look on your face was
one that I wanted to put on record for the benefit of the readers of
the <i class="I">Liverpool Echo. </i>My mind boggles at where we could go on
that.</div>
					<a name="07022056000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout the
debate, including in the weeks and months preceding today, I have been
surprised by the level of opposition from the hon. Member for Hazel
Grove to the proposal. He has campaigned and spoken with some force,
and I find that genuinely surprising. The idea for a directly elected
executive, or a slate, came initially from Stockton council and has
been considered by other authorities including, I believe, Cornwall and
Durham county council. As I said during the previous debate, it is
often the geography of a place that dictates the arrangements for best
governance. I make my argument on this basis; the hon. Member for Hazel
Grove has been almost passionate in his opposition to the model, and
yet he claims that his approach is a permissive devolutionary
one&#151;if the model does not work, let Stockton worry about it. The
hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire said we had got it wrong over
the city manager model&#151;no, Stoke council has said it does not
want it and I will not tell Stoke that it has to have it. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 256</div>That is perfectly permissive, but it passes the test of strong executive
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07022056000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Southport said that everything was hunky-dory in
Sefton. Everything is not hunky-dory in Sefton. Your constituents,
Mr. Benton, require good services, improvement in economic
performance and regeneration. North Liverpool&#146;s regeneration is
the largest single infrastructure project in the United Kingdom, and it
came about not because of strong leadership from Sefton
council&#151;I pay tribute to the hard work that the council
does&#151;but because of the intervention of the private sector and
Government agencies. That is why it is happening.</div>
					<a name="07022056000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">We cannot accept that the
status quo in all parts of the country is enough; we have a
responsibility to ensure that the best models are in place. Regarding
the directly elected model, I do not accept the argument that, on the
one hand, we should be devolutionary and permissive and, on the other,
because hon. Members do not like this particular model, it should not
be allowed. That seems to be contradictory. If there are difficulties
with that model, let us talk them through with the relevant local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="07022056000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I get
the impression from Opposition Members that they do not accept the case
that strong leadership matters.</div>

							<a name="07022056000475"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>With respect to the Minister, does he accept
that the thrust of the argument some of us are making is not that there
is anything wrong with being devolutionary, but that it is the
Government who have chosen to set up a particular menu from which
councils must choose and therefore that it is incumbent on the
Government to ensure that the menu includes options that are
practically workable? That is my real
concern.</div>

					<a name="07022056000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will run out of time and I do
not want to delay the Committee. Regarding the points that the hon.
Gentleman has made about the comments by Sir Jeremy Beecham, I
would give the same answer to Sir Jeremy Beecham as I have given to
him. I do not think it is incumbent on me to respond to those points
just because Sir Jeremy is in my party; it is incumbent on me to
respond to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points because he is the
Opposition spokesman.</div>
					<a name="07022056000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the Government disagree
with Sir Jeremy is that the model has come forward from local councils
and it provides for a directly elected slate, which would offer visible
and accountable leadership. There may be pragmatic problems in
implementing it, but there are pragmatic problems in implementing any
model of government. I am sure that, when our forefathers introduced
the idea of ward councillors, they envisaged practical problems.
However, in my view those problems can be overcome. The model is not a
one-way street; it does provide for a reversal of the decision. The
principle that underlies the arrangements in the Bill is that the
method by which a leadership model is chosen is the method that can
undo it, whether that be referendum or decision.</div>
					<a name="07022056000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Southport
described the situation in Sefton. He could be absolutely right, but I
would imagine that Sefton will not opt for this model, because of the
reasons that the hon. Gentleman has given. The hon. Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst displayed a centralising tendency, in effect saying,
&#147;Well, I will devolve as long as I like the model that is being
given&#148;. I do not accept that.</div>
