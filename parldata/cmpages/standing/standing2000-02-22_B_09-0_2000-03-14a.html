<H4><center>Clause 51</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of property etc. to nominated company</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): It is nice to be back in Committee after my excursion to other climes to broaden the message of international democracy.
<P>
The clause is a typical blank cheque provision, as was clause 32. You must remember that clause, Mr. Maxton, given that you directed me towards it forcibly because we had to agree that all environmental and social guidance factors were put in place. Clause 32 gave the thumbs up to that guidance, even though we have no idea what it will be.
<P>
Clause 51 gives the tick in the box to schedule 3 so, by agreeing to the clause, we would be bolted on to agreeing to the schedule. When we discuss it, I hope that Labour Members will take account of paragraph 2 and that the Minister will give a substantial and detailed explanation of it. New clause 1 is also of significant relevance to the clause, but we shall discuss that later.
<P>
We welcome clause 51 in broad terms because it sets in train the essential steps for freedom for the Post Office to go further down the line towards liberalisation and operating in a free and open market. It is most important, however, not to allow the Post Office to operate with the Government's support and ticks in the box regarding the borrowing of money, or giving it freedoms that would not be available to other commercial companies. I want assurances from the Minister that the Post Office will be required to play by the rules and that it will not be given a double advantage. We do not want it to be able to borrow money from the loans fund. I accept that ostensibly the loans fund does not have a Government guarantee behind it, but I am sure that it would be regarded as a huge advantage if it were available to a private company. We also want assurances that the Government cannot take all the properties and start using the fund as additional support, which would be unfair on the commercial scene. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness </B>(Mr. Alan Johnson): I am confused as to whether the Opposition welcome or condemn the clause, which is essential in the transfer of the Post Office's property to the Post Office plc. It repeats various provisions from previous legislation, and is at the heart of the provisions to convert the Post Office from a statutory corporation to a company governed by the Companies Acts. The conversion is one of the essential elements of the reform package. As has been said, it underlines the commercialisation of the Post Office.
<P>
The clause permits the Secretary of State to make an order setting the day for the transfer under clause 62, so that the property, rights and liabilities of the Post Office are transferred to a company formed and registered under the Companies Acts. The clause also requires that the company to which the transfer is made is wholly owned by the Crown at the date of vesting. All being well, that date is expected to be 26 March 2001, which is the last day of the Post Office's financial year.
<P>
The transfer will effectively change the status of the Post Office from a statutory corporation to a public limited company. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) is right: it will underline the new commercial freedoms of the Post Office and its new arm's length relationship with Government. The transfer will give the Post Office the added certainty of operating as a plc in a recognised business environment in which, like its private sector competitors, it will be governed by the full range of company law. The transfer will also underline the accountability of the directors and the new commercial status of the Post Office, and help clarify the separate roles of Government and the board. There is no question of our giving the Post Office privileged status. The hon. Gentleman mentioned debates that we shall have in future, but in this debate we are talking about the transfer of Post Office property and other paraphernalia into a new company. I reassure the Committee that the clause can safely stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 51 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>TRANSFER TO THE POST OFFICE COMPANY: SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I hesitated before speaking, as I had tipped off Labour Members that we would soon debate the schedule, and that it contained several important provisions, including those on pension arrangements. I should have thought that the party that is for the workers would have asked its Minister exactly what was involved in the transfer.
<P>
I am either misreading item 175 of the explanatory notes, which is on page 30, or it is slightly truncated. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Paragraph 2 enables the Secretary of State to safeguard the pension arrangements of those affected by the transfer by making any necessary.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know what is meant by ``any necessary'' followed by a full stop, so it would help if the Minister explained it.
<P>
If I can bear to say it, I am doing the work of the Labour party by asking whether the Post Office pension fund is in surplus, whether the Government intend to transfer the fund in total or actuarially calculate its liabilities and requirements, and what will happen to the surplus if there is one. If there is a surplus, will there be moves to extend the pension arrangements of Post Office workers to give them better pensions and retirements?
<P>
I have no objection to the other provisions in schedule 3, which specify the arrangements that are necessary for the Post Office to operate as a plc while being entirely owned by the Government. However, I hope that the Minister will deal in some detail with my anxiety about pensions and will mention any actuarial calculations involved, including which company was involved and whether the work was done by competitive tender, all of which is necessary as part of a standard operation to transfer the corporation into the plc sector.
<P>
It would be helpful to have a few explanatory details on paragraph 5, which covers the vesting of foreign properties. The mail business is becoming international, and we shall want our Post Office to be competitive throughout the world, which will require vesting of foreign property. We want to be assured that that will be done on a fair-play basis and that the Post Office will not have an unfair advantage against operators that must raise their money in the marketplace. It is essential that the Post Office can compete internationally if it is to become an international player and not be squeezed out and be merely a part-time player on our own turf.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): I simply quest after knowledge. Paragraph 3(2)(e) refers to a right of irritancy. What is a right of irritancy? Is it what the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) has against the Government Front Bench? I have never heard of a right of irritancy before, and we should know what it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> To reiterate, as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, paragraph 3 provides supplementary powers to transfer the Post Office corporation to the new Post Office plc. I had anticipated a question such as the hon. Member for Banbury asks, and I asked my officials what was meant by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a right of reverter (or, in Scotland, the right of the fiar on the termination of a liferent).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I asked, but no answer was forthcoming. Several jokes were made about a right of irritancy, some of which involved the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan), which I refuse to use in Committee. People have rights, especially now that we have transferred the European convention on human rights into British law. Irritants can have rights, too, and it is right to enshrine that in law.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire made a serious point about pensioners. Labour Members have not made that point because everyone who has an interest in the matter, including my colleagues who have pensions—[Hon. Members: ``No.''] They have transferred out to Strasbourg. The organisation responsible for people whose pensions are important to them has not made such points. It understands that the provision is designed to protect the pension status of Post Office staff after the transfer. As I said in the debate on the sittings motion, when I referred to the new clauses that might have to be introduced, this is a horrendously complicated aspect. Some people still have civil service pensions—Post Office staff were part of the civil service until 1969—and some people are outside the two, if not three, existing Post Office pension schemes. The whole area is fraught with difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): When the Labour party was in opposition, it always objected to the removal of any surplus that was not needed to guarantee the delivery of pensions to those in a scheme. It objected, in particular, to the idea that the surplus should go back to the Exchequer. Will the Minister, to be consistent with his position in opposition, give an unequivocal guarantee that any surplus in the Post Office pension fund will not revert to the Exchequer?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Yes. Any surplus in the Post Office pension fund will be transferred to the new organisation. Such matters are for the Post Office to decide. It will deal with the detailed matters that the hon. Gentleman raised in relation to its pensions policy in its negotiations with the trade unions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle </B>(Chorley): Is there a cast-iron guarantee to postal workers that what happened to the National Bus Company pensioners will not happen to them? Those pensioners are still fighting to ensure that their money is given back after the previous Government robbed them of their pensions. Can the Government guarantee that they will not do the same as the previous Government?

<P>

<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Yes. My hon. Friend draws attention to one of several pension scandals. There were others, including missold pensions and the veil of secrecy drawn over the state earnings-related pension scheme. I can guarantee categorically that we will transfer the pension rights of existing pensioners to the new company—lock, stock and smoking barrel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister has changed his wording. Transferring pension rights is one thing; transferring all the money that is currently in the fund—sufficient, perhaps, to guarantee those rights and more besides—is another. Will the Minister guarantee that the whole fund, unadjusted, will be transferred and will remain intact?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The assurance that I gave is on the record. Any surplus in the fund will be transferred with the transfer of provisions. We may be able to put detailed provisions into the Bill later in Committee, as I said during the debate on the sittings motion, and I hope that we do. The principle behind paragraph 2 of the schedule is that pensioners will be no worse off, no matter which pension scheme they are in—there is, as I explained, a wide variety of schemes—following the transfer to the new Post Office plc.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 3 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 52</center></H4>
<H4><center>Government holding in the Post Office company and its subsidiaries.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 29, line 12, leave out `from time to time'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 131, 132, 136 and 139.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The amendment is a technical one, designed to remove any inconsistency—[Laughter.] Opposition Members chuckle, but it is, indeed, the epitome of a technical drafting amendment.
<P>
We have used the phrase ``from time to time'' at various stages. Simple references to giving directions in clauses 52 and 66 should allow for them to be given more than once, unless the context requires otherwise. The wording ``from time to time'' is officially declared redundant. We are aligning the requirement for the Secretary of State to have the Treasury's consent—the other technical issue dealt with by the amendment—with clause 53 and with public probity in relation to financial issues. Clauses 52 and 66 relate to public assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Will the Minister explain what he understands to be the exact meaning of the word ``securities''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Securities are shares, share stock and so on. They are the financial stake in the company.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> The purpose of the amendment is to obtain more information from the Minister. We tabled an amendment on ``reasonable'' before, and now we are dealing with another word starting with ``r''—``relevant''. As the Minister said, securities can be shares and such like, but will he expand on the intention behind the clause? We have picked on the word ``relevant'' because we would like to know whether it means only universal delivery. Could any other form of subsidiary be included? Does the Minister envisage the Post Office acquiring other subsidiaries that are not concerned with universal delivery, and, in that case, would securities be issued?
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> This is a probing amendment. Rather than going through every dot and comma of what it would do, which would be horrific, I will explain some principles to Opposition Members. In framing the Bill, our concern was that the Post Office should remain in public ownership—unless further primary legislation was introduced—to meet the pledge given by the Secretary of State on 8 July 1999. Some parts of the Post Office have always been able to sell shares; for instance, 49 per cent. of Quadrant, which is the catering arm of the Post Office, was sold to a catering company a couple of years ago. That was quite right, because our only purpose is to protect what the public thinks of as the Post Office, although the Post Office is in fact multifaceted and has many subsidiaries. We want to ensure that no future devious Government—they certainly would not be Liberal Democrats, because the concept of their being in Government is a bit unlikely, unless they are in a coalition—can get round the assurances that we have given to Parliament and written into the Bill. That Government might transfer Royal Mail, Parcelforce or the Counters network into one of those subsidiaries, to avoid the requirement to introduce primary legislation.
<P>
We have carefully defined a relevant subsidiary and separated it from other subsidiaries, as the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) rightly said. Clause 52(8) defines relevant subsidiaries as those that deliver a universal service, such as Parcelforce, Royal Mail and the Post Office Counters network. The Counters network is included because it is the only way to send a registered postal packet. We must be able to protect those relevant subsidiaries and ensure that shares may be sold only to cement an alliance or a joint venture, as set out in clause 56.
<P>
The Post Office does not want us to restrict it in any way. One of its subsidiaries is German Parcels, in which it bought a huge stake last year. It is entirely a matter for the Post Office to decide whether to dispose of those shares. Similarly, subsidiaries such as the catering arm and the cash-carrying arm should not be brought within the ambit of the safeguards. We are purposefully defining relevant subsidiaries and differentiating them from other subsidiaries. If the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare pressed his amendment and it was carried, the Post Office would be worse off in one of two ways. I am not sure which way it would go. First, a devious future Government might try and get round the commitment made to Parliament in the Bill that further primary legislation was required to change the status of the Post Office. Secondly, the amendment might inhibit the Post Office in relation to German Parcels and many other subsidiaries. A new subsidiary, announced last week, has now been set up with the TNT Post Group, the Dutch Post Office services and TNT, and Singapore Post. That is an important development in European and world international communications. I guess that that would be considered a subsidiary. There is no ambition to constrain the Post Office in what it does with such acquisitions. I hope that I have said enough to convince the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments, but if he does not, I hope that the Committee will defeat them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Before we decide how to handle this amendment, will the Minister explain how the provision might affect some subsidiary shares that, until this point, have been 100 per cent. owned by the main holding company? The main holding company would need primary legislation for the sale of any of its shares. Let us say that it owned 100 per cent. of Post Office Counters Ltd. Will he explain the regime that would govern whether part of those shares could be disposed of? We understand that if the company had a shareholding in German Parcels or the Irish Post Company, essentially the shares will be in a different company outside the Post Office commercial structure. But, if there is a subsidiary beneath the holding company—Post Office Counters Ltd., Post Office Catering even, Post Office Uniforms Ltd., who knows what it might be—what restraints on the disposal of those shares would prevent 100 per cent. of the overall shareholding of the Post Office remaining in Government hands as a plc, but all the various components being sold off as subsidiary shareholdings?
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> Although it is not particularly relevant to the amendment, I am happy to answer the question. It depends what kind of subsidiary. That is the whole point of ``relevant subsidiary''. POCL, for instance, is a relevant subsidiary with a capital ``R'' and a capital ``S'', and under the terms of clause 56, the Post Office must come forward with a reason why disposal is in the commercial interests of the company. No Secretary of State or Government can kick off the process. The Secretary of State and the Treasury must approve the proposal and then it must go before both Houses of Parliament for an affirmative resolution. If the company is one similar to those mentioned by the hon. Gentleman—not a relevant subsidiary—then exactly the same as happens now will be the case. However, the Post Office would have more commercial freedom because now it has to ask its Mum and Dad what it can do. There would be complete commercial freedom for subsidiaries such as German Parcels. Whether that can lead to the kind of scenario that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, would be better debated under clause 56.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am sorry that the Minister put a further nail in the warm relationship with the Liberal Party and in particular the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, who has been reasonable throughout the Committee's proceedings. I do not know why the Minister has turned against the hon. Gentleman in this savage fashion.
<P>
May I probe the Minister a little more on the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton, who rightly put the Minister on the spot. I do not like to say this, but the Minister was weaselling his way round the point. Does the clause give authority to the Government to allow back-door creaming off, if not privatisation? It might technically prevent privatisation, but the word ``relevance'' has huge significance.
<P>
What would stop the Post Office expanding its activities through a host of subsidiaries so that the holding company became a small component and the subsidiary activity huge? What would stop the Government asking for the sell-off? The Minister was playing with semantics when he said that the process could not be initiated by the Government but had to be kicked off by the Post Office. If I am running a company that is totally owned by one shareholder, and I am given a lunchtime directive, for example, I am unlikely to tell that shareholder to go and get lost. So what is to stop that subsidiary being sold off, a huge sum of money accumulating into the centre, at the Post Office, and the Government then putting out requirements for their annual dividend that are way above the current limits?

<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> Excuse me, but I do not want to get into that argument now, The clause does not relate to those points; in fact, it allows the Government to create shares in the Post Office as long as the Post Office is wholly owned by the Crown. As soon as there is a 2 per cent. share swap to cement the joint venture, the whole of the clause drops because one cannot leave the Government in control of how many shares they produce when another party is involved in the company. The protections in clauses 54 and 55 would then apply.
<P>
I am not questioning the hon. Gentleman's right to raise the point under the clause, but this is the least best clause under which to do so because the provision will not apply once we get into the realms that the hon. Gentleman mentions. Those are not weasel words; I am perfectly happy to debate the issue, but it is best to do so when we are all focused on the same issue. The issue is important, but is not relevant to the amendments that we are debating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I rise somewhat shaken, having been so severely savaged by the Minister. Blood is streaming from me. Despite that, it has been handy to raise the matter at this stage. The Minister has, as is customary, given a clear explanation of the clause. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 30, line 20, leave out from `issued' to `or' in line 21 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to the Post Office company or any other relevant subsidiary of which the relevant subsidiary concerned is a subsidiary or any nominee of the Post Office company or of the other relevant subsidiary,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Once again, this is a tidying amendment. It removes the unintended effect of preventing shares or share rights in a relevant subsidiary from being issued to the Post Office company, or any relevant subsidiary, after a share swap to cement a commercial alliance has taken place.
<P>
The unamended clause allows the issue of shares and share rights to the company, or the relevant subsidiary, when the Secretary of State gives a direction under subsection 2(4).
<P>
As I said earlier, the whole of clause 52 ceases to apply when the Government cease to be the only shareholder. At the moment, the clause has the effect of severely restricting the Post Office and the Government. The amendment deals with that by permitting the shares of a relevant subsidiary to be issued to the Post Office company or any relevant other subsidiary of which the relevant subsidiary is a subsidiary—that involves a lot of subsidiaries. With the other restrictions in the clause, the amendment preserves the principle that there should be no disposal of shares, and soon without parliamentary approval, since the Post Office company or the subsidiary receiving the shares could not dispose of them without the standard restrictions in the Bill applying.
<P>
This is a difficult area—it is difficult for me, even with a wet towel round my head. The amendment is technical and tidies up a mistake. As the clause stands, the provisions of subsection (4) would have been suspended if other shareholders were in the company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): Before the Minister stood up, I thought that I understood the provision. For the sake of clarity, does it mean that shares in the subsidiary can be transferred without recourse to Parliament, but shares in the plc cannot?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> As usual, I should have kept my mouth shut. It has long been said about me that, when I try to clarify something, people become more confused. Clause 54 deals with a restriction on the issue of shares to third parties. It relates to the Post Office holding company and any subsidiaries. If we had left the clause as it appears at line 20 on page 30 of the Bill, the power to direct the Post Office to issue securities under clause 52 would be suspended as soon as someone else had shares in the company. The provision would come under the terms of the Companies Acts, otherwise the Government could dilute the value of the other shareholders' holdings. The only technical error was that the clause could have been put in suspension.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation.

<H4><center>Approved disposals</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Geraldine Smith </B>(Morecambe and Lunesdale): Clause 56 sets out the procedure to be followed to obtain Parliament's approval to make share issues or disposals that would otherwise be prohibited under clause 55. The main criteria that must be met before a motion to dispose of the public stake in the Post Office is brought before the House is that the Post Office must persuade the Secretary of State that it is in the company's commercial interest to do so. Bearing in mind the importance of the Post Office to the economy of this country and the essential role that it plays in the fabric of our society, the Secretary of State should have a wider obligation than that of simply considering the commercial interests of the company.
<P>
Before such a motion is brought before Parliament, the Secretary of State must be convinced and able to demonstrate clearly that any such disposal of shares or assets is in the national interest. That should be reflected in clause 56. Furthermore, the clause is deficient in that it does not set a limit on the total amount of assets that may be disposed of. The absence of such a limit leaves the Post Office open to a process of creeping privatisation and that is not consistent with the Government's declared objective to establish a publicly owned plc. Although I understand the Government's reluctance to place unnecessary restrictions on the Post Office that may impair its ability to form partnerships or make acquisitions in its commercial interests, it is essential that a cap be placed on the disposal. That should at least ensure that the state continues to hold a controlling interest in the company. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments about that. In all probability, a ceiling of no more than 5 per cent. would be sufficient to meet the needs of the postal business. That is the view of the Communication Workers Union, and the Post Office has stated that it could live with it.
<P>
It has recently been suggested that the Post Office is opposed to a limit on the size of any share disposal or future joint venture. That seems to contradict the comments of the Post Office chairman to the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, so I ask the Minister to tell us when the Post Office opposed the cap on share disposals, if it did so. Who made that statement? Are there documentary records of it?
<P>
The Minister states that the Post Office needs maximum scope to form partnerships and make acquisitions in its commercial interest. Will he tell us of any joint ventures in the postal industry or other industries that have involved more than 5 per cent. of the company's total share capital? If the Government cannot live with a 5 per cent. cap, at what level would they be prepared to cap the disposal of assets?
<P>
The Government's failure to convincingly argue about their opposition to any cap on the disposal of assets undermines an excellent Bill overall. If the Bill were enacted with clause 56 in its current form, legally any proportion of shares in the Post Office could be subjected to future disposal. That could mean anything—90 per cent. Or 99 per cent. of the shares.
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister considered my concerns about the case for a cap on share disposal and introduced new proposals on Report. As he is aware, my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton) and I tabled an amendment, but did so too late for the Committee to consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> There is clearly grave unhappiness on the Government Benches about the clause, and the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Miss Smith) has at least had the courage to say so. Her thoughts would probably be echoed by the hon. Members for Derby, North and for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle), and perhaps by some other Labour members of the Committee.
<P>
Anyone who read The Times on Monday can see that there has been a burst of activity—a flutter in the dovecots—between the Department of Trade and Industry and the unions on the matter. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Bob Laxton, MP for Derby North, and a member of the Trade and Industry Select Committee, will meet Alan Johnson, the minister responsible for the Post Office, tonight to call for measures to prevent share swaps.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I look forward to the day—it will not be long—when the fragile coalition of the Labour party splits into the old rebels and the new robots. We have some elegant old rebels, and now I shall not be able to label the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale a new robot. She can clearly think for herself and has the courage to say so.
<P>
If Labour members of the Committee have real courage, they will join us in voting against the clause standing part of the Bill. That would require the Minister to return on Report with a clear picture of what he intends to do. The promise that he has given the world is that the Post Office will have genuine commercial freedom, but it will not if it must ask permission from the House of Commons for a share swap. He may have good reasons for that, but that does not constitute commercial freedom. It constitutes the possible political restraint of the Post Office's commercial activities, for reasons that he will no doubt eloquently explain But it is not commercial freedom.
<P>
The obverse of that argument is that Labour Members are extremely worried that behind the clause lies the risk of piecemeal privatisation. We would welcome the disposal of most of the shareholding in the Post Office, and we are open and honest about that. Labour Members are perhaps equally honest in saying that they do not advocate that. I suspect that the Government are bang in the middle, and want to give the impression that they do not favour it, but nevertheless hope to achieve it step by step. Every privatisation that they have opposed in the past they have since promoted and put into effect. Whether they are dealing with National Air Traffic Services or another service, the Government will privatise, although they pretend that they will not.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
This is probably a scam: the Government want to privatise but do not dare say so. They have been rumbled by their hon. Friends, and the clause enables them to privatise. It is the worst of all worlds—a creeping privatisation that Labour Members oppose, and a lack of commercial freedom because the Post Office will have to gain approval for a share swap through a statutory instrument. It is a recipe for complete disaster. On what basis will share swaps take place? What fraction of the 100 per cent. plc shareholding might over the next five or 10 years be swapped out? Does the Minister believe that it is ever acceptable for the Government, through share swaps, to become part owners in what will probably be overseas ventures? In light of our previous debate, if the Secretary of State were to own other people's shares, how might those shares subsequently be disposed of?

<P>

<B>Mr. Bob Laxton </B>(Derby, North): Unlike the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, I am not worried about the privatisation of the Post Office. I was more than happy with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's unequivocal statement on Second Reading that in the life of this Government no primary legislation will be introduced to sell the Post Office. However, I am slightly worried about some of the issues involved in clause 56. Nevertheless, I must counterbalance that with some of the practice to date. Only recently, a collaborative arrangement was made between the Post Office and the Dutch and Singapore post offices. Of that global joint venture, 50 per cent. of shares are held by the Dutch post office, and the balance is shared between the Singapore and British post offices. No share swap arrangements were involved, and the three businesses do not share equity. I counterbalance that against my anxieties.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale referred to the statement by the chairman of the Post Office, Neville Bain, to the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, of which I am a member. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Let us just remind ourselves that the White Paper sets out very clearly the position in terms of borrowings, £75 million per annum for the smaller acquisitions, and if we have a significant case to go forward that requires additional borrowing there is a clear way forward with that as well. If it did require something that was, in your words.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the words of the Chairman of the Select Committee
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>something akin to a share swap, it would not necessarily have to happen at the top level.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In a normal commercial arrangement in my experience this would be most likely to be something below the Post Office plc top line and would be a joint venture of some sort at a secondary level. This would not necessarily mean at least in the first stage a share swap at all and certainly that would be a practical way forward We would be able to do that within the confines of the White Paper.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The only other thing that I have got to say is guess in terms of the plc status that if we had full plc status we would have had greater flexibility of issuing shares in the case of a major acquisition but that is not included in the strategic plan and I think we have a framework that we can work with.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have a question for my hon. Friends. What has changed, and has the Post Office repositioned its view? Does the statement by the chairman of the Post Office that it could work within the proposed framework mean that it has changed its mind? Is it hostile to a possibility of a cap on share swaps? We know that Opposition Members and the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton are clear that, given their way, they would sell off the whole Post Office, lock, stock and—as the Minister said—two smoking barrels. They would do so tomorrow, without compunction. We, and certainly I, are hostile to that. The Post Office is almost a great British constitution. I am also mindful of the universal service obligation that would, under 100 per cent. private ownership, have the potential quickly to disappear.
<P>
So I agree that we need some assurances. There are people out there who are less charitable than I, who view the process with suspicion and who perhaps believe that a 2 per cent. share swap, with an 8 per cent. here, a 10 per cent. there, with a joint venture thrown in, could mean, in theory, a disposal of shares that accumulates to more than 50 per cent. of the total capital share value of the proposed Post Office company I do not believe that that would happen, but I shall listen eagerly to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> The hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale mentioned creeping privatisation and the concerns about the status of the Post Office. I do not think that people in my constituency are concerned about issues such as share swaps and whether the share is 5 per cent., 7.5 per cent. or 6 per cent. Their real concern is the level and quality of service that they will get when the Bill is enacted. In particular, they are concerned about the integrity of the existing postal network service.
<P>
I should like briefly to raise an issue because it is a convenient opportunity to do so. I was approached last Friday about the post office in South Newington, a typical village in my constituency that is about 10 miles from Banbury. It has infrequent bus services—I suspect maybe one or two buses a week into Banbury—so it is not easy for pensioners and the elderly to access the Crown post office in Banbury or, indeed, sub-post offices in other villages. For some time, the Post Office has had a contract with Bill Fish, who runs the sub-post office.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not discussing the clause, which is about share swaps, not the post office network.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> It is about status and the status of privatisation. My point is that people are concerned not about share swaps but about the integrity of their post office. Consumers and pensioners in South Newington are worried that the service that they receive each week, whereby the sub-postmaster from the neighbouring village comes for an hour and a half to pay out pensions and benefits, will be stopped on the grounds that there is not a computer link in South Newington. The sub-postmaster from Milcombe said that he would immediately return to his post office where there was a computer link and enter up the entries there. We are talking rather grandly in Committee about share swaps and the future, whereas the rural postal network rather than being improved, will be cauterised. That is sad and I shall write to the Minister about it. I hope that the Post Office can be persuaded to look again at the facilities in South Newington. I am grateful to you, Mr. Maxton, for your indulgence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> True consideration should be given to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale. She expressed genuine concern about the provisions. Members of the Committee are concerned about jobs and the future of the Post Office, and rightly so. It is easy for Opposition Members to complain and say that the Bill does not go far enough, that it should concern full privatisation and that it is a back-door method. Those are fine words, but they want it both ways. One minute, they claim to be the champions and defenders of rural post offices throughout the country, and the next minute they favour full privatisation whatever the cost.
<P>
That cost could easily be the end of rural post offices, but Opposition Members do not worry about that. They fail to deal with such issues, but instead use throwaway arguments, such as ``Full privatisation is the way forward. We don't like what is going on. It is a recipe for disaster.'' But the recipe for disaster would be to follow their line of thinking, which is total disregard for the future of rural post offices and jobs in the rest of the postal industry. I admire my colleagues who are willing to stand up for jobs and for people within the Post Office, unlike Opposition Members who have no concern about such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> What have the hon. Gentleman's remarks to do with share swaps?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> The hon. Gentleman said earlier that share swaps were a disaster and that the Bill should be concerned with full privatisation. I am addressing his argument. If he has a short memory, I shall continue to help him to remember what he said. I have no problem with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I have every sympathy for the concerns expressed by my hon. Friends the Members for Morecambe and Lumesdale and for Derby, North, but let me put the debate into context. For many years, Labour Members have fought, not for the preservation of the status quo, but for a publicly owned Post Office with genuine commercial freedom. That aim was in our manifesto. It was our rallying call throughout the campaign against the disastrous proposals of the Conservative party. When introducing the White Paper to the House in July last year, the Secretary of State announced that the Post Office would be 100 per cent. publicly owned. He said that any attempt by a future Government to sell it off must be made under primary legislation. That is written into the Bill. My right hon. Friend said that, if the Post Office needed, as part of this brave new world of commercial freedom, to use a minority share disposal to cement a joint venture or an acquisition, such action would also require an affirmative resolution in both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I said that we needed to get the matter into context. At the time, two concerns were expressed both on the Floor of the House and by the unions. The concern about the commitment to further primary legislation if any future Government wanted to sell it off has already been answered. The other concern was about the monopoly limit. [Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North, having asked the question, should listen to the answer because he was a member of the Trade and Industry Select Committee to which Neville Bain gave evidence. That Committee raised one important point about share disposals.
<P>
The argument is not that the Post Office should not be given commercial freedom. Everyone accepts that the Post Office must have the freedom to make such disposals. There is no argument about that. My hon. Friend makes arguments about 5 per cent. or where the limit would be set. No one is arguing that commercial freedom should not be given. What the Trade and Industry Select Committee said in its report is the point that we tackled in an earlier debate about relevant subsidiaries. Its point was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is at the subsidiary level that joint ventures and partnerships are formed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We therefore had to take care of the point about defining relevant subsidiaries. We did that and we published our response. There was no mention of any concerns about the matter.
<P>
We have gone through months of dealing with the problem of the monopoly limit and share sales by a future Government and the need for primary legislation. I say that to get the debate in context because if my hon. Friends are not careful, they will fall into the beautifully manicured claws of Opposition Members, who have argued that the only way to give commercial freedom to the Post Office is to privatise it. That has been their constant mantra for the past seven years. Perhaps I can redefine a phrase that I was used to as a delivery postman—beware of the dogma. The fact that neither Baroness Thatcher nor the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) could privatise the Post Office, and a proposal was never put to the British people to privatise it, shows how much difficulty they had with that stance. Nevertheless, the Conservatives have returned to it now. I ask my hon. Friends to bear it in mind that we play into their hands if we say that we cannot give the Post Office the genuine commercial freedom that it needs unless we impose caps and ceilings. The Conservatives will say that the only answer is privatisation.
<P>
Why did I refer to putting the debate in context? My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North made a relevant point about the limit on the amount of money that the Post Office could borrow. He also said that he did not expect anything other than a joint venture in the first stages. If we were to talk to the chairman of the Post Office today, it would be clear that we were dealing with a constantly changing marketplace. I quote the eloquent words of the union of which I have been proud to be a member for the past 32 years. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mail services have been seen as predominantly domestic markets met by national operators. However, the growth of international mail, the opportunities for e-mail, and developments in the parcels markets are all leading to a more international marketplace that is likely to be dominated by a small number of global players or alliances. The British Post Office cannot afford to stand apart from such powerful trends. The present structure of the Post Office as a statutorily defined public corporation makes it very difficult for the business to form the alliances and joint ventures that are necessary in the fast-moving world of global communications. No corporation or company can do it all—it needs partners and these partnerships will take a variety of legal forms that are either frustrated or precluded by the current state of the Post Office''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Nobody wants commercial freedom more than the CWU because in representing its members excellently, as it always has done, it sees what is going to happen in the global marketplace.
<P>
We come down to a point of distrust. My hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale made a genuine point when she asked whether we could introduce a cap and assure people that the Post Office would not slip out of the public sector by default, through various tranches of joint ventures.
<P>
We will continue to look carefully at the matter to ensure that no stone has been left unturned. Our conclusion so far is that setting a cap, in legislation that is meant to last a generation, could create a situation that none of us can foresee at the moment. Things have already changed dramatically in the sector. My hon. Friend referred to the deal last week involving the TNT Post Group and the Dutch Post Office group, which purchased TNT. Deutsche Post has also purchased a share of DHL. Globalisation is taking place. Thanks to the Opposition, the British Post Office has been able to do nothing about that because it has been under constant review for seven years. The deal last week was crucial. Singapore Post linked up with the Dutch Post Office, which linked up with the UK Post Office. Whereas previously the trend has been towards parcels, particularly next-day delivery, which is the big growth market, it may turn to the letters market; liberalisation of that market may come from Europe by 2003. The Post Office did not on this occasion put any shares into the deal—it did not have any to put in—but TNT and Singapore Post talked to the Post Office precisely because they knew that commercial freedom was coming and the deal was cemented when the Post Office put in assets, which might at some stage be followed by the need to put in shares.
<P>
So the market is changing considerably all the time. If we included in the Bill a fixed percentage as a cap, that would mean that if there were a deal on the table that required 6 per cent., 10 per cent. or 2 per cent. above the limit set in the Bill and we had to go through primary legislation to secure it, the deal would be gone. Deutsche Post, or UPS, would have it. The Danish Post Office operates with a 100 per cent. publicly owned plc, as does the Swedish Post Office and Deutsche Post and the Austrian Post Office is being privatised, while New Zealand Post has complete commercial freedom—not to mention the huge private sector operators such as UPS, FedEx, DHL and so on.

<P>

<B>Miss Geraldine Smith:</B> What about a cap of 49 per cent.? While I understand and respect what my hon. Friend is saying about the problems and about globalisation, if there is no cap and deals go ahead and shares are swapped, the logical conclusion is that the Post Office will gradually be privatised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I will come to that in a moment. I will answer all the questions that have been asked, but this is an important debate and I want to put it into the context of what is happening in the marketplace. Government Members should be proud of carrying out our manifesto commitments on the Post Office, but we now find ourselves accused in some quarters of betrayal and all kinds of terrible treachery. We are merely ensuring that a deal that is within grasp, in line with what the CWU has said about the interests of its members—if one is not a global player, one will be doomed to gradual, if not quick, decline—will not require primary legislation.
<P>
The amendment that has not been selected suggested a cap of 5 per cent. My hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale makes a fair point in asking whether we can be assured that the Post Office will be kept in the public sector. The Government come at the issue from a simple angle. We have written into the Bill the provision that Governments can do nothing about commercial freedom or joint venture alliances. Under the clause, the impetus has to come from the Post Office plc. In a rather cynical remark, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, ``Oh yes, but the Government will have their hand up its back''. We are creating a company under the Companies Acts, which, under law, cannot be told to do anything. Under the clause, it will be in the company's gift to go to the Secretary of State and say, ``We want to go into an alliance or a joint venture''. That is the first step of the process.
<P>
So the company, not Governments, will kick off the process. A point was made about the national interest. The national interest and the interests of the Post Office are the same. To act in the national interest is to ask whether, in commercial logic, prohibiting a deal would position the Post Office poorly in the marketplace. The Post Office led the world by introducing the Rowland Hill principle, and it should not be put at a disadvantage now. The clause clearly states that the deal must be in the commercial interests of the Post Office. If the Secretary of State is convinced of that, the deal will be subject to an affirmative resolution in both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton says that that is nonsense, because it is the argument for privatisation. The Post Office would have no difficulty with the procedure, because it would plan for it in its negotiations. Parliament will decide on any deals, and we have given guarantees that the Post Office will remain in public ownership. Therefore, only a very suspicious, cynical person—perhaps one similar to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, although given the spirit of generosity in the Committee, nobody would suggest that—would think that we would privatise the Post Office by that route.
<P>
What Government would use such a tortuous route, through a small back door, to privatise the Post Office? The basis of privatisation is that the Treasury receives revenue from flotation on the stock market, and that would not happen if such a method were used. If anything, shares would have been undersold to forge the joint venture or alliance. To privatise in dribs and drabs, without all the benefits of privatisation, but with the requirement for Parliamentary approval and for each venture to be approved on its merits, would be inconceivable. Of course, the Conservative party says that it will privatise the Post Office, and we are happy for it to stand on that platform at the next election.
<P>
We talk to the Post Office all the time. The Post Office is not the only player, and it is not driving us down that route. We talk to the Post Office about how we can allay some people's reasonable fears that we might end up with a Dutch Post Office, or that what Charles I made a British asset in 1631 could be owned by another country. Can we do that with a golden share? Can we use the holding companies and subsidiaries? They cause complications. Would a 10 per cent. limit apply across the subsidiaries? Some might use 10 per cent., but others might use 20 per cent. to cement a joint venture. Having fought so long to give the Post Office commercial freedom in the public sector, we must not fail by restricting commercial freedom. The Dutch do not have those inhibitions. They have no caps, and they go out and do deals. The Danish and Swedish Post Offices are similar, and they are totally publicly owned. We must be able to act quickly and negotiate deals. The legislation will last a generation, and we are looking ahead not one year, three years or five years, but to the next 15 or 20 years. There were Post Office Acts in 1953, 1969 and 1981, and there is one this year. They are about as frequent as London Transport buses, although two never come along together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I will give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley, who made an important contribution in setting out where Labour Members stand, and should be proud to stand. We are opposed to privatisation, on behalf of the British public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister mentioned the golden share. Will he explain its benefits? Does it give assurances to people who work in the postal service, and to my hon. Friends the Members for Derby, North and for Morecambe and Lunesdale?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The golden share is worth exploring. As my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North will remember, the previous Government kept a golden share in British Telecom. The Dutch Post Office owns a golden share in the TNT Post Group. We do not think that it will happen, but it is impossible to say that different chunks, to the extent of pushing 50 per cent., will not be sold off in the future. The correct terminology is a special share, not a golden share. That it could protect the interests of the British public by ensuring that it stays a United Kingdom asset and not one that is diluted throughout the world is certainly a proposal worth exploring—as I shall explore other ways in which I can meet the genuine concerns of my hon. Friends. We have worked for the Post Office and know how important such issues are for not only the public, but those who work in the business.
<P>
We must carry out our argument in the proper spirit and recognise that we want genuine commercial freedom. Any move away from that, whereby the Opposition can say, ``Ah, but the Post Office will lose out in terms of the world players on the international stage'', will lead inevitably to the wrong argument that privatisation is the only solution. That argument has been used for the past 12 years and that fact that Conservative Members did not nothing about it says a lot about the competence of the previous Government, rather than their approach to privatisation.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
With that, I hope that I have given the Committee enough assurances. The clause must stand part of the Bill. It is an important protection, as was mentioned to no criticism in the House by the Secretary of State on 8 July last year. We want to ensure that such a provision is enshrined in legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The situation is unsatisfactory. Much scragging has been going on behind the bike sheds. That is clear for all to see. The debate has been a complete charade worthy of Gilbert and Sullivan; some hon. Members have attempted to get something in their local newspapers when, in fact, they do not have an intention of doing anything about such matters. Clearly, something has been going on and I shall give the Committee clear evidence of that. The Times reported that the Secretary of State had sent a fax to Mr. Hodgson, the General Secretary of the CWU, confirming that there will be no cap on disposals. I can at least commend the Minister on being consistent, as that was what he said to his hon. Friends. Despite their genuinely felt concerns, the hon. Gentleman has been unable to give them an assurance. I congratulate the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale on at least saying what she thinks. She genuinely does not like the fact that there will be no cap on the potential disposal of shares in share swaps.
<P>
Naturally, I should like more genuine commercial freedom and the open and honest disposal of shares. In the meantime, with such an awkward halfway house, there is unhappiness in the Minister's own ranks. Will he confirm that he will circulate urgently to all members of the Committee the letter that was sent by the Secretary of State to Mr. Hodgson. It should be a matter of open record. Given that it was reported in The Times, members of the Committee should be able to read it.
<P>
The Minister should understand that we have grave concerns that the CWU is attempting to change the Government's policy. In the face of what has so far been a refusal on the part of the Minister to change policy, it is threatening to withdraw its contribution of £500,000 to the Labour party. It is a pretty mucky state of affairs. Much is going on behind the scenes that should worry the public.
<P>
However, for the first time in Committee, we have heard three Labour Members express concern about the structure of clause 56. We shall do them a favour. We shall press the matter to a Division and vote against clause 56 standing part of the Bill. I hope that we shall be able to write to the local papers of those three Labour Members and their association chairmen commending them for the courage of their conviction in pressing the matter to a Division in defiance of their Whips to show that they genuinely have the courage of their convictions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> Stick to scragging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> That was an interesting contribution to the debate. Scragging never cropped up in Bevington road primary school, Notting Hill. We did a lot of things, but I do not think that we scragged. Labour Members act in a civilised fashion. Lots of words have been associated with us, but not scragging.
<P>
It is interesting to note that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton believes every word that he reads in the newspapers. In response to his question about circulating the letter, I shall ask the people who sent and received the letter whether they object to its circulation. I have no objection to the Committee having access to any document that is relevant to its deliberations.
<P>
I said that we should beware of the dogma, and we have just heard it full scale. Opposition Members did not privatise, being all mouth and no trousers, for the first 12 years. They did not mention privatisation in their manifesto in 1992. Subsequently, they tried to privatise, but backed off in the face of fierce opposition. Moreover, although they had the power to agree to the Post Office participating in a joint venture to ran Railnet, the Post Office was forced to buy a complete train set, because Opposition Members, then in government, did not agree. Every bit of licence that the then Government had to approve a domestic alliance or a joint venture—they had no power in relation to international agreements—was refused. They rejected every application. They hiked the external financing limit up to £1 billion in three years, and forced postal tariffs up to 26p. It is from the Government, and, to be fair, the Liberal Democrat, Benches that we shall hear any sense or logic in debating the future of the Post Office.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Borrow </B>(South Ribble): Does my hon. Friend agree that the impetus for privatisation for the Conservative party was not greater commercial freedom but dosh for the Treasury?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I entirely agree. Indeed, ultimately, the previous Government wanted to break up the Post Office and separate Counters, removing all the synergy of its being part of the bigger organisation, which proved that the policy was designed only to raise cash.
<P>
Clause 56 is crucial, because it fulfils our commitment, made in Parliament, that we would insist that, in the event of any shares being exchanged to forge a joint venture or alliance, the Post Office would give an explanation to the Secretary of State, who would refer the matter to both Houses of Parliament. Opposition Members want to remove the clause because they believe, as they have clearly stated, that it will be too much of a constraint, and that parliamentary approval should not be necessary for swapping shares. We believe that such approval is necessary. It would place no constraint on the Post Office's commercial activities, while a cap on share sales would. As my hon. Friends the Members for Derby, North, for Chorley and for Morecambe and Lunesdale said, we should continue to listen and try to find a solution to such problems, not out of a sense of anxiety that Opposition Members pick up lurid stories in newspapers, but because we want to do the best for the Post Office on behalf of the British people, the company itself and its work force as excellently represented by the CWU, the Communication Managers Association and the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I will explain the purpose of the amendments briefly. My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton will set out the arguments in greater detail. We want the Secretary of State to define more clearly his policy in relation to the making of loans. We want to know about the basis for his decisions, the size of the loans and his remit.
<P>
Obviously, we want the Post Office to be in a position to compete on worldwide, but that should be on the basis of fair play. I have to smile when the Minister appeals to us to accept that everything will be clear, transparent and above-board. The Government have spun so many stories that they go through 360 degrees every day. The Minister talks about the independence of the Post Office as a plc, able to boldly go wherever it wants. To him, I say, ``Dream on.'' As we know, the borrowing of anything more than £75 million requires the authority of the Secretary of State and the approval of the Treasury. If that is not controlling the decision-making process, I do not know what is.
<P>
The clause will empower the Secretary of State, with Treasury approval, to make loans to the Post Office, once it becomes a company, and will provide for the required lending to be supplied by the national loans fund. It will apply all the way down the line—to the Post Office company or directly to any of its subsidiaries. If I were operating in the private sector and had to raise my money commercially, I would regard that as unfair funding for a competitor. The power to grant loans to the Post Office and its subsidiaries, such as the German Post Office and the Williams Group, is too broadly defined. The clause threatens to distort the competitive environment and will allow the Post Office privileged access to borrowing facilities. Such privileged access will not be available to those who operate without Government support. The amendment would ensure that only the Post Office and its relevant subsidiaries, as defined in clause 52(8), could benefit from such state loans.
<P>
The other amendments take the argument a little further. Amendment No. 23 sets a limit on lending by the Crown to the Post Office company and any of its subsidiaries. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare has disappeared, because he has a great affinity with the words ``reasonable'' and ``relevant''. The amendment should gain his particular approval.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 23 is not in this group. It is a separate amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am sorry. When I said amendment No. 23, I meant amendment No. 28. You will know immediately, Mr. Maxton, that what I was saying was in order in relation to amendment No. 28. I apologise for calling it amendment No. 23, and I am sure that Hansard will put my correction into the record and ensure that no one is misled.
<P>
My last point about this clutch of amendments is that the limit on borrowing should be set at a lower level. Again, we want to ensure that the Post Office operates fairly and does not gain an unfair advantage. I shall be greatly interested to hear what the Minister has to say about how we ensure that there is a level playing field—a terrible phrase, but we all know what it means—for competition in postal services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> My hon. Friend has pretty well said it all, but his point requires an answer. If there is to be genuine competition, there must be the fair play that he described and a balanced competitive structure that does not unfairly advantage one participant. The Post Office and any company associated with it may enjoy an advantage by being able to borrow at lower rates from the national loans fund than they could in a private market.
<P>
We need some assurance from the Minister that there will be a broad measure of equity in the source and costs of funds. That is important not only for the basic fair play that we want introduced, but because challenges may be made from within the European Union about the competitive advantages that those associated with the Post Office might enjoy. They might compete in other activities outside the United Kingdom but they will enjoy advantageous funding from the UK Exchequer. We seek an explanation sufficient to convince us that there will be equity and fair play.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I hope that I can do as the hon. Gentleman requests. The fundamentalist wing of the Conservative party says that it is impossible to take such action in a publicly owned Post Office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Principled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> It is not a principle that inhibits the French or the Dutch. Most Dutch success in building up postal services was within the public sector. The principle does not affect the Swedes or other Scandinavian countries; it is only in the UK that one cannot have commercial freedom in the public sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> To put it delicately, the Minister is being disingenuous. He knows that our Treasury rules operate on a different basis. Telia in Sweden can borrow from the commercial market without the same form of guarantee. He must accept that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I once had to tackle the complexities of the Ryrie rules. These are not political laws of gravity. It is possible to have commercial freedom in the public sector. A chunk of a 1994 Green Paper produced by the previous Government was dedicated to the reasons why one could not, but they were problems that any Government with a will could have dealt with easily. We now have such a Government, as my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Mr. Colman) knows. He worked for a long time in the private sector and has first-hand experience of the business world.
<P>
We spent hours trying to prevent the Liberal Democrats from removing the word ``relevant'', and now we shall spend time trying to prevent the Conservatives from including it. The amendment would alter the definition to be about relevant subsidiaries, so that any subsidiary that did not fall into that category could not borrow money. The speeches, especially that made by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, contained fair points. Those points were raised on Second Reading, and I hope that I can reassure him.
<P>
Borrowing from the national loans fund will be at commercial rates to ensure fair competition with private sector companies. There will be no hidden advantage for any of the subsidiaries. Similarly, should the Government guarantee any financial obligations of a subsidiary, they will do so on commercial terms.
<P>
In principle, the Post Office and its subsidiaries will have power to borrow from either the Government through the national loans fund, the commercial markets. It has been argued that borrowing from the commercial markets would impose additional disciplines that could offset the additional cost that that could be the answer to the question of the level playing field, a terrible term of which I agree that we are heartily sick. However, the markets will regard such borrowing as being at least implicitly underwritten by the Government, and so it is likely to confer little, if any, additional discipline. The Government's intention is that borrowing will be from the national loans fund, as that will provide better financial discipline and value for money, and be more cost-effective for the taxpayer. To ensure that the Post Office competes fairly with other postal operators in the private sector, and to reinforce commercial disciplines, the Post Office will borrow from the national loans fund at a rate broadly comparable to the rate that it would be charged in the market without an implicit or explicit Government guarantee. The Government will seek independent advice on the appropriate rate.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not like to interrupt the Minister, but I think that he is beginning to speak to amendments Nos. 24 and 25, which we shall debate later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The Opposition raised those points, so perhaps I can return to them on the relevant amendments. I reassure the Committee that the provisions in the Bill will create no unfair advantage. We merely intend to follow through our commitment to give greater commercial freedom to the Post Office and to create a more commercial balance sheet for it. The amendment would confine the ability of the Post Office to borrow. It would restrict it to certain subsidiaries so the amendment would be a step back. I ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister has dealt with our concerns about equity. Amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 25 are allied to our present discussion, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 23.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Not moved. I beg to move amendment No. 24, in page 31, line 42, leave out from `section' to end of line 43 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`at 0.5 per cent. per annum above the lowest of the standard rates described in subsection (2A).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 25, in page 31, line 43, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2), the standard rates are the rates (expressed as an annual percentage rate) at which three of the reference banks are offering Sterling deposits in comparable amounts for comparable periods to leading banks in the London interbank market at or about 11.00 a.m. (London time) on a day within a calendar month before the day on which the loan is proposed to be made.
<P>
(2B) If the Secretary of State determines that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the standard rates described in subsection (2A), interest shall be paid or loans made by the Secretary of State under this section at the annual rate equal to the average cost to three of the reference banks of funding the loan by whatever means the reference banks determine to be most appropriate plus a further 2 per cent.
<P>
(2C) For the purpose of subsections (2A) and (2B) the reference banks are three of the seven largest institutions authorised under the Banking Act 1987 and incorporated in and carrying on deposit-taking business in the United Kingdom.
<P>
(2D) The size of an institution is to be determined by reference to its total consolidated gross assets denominated in sterling, as shown in its last published audited end-year accounts.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We want to amend the provision about loans by the Secretary of State to the Post Office and its subsidiaries to ensure that interest paid on loans is identical to the interest paid on-similar loans to other postal operators. That is similar to what the Minister has said, but I hope that he can persuade us that the sort of stipulation that we want to define is sufficiently provided for elsewhere in the Bill. That would give us the comfort that we seek.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I am surprised that the amendment is so rigid and formulaic.
<P>
We clearly set out our policy on lending to the Post Office in the White Paper. As I inappropriately said in the previous debate, to ensure that the Post Office competes fairly with other operators in the private sector, and to reinforce commercial disciplines, it will be required to borrow from the national loans fund at a rate broadly comparable to the rate that would apply in the market. We have sought independent advice on the appropriate credit rating that would apply to the Post Office without an explicit or implicit Government guarantee and on the appropriate borrowing rates. We will continue to take advice as necessary in the future and to make the necessary adjustments in the light of market changes.
<P>
The rate of interest set by a lender for a commercial company seeking to borrow would depend on the credit rating of the organisation, the exact nature of the borrowing proposal, the current situation in the market and the size and duration of the loan. None of those factors would be addressed by such a rigid amendment. We intend to replicate that commercial approach and take those factors into account when determining the appropriate commercial rate for Post Office borrowing.
<P>
Perhaps this is a probing amendment, but the hon. Gentleman is seeking to be too forrmulaic in the means of determining the rate of interest applied to any lending to the Post Office company or its subsidiaries. That could seriously disadvantage the taxpayer and does not reflect commercial practice. Our proposal will ensure that the rate set for each loan is broadly comparable with the rate that the Post Office would be charged in the market, but without relying on a predetermined formula that will be set in concrete for a generation under the Bill. The interests of the taxpayer and those of the Post Office's commercial competitors will be safeguarded. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. He must now be aware of its pitfalls. If not, I hope that the Committee will reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Commercial freedom implies that there are commercial terms for the other side, too. If the company will be allowed to operate in the commercial world, it should be subjected to the same commercial restraints and conditions as those complied with by the other side. The Minister said that the terms available to the Post Office would not contravene European competition regulations. There are several aspects to loan conditions if they are to operate commercially, such as interest rates and repayments. Banks do not think of a figure; they balance risks and rewards. It is a strange situation in a sense: if the Government are standing behind the loan, the risk will be minimal. Some would say that it would be non-existent.
<P>
However, the reward that is being sought is one that is based on the fact that, if the organisation were in the commercial world, it could go bust and the bank might lose some money. Under a commercial loan, a risk-and-reward profile or a fear-and-greed profile is instituted, and a loan agreement with certain levels of interest rates and repayments is drawn up. There is a unique situation under the Bill when the risk and reward are different. The risk would be relatively minimal; the reward—through the interest rate and so on that was achieved on the loan—would be significant if it were commercial.
<P>
I come now to the real risk and the nub of the problems. There are three different styles in which the Post Office could be run under full privatisation. Such aspects do not exist, because it is into full commercial freedom and full operation; it will raise its money on the market. Risks and rewards will be worked out and matters will be precise. The model of the Government and that of the Liberal Democrats are not as clear. The national loans fund will charge an interest rate that will be broadly similar to that of a commercial concern. Will that interest rate be one that the company could obtain in the marketplace bearing in mind that the Government would be standing behind it and that the risk would be minimal, which presumably the reward should reflect? Alternatively, will it be a fully commercial operation as if it stood alone in its own brave world and perhaps be able to fail or be picked up by another company if it were about to fail? The amendments are trying to clarify those technical details.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts our argument. The Government will always be regarded as the lender of last resort. If it were said that the Post Office could borrow on the open market, technically the Bill will allow that. We are saying that it should borrow from the national loans fund. That would be the uneven playing field.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked what the interest rates might be. We would take independent advice based on all the factors of the loan in question, which is the problem with a formulaic proposal as in this amendment, and the interest rates would depend on the size of the loan, the duration of the repayments and many different features. We would take independent advice on what the interest rates should be and they would be set at the market rate. We believe that the Post Office would have a distinct advantage if it borrowed on the open market, albeit it at the market rate, because the Government would be seen either implicitly or explicitly as being behind the loan.
<P>
Our expert advisers tell us that even if the Government declare that they do not stand behind the Post Office, people will not believe them and the Post Office will still get preferential rates from the private sector. We will set a commercial rate through the NLF on the basis that there is no Government backing. That is the fair way to do it. It is the way to ensure a level playing field in a market in which there are 4,000 private sector operators. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it is convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 134, 145 and 146.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> This is again a technical amendment and it improves on the wording. In clause 57, what we are seeking to amend relates to subsection 7, which rather tortuously says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Such sums may be issued in sterling or in a currency other than sterling (whether or not the loan is to be in that currency).<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 32, line 38, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Any statement under subsection (4) shall include a statement of—

(a) any amounts received by the Secretary of State during the financial year concerned in or towards repayment of, or as interest in respect of sums paid by him in fulfilment of any guarantee given under subsection (1), and
<P>
(b) any amounts outstanding at the end of that year in respect of sums so paid by the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are clarifying the scope of the information that the Secretary of State must include in his annual statement to Parliament in respect of any sums paid in the fulfilment of a guarantee. This amendment makes it clear that he will have to include information as to the amounts repaid by the Post Office or its subsidiaries in respect of sums issued by him under a guarantee and the amounts of the repayments still outstanding. Those statements will cover both the principal and interest. The intention is to leave no doubt that this information should be included in the account as an aid to public accountability. We believe that the Bill as originally drafted left this ambiguous and that it is proper for us to clarify that.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The clause gives the power to the Secretary of State to give guarantees in respect of the financial obligation on the Post Office or its subsidiaries. The clause removes the fig leaf behind which the Minister has been endeavouring to hide for so much of the proceedings on the Bill. We have been hearing about the independence of the plc, so that it will be able to do this, that and the other, but when it comes down to it, the Post Office will be in the traditional position that has always applied to our nationalised industries. It says on page 16 of the explanatory notes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is not envisaged that this power''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
—that is, the guarantees—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would be used often in the Post Office's case.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The fact is that when it comes to the commercial crunch, it is unfair that somebody in the private sector will not have such support, but the Post Office will have big brother telling it what it can and cannot invest in. That is why we believe that a free and privatised Post Office is the best way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> We are in the realms of dogma. I do not know whether my fig leaf will help me when I am scragging. In fact, there is no fig leaf; we are being very open. We want the Post Office to remain publicly owned and accountable. We want the Crown to continue to own it, as it has done for the past 370 years. We do not believe that that inhibits commercial freedom. We are giving the public an assurance. According to any opinion poll that one cares to look at, between 90 per cent. and 99 per cent. of the public support a publicly-owned Post Office. The legislation carries forward the principle of the Post Office Act 1969 that the Crown may guarantee borrowing from a source other than the Government. That also follows Treasury guidance; it is usual practice for nationalised industries that are borrowing from non-Government sources to obtain a Government guarantee to secure the cheapest possible funds for the public sector. It is all about best value for the taxpayers, who own the Post Office.
<P>
I understand the banter that will carry on throughout the debate—I will doubtless always be spinning, scragging or wearing a fig leaf. I hope that we are being as open as we can about our intentions. We are creating a public sector Post Office that has commercial freedom. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<H4><center>Clause 59</center></H4>
<H4><center>Extinguishment of certain liabilities</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The clause is slightly wide in that it gives the Secretary of State power to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``extinguish all or any of the liabilities of the Post Office company or''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
—here is the rub—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any of its subsidiaries.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It gives the Secretary of State sweeping powers to write off debt, which may have come from the national loans fund, perhaps for subsidiary activities that have little to do with the main purpose of maintaining a post office network. If Post Office Sandwich Bars Ltd, for example, started up in some old post offices and turned out to be a fantastic failure, the clause gives scope for the Government to write off the Post Office's liabilities—there are echoes in that of De Lorean, of the National Enterprise Board and of all sorts of unfortunate examples of Governments trying to get involved in commercial activity or leading a company associated with the Government into poor commercial investments that they then write off—or which, put differently, the taxpayer has to bail out.
<P>
I am worried about the wide scope of ``subsidiaries''. Perhaps the Minister will want on Report to bring back ``relevant''—we are playing ping-pong with that word today. The clause suggests that any subsidiary, even one unconnected with postal services, could be written off if it did not perform well. If that were the case, it would be very unsatisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The clause is intended to support the restructuring of the balance sheet to place the Post Office company on a more commercial footing and allow benchmarking against its competitors. At present the Post Office holds on its balance sheet Government securities and deposits with the NLF that represent accumulated reserves, which might be viewed as accumulated dividends that were not payable to the Consolidated Fund.
<P>
The provisions of the clause are included to provide flexibility when decisions are made about restructuring the balance sheet. It may, for example, be used to cancel certain debt liability, with a view to replacing that debt with new debt that may better meet our and the Post Office's restructuring objectives, but without conferring any unjustified commercial advantage on the Post Office company. The Post Office has few debts, and we do not intend them to be cancelled. However, we need to ensure that the balance sheet is restructured so as to ensure that the Post Office operates using best commercial practice.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton asked whether we would return, God forbid, to the word ``relevant''—I forget whether its insertion or removal is proposed. The clause will apply to all subsidiaries. It will provide flexibility in restructuring the balance sheet, which will require us, with the help of our professional advisers, to consider all elements of the business. It would be ridiculous to restructure the balance sheet and consider only relevant subsidiaries. We need to consider all of them. The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The purpose of the exercise is not to cancel debt, not that the Post Office has any—I hesitate to say that it has none, but if it has any, they are small. The clause is not intended to wipe those debts away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister may have allayed my fears. Will he confirm that what is envisaged is a possible cancellation of debt as a one-off act on transfer of assets into the new plc, and that the clause does not allow for the subsequent cancellation of debt for any ventures that might prove unsuccessful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am always wary of questions posed on such an important issue. My understanding is that we do not propose to wipe away any existing debt, but want to ensure that debts will be reconfigured in a more modern way in restructuring the balance sheet. We are concentrating on existing circumstances, not possible new circumstances. I believe that it would be a one-off exercise. If that is not so—indeed it may not be. I have thought about it again. [Laughter.] It is always good to reflect. It is likely that any liability cancelled under the clause would be replaced with other forms of debt as part of the restructuring. However, if it is not, we shall need to ensure that the cancellation of the liability is part of a commercial arrangement. I shall write to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton to confirm whether the clause relates to a one-off event and not the future.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Earlier in our proceedings, when we discussed quorums, we realised that specifying a particular figure in the Bill involved an arbitrary decision about amounts. That also applies in the case of debt and liabilities. Whether the figure involved is £1.2 billion, £1.7 billion or £5 billion, an element of arbitrary choice is involved. A massive increase is proposed. A large amount will be retained on the Exchequer's books, as distinct from those of private companies. How does the Minister picture and justify the regime? Why can the Post Office, off its own bat, as a company that has, as the Minister said only seconds ago, very little debt, not go freely into the commercial markets to borrow on proper commercial terms? Why must it have the advantage of being propped up in this way?
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises perfectly relevant points to which we referred on Second Reading. However, the amendment would put back the clock 19 years. The current legislation that was passed in 1981 set a limit of £1.2 billion that can be raised by secondary legislation to an upper limit of £1.7 billion on the Post Office's indebtedness. With all due respect, a limit that was set 19 years ago needs to be updated not only to reflect the changing circumstances over that time, but the fact that the Bill must remain relevant at least for the foreseeable future.
<P>
How did we reach the figure? In reviewing the ceiling on Post Office indebtedness, we sought the advice of our financial advisers on an appropriate limit on total indebtedness to the Government. The conventional indebtedness restriction imposed by the articles of association of nearly all public companies is a multiple of their adjusted share capital and reserves. Typically, large public companies have multiples of between 1.75 times and 2.5 times that baseline.
<P>
The Post Office's report and accounts for the year ending March 1999 shows that it had reserves of approximately £4,300 million and holdings of national loans fund deposits and gilts of about £2,500 million—to use English parlance rather than American terminology. In advance of detailed decisions on the agreed restructuring of the Post Office's balance sheet in 2002, for example, on the amount of shareholders' funds—equity plus reserves—that will be vested in the Post Office, or whether the Post Office should be capitalised with debt—by injecting that debt into its balance sheet following restructuring—and, if so, with how much, we took it as a reasonable assumption that the balance sheet would have neither investments nor debt at the time of its reconstruction. That would imply shareholders' funds of about £2 billion, assuming that there were no further revaluation of assets.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister is putting a good argument for the scale of debt in general, but not one strong enough for its being a debt granted by the Government. If it were money borrowed on the commercial market, his arguments would be valid. It is not a matter of going back 19 years. If we are going forward into true commercial freedom, surely that freedom should be exercised in free commercial markets, not on an increased scale with the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman wants to restrict the Post Office's commercial freedom by keeping the indebtedness at its present level. We used the argument about 19 years because we must ensure that matters are updated and put at a proper level to take the Post Office into the future. The hon. Gentleman was rather tortuously responding to the point about how we arrived at the figure. I was explaining that we did it on the basis of the financial advice that we received and said that we were taking the usual multiple of 2 to 2.5 times shareholder funds, which produces a range of indebtedness limitation of £4 billion to £5 billion. We have taken the top end of that and incorporated it into the Bill.
<P>
The limit is sensible. It is based on a commonly used formula for both the present and the foreseeable future. It will last the test of time. Any increase would depend on whether it was considered at the time that the Post Office could sustain a higher limit. That would, in any case, be subject to approval by the House of Commons. The amendment would take us backwards rather than forwards. In a sense, we had the same debate on clause 57. We explained then that it was fairer to competitors for the Government to loan the money and to ensure commercial rates and a level playing field. It is the same argument as that about national loan funds and indebtedness. To be free on the open market with explicit Government support and the Government as the lender of last resort would lead to an uneven playing field and militate against the objectives of Opposition Members. I hope that the Committee will oppose the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Our purpose was to probe the Government and work out how they obtained the figures. On the basis of what the Minister said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 60 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Amendment made: No. 136, in page 33, line 40, leave out `from time to time'.—[Mr. Alan Johnson.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The Minister expressed puzzlement at what I said about the lunchtime directive. At least Dick Turpin wore a mask. However, I may withdraw my accusation against the Minister, because the clause shows the iron hand of the state at work. The Department of Trade and Industry and the Treasury, which may be in an unholy alliance, clearly cannot let go. They cannot allow the Post Office to be a publicly run corporation, and must always be there, meddling in the background.
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State powers
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
of which the Government own 100 per cent.—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and with the consent of the Treasury, to give directions to the Post Office company . . .  to allocate sums to general reserves or to reserves for a particular purpose; and to reallocate those reserves to other specified purposes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The power extends to the reserves of the Post Office company's subsidiaries, and the Secretary of State may require the payment of dividends out of those reserves.
<P>
The Government can extract the dividends themselves. The Minister may recall his casual approach to the concerns that my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton and I expressed about whether the Post Office and its subsidiaries would be able to expand—amen to that. A subsidiary could grow to such a size that it is worth a lot of money, and then be sold off. The clause entitles the Government to take back that money. So much for independence. Regretfully, I think that the Government still want to run the Post Office, and will not let it go freely into the open market. That is another reason why full liberalisation should be put in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> That is not the aim of the clause, which is intended to facilitate the restructuring of the Post Office company's balance sheet on 1 April 2002. There are many reasons for that. For example, we want to ensure that there is no cross-subsidy between the reserved and non-reserved areas, so the balance sheet must be transparent. The balance sheet will be restructured to place the Post Office company on a more commercial footing and allow it to benchmark against its competitors. At present, the Post Office holds on its balance sheet the Government securities and deposits with the NLF. They represent accumulated reserves, which could be viewed as accumulated dividends that were not payable to the Consolidated Fund. The clause will allow the Government to extract an agreed amount in respect of those accumulated reserves, which consist of taxpayers' money. We are entitled to ensure that that money is distributed to allow the creation of specific distributable reserves, within the meaning of the Companies Act, from which the Post Office company or its subsidiaries can pay the Government a dividend which will be paid into the Consolidated Fund.
<P>
The Committee was remarkably free of hyperbole until the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire spoke. If that is the iron hand of the state, I must be standing before the Committee wearing a fig leaf.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> It has gone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> It is difficult to get rid of a fig leaf with the iron hand of the state. I ask the hon. Gentleman to calm down, take a glass of water and a couple of tablets and lie down in a darkened room over lunch. There is no iron hand of the state at work here, but simple, normal probity in relation to restructuring the Post Office's balance sheet.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 61, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clauses 62 and 63 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
