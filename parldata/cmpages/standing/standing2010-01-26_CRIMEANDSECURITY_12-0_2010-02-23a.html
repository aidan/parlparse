<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000528"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Alan Campbell):</b> I was responding to the
right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham who was,
unusually, promoting the notion of a ban-albeit a delayed
one-that would be introduced, ironically, through a statutory
instrument. Therefore, I assume that this is a rather academic
discussion.</div><a name="100223109000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100223109000529"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): The
Minister will recall that I suggested an amendable statutory
instrument.</div><a name="100223109000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000530"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Amendable, but a statutory instrument
nevertheless. That will not be necessary because the short history of
the issue shows that the Government have moved from the licensing of
individuals involved in wheel-clamping to the current proposals on the
licensing of companies. We have demonstrated our intent, and we would
not have got to this stage-a major part of a major
Bill-were we not determined to take the correct action that will
have the desired effect. I do not accept that we should have a ban,
albeit one that hangs like the sword of
Damocles.</div><a name="100223109000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall respond quickly to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent,
South, who suggested that we could avoid the problems if the owners of
private land simply fenced it off. We had a short discussion about
whether that was mainly a rural issue. It is an urban issue, too,
because there are many areas, including old people's homes,
hospitals and a variety of private land, that require some form of
parking control. There is a host of areas for which it would be
impractical to insist that if owners did not want people to park there,
they should fence them off. That is why we are making our current
suggestions.</div>
<a name="100223109000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Romford highlighted the need for the action we are taking,
because he gave a number of examples of the type of unacceptable
behaviour that we are trying to get rid of. These include release fees,
signage and so on, which will be an important part of the code of
practice.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div><a name="100223109000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to concentrate slightly longer on the comments made by the hon.
Member for Winchester, who set out a range of objections to the route
we are taking. I shall try to persuade his colleagues and others that
ours is the right route. He advocated that local authorities should
take control of the situation. Like the hon. Member for Romford, I
cannot recall from the evidence session that the representative of
local authorities showed a great deal of enthusiasm for the idea of
them taking this on. We kept coming back to the perennial cost question
and an acknowledgment that, were we to go down that route with an
entirely different model, there would be a cost involved. I am not sure
that the local taxpayer should pick up the cost. The way in which we
are proceeding represents a fairer and more proportionate
system.</div>
<a name="100223109000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100223109000531"></a><b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): I wonder whether
the Minister can recall any enthusiasm from the witnesses for the
Government's
solution.</div><a name="100223109000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000532"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that but, in fact, we
have been consulting on a range of proposals for some time. I accept
that nobody came out in complete support of everything that we were
doing. However, by and large, we have managed to satisfy a majority on
most of the issues raised in those sessions and during the consultation
process, such as what a code of practice would look like, or crucially
whether there should be an independent appeals mechanism. I admit that
at one point it was not clear that that was what we were
proposing-but we are. People often have their own views and put
forward alternatives. However, in the absence of a clearly more
acceptable alternative, I think that we have broad support for our
suggestions.</div><a name="100223109000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Winchester mentioned incentivisation, which we have
discussed before, with regard to whether there will be a great
incentive to carry out wheel-clamping to maximise profits.
Incentivisation might have an attraction now, because there is a fairly
open-ended and loose system through which people can make extortionate
profits, but part of what we are doing is to put limits on things such
as release fees and to address issues regarding what happens if
vehicles are impounded overnight and whether people have to pay for
that. Many incentives that might have been in place will not exist
under the scheme that we are advocating. The hon. Gentleman also
mentioned the need for an appeals procedure. As we will discuss later,
there will be not only such a procedure, but an independent
one.</div><a name="100223109000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also spoke about some entirely unacceptable examples of
people who were forced to abandon their cars during the bad weather
coming back to find that they were wheel-clamped. I cannot give a
complete undertaking that that will not be possible in the future, but
if we address issues such as signage and release fees, many of those
problems could be resolved. If Members of Parliament and others are
thinking about going to the companies and saying, "Surely this
is unfair," please remember that companies will need to have an
appeals procedure and, under the code of practice, they will also need
to have a complaints procedure. Beyond that, there will also be an
independent complaints procedure, through which I am sure some such
complaints could be not only heard, but
upheld.</div><a name="100223109000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000533"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> With regard to the appeals procedure and its
independence, who will determine the criteria that the independent
appellate body will have to apply?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div><a name="100223109000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000534"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The code of practice will set out clearly what
companies will be allowed and not allowed to do. It will deal with
issues such as how much had been charged, whether the signage was
adequate, whether there was information about whom one could complain
to, which company was responsible in the first instance, and how one
could get in touch with the appeals procedure. All that will be dealt
with in the code of practice. Therefore, in a sense, the independent
adjudicators will not only be addressing the code of practice because,
as we will get on to later, legal minds will be brought to bear, so I
am sure that they will be able to bring some reasonableness and common
sense to the
issue.</div><a name="100223109000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000535"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am sorry to press the Minister on this matter, but
it is important. An element of discretion will always be involved, and
I am trying to ascertain whether the independent adjudicator in the
appeals
process-</div><a name="100223109000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000536"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I ought to advise the Committee that we
are straying into the area covered by Government amendment 110 and
Government new clause 10. It is not strictly
relevant.</div><a name="100223109000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000537"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Given that the issue has been raised, Mr.
Cook, whether it would be convenient to deal with it now is a matter
for you. If not, I will postpone my comments-whatever you think
fit.</div><a name="100223109000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000538"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That would be the proper way to approach
it.</div><a name="100223109000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000539"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Then that is what we will
do.</div><a name="100223109000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000540"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The hon. Member for Winchester also raised the
question of self-regulation. We are not going down that route. He
talked about some of the problems that have arisen with ticket parking.
We are determined not to go down that route because we want to ensure
that our proposals have teeth. He also asked, as his defence of using
local authorities as the best route on this matter, whether the
proposal amounted to a licence to print money. I remind the Committee
that we intend to cap fees and, through that, to change business
behaviour.</div>
<a name="100223109000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
say-I do not think that this has been raised, but it is
pertinent to the whole of our deliberations-that while the
proposal is about changing the behaviour of the businesses currently
involved in vehicle immobilisation, it is also about changing
motorists' behaviour. The reality is that quite a number of
people who are clamped are clamped for valid reasons-they should
not be parking where they have parked. Therefore, we must have a system
that is
proportionate.</div><a name="100223109000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the hon. Gentleman expressed concern that if it was left to the
companies, and not the local authorities, the companies would simply
disappear, and rebrand and relaunch themselves. I have two points to
make about that: first, they would still need a licence if they
attempted to do that; and, secondly, the Security Industry Authority is
very experienced in dealing with such practice, because it has been
attempted in other areas of its activity. It is very good at holding to
account people who try to evade the rules and directors who think they
are being clever by setting up a different company. I am confident that
we are taking the right
route.</div><a name="100223109000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
restricting wheel-clamping activities to local authorities, new clause
3 would effectively ban wheel-clamping on private land, because of
course local authorities have no power to control parking on private
land. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>would be taking quite a big step if we went down that route. Some people
have advocated that as a way forward, but we believe that a system of
licensing businesses will deal with the matter more
effectively.</div><a name="100223109000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me briefly turn to new clause 27(1), which would ban wheel-clamping and
related activities, restriction and removal against a release fee.
Subsection (2) of the new clause would mean that an occupier of the
premises would be committing an offence automatically if anyone else
carried out wheel-clamping and related activities on his premises with
his permission. It would only require the occupier to have given
permission for the activity to take place, or for those activities to
be carried out under a contract for the supply of services to him. That
would not be the right approach. It is appropriate to allow
wheel-clamping on private land in England and Wales to continue. I know
that that is not a universal view, but that is our belief, subject to
the new controls on the wheel-clamping businesses. We want to strike
the right balance between the rights of motorists and the rights of
landowners, who are entitled to control or prevent parking on their
land. For example, businesses in a town centre or near a railway
station will quite reasonably want to keep their parking space free for
customers. We do not believe that we should limit their choice of how
they do that, provided that they comply with the law. We want to ensure
that the sector is regulated properly and that we get rid of
exploitation and excess, which is what our measures will do.</div>
<a name="100223109000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
27(3) would restrict the penalties available to a fine without the
option of imprisonment. As we discussed that matter earlier today in
relation to amendments 90 to 93, I will not go into any more
detail.</div><a name="100223109000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 30 would create a statutory requirement to make regulations that
would provide for a code of practice for the business licensing scheme.
The provision is unnecessary because the Private Security Industry Act
2001 already provides for regulations to be made whereby the Secretary
of State can specify the conditions to be attached to any licence that
the Security Industry Authority issues. We have made it very
clear-and I am happy to repeat it again-that we plan to
make regulations that will be the basis for a code of practice. We
expect that they will cover warning signs, release fees and a range of
other matters. We will put it in secondary legislation because, having
listened to a fairly lengthy debate both inside and outside the House,
we want to decide on the contents, and consult publicly on the details.
I hope that I have explained sufficiently why new clauses 3, 27 and 30
are not necessary, and I hope that clause 39 will stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="100223109000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100223109000541"></a><b class="B">Shona

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000542"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. In view of what has just been put on the
record, and given my 27 years of experience in the House, may I offer
the hon. Lady a small word of advice? In future, when choosing a seat,
make sure you are in full view of the
Chair.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div><a name="100223109000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000543"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> I have already taken that advice on board,
Mr. Cook, which is why I have moved from where I was sitting
this morning. I will now be able to catch your eye whenever I wish this
afternoon.</div><a name="100223109000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have sympathy with some of the new clauses about wheel-clampers. During
the evidence sittings, it became apparent to me that we do not really
need wheel-clamping firms. Whatever the Minister says about people who
park illegally, surely we do not need clamping firms to enforce
regulations. We should have a properly regulated ticketing system,
which I will talk about later.</div>
<a name="100223109000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that
we need good signage, limits on release fees and a code of practice,
but, as we heard in the evidence sittings, the fear of the RAC and
others is that the firms currently making a lot of money through
practices that extort money from people will move to ticketing. I am
sorry to say that the types of restrictions that we are introducing for
wheel-clamping firms will not read across to ticketing. The same firms
often carry out such practices. As we heard, they will put up a closed
circuit television camera and small, insignificant notices, and if
people overstay an hour's parking, they will end up getting a
parking charge disguised as a penalty charge
notice.</div><a name="100223109000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my area-part of my constituency is a seaside resort-many
visitors, as well as residents, keep getting caught out, because
private firms operate alongside local authority car parks. We have to
do something to prevent that leaching to ticketing. Those firms make
their money through excessive charges. The right hon. and learned
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham may correct me, but I believe
that there is absolutely nothing in criminal law that says that such
firms can issue excessive charges. There is no way that they can take
somebody to court or put points on a
licence.</div><a name="100223109000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000544"></a>Mr.

could technically be done would be for the owner to lodge a civil suit
for trespass. The unauthorised parking of a vehicle on private property
is a trespass for which, in theory at least, one could claim damages,
which would represent some form of rental charge. I think that is the
only legal process that would ever be available to an occupier of
private land in the circumstances under
discussion.</div><a name="100223109000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000545"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> I appreciate that clarification. It is,
therefore, correct that the firms rely on ignorance of the law by
issuing things that look, to all intents and purposes, like a penalty
charge notice. They have the same lay-out and use the same typefaces,
and they threaten to take one to court, even though they cannot do so.
I am worried that the unintended consequence of what we are doing for
the wheel-clamping firms-or vehicle immobilisation
firms-is that they are simply going to make their money in an
unregulated
way.</div><a name="100223109000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
realise that there are limitations in the Bill, because we are dealing
with the security industry. However, I understand that it is the
Department for Transport that would have to do something to deal with
ticketing if the firms choose to go down that road to make their money.
What discussions has my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary had with the
Department for Transport about those issues? Is there any chance that
we can address those worries on Report?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div><a name="100223109000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000546"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member
for Winchester, who cannot be here to listen to the Minister's
detailed and considered response to the points made by my hon. Friend
on new clause
3.</div><a name="100223109000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
listened carefully, but the bottom line is that the Minister is not in
a position to give any assurances. The Minister cannot assure the
Committee that someone who is clamped-whether legally parked or
otherwise-on a cold and windy night and not sure who owns the
land will not be fleeced by a wheel-clamper. New clause 3 makes the
matter clear; it is very simple and
straightforward.</div><a name="100223109000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may be right that local authorities would not be keen on the
responsibility if they were required to pick up the operating cost
themselves, but I am sure that there are ways and means of ensuring
that that would not be the case, and that those seeking support for
wheel-clamping, rather than the council tax payer, would pay the fee.
We would support making sure that there was no linkage between the
number of clamps applied and the fee that any company, local authority
or private contractor employed by a local authority could obtain from
the
clamping.</div><a name="100223109000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
the bottom line has to be whether the measure will work to protect
drivers in all circumstances. The Minister cannot assure the Committee
that what he is proposing, for which there was no great enthusiasm
among the witnesses, will do the job. When there is an opportunity to
vote against the clause, I shall certainly do
so.</div><a name="100223109000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000547"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> May I make this point to the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington? The problem about voting against the new
clause is that, in theory, we are left with nothing, which is bad news.
I would prefer the total ban, but I do not think that I shall be
allowed to vote for that and, in any case, I do not suppose I have the
big battalions. If we vote against clause stand part, we are left
without any form of regulatory regime, which would be bad news.
Although, personally, I am uncomfortable with the way forward and would
prefer the course of action that I advocated to the Committee, I shall
not be supporting the hon. Gentleman and I rather hope that my
colleagues will
not.</div><a name="100223109000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000548"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> We have been looking at the issue for some time
and I understand that there are different views about the best way
forward. Should local authorities be responsible? Should we ban
wheel-clamping in the first place? In reality, in many cases, private
landowners need some way of regulating parking on their land and, in
some cases, of preventing parking on their land. In the Bill, we are
cleaning up an industry which, as it currently operates, has many
examples of unacceptable practice.</div>
<a name="100223109000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does
not, however, necessarily lead to the conclusion that there is no room
for wheel-clamping at all, which to some extent is a matter of choice
for landowners. If they go down that route, then by licensing the
businesses with a strict code of conduct, we expect the excesses to
disappear and the industry to be as responsible as it can be in the
circumstances.</div><a name="100223109000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of ticketing, clamping is dealt with because we are doing it
through the SIA-clamping is dealt with through the Private
Security Industry Act 2001, but ticketing is not. I have had
discussions with colleagues from the Department for Transport, in
particular when we were looking to secure an independent appeals 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>procedure and looking for models that we could
either piggyback or replicate somewhere else, but the issue of
ticketing is for them to deal with. In the Bill, we are dealing with
wheel-clamping.</div><a name="100223109000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington claims that I am not in a
position to reassure people that their circumstances will be better on
a cold and windy night, when they risk being fleeced. However cold and
windy it happens to be, unless there is adequate signage that is
informative about what can and cannot take place in that area, the code
of practice will be being breached.</div>
<a name="100223109000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">If by
"being fleeced" the hon. Gentleman means that people will
be given excessive charges for release, I should say that that will not
be allowed under the code either. If they are not happy and cannot come
to some agreement with the company if wheel-clamping is taking place,
there will be an independent appeals procedure which will have the
final say. Ultimately, if a company acts in the way suggested by the
hon. Gentleman, it risks losing its licence. If it loses its licence it
cannot take part in the industry in future. I am not as pessimistic as
the hon. Gentleman about the outcome of the
Bill.</div><a name="100223109000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000549"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I thank the Minister for giving way. How will he
ensure that drivers have a clear understanding of what they are
supposed to be seeing on the notices on this hypothetical cold, windy
and perhaps wet night? He cannot give those assurances. He cannot give
an assurance that they will know what is required to be on display and
therefore the risk of people being clamped in unacceptable
circumstances remains, because they will not be in a position to
challenge
it.</div><a name="100223109000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000550"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> That is precisely why we are consulting widely
and thoroughly on not only the question of signage, but what would be
on the signs. I take the point that if it is dark the signage needs to
be lit. Many people in all of our constituencies use car parks on cold,
windy and wet nights, but that is not an excuse to say,
"I'm not going to pay that fine because I could not
understand the sign". Those signs will have been worked out; the
lighting will be adequate. The machines will be clear, so there will be
no prospect of people's not knowing what their responsibility is
if they park their
vehicles.</div><a name="100223109000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100223109000551"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Rosindell</b> (Romford) (Con): The fact is that however a new
law on vehicle clamping is implemented, there will be problems to be
resolved. There is some consensus between the Government and the
Opposition on the fact that if we do nothing, we leave a problem
without a solution. Does signage need to be explained to every driver?
Everywhere we go on every highway there is signage. Surely it is common
sense that, if we park our cars somewhere, just as we do when we park
in a public car park, we check the signs to see whether there is a fee
to pay and what the rules are. If the Liberal Democrats oppose the
measure, a lot of people out there will wonder why. A lot of people are
very angry about the current law and they want it to be tightened. The
clause may not go as far as we would like, but it is a step in the
right
direction.</div><a name="100223109000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000552"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am grateful for that support. It would not be
the first time that the Liberals were on the wrong side of the public,
and I suspect it will not be the last. The public are not fools,
particularly when there is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>publicity for such issues, and they know what their responsibilities
are. I am sure that where there are anomalies or disagreements, if the
two parties cannot agree, there will be an opportunity to resolve those
matters once the complaints and independent appeals procedure is in
place. There are many views about how the problems can be resolved, but
we have produced a set of proposals that commands general support. I
hope that the Committee will support
them.</div><a name="100223109000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000567"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I beg to move amendment 173, in
clause 41, page 83, line 24, after
'telephone',
insert</div><a name="100223109000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">'or
any device capable of sending or receiving electronic
data'.</div><a name="100223109000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would tighten up the sensible policy of removing mobile
devices from prisoners serving custodial sentences and not allowing
them to communicate with the outside world. There is, however, little
point in doing that unless we ensure that other devices are also
unavailable to the prisoner. In the modern world, all sorts of devices,
particularly those that access the internet, allow people to
communicate with the outside world, so there is little point in
singling out the mobile phone, although we support that prohibition
wholeheartedly. With the amendment, we are asking the Government to
consider other devices that may be
used.</div><a name="100223109000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have seen examples recently of how other devices have been used and we
urge the Government to look at that before deciding what to do. Devices
nowadays can do a lot more than make or receive calls; many can access
the internet. There have been several incidents involving their use,
which we need to consider carefully. Murderers have boasted about their
life behind bars, which is something that no one in prison should be
allowed to do. Imagine the victim or their relatives knowing that the
murderer is boasting via the internet. We need to tighten up the
law.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div><a name="100223109000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
law should stop such people flaunting their crimes and taunting the
justice system. Only a couple of weeks ago, the murderer of Ben
Kinsella updated his Facebook page, writing that he wanted a remote
control to "mute or delete people" when he needed to.
That is another example of how an electronic device can be used in
prison to intimidate people outside. Less than two weeks ago, an
arsonist serving an indefinite life sentence updated his Facebook page
to describe a life of playing computer games, getting drunk on
home-brew and enjoying sleep-ins-mocking the innocent victims of
the crimes for which he was jailed. The Government should tighten up
the provisions and extend the principle, so that not just mobile phones
but other devices are covered. Recently, Ashley Graham in HMP Lindholme
updated his Facebook page
with:</div><a name="100223109000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">"HMP
Holiday's a place where men can come for a nice relaxin break
from their moanin women and crying kids. No stress just
rest."</div><a name="100223109000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mark
Elliot, who as part of a group savagely beat a father of three to
death, also had access to Facebook via a phone, and updated comments
and posted pictures. The problem is
widespread.</div><a name="100223109000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
are put in prison to lose their freedom and be punished for the crime
they have committed against society. It cannot be right to allow any
prisoner easy access to people in the outside world, to communicate
with them and perhaps work with them to commit other crimes or
intimidate people. Prisoners should not be allowed the same freedoms
that law-abiding people enjoy. That is a simple principle. I hope that
the Government will take that into account, reconsider, and accept our
amendment.</div><a name="100223109000126"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000568"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I rise to speak in support of what I think may be a
probing amendment to flush out the Government's thinking. If the
Government seek to ensure that it is an offence to use telephones in
prison because they are used to pursue criminal activities, thereby
discouraging that use, they need to bear in mind that there are many
other things that prisoners can and do use in prison for that purpose
that can be just as harmful, as the hon. Member for Romford set out. A
considered response is therefore required.</div>
<a name="100223109000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">This may be
another opportunity to briefly raise the fact that the most effective
way of tackling the problem of telephone calls in prisons is a
technical blocking device that can stop calls coming through, which is
being investigated. I will listen with interest to why the Minister of
State does not feel it necessary to extend the legislation to things
such as Facebook, which are clearly used by criminals to pursue their
criminal
activities.</div><a name="100223109000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000569"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I rise to support the amendment in its terms, but I
am bound to say that I do not entirely agree with my hon. Friend the
Member for Romford. I hope he will forgive me if I explain
why.</div>
<a name="100223109000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">So far as
the terms of the amendment are concerned, my hon. Friend is right. If
the definition of the mobile telephone in some other piece of
legislation is not sufficiently wide to encompass BlackBerrys, for
example-one of which I hold in my hand and on which I have been
busily communicating with various people during the Committee
sittings-it should be wide enough in the Bill. We all use
BlackBerrys and know that they can be used to communicate with the
outside world. They are not, on the face of it, mobile telephones,
unless 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>there is a definition of which I am unaware. My hon.
Friend is right to try to extend the definition to include BlackBerrys,
laptops and other equipment that is capable of communication with the
outside
world.</div><a name="100223109000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
I differ with my hon. Friend is as follows. I have a certain amount of
experience here, as many years ago I was Prisons Minister for two years
and I represent clients in prison, so I see a lot of prisoners. Over
the past five years I have seen 50 or so prisoners, usually in prison,
and I am familiar with prisons. One has to ask oneself an important
question: what is the purpose of prison? The purpose is to punish, but
the punishment lies in the deprivation of liberty. I do not believe
that that extends to all the ordinary facilities of life. We are
certainly not in the business of humiliating prisoners or depriving
them of education and work more than need be, and it is terribly
important that they retain contact with their families.</div>
<a name="100223109000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I absolutely
agree with the proposition that prisoners must be prevented from
running criminal activity from inside-that is clearly essential,
and often requires the confiscation of all mobile telephones, so that
prisoners cannot communicate with people outside. It is at least
arguable that they should be prevented from using mobile communications
to insult or humiliate people who have been affected by their crimes.
That is an interesting proposition, which my hon. Friend made, in part,
and I understand that some things that go on Facebook are abusive and
might upset victims. However, we need to keep in mind that prisoners
must be able to communicate with their families, and there are lots of
activities on the internet-accessing information and
learning-that I would want to encourage.</div>
<a name="100223109000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The secret
lies in the phrase "without authorisation". New section
40D(3A) of the Prison Act 1952, inserted by the clause, refers
to</div><a name="100223109000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">"A
person who, without authorisation, is in
possession"</div><a name="100223109000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">of
such a device. It is a matter for the prison governor. He or she should
have the ability to see what the prisoner is using the communication
device for. If the prisoner is using it for any of the purposes that we
have identified as being profoundly wrong, such as organising crime
outside, he should be stopped. If he is using it for the sorts of
purpose that the prison governor deems to be offensive to the victim or
whoever, he should be stopped. However, I do not accept the proposition
that we should stop all possession, because that will lead to a greater
punishment than I favour.</div>
<a name="100223109000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000570"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I respect entirely my right hon. and learned
Friend's views. My concern is how such a situation could be
monitored. When we have hundreds of prisoners in a jail, how is the
prison governor expected to monitor the use of electronic devices? That
question has to be answered. Although I agree wholeheartedly that
prison should not be used to humiliate people and take away their
dignity-they are entitled to a certain standard, as is every
human being-I am not convinced about the use of Facebook and
free access to the internet for non-educational purposes. Many people
cannot use modern electronic devices because they cannot
afford to do so. I think that many members of the public would be
rather concerned if free access were to be allowed in
prison.</div>
<a name="100223109000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000571"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I do not twitter and I am not familiar with
Facebook. I use e-mails, but I do not have a clue about Facebook and I
do not know what one has to pay to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>twitter. Those things are slightly outside the scope of my knowledge,
and I have not the faintest intention of acquiring such knowledge.
However, I go back to the broad propositions. It is wrong that people
should be able to organise crime from within; that clearly requires
them, in certain circumstances, not to have access to electronic
communications. I do not want them to say things on their electronic
media that distress the victim; I agree with that. But I do not go much
further than that. I do not want to restrict their ability to obtain
information about prospective jobs or deprive them of the ability to
learn about things that might be useful in later life. I certainly do
not want to prevent them from maintaining contact with their
families.</div><a name="100223109000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend made a perfectly fair point about monitoring. I accept
that, and it is not easy, but we have to decide where the balance lies.
My judgment is that it lies with the prison authorities. The prison
governors and officers in charge of the prisoners have to form a view
of the sort of characters they are dealing with, and generally
speaking, they do. When a prisoner has been in prison a long time and
has been reported on by officers over a period of time, they form a
fairly clear view of what they are dealing with. It is less easy when
people are being moved from prison to prison. I would leave it to the
good sense of the governor, without adopting-I hope my hon.
Friend will forgive me-the widespread objection that he has
raised. I would try to confine my prohibition pretty
narrowly.</div>
<a name="100223109000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000572"></a>The
Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr.
David Hanson):</b> I thank colleagues for their contributions
to the debate. I have some sympathy with the points made by the hon.
Member for Romford and I will certainly consider the amendment.
Essentially, we need to provide sufficient scope to ensure that mobile
phones and other electronic devices are not used by prisoners in
prison. That is why, when I was the Minister responsible for prisons,
like the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
was, I took through the Offender Management Act 2007, which banned
mobile phones being imported into prison. We do not want a situation
wherein prisoners, as well as maintaining contact with their families,
which is a noble cause, can undertake communication with the outside
world that is intimidatory and threatening, and where murders have been
commissioned from prison by prisoners using mobile phones. That is not
acceptable, so we need to close that
loophole.</div>
<a name="100223109000494"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="100223109000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why this is not only a question of mobile phones being imported into
prison and the Offender Management Act 2007; it is about closing the
loophole so that individuals caught in possession of a mobile phone in
prison face an additional sentence, which is very severe, whether it
involves custody and/or other potential measures.</div>
<a name="100223109000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
great sympathy on that issue. If the hon. Gentleman withdraws the
amendment, I shall consider the issue so that we can draft an amendment
on Report that will catch up with a growing technology. When I was
first elected to this place 18 years ago, my mobile phone was this big,
and now it is that big-probably far too large; for the purposes

Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): Not
inches?</div><a name="100223109000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000574"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I was going to talk in inches, but I thought that
I would show myself as very old if I did that, so I resisted the
temptation.</div>
<a name="100223109000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
thing is the need to future-proof the situation to cover all the
electronic technology that will undoubtedly develop in the next few
years, which will affect mobile phone use. I shall happily look into
the issue if the hon. Member for Romford withdraws the
amendment.</div>
<a name="100223109000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington rehearsed an argument that we have
wrestled with for years in the prison system: how do we block mobile
phones as a whole? We have considered blockers, and have introduced
body orifice security scanner, or BOSS, chairs. If we can, we shall,
through the Ministry of Justice, consider the idea of telephone
blockers, but the difficulty is that prisons are often in urban areas
where, just over the wall, live people who have every right to use
their phones, which could be blocked. We have been looking at the issue
for some time. If the technology is appropriate, my colleagues in the
Ministry of Justice will certainly consider it. We have even
considered, through a range of activities, increased security and
checks, and a range of measures in relation to imports, through the
Offender Management Act 2007 and the Bill. We take the issue extremely
seriously.</div><a name="100223109000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are occasions when electronic equipment can be used for rehabilitation
purposes. The right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham is right: we want people to be able to use computers, think
about rehabilitation and look at job opportunities. In prisons, that is
undertaken in a controlled environment, under the auspices of the
governor. There are controlled circumstances in which such access can
happen. The provisions are essentially about stopping individuals from
making contact from their cells, through mobile phones, to commission
drugs, murder and intimidation.</div>
<a name="100223109000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000575"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I agree with what the Minister of State and my hon.
Friend the Member for Romford say about the undesirable use of mobiles
or BlackBerrys, but can I pose a question on a matter of
principle? The Minister said that he did not want such devices used in
a cell. I understand that. However, if the mobile phone were being used
exclusively to speak to the family-and this raises many
difficult questions-would that be objectionable?</div>
<a name="100223109000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer
may be that we cannot so confine it, or that we could not be so sure of
the bona fides of the prisoner that we could permit that activity.
However, what if those practical arguments-which are real and
substantial-were stripped aside, to enable us to ask a narrow
question? If we could confine the use just to calling the family, would
that be
wrong?</div><a name="100223109000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000576"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> That poses enormous difficulties for security and
the prison, and for the contact. Even if the right hon. and learned
Gentleman were to suggest a list of five phone numbers for the family,
there is no way in which we could assume that the person at the other
end would be the one who should be contacted by the prisoner. It is
very difficult to control the use of mobile phones in prison, and for
security purposes it would in my view be pernicious to allow their
use.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div><a name="100223109000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are methods for contact with families, through personal visits, and
there are regular numbers that can be put through normal phones that
are available on wings in prisons. It would be very difficult to give
sensible consideration to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's
proposal given the security issues in a place that is, as the hon.
Member for Romford said, ultimately about punishment as well as reform
and rehabilitation. It would be very difficult to
undertake.</div><a name="100223109000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000577"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> To return briefly to the issue of blocking, will
the Minister confirm whether there are time scales during which the
blocking technology is being reviewed, and whether there is an
implementation programme? He might need to write to members of the
Committee about that.</div>
<a name="100223109000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had a
conversation with someone who, until recently, was a prison governor at
one of the large London prisons. His view was that the technology
worked and that it was more a question of cost than of whether the
technology was effective.</div>
<a name="100223109000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000578"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I left the Ministry of Justice about nine months
ago when it was trialling the position on potential mobile phone
blockers. It is an expensive business, but the principle is that if we
can do it, we should. For me and for the Ministry of Justice, the
question was whether we could make the blockers effective so that they
worked in prisons. We need that element of security to know, first,
that the technology works in prisons, and secondly whether it would
have an impact outside prison. Both points are genuine issues that were
being looked at in the trial.</div>
<a name="100223109000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000579"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I have a lot of sympathy with the context of the
blocker. However, let me say to the Minister of State that when I go
into prisons, which I frequently do, I surrender my mobile, which is
put into a secure box before I go into the secure area. However, the
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington might wish to bear in mind
that outside the secure area, but within the prison, we do use our
mobiles to contact solicitors or families, or to call a taxi and those
sorts of things. That might be an obstacle to the use of the blockers.
Once someone is inside the secure area, that is one thing, but they
could be just outside it, where hitherto we have all used our
mobiles.</div>
<a name="100223109000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000580"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The key point is ensuring that the technology
works. If it works, it will be looked at. The trialling has been
ongoing. We are looking, and have been looking, for a solution, and if
we can block signals in a defined area we should do so. However, I do
not need to remind hon. Members that Wandsworth prison, Wormwood
Scrubs, Liverpool prison in my neck of the woods, and Manchester prison
are all next door to residential areas. So is Wakefield
prison.</div><a name="100223109000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000581"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> Chelmsford.</div>
<a name="100223109000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000582"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Indeed-so is Chelmsford prison in the hon.
Gentleman's constituency. I had the pleasure of visiting about
50 prisons during my time as Minister, and I rarely went to a rural
location. Most prisons are in neighbourhoods and sometimes have people
living close by them in flats. The issue is difficult; we need to find
a technological solution that works.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div><a name="100223109000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The solutions
that we have brought forward have introduced scanners for when people
enter prison and increased security measures, training for staff and
severe penalties for when, occasionally, mobile phones are brought into
prison. Two years ago, a provision was introduced under the Offender
Management Act 2007. It means that if someone does manage to smuggle a
phone into the prison, through whatever means, or if they are caught
with a mobile phone in prison-and I could widen that to include
the amendment that looks at electronic communication
devices-they will face an additional custodial sentence. That
has to be a deterrent.</div>
<a name="100223109000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I am
honest, even with that measure there will be occasions when people will
try to get mobile phones. Once this legislation is passed, there will
still be those who think that doing so is worth the risk in order to
run their businesses from prison or to continue intimidation from
prison. We must be continually vigilant.</div>
<a name="100223109000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
guarantee that this clause will stop every mobile phone from getting
into prison. However, I can say that we are stopping mobile phones from
getting into prisons and that if individuals are found in prison with
such a device, they will face a custodial sentence. They will go before
the courts; ultimately, people will find themselves facing penalties if
they are caught.</div>
<a name="100223109000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must do
what we can to reduce the use of mobile phones in prison, not because
we want to deny people family contact, but because mobile phones in
prison are by and large used for purposes that are not supported by the
state and the Government. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw
his amendment.</div>

Rosindell:</b> I thank the Minister of State and I hope that
the Committee has been reassured by his comments. He has accepted that
it is possible for other modern electronic devices to be used to
communicate for illegitimate purposes outside prison, and I am pleased
that he has said that the loophole should be closed. On the basis that
the matter will be looked at closely and considered in the way that has
been outlined, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="100223109000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

</i><i class="I">Bill.</i></div><a name="100223109000029"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
42</h4><a name="100223109000008"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Offence
of allowing minors access to air
weapons</div><a name="100223109000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000584"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I beg to move amendment 174, in
clause 42, page 83, line 33, leave
out 'take reasonable precautions
to'.</div><a name="100223109000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have moved swiftly to the subject of air weapons. Once again, it is an
area where I am sure there will be a degree of consensus. It is
absolutely right that no young person, whether they are 18 or 14,
should have access to an air gun or a weapon of any kind. An adult or
older person must ensure the protection of that child in respect of the
use of that air gun, and that it is properly monitored.</div>
<a name="100223109000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sadly, we
have seen many accidents in which a young person's managing to
obtain an air gun or weapon of some sort has led to the deaths of
either themselves or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>somebody else. There will be no argument from this side of the House
about the need to stop young people from using such weapons.</div>
<a name="100223109000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to give one or two examples. Last March, a teenage boy died after being
shot with an air rifle in a tragic accident while doing target practice
in his back garden. In 2007, Mitchel Picken, who was only 12, was shot
dead when his friends were playing with the family air rifle. One has
to ask oneself what a family rifle was doing in the garden where very
young people were playing games. No responsible adult should ever allow
that situation to come about. Another example is from the same year.
Danny Marsh, aged 17-slightly older-was supposedly
larking around with two friends when their air gun went off
accidentally and killed him. That is where any right-minded person
would want to see a tightening up of the
law.</div><a name="100223109000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
if we are to tighten the law, we must ensure that we do it in a
practical and enforceable way. My concern about the clause is with the
words "take reasonable precautions"; that is why I tabled
the amendment. How is that to be done? I fear that putting those words
in the Bill weakens the position. It is better to make it absolutely
clear that it is the duty of the adult to prevent such an incident from
happening, rather than to take precautions.</div>
<a name="100223109000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">An adult may
claim that he has taken precautions when he may not have taken nearly
enough. Who is to judge what that phrase means? Unfortunately, although
the principle of the clause is, I think, supported by everyone in the
room, the fact that the words "take reasonable
precautions" are in the Bill weakens the clause and will not
lead to what we want to see-the end of accidents of this nature.
I hope the Minister will consider my point. The amendment would
strengthen the legislation, rather than allow it to be weaker, which is
what it is as it
stands.</div><a name="100223109000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000585"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Romford
will not take it personally when I say again that I disagree with him.
It is becoming a pattern of mine, and I apologise to him. I hope that
he will forgive me if I explain my reasons.</div>
<a name="100223109000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hold a .22
rifle and several shotguns, and I am duly certificated in respect of
all of them. They are held in a steel cabinet. Within the cabinet are a
couple of airguns, which I have had since I was a boy. The steel
cabinet is locked. We have to dispose of the keys somewhere, but let us
assume that a young person finds them, opens up the steel cabinet and
takes out the airgun. Is it right that I should be liable under
criminal law, having locked the cabinet and put away the keys securely?
The answer is manifestly no; I would have taken reasonable precautions
as required by the police. The fact that my precautions were undone by
a devious juvenile should not make me liable for a criminal
offence.</div><a name="100223109000495"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="100223109000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we accept the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Romford, we
would be adopting the principle of what is known as either strict or
absolute liability. As a general proposition, I am against strict or
absolute liability and I would confine it to the most particular and
special of circumstances. I hope that he will reflect that, while some
of his examples are perfectly sound, most people-like
myself-actually lock up their airguns, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>although it is not a strict requirement. We keep them in steel cabinets
and that seems as much as we can reasonably be expected to
do.</div><a name="100223109000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000586"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend makes a good
point, but my examples are not relevant to it. The guns were not locked
away. If the matter ever went to court, any reasonable judgment would
be that, if the owner of the gun had locked it in a cabinet and the
keys had been stolen, the act would not be considered irresponsible if
the owner had taken such
precautions.</div><a name="100223109000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000587"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Forgive me, but my hon. Friend is misunderstanding
the nature of his amendment. If it were accepted, the Bill would state
that</div><a name="100223109000477"></a><div class="hs_brev">"It
is an offence for a person in possession of an air
weapon"-</div><a name="100223109000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">such
a gun, when in a steel cabinet, is probably in my
possession-</div><a name="100223109000478"></a><div class="hs_brev">"to
fail to prevent any person under the age of eighteen from having the
weapon with
him."</div><a name="100223109000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend would be removing the "reasonable
precautions" requirement to say that any failure amounts to an
offence. In the circumstances that he clearly outlined to the
Committee, the owner of the gun failed to take reasonable precautions.
If we leave a gun lying around in our room, but someone takes it and
shoots a duck or, much worse, a person, there has been a failure to
take reasonable precautions. All such people are caught under what is
proposed. I am worried about the person whose reasonable precautions
were got round by the young person, but who is still made liable. That
cannot be
right.</div><a name="100223109000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000588"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The clause is all about prevention. I am
heartened to hear the reassurance from the hon. Member for Romford, who
is leading for the Opposition, that he shares our ambition to ensure
that weapons that can on occasion cause harm do not get into the wrong
hands. I am grateful for his offer of consensus with our
aim.</div><a name="100223109000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have two points to make about the effect of amendment 174. Clause 42
requires people to take reasonable precautions to prevent young people
from gaining unauthorised access to weapons. The amendment would remove
the requirement for reasonable precautions to be taken. That would
shift the effect of the offence because it would apply only after a
young person had gained access to an air weapon, and that could mean
that the damage, including a fatality, had taken place. That is not
acceptable.</div><a name="100223109000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to prevent the damage from being done in the first place, an
ambition that I am sure the hon. Gentleman shares. I am in favour of
using the law as a deterrent. The offence as he would like to amend it
could provide some kind of deterrent, but we want the police to be able
to take preventive action where they encounter an unsecured air weapon,
rather than wait for a young person to pick it up and risk a tragic
accident. I am sure that that would be an unintended consequence of his
amendment, but we do not want to wait for the accident or the damage
before action is taken.</div>
<a name="100223109000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
second point, I agree entirely with the right hon. and learned Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham and he argued very well from personal
example. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>amendment would mean that an offence would be
committed irrespective of any safekeeping measures taken by the owner.
We could end up with an injustice whereby someone takes every
reasonable step possible, including locking up the weapon in a cabinet,
and then somebody gains access to the keys, opens the cabinet, takes
the weapon out and causes damage. Therefore, it is our view that the
offence ought to be based on the failure to take reasonable
precautions. We believe that that would be both a fairer and more
proportionate response to the dangers we have mentioned, and would not
put such people, whom the right hon. and learned Gentleman made a very
responsible plea for, in that position.</div>
<a name="100223109000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis
that the amendment would have unintended consequences and could
penalise those whom we do not seek to penalise, I hope the hon. Member
for Romford will withdraw it.</div>
<a name="100223109000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000589"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I thank the Under-Secretary for responding to
what was a probing amendment. I felt it necessary to raise the issues
and have a debate, albeit brief, and it has been a valuable discussion.
I will withdraw amendment 174, but I urge him to consider the
definition of taking responsible precautions and how that will be
interpreted. Every one of us in the Committee Room wants every possible
precaution to be taken to ensure that a death in this way never occurs
again.</div>
<a name="100223109000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="100223109000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

withdrawn.</i></div><a name="100223109000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000590"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I beg to move amendment 142, in clause
42, page 83, line 34, leave out 'eighteen' and insert
'fourteen'.</div><a name="100223109000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a feeling that my hon. Friend the Member for Romford is not going
to agree with me on this amendment. I might sound a bit old-fashioned
about all this, but I think I had my first gun-a single-barrel
shotgun, 16. bore-when I was 10. My father was a lawyer and well
acquainted with the need to maintain public safety, but he had not the
slightest inhibition about giving me that gun for my 10th birthday. I
had an airgun, certainly access to an airgun, at about the same age. It
is important to keep in mind that at the age of 18 young people can be
serving in Afghanistan with modern weaponry on the front line, yet we
are saying that, in effect, a person of 18 should not have access to an
airgun.</div>
<a name="100223109000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be
clear about this. I accept that there are powerful airguns, especially
those that are pump operated; I also accept that some are capable of a
high penetrative power. Most airguns are not capable of that, although
they can cause serious injury-I do not dissent from that view.
They are the first weapon people have when they learn to use guns. In
the end it is a matter of judgment. I think that 18 is far too old. I
made the point that 18-year-olds are serving in Her Majesty's
forces in Afghanistan using the most modern weaponry. To then say that
that is the age necessary to justify possession of an airgun is,
frankly, disproportionate. Whether I am right in saying that 14 is the
right age when I had an airgun at 10 is a matter of debate, but I am
quite clear that 18 sets the age barrier far too
high.</div>
<a name="100223109000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000591"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> We established in the previous debate that the
point of the measures we are introducing is to safeguard people from
accidents involving air weapons; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>we are in common agreement about the need for that. I felt from the
right hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks that we were in
danger of rerunning earlier debates about the age at which it would be
appropriate for someone to have unsupervised possession of an air
weapon. Parliament has decided that. The age of 18 was set in the
Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, which was implemented in October
2007. I remember our long debates then, but Parliament decided that the
age limit should be 18. That is notwithstanding the arguments about
those who can use other weapons in theatres of war. That is why we have
chosen 18. It is the age the law sets out for unsupervised possession
of an air
weapon.</div><a name="100223109000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we have stipulated certain circumstances in which people can use air
weapons, but under controlled conditions. Someone under 18 can have
access to an air weapon and use it when they are supervised by someone
aged 21 or over; when they are engaged as a member of an appropriate,
approved target-shooting club or in a shooting gallery; or, aged 14 or
over, if they are on private premises with the consent of the occupier.
Clause 42 will not affect those arrangements. Indeed,
subsection (2) makes it clear that the new offence will not
apply when the young person is authorised to have an air weapon with
him in those circumstances.</div>
<a name="100223109000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would take away that precautionary element for people aged
15, 16 and 17. Our argument is quite simple: it is as appropriate to
secure against improper use by a 15-year-old as by a 14-year-old. The
potential for accident or misuse is the same, and that is why we resist
the amendment. It is both logical and necessary to have an age limit of
18, and the safeguards should apply. Our proposal does not change the
current arrangements for use by young people. Although he may not
agree, I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will withdraw
his
amendment.</div><a name="100223109000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000592"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I do not disagree and I will withdraw the amendment,
if only because I do not wish to suggest for a moment that there is any
dissension on the Conservative Benches. I have a feeling that my hon.
Friend the Member for Romford may not agree with me on this issue, in
view of what he has said in other debates. As the Conservative party is
entirely united on all major issues, this is not a moment to suggest
otherwise. I therefore beg to ask leave-having said that, the
Committee may deny me leave-to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="100223109000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Scotland).</i></div><a name="100223109000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000594"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government new clause 10-<i class="I">Charges for vehicle release:
appeals.</i></div><a name="100223109000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000595"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> We return to wheel-clamping and the important
matter of an independent appeals procedure. The Committee is well aware
of our intentions in relation to wheel-clamping. The Security Industry
Authority will issue licences to businesses and there will be a code of
practice covering issues such as fees for clamp release, towing and
impounding, rules on signage warning motorists that they risk being
clamped, time limits for towing vehicles, and other conditions
governing the circumstances in which a fee can be charged. It will also
cover things such as methods of payment, record keeping and the proper
consideration of complaints, which is a crucial part of our
deliberations.</div><a name="100223109000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make it clear that we would expect, as part of the code of
practice, that individual businesses, as part of getting their licence,
would have a complaints procedure. Therefore, if an individual was
clamped and wanted to protest, their first port of call would be the
company. However, as is the case with tickets, people sometimes want to
go beyond the first level of complaint and seek an independent view of
whether they have been clamped properly. We intend to establish an
independent complaints procedure with adjudicators who are legally
qualified. We have been looking, as I alluded to earlier when talking
about my discussions with the Department for Transport, at whether we
can piggyback on to an existing tribunal-there is one that deals
with ticketing that has legally qualified adjudicators -or
whether we can replicate one in a separate form. We accept the need for
independent adjudicators. They will be legally qualified, but we have
not exactly decided whether they will use the existing system or a new
one.</div><a name="100223109000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000596"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Now is the appropriate time to tax the Minister on
the scope of the appeal-I am grateful, Mr. Cook, for
your previous
guidance.</div><a name="100223109000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new subsection (4) in new clause 10 deals with the grounds that may be
relied upon. The Minister will note that they extend to the
contravention of a code of practice together with the contravention of
any requirement. What I do not see in that subsection is any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>general discretion given to the adjudicator-if that is the
appropriate word-to determine whether it would be right in
general terms to waive the charge. Is the adjudicator being given a
general discretion to do what is fair, even when the act complained of
does not necessarily constitute a breach of the
code?</div><a name="100223109000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000597"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> That is certainly our intention. The right hon.
and learned Gentleman was not impressed when I suggested earlier that I
would look at the issue, but I will look at it. We are absolutely
determined that the system gives the rights and protection that
motorists seek. There will be a series of things to which the
adjudicator will be able to refer in the code of practice, but it would
be perfectly reasonable if they were given some discretion, because
every case that comes before them will be different in some way. It
will not be a cheap system, and if we bring in legally qualified
people, we should trust their discretion on such matters. I give the
right hon. and learned Gentleman an undertaking that we will look at
the issue in the continuing
deliberations.</div><a name="100223109000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
funding, an independent appeals procedure will cost money. We propose
that the scheme will be funded partly by the fees paid by the
businesses themselves. When they get a licence, part of that will go
towards the set-up costs of the appeals procedure. We also think it is
right that, where the businesses lose an appeal, they should be
responsible for its cost. They should not get away with the fact that
someone has had to go through the appeals procedure to get back money
that they should not have lost in the first
instance.</div><a name="100223109000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am quite open about this, so let me say to the right hon. and learned
Gentleman that we are also looking at whether there should be a
small-a very small-administrative fee for people who take
their case to appeal. We have to protect against vexatious appeals. If
we have a system that is entirely open from the moment a vehicle is
clamped to the end of the appeal, we have to ensure that people do not
automatically decide to go through the appeals procedure. Because there
will be an administration cost, we are looking at the possibility of a
small fee, bearing in mind that if people win the appeal, they will get
back a great deal more than that would
cost.</div><a name="100223109000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000598"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I think that I am right in saying that there is no
fee for the parking adjudicator, so why in this case does the Minister
consider that there might be vexatious
complaints?</div><a name="100223109000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000599"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> We have looked at this in detail. The main
reason is scale. Around one in 10 of people who get parking tickets
appeals first to the local authority and then, of that number, one in
10 takes it to the independent appeal. The extent of the ticketing
system means that the local authorities can pay for the appeals
procedure. We believe that the cost of the appeals procedure for
wheel-clamping should be largely-perhaps entirely-met by
the businesses themselves through the licensing system. The scale of
the local authority set-up means there is a great deal more money
compared with the wheel-clamping sector. That is why we were looking to
piggyback on that system. We are looking to make the process as
affordable as possible, even though we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>recognise that there could be some money involved. I want to reassure
people that most of the cost of the appeal will fall on the businesses
themselves. We are bringing the proposal forward in this way because it
is a matter for continued discussion and consultation. Having an
independent appeals system is very important and gives people
confidence.</div>
<a name="100223109000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
110 ensures that the amendments made to the Private Security Industry
Act 2001 providing for appeals against charges for vehicle release
extend, like the rest of that Act, to England and Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. As many people will know, however, Scotland bans
wheel-clamping, so we are caught in a slight dilemma with regards to
extension to other parts of the country. However, the existing wording
of the Act means that Scotland will not be caught. It does not need to
be, as it does not have wheel-clamping in such a way. However, as we
heard in our earlier deliberations, clause 39 is not confined in its
potential scope to that sector of the private security industry, since
it allows for business licensing to be extended to other sectors. We
want to leave the door open for the extension of other sectors, but we
appreciate that measures on wheel-clamping will not be necessary for
Scotland. With that, Mr. Cook, I hope the Committee will
support our
proposals.</div><a name="100223109000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000600"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I welcome what the Minister has said and I accept
his undertaking to think further about the point I made. One
has to ask what criteria the adjudicator-the appellate
authority-will have to consider at the appeal. At the moment,
proposed new section 22A(4) of the 2001 Act is pretty narrow. It states
that the grounds of
appeal</div><a name="100223109000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">"may
include in particular...contravention of a code of
practice"</div><a name="100223109000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="100223109000481"></a><div class="hs_brev">"contravention
of any requirement imposed by...this
Act".</div><a name="100223109000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to another provision to cover any other matter that, in the
opinion of the adjudicator, makes it unfair to levy the
charge.</div><a name="100223109000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Winchester spoke this morning about his constituents
who had their vehicles clamped as a result of the snowstorms. If, for
example, we left our car in a private place because of the
snow-because we could not move it-and it was clamped, we
would probably be in breach of the requirements of the clamping
authority or the owner, but it would be unfair to require us to pay. I
can think of lots of other examples: we might leave our car in a pub
car park and fall ill or something so that we could not remove the car
immediately; or someone might nick our handbag that had the keys in it,
so again we could not move the car. In such circumstances, we would be
in breach of the requirements imposed by the occupier, but none the
less it would be unfair-if we could justify and prove the
facts-to require us to pay the
charge.</div><a name="100223109000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is probably important that the Under-Secretary reflects on the matter
so that when the provisions are made by regulation, the adjudicator
will have sufficient discretion to waive the charge when in her or his
opinion levying that charge would be
unfair.</div><a name="100223109000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000601"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Proposed new section 22A(4)
states:</div><a name="100223109000490"></a>"The
grounds may include in particular...contravention of a code of
practice issued by the Authority". 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div><a name="100223109000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I take on
board what the right hon. and learned Gentleman says. The list is not
exhaustive by any means and I shall see what we can do to reassure
him.</div><a name="100223109000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000602"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I accept that the list is not exhaustive, but the
problem is that it rather points to some procedural defect. I want to
see some form of general discretion appearing in the
regulations.</div><a name="100223109000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000603"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I understand that point, which is why I have
given the right hon. and learned Gentleman such reassurance. However,
we have to be careful, because the companies need to know where they
are too. If they are carrying things out, they need to know that, while
there might be some discretion, they would not be put in the position
of genuinely thinking that they were acting within the scope of the
code of practice only for someone else to come along later and rule
that they were acting outwith what would be, if not the code of
practice, a test of reasonableness. I am sure that we can deliberate
and see if we can come up with better wording, especially as the matter
will be dealt with in
regulations.</div><a name="100223109000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000604"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> The inclusion of an independent adjudicator
appeals process is something that the Opposition have argued for and
supported from day one. We are pleased that it has now been included in
the Bill. However, I want to make one or two
points.</div><a name="100223109000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
from studying new clause 10, I notice that on numerous occasions the
word "may" is used in proposed new section 22A. For
example, proposed new subsection (3) states that
"appeal may be made", while proposed new subsection (4)
states that "grounds may include". Is that word strong
enough? If the legislation is to be effective-we all hope it is,
because we have debated at length how much of an issue it is to our
constituents-is the word "may" as strong as it
needs to be? Should not the word "shall" be substituted
for it in certain cases, when
appropriate?</div><a name="100223109000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also wish to respond to some of the points made by my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham. I agree with
him about the situation if people are unable to access their vehicle
through no fault of their own, such as because of bad weather. The hon.
Member for Winchester made an important point earlier about
people's vehicles being immobilised because of snow, and yet
being clamped. Any code of practice ought to take such circumstances
into account. However, I slightly disagreed with my right hon. and
learned Friend when he mentioned people falling ill. If they park in a
pub, as he mentioned, and then are ill, we may wonder why they have
become ill, so perhaps the legislation should not be quite so lenient
in such
circumstances.</div><a name="100223109000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000605"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> That would be a matter for the
adjudicator.</div><a name="100223109000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000606"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> Indeed, and that is why it is important that
the adjudicator has flexibility and is able to judge fairly and take
into account all the circumstances while not letting people get away
with parking illegally and ensuring that clampers do not use the power
they have via the licence to clobber people and extort money unfairly.
On that basis, I have no doubt that Members 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div>of the House, local authorities and all those engaged in this aspect of
legislation will be consulted to ensure that the provisions are
effective. Hopefully, MPs' case loads will then be much smaller,
as our constituents will not have to complain so
regularly.</div><a name="100223109000497"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="100223109000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000607"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> If the Government go down that route, an
independent adjudicator will be required, and I hope that he or she
will be as effective as the parking adjudicator, whose role is widely
recognised as positive and independent. The Under-Secretary raised the
issue of a small charge being levied, and the only word of caution that
I have for him is that the charge should not be at such a level as to
discourage people from pursuing an appeal if they feel that they have
been wrongly
clamped.</div><a name="100223109000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000608"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> In response to the hon. Member for
Romford's point about the use of the word "may" in
proposed new subsection 22A(3), we say that the regulations shall
specify the grounds on which an appeal may be made because we hope that
people will not need to make an appeal. We leave the door open for
that, but we hope that there will be no need to appeal when the
regulations are in operation.</div>
<a name="100223109000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The use of
the word "may" in proposed new subsection
22A(4) goes back to what I told the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham: the list is not prescriptive. We need to
make regulations, which is why "may" is there, but there
will be requirements and the regulations will be clearly set out. I
shall certainly take on board what he has
said.</div><a name="100223109000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington has no great enthusiasm for
the system that we are introducing, but he is right that an independent
appeals procedure is needed. Although we are considering the
possibility of the appellant paying, I am conscious of the hon.
Gentleman's point, and we would not want to put people off
appealing. However, if there was a clear way to proceed without any
real thought about the cost, there would be a danger of the system
being swamped, and we must be careful to prevent that from happening. I
acknowledge what he said about the parking adjudicator, which is why we
are trying to get as close as possible to that
model.</div><a name="100223109000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000609"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> The Under-Secretary has clearly stated that
deliberations are going on about the charge. Has any figure come
forward?</div><a name="100223109000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000610"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a figure. I am
talking first about the principle of whether we have a charge and then
about the general commitment to the bulk of the cost falling throughout
the system on the businesses themselves, which, after all, are making
the profits. I give the hon. Gentleman the undertaking that if we were
to go down that route, the charge would be as small as possible, while
nevertheless having the effect of sending out a message about vexatious
claims.</div><a name="100223109000229"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000612"></a>Mr.

one's car released and going through the appeals procedure,
there is still the risk of facing a hefty bill that would be
disproportionate. The process will not come without a cost. We
therefore accepted the principle that the businesses should pay. I
understand what the right hon. and learned Gentleman is saying, and
there is some logic to his suggested system. To avoid the kind of
situations that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington hopes
that we can avoid, we alighted on the notion of an administrative fee
and people should not be expected to pay the full cost of the appeal.
We have to get the balance and the proportion right, which is where we

compensation scheme for the victims of overseas terrorist attacks, as
announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on Second Reading.
Self-evidently, we are introducing the provisions because we wish to
ensure that the British victims of overseas terrorist attacks have
support from the Government on similar terms to victims of terrorist
attacks in the United
Kingdom.</div><a name="100223109000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members will be aware that we have had a criminal injuries compensation
scheme for some years. However, it covers only the victims of violent
crime, including terrorism, in Great Britain, while a separate scheme
operates in Northern Ireland. That has led to a great deal of
unfairness, which we seek to address today. We hope never to have to
use the provisions, because we hope to prevent further terrorist
attacks. A victim of a terrorist attack in this country will be
compensated, whereas a British citizen who is the victim of a terrorist
attack overseas may have no realistic prospect of securing comparable
compensation in the country concerned.</div>

checked the new clause. If the British citizen secures compensation
abroad, either from a comparable scheme or, I suppose, through civil

that there is no double recovery?</div>

Gentleman.</div><a name="100223109000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sadly,
there have been some serious terrorist attacks overseas that have
impacted on British citizens: the Bali attack in 2002, the Sharm
el-Sheikh attack in Egypt in 2005, and the latest attack, which we can
recall vividly, took place in Mumbai in 2008, when British citizens
were, or could have been, killed or injured. The people involved in
such attacks are often targeted simply because they are British
citizens or western, and we need to bring the compensation scheme in
line to reflect that, whether or not they are indiscriminate terrorist
activities.</div>
<a name="100223109000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
victims of overseas terrorism compensation scheme will broadly mirror
the domestic criminal injuries compensation scheme. In particular, I
envisage that the compensation awarded under the overseas scheme will
be calculated on the same basis as the compensation payable under the
domestic scheme in force at the time of an overseas terrorist attack.
As with the domestic scheme, the Criminal Injuries Compensation
Authority, based in Glasgow, will administer the victims of overseas
terrorism compensation scheme. Under the existing domestic scheme,
adopted in 2008, awards are calculated according to the seriousness of
the injury or injuries sustained and, where appropriate, loss of
earnings and special
expenses.</div><a name="100223109000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
trigger for the new scheme will be the designation, by the Foreign
Secretary, of an overseas terrorist attack. Such designations will be
only for the purposes of the scheme. In deciding whether to designate
an attack, the Foreign Secretary will take into account all relevant
factors, including-this is an important factor-whether
the Foreign Office had advised against travel to the area where the
attack took place.</div>
<a name="100223109000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we are
dealing with overseas terrorist attacks, we believe that the focus of
the scheme should be on compensating British citizens. In addition to
British citizens, we will also cover, in fulfilment of our European
treaty obligations, EU and EEA nationals with sufficient connections to
the United Kingdom. We are currently considering what the eligibility
criteria should be.</div>
<a name="100223109000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
national statutory scheme will take effect, in the event of Royal
Assent, from 18 January 2010, which was the date of the Bill's
Second Reading, when my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced
the new scheme. I hope that it will be a positive development from 18
January. Many British citizens have been victims of terrorist attacks
in recent years, some of which I referred to earlier, such as those in
Sharm el-Sheikh and Bali. They continue to face hardship as a result of
the ongoing consequences of a disability arising from injuries that
they sustained in those terrorist attacks. Such victims will not be
able to claim compensation under the statutory scheme provided for in
the new clauses. We have concluded that if the scheme is enacted, we
should also provide some financial recompense to those victims who
continue to live with the consequences of the injuries that they
sustained. It is important that we recognise that, although we cannot
make clauses retrospective.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div><a name="100223109000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accordingly,
my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary has established a
time-limited scheme open to those eligible who were injured in
designated terrorist attacks abroad since 1 January 2002. He will
develop and establish a scheme following Royal Assent. I should stress
that that will be a wholly separate arrangement from the new statutory
scheme. We will not be retrospectively legislating on these matters,
but we feel that awards payable under the time-limited scheme should be
made. In these circumstances, the awards payable will be put in place
by my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary. There will be no awards
to those who were bereaved in past attacks or to those who were injured
and have now recovered. I accept that that will be a difficult
situation for many individuals, but we will ensure that for those with
an ongoing disability, one-off payments will be made, calculated by
reference to the tariff based on the seriousness of the injury or
injuries that we have indicated in previous discussions today. No
payment will be made for the loss of earnings or special expenses. That
will be a disappointment-I accept that it will be
difficult-but I hope that the Committee will accept that we are
legislating for a new scheme from January and that we are making
strenuous efforts to ensure that we can help individuals who have
ongoing
difficulties.</div><a name="100223109000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000618"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> May I make one point, which, I am sure, the Minister
already has in mind? It is important that the sums payable under the
scheme should not exceed the sums available to members of the armed
services who are injured in conflict. If that were to happen, there
would be a terrible row. People are rightly very sensitive about
compensation payable to servicemen, and there would be the most
appalling row if servicemen received less compensation than other
British citizens who are injured
overseas.</div><a name="100223109000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000619"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> As I have said, any payment made will be on par
with a tariff, which is a well-established practice to date. My
understanding is that that will not be higher than individual service
awards. I will certainly take those points on board and reflect upon
them in due course. I am advised that the armed forces scheme is even
more generous than the criminal injuries compensation scheme. There is
no opportunity for an overlap, which would be detrimental to those
brave individuals who serve in our armed forces. We aim to establish
the time-limited scheme for victims of attacks since 2002 as quickly as
possible once we have enacted the statutory scheme. I hope that that
will be
helpful.</div><a name="100223109000498"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="100223109000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Committee will agree to the new clauses and amendments. I
hope that we never have to implement the provisions, for the simple
reason that we do not wish terrorist attacks to occur. None the less, I
hope that the Committee will recognise that the Government have made an
effort to ensure fairness for those who may be injured in terrorist
attacks, and to offer some help to those who have ongoing difficulties
as a result of terrorist attacks.</div>
<a name="100223109000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="100223109000620"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): I share the
Minister's sentiment when he said that we hope that the
provisions outlined in the new clause will not be necessary; if they
are, it will mean that some form of terrorist 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>action will have taken place overseas and that
British people will have been caught up in it. However, the sad reality
is that it may happen, and I note the sensitive way in which the
Minister approaches the matter.</div>
<a name="100223109000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">For me, the
Second Reading debate was marked by the contribution of my hon. Friend
the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), whose
brother was caught up in one such terrorism atrocity. That highlighted
the personal issues that can result from those appalling actions, and
the impact they can have. We obviously support the work of our security
services, our armed forces and the other law enforcement agencies in
seeking to ensure that our fellow countrymen and women are protected
against such appalling actions.</div>
<a name="100223109000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
the call for support made by those who fall victim to appalling acts of
violence abroad who would have received a financial contribution if
those acts had occurred in this country. I hear what the Minister said
about the new provisions and, as I said on Second Reading, we will
reflect closely on them.</div>
<a name="100223109000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
the Government have considered the matter and have moved from their
previous approach of suggesting that a statutory compensation scheme
for British victims of overseas terrorism was not necessary because
European legislation required member states to apply compensation to
any victims of terrorist acts within their territories. That goes only
so far. A number of incidents have occurred outside the bounds of the
European Union and the European economic area, and it is in that
context that the Government have reflected on the representations made
to them and have proposed the scheme outlined in the new
clauses.</div>
<a name="100223109000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions were initially announced in a Ministry of Justice press
release, and the Home Secretary noted on Second Reading that the
Government would be bringing forward proposals. As the Minister said,
the scheme is intended to apply not only to UK nationals but to
nationals of other EU member states and other countries in the EEA that
have sufficient connection with the United Kingdom. I assume that will
be based on shared arrangements in meeting treaty obligations, and that
we will almost have reciprocity-the arrangements possibly being
utilised by other member states.</div>
<a name="100223109000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000621"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Could one not be more robust? We could say something
to the effect that citizens of an EU state should not be entitled to
make a claim under the scheme unless the state to which the claimant
belonged had a reciprocal arrangement that would enable UK citizens to
make a
claim.</div><a name="100223109000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000622"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> As always, my right hon. and learned Friend
makes an important point. If individual schemes operate in other EU
member states, is there some ability to share in any payments that are
made? Should there be some sort of credit? How would individual schemes
operate across the EU? If a resident of another EU state is entitled to
claim under the UK scheme, should there be an arrangement to seek
recompense from that other member state, so that there is a level
playing field across the EU? It would be interesting to hear from the
Minister on that point about the application of the scheme.</div>
<a name="100223109000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
proposal is intended as a fall-back or safety net for when the country
where the incident has occurred does not fulfil its European or
international 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div>obligations. We seek assurances that all steps will be taken to ensure
that countries do not ignore their responsibilities under their own
schemes. It is interesting to note, for example, that in 2008-09 awards
to the value of &#163;539,491 were made under the criminal injuries
compensation scheme to overseas residents who were victims of terrorism
in the UK. The UK is clearly meeting its responsibilities in that
regard, and it is important to ensure that other countries step up to
the plate and similarly respect their liabilities and responsibilities.
I will listen carefully to how the Minister envisages the operation of
the scheme in that context, and to what discussions he has had with
colleagues about the international application of the relevant
procedures.</div>
<a name="100223109000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
also be interesting to hear whether the Minister has had any
discussions with the insurance market about terrorism exemptions in
insurance policies, and about the interrelationship of the proposed
scheme with other insurance that may or may not be available. From what
he has said to my right hon. and learned Friend, I imagine that the
Minister envisages that if payment is received from other sources, it
would act as a credit against sums or payments that might be due under
the scheme. It is important to understand that better. Equally, if
payment is made under the scheme, and further subsequent payment is
made either by the host country or other sources, how is it envisaged
that that would operate in practice?</div>
<a name="100223109000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we
understand from statements in the Ministry of Justice press release,
and from what the Minister has said, it is intended that the scheme be
administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, based in
Glasgow. The Minister may be aware that in the recent past, that
organisation has come in for scrutiny and some criticism by the Public
Accounts Committee. A PAC report made 14 recommendations relating to
the performance of the criminal injuries compensation scheme. For
example, the PAC highlighted issues such as the fact that some of the
forms needed to use plain English, that some applicants felt that they
needed to be legally represented in order to make an application and
receive compensation from the CICA, and that there were performance
issues regarding the answering of telephones. Obviously, if we now add
the new requirements for victims of overseas terrorism to the
obligations, responsibilities and administration of the criminal
injuries compensation scheme and the authority, it would be helpful to
know how the CICA has responded to previous criticisms.</div>
<a name="100223109000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Ministry of Justice had been seeking to set up action plans to
respond to the criticisms made by the PAC and, through the Committee,
the National Audit Office. We are trying to ensure that should the
scheme come into effect, and compensation is due to those who suffer
horrendously from incidents abroad, the process should be clear and
understood, and that no obstacles should be put in the way by the
operation or administration of the CICA. Therefore, it will be helpful
to hear from the Minister how the authority is responding. How does he
anticipate that the CICA will operate under the scheme to ensure that
claims are made as painlessly as possible in terms of paperwork, and
that claimants can contact the CICA for advice, guidance and assistance
getting through the process, without feeling that recourse to legal
advice is necessary?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div><a name="100223109000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that the levels of compensation will, in broad measure, reflect
the existing criminal injuries compensation scheme. Will certain
exclusions apply to the operation of the new scheme, similar to those
that apply in the existing scheme? New clause 13
states:</div><a name="100223109000482"></a><div class="hs_brev">"The
Scheme may make provision about a person's eligibility for a
payment under it by reference to any or all of the following
factors",</div><a name="100223109000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">including</div><a name="100223109000483"></a><div class="hs_brev">"any
other factors that the Secretary of State considers
appropriate".</div><a name="100223109000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that under the criminal injuries compensation scheme,
there could, for example, be a question about whether a previous
conviction was relevant in deciding about the award of a payment. It
would be helpful to understand what is meant by the detail of the
proposed scheme-whether it will reflect principles similar to
those in the existing one.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000623"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> That is an important point. It would help us if the
Minister could amplify on it. I do not want to disqualify someone
simply because they have a criminal conviction in the past, but if a
person happened to be, for example, running drugs when he was caught up
in an explosion, I would not be sympathetic to his claim for
compensation. That is the sort of issue that has to be spelt
out.</div><a name="100223109000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000624"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend is
absolutely right. The Minister has set out the broad mapping of how he
envisages the operation of the scheme. He said that it would broadly
follow the existing criminal injuries compensation scheme. That is
helpful, but it would be even more helpful if it was set out in further
detail.</div>
<a name="100223109000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right
hon. and learned Friend made an important point that I was intending to
raise-the issue of service personnel. I understand that there
was originally some delay in proposing the scheme regarding the
interrelationship with the armed forces compensation scheme for the
appalling incidents that we have seen in Afghanistan, such as roadside
bombings, which could be considered terrorist insurgent action. How
does the Minister see the interrelationship between the scheme for
compensation for service personnel and this scheme? As I understand it,
the proposed scheme is separate and would not apply to service
personnel-they would be excluded because they are already
entitled to apply to another scheme. There would thus be no overlap
between the two schemes. It would be helpful to have it set on the
record that that is the intention of the
proposals.</div><a name="100223109000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000625"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> My hon. Friend is clearly right, but individuals
such as journalists may be embedded with UK forces. Under which scheme
will they make a claim? It is important that they do not receive more
than service
people.</div><a name="100223109000499"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="100223109000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000626"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister says that he anticipates that
the payments under the scheme would be less than those that go to
service personnel. Obviously, there would be a need to spell out in the
detail of the regulations and the scheme what exclusions would apply
and, if someone were in a theatre of conflict, whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div>there would be application under one scheme or the other. It is just a
matter of ensuring for definitional purposes that the details are made
clear.</div><a name="100223109000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is open to the Secretary of State, as stated under new clause 11, to
make the requirements to designate whether a particular incident is to
be covered under the scheme. We can debate if the provision is too
loosely worded about whether the Secretary of State may or may not
designate, although I appreciate that certain facts and circumstances
might need to be established if something is to be regarded as a
terrorist incident. That is why defining the scheme and the application
of new clause 11 will become
important.</div><a name="100223109000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000627"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> May I try something out on my hon. Friend? There
will be several situations in which people-journalists or
whoever-are working in conflict or danger zones as part of their
job. There would be a case for saying that such persons should be
required to take insurance so that the scheme can get the credit for
the insurance payment. For example, it could be said that a journalist
embedded with the forces should be insured against the damages that
they suffer, otherwise the whole cost would fall on the
scheme.</div><a name="100223109000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000628"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Hence the reason for my earlier comment to
the Minister about what consideration he had given to the availability
of insurance. In certain circumstances, people might not be able to
obtain cover in the insurance market and, in that context, perhaps the
Government would consider the scheme as the safety net. The point about
credits or recompense through other routes is relevant and one that we
have touched on in the debate, so it will be interesting to hear from
the Minister about how that will operate in
practice.</div><a name="100223109000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have determined that they accept their moral obligation to
recompense people caught up in acts of terrorism abroad, but they are
not seeking to recompense victims of serious crime that is not
terrorist action or atrocity. Will the right hon. Gentleman explain why
the Government have sought to take the approach of looking at the
criminal injuries compensation scheme and saying that they are prepared
to accept it to a certain extent, but not in relation to other
circumstances? It would be genuinely interesting to hear the
Minister's thoughts about the logic and the process and how, in
the terms of definition, an action could be a terrorist action or
violent crime. Perhaps the Secretary of State will contemplate such
matters by virtue of the provision embedded in new clause 11 that gives
him discretion to decide whether something is caught by the scheme. It
would be helpful to understand the limits and scope of what is
intended, and the approach that has been
taken.</div><a name="100223109000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to a couple of more detailed points about the new clauses. I
understand that the provisions would not prevent ex gratia payments
from being made, should the Government determine that appropriate.
Subsection (3) of new clause 11 states
that</div><a name="100223109000484"></a><div class="hs_brev">"Nothing
in this section affects any power of the Secretary of State to make
payments to, or in respect of, persons who are injured as a result of
terrorism outside the United
Kingdom."</div><a name="100223109000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
that still allow discretion for some element of ex gratia payment over
and above the compensation scheme, or has that provision been included
for another reason? I want to understand the logic that is being
applied.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div><a name="100223109000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going back to
the point about the Secretary of State having discretion to decide
whether it would be appropriate to designate the particular act to
ensure that compensation would be payable under the scheme, what sort
of factors does the Minister anticipate, because obviously the
provision has been drafted with some thought? What sorts of exclusions
are anticipated regarding reserving that right of the Secretary of
State to determine that something should not be
covered?</div><a name="100223109000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 18 makes it clear that any scheme under these provisions would
need to be laid before Parliament. What thought has been given to the
pre-consultation that should be carried out in relation to the scheme?
Once it is laid before Parliament, we would not be able to amend it
under the anticipated procedures, so does the Minister plan to have a
formal consultation procedure on the scheme to ensure that relevant
points can be incorporated before it is
finalised?</div><a name="100223109000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000629"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> May I make a further suggestion that my hon. Friend
proposes to the Minister that it would be a good idea if the scheme
could be debated in draft before it was laid in its final form before
the
House?</div><a name="100223109000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000630"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister might be able to clarify this,
but new clause 18 states that the scheme cannot be made unless a draft
has been approved by a resolution of each House. Therefore, it seems
that a draft would need to be laid and approved by both Houses before
it could come into effect. The point that I was making was that the
draft would be laid, but it could not be amended, so it would have to
be accepted or
rejected.</div><a name="100223109000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000631"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I think that new clause 18 refers to the draft that
becomes the final resolution. What sometimes happens, as my hon. Friend
will know, is that Governments come forward with a draft that is
debated, but not necessarily voted upon. The Government then take it
away and incorporate into the final draft such changes as they deem
appropriate as a consequence of the debate-that was what I had
in
mind.</div><a name="100223109000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000632"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Equally, my right hon. and learned Friend
will be aware of the process whereby a Select Committee can consider a
draft Bill or draft orders. I am trying to make the point that there
should be an opportunity for debate to facilitate the best operation of
the scheme and to ensure that relevant points can be fed into the
process. The Minister might be planning a formal consultation period
that would facilitate that and there might be some parliamentary
involvement. Given the interest that many right hon. and hon. Members
have in the subject, they may want to have such engagement. At the very
least, there should be a process to facilitate such input to ensure
that the scheme will be more effective and will take those issues into
account.</div><a name="100223109000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will listen carefully to what the Minister says in response to this
debate because this is an important issue. We must reflect carefully on
those people who have suffered in terrorist incidents overseas. There
is an issue of fairness. If such an incident had occurred in the UK,
they would be entitled to compensation, but because it took place
overseas in a territory that does not have a scheme to provide
compensation directly, there is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>clear gap. I recognise the moral issue here, which I
am sure is part of the reason why the Government have brought forward
these
proposals.</div><a name="100223109000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000633"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I welcome the proposals, although I note the
restrictions applying to retrospective compensation. When considering
what compensation to provide, going back to 2002, were any estimates
made of the number of people anticipating being included, but who are
not included?</div>
<a name="100223109000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch raised a large number of interesting points about
the way in which the proposals interlink with existing
schemes-EU schemes, insurance schemes, and the interface with
the service personnel scheme-and whether the principle of
non-payment to people with previous convictions that applies in
relation to criminal compensation is to be extended to this scheme. He
raised a number of valid points to which I am sure that the Minister
will want to respond.</div>
<a name="100223109000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to echo another issue raised by the hon. Gentleman that is slightly
outwith what we are debating, although I hope that you will allow me
one or two sentences on it, Mr. Cook. The Government have
established the principle of compensating British citizens who are
victims of a heinous crime abroad-terrorism. The hon. Gentleman
made a strong point about the deliberations the Government went through
to arrive at the restriction to victims of terrorism abroad. The
Minister might be aware of a case involving the son of one of my
constituents who was attacked and seriously injured when he was on
holiday in Malia in Crete. We had a meeting in Westminster a couple of
weeks ago to look at the issue of victims of crime abroad. A
regrettably large number of British citizens have been affected by
crime in Greece. I would like to know whether the Government have
considered taking the remit beyond victims of terrorism into other
areas of serious crime. The Minister has a number of challenging points
to respond to, but the principle he has set before us is one that I
think all Members will
support.</div><a name="100223109000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000634"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I am grateful for the broad level of support from
the hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Carshalton and Wallington. They
raised a range of points and I will try to respond in due
course.</div>
<a name="100223109000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
compensation scheme is first and foremost designed for British victims
and their families. I recognise that we have obligations under European
Union treaties. Article 18 of the treaty on the functioning
of the European Union expressly states that we may not discriminate
against citizens of other member states on the grounds of their
nationality, and there is case law on that. Through the proposals I
have brought before the Committee, we are trying to ensure that
individuals from abroad who are eligible for this scheme should have
strong links with the United Kingdom, and those strong links are
defined by case law.</div>
<a name="100223109000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch mentioned the important point of travel
insurance. Travel insurance is not designed to provide compensation in
the way in which the scheme is designed to do. If I am asked the
straightforward question of whether individuals should take out travel
insurance, the answer is yes, they should. They should also check that
it covers terrorist activity, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>which around a third of travel insurance schemes
currently do. As I have already indicated, if alternative methods of
finance are provided, the scheme will take that into account when
determining the awards.</div>
<a name="100223109000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch asked whether the eligibility for criminal
convictions would be similar. The existing UK criminal injuries
compensation scheme will be the basis for the scheme operating abroad,
which will have similar
provisions.</div><a name="100223109000500"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="100223109000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman commented on the ability of the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Authority to deal with the claims. I have every confidence
that it will be able to do so. It aims to provide compensation as
quickly as possible, not just as a matter of course but because it is
important that the compensation goes to individuals who require it.
Last year, the average time for the authority to decide an application
was about nine months and 57 per cent. of applications were decided
within eight months. To put that into context, last year 36,461
compensation awards were made in the UK, and since 2002 about 300 of
our people have been killed or injured abroad because of terrorist
activity. I hope that it never happens but, looking at past form, the
increase in the authority's work load would be relatively minor
and within its ability to
cope.</div><a name="100223109000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of Members mentioned the armed forces compensation scheme, which
is entirely separate from the victims of overseas terrorism
compensation scheme. A member of the armed forces injured while on
active service would expect to apply to the armed forces scheme and not
to the victims of overseas terrorism compensation scheme. We had an
interesting discussion about people who might be embedded within the
armed forces, working for them as journalists or civilian contractors.
We would expect contractors and journalists to be covered by private
employer insurance schemes, and in the unlikely event that they were
not, the Foreign Secretary would have to consider whether to include
them in his designation of terrorist activity. To clarify, the Foreign
Secretary, when determining a designation, will consider the identity
of the attacker, the design and purpose of the attack, the nature and
circumstances of the attack, and the broad thrust of why the attack
took
place.</div><a name="100223109000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision will allow ex gratia payments-payments to be made
outside the scheme-which were again mentioned by the hon. Member
for Hornchurch. An existing Ministry of Defence scheme and Foreign and
Commonwealth Office exceptional assistance are both covered, and the
Secretary of State for Justice will be able to introduce the
arrangements that I mentioned on Second Reading for some of those
injured since
2002.</div><a name="100223109000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consultation
was mentioned by both the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford
and North Hykeham and the hon. Member for Hornchurch. As I have said on
numerous occasions, we are modelling the system on the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Authority scheme, which is a natural scheme in
practice, and on which we do not need further consultation. We will lay
draft orders before the House for approval or otherwise, and I do not
want at this stage to commit to full-blown consultation. The principles
are established and we do not consult on the current CICA scheme.
Furthermore, I do not want to delay the introduction of the scheme. I
want it to be operational for anybody who is a victim of a terrorist
attack in the near future.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div><a name="100223109000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am trying to think as quickly as I can to cover the points that have
been mentioned. Overall, the scheme should be welcomed, and I commend
it to the
Committee.</div><a name="100223109000301"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000635"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I think that the Minister was searching for some
points to which he meant to respond. Both the hon. Member for

extending compensation to victims of not just terrorism abroad, but
other things such as serious
crime.</div><a name="100223109000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000636"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The hon. Gentleman pins me down on an issue that I
was not trying to avoid, but was not keen to explore in great detail.
We have had to make some considerations on all the matters. Resources
are always limited and we have to consider the issues in the round. We
have determined that there is a difference between terrorist attacks at
home and terrorist attacks abroad, and we have therefore decided to
support the scheme. It is right that we should make provisions for
British victims of terrorist attacks abroad.</div>
<a name="100223109000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
tangible expression of outrage when a terrorist attack occurs, and I
recognise that such injuries need to be considered in detail. We have
to consider the wider picture, however. I cannot give a commitment to
extending the CICA scheme to victims of ordinary crime abroad. We have
tried to make terrorism a special circumstance. I hope that the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington will accept that that is progress,
even if he wishes us to pursue the matter further. I commend the new
clauses to the Committee.</div>

amendment
176.</div><a name="100223109000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000639"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Government amendment 175 ensures that Government
new clause 10 will extend only to England and Wales. Government
amendment 176 is merely consequential. I hope that the Committee will
forgive me for spending a little time speaking to these measures, as we
did not have the opportunity to discuss the matter on Second
Reading.</div>
<a name="100223109000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
new clause 31 would amend the Licensing Act 2003 by inserting five new
sections. New section 172A will provide licensing
authorities, almost all of which are local authorities, with the power
to ban sales or supplies of alcohol between 3 am and 6 am, either in
the whole of its area or in a smaller, more confined part of it. The
provisions require that such an order may not be made unless certain
preconditions are met; I shall return to those
shortly.</div><a name="100223109000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of an order would be to override the effect of any premises
licence, club premises certificate or temporary event notice otherwise
authorising sales or supplies at that time in the early morning. We
have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 448</div>chosen to restrict such bans to the period between 3 am and 6 am as a
result of the findings of an evaluation of the 2003 Act that was
published in March 2008. In a written statement to Parliament, the then
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my right hon. Friend
the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), said of the 2003 Act:</div>
<a name="100223109000485"></a><div class="hs_brev">"Its
introduction has not led to the widespread problems some feared.
Overall, crime and alcohol consumption are down. But alcohol-related
violence has increased in the early hours of the morning and some
communities have seen a rise in disorder."-[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 4 March 2008; Vol. 472, c.
102W.]</div><a name="100223109000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
evaluation reported an increase in the number of offences committed
between 3 am and 6 am that was small in absolute terms, at 236
incidents, but large in proportionate terms at about 25 per cent. Our
intention is not unnecessarily to restrict or inhibit the night-time
economy, which is often important to local economies, but to focus
sharply on the problem that has been
identified.</div><a name="100223109000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
briefly to the preconditions, first, the order must be necessary for
the promotion of one or more of the four statutory licensing
objectives. I remind the Committee that they are: the prevention of
crime and disorder; public safety; the prevention of public nuisance;
and the protection of children from harm.</div>
<a name="100223109000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
new section 172B requires the licensing authority to advertise the
proposed order and to consider at a hearing any relevant
representations made to it by any of three different groups. The
Secretary of State is empowered under the new section to prescribe the
detailed procedure governing how and when relevant representations
should be made and how they will be processed. Under the provisions,
representations are relevant if they concern the likely effect of the
order on the statutory licensing objectives, and are made in the
prescribed form and within the prescribed time.</div>
<a name="100223109000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of the three
groups that may make representations, the first includes any persons
affected by the order, which means the licence and club certificate
holders, people who give temporary event notices, and the holders of
provisional statements. The second group includes responsible
authorities-for example, the police and environmental health
officers. The third group comprises interested parties, including
residents or other businesses in the vicinity of the affected premises.
It also includes local councillors who are members of the licensing
authority. Where no relevant representations are received, the
licensing authority will be free to make the order it had proposed and
advertised, but, where representations have been received, the
licensing authority must hold a hearing before finalising its decision.
The arrangement for such a hearing will be set out in the
regulations.</div><a name="100223109000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation was passed in 2003 and came into force in November 2005, so
it has been in force for more than four years. At the time it was
enacted, the Government promised to keep its impact under close
scrutiny. The new measure is designed, in the light of our evaluation,
to extend the powers that we originally gave to licensing authorities.
The question has been asked whether we expect the power to be widely
used. The answer is no, we do not. The 2003 Act has been a considerable
success in many areas and we believe that the existing powers in the
Act are sufficient in those areas. In other areas, however, we need to
go further.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div><a name="100223109000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are 378 licensing authority areas. In the case of public bars, pubs and
nightclubs, some 73 per cent. of those licensing areas have either one
or no premises licensed for 24 hours. Nationally, we believe that no
more than 3 per cent. of licensed premises trade between 3 am and 6 am.
That suggests that no more than 6,000 premises would be affected if
every area made such an order, which is highly unlikely. Our approach,
therefore, is targeted and
proportionate.</div><a name="100223109000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
local authorities, however, have more demanding night-time economies,
and they tell us that they would welcome the power to manage crime and
antisocial behaviour better, in the interests of their residents. There
is a general principle that we wish to empower local people to have an
even stronger say in what their towns and cities are like, particularly
in the early hours of the morning. It is fair to ask, in anticipation,
why we are not giving licensing authorities a free hand to set their
own hours of closure when making orders. We believe that the measures
are reasonable and proportionate. We do not want to create unjustified
problems for businesses that are emerging from recession, or provoke
job losses, unless there is a good, evidence-based
reason.</div><a name="100223109000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for why we are centring on the hours between 3 am and 6 am, a
fixed closing time of 3 am minimises the disruption to businesses, with
only those trading between 3 am and 6 am potentially affected. We
believe that 3 am is late enough to allow closing times and departures
from licensed premises to be staggered, which the police continue to
value as a support for dispersing large numbers of people from city and
town centres. Moreover, 3 am should be sufficiently late not to
interfere with plans for wedding receptions and other special
celebrations that may continue later than a normal evening's
pleasure. At the other end of the closure period, 6 am allows people to
sell alcohol with breakfast. It may come as a surprise to some that
that is a habit, but I am told that champagne breakfasts sometimes have
an appeal for tourists. People celebrating Christmas might also decide
that they want a particularly early start, so 6 am offers that
flexibility and allows the period for
closure.</div><a name="100223109000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
section 172E will allow the Secretary of State to make an order
exempting certain cases and circumstances from the effects of an order
made under new section 172A. Those cases and circumstances
will be defined in particular by reference to certain types of premises
and certain days. On certain premises, hotels have always been free to
supply alcohol to their residential guests, so we think that they
should be exempt from the arrangements. Moreover, we would not want to
exempt sales made to the general public at certain other premises.
Warehouses to which the public have no access for purchasing alcohol,
for example, hold 24-hour licenses and operate after 3 am. Such
premises may be distribution centres for wine purchased over the
internet or by mail order, with the goods sometimes starting their
journeys in the small hours. We would expect such premises to be exempt
because they do not present any obvious danger to the licensing
objectives.</div><a name="100223109000501"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="100223109000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for particular days, we would consider appropriate for exemption new
year's eve every year and specific days such as the diamond
jubilee weekend of 2012, for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>which occasion it might be suitable to exempt days, but-I stress
this point-the effect would not be that all licensed premises
can trade between 3 am and 6 am on the exempted days. The effect of an
exemption would be that the normal permission for such licences and
certificates would be in force. Thus, premises whose hours have always
been restricted by their licences and certificates would continue to be
restricted despite the existence of an exemption on the day or
days.</div><a name="100223109000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000640"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am gratified that the Minister had the good
grace to accept that the provisions in the new clause are likely to
have limited effect. I hope, for his sake, that they will not have the
same limited effect as the new alcohol disorder zone provisions, none
of which has been used at
all.</div><a name="100223109000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate and recognise that the Government, by virtue of the
provisions, accept that they got 24-hour licensing wrong. The Minister
rightly identified the increase in violent crime between 3 am and 6
am-from the DCMS report-which is tantamount to admitting
why the Government are introducing the new clause. They are right to
take action. We have seen not just the rise in crime but the rise in
hospital admissions of patients with an alcohol-related
diagnosis-between 2004-05 and 2008-09 such admissions went up by
47 per cent. Similarly, the number of children admitted has risen, and
death rates from alcohol have increased by 47 per cent. since
1997.</div><a name="100223109000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions are an admission and recognition of the problems caused by
the Government's approach. I appreciate what the Minister said
about keeping things under review, but the situation is not one they
have woken up to overnight, because the problems relating to the small
hours of the morning were first identified in July 2007. Why have the
Government taken so long to act? Furthermore, incidents that occur at
that time are likely to be the result of drinking much earlier
in the evening-the whole concept of pre-loading and the
consumption of alcohol in the home. Although the problems might be
exhibited in the hours between 3 am and 6 am, it does not mean that the
alcohol was consumed then. When we understand that, we see a much wider
problem than the Minister alluded
to.</div><a name="100223109000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a few comments on the specifics of the new proposals, but I do not
intend to use this afternoon's sitting for that wider debate,
because it would not necessarily be appropriate or in order. However,
proposed new section 172A in new clause 31,
states:</div><a name="100223109000486"></a><div class="hs_brev">"If
the licensing authority considers it necessary for the promotion of the
licensing objectives, it
may"</div><a name="100223109000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">take
the relevant action. From what the Minister said, that appears to be
tied to the four licensing objectives, but I want to understand that a
little better. The DCMS press release of 4 February 2010
stated:</div><a name="100223109000487"></a><div class="hs_brev">"Councils
would need to show that the restriction was necessary to prevent crime
and disorder or public nuisance or to promote public
safety."</div><a name="100223109000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
obligation does that place on councils? Can they make a restriction if
they consider it necessary, or must the necessity be demonstrated with
objective evidence? In other words, is the provision likely to be
fettered by guidance that would sit alongside it, which would make it
very difficult for a council to show that evidence and to rely on the
provisions set out in the new clause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div><a name="100223109000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have heard, in the review from the DCMS, that there were just 470 pubs,
bars and nightclubs with 24-hour licences, but there was no evidence
that more than a handful operate on that basis. If there were so few
licensees trading or operating during that time, how would a council be
able to demonstrate that the four criteria-the licensing
objectives-would meet the hurdle that the Government appear to
be setting up? Would it create a restriction on the utilisation of the
powers, even if a council wished to do so? It is all very well putting
down in legislation that new powers exist, but if the bar is set so
high for councils to satisfy the relevant criteria-to go through
the procedures that the Minister has alluded to-the likelihood
is that they will not bother, even if they feel that it might be useful
or helpful for them to do so.</div>
<a name="100223109000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole of
that fettering-all the other arrangements that sit alongside the
provisions-is germane. We have seen guidance fetter local
councils in their ability to utilise the staggered arrangements alluded
to by the Minister. In essence, the council always has to prove why a
licence should not be granted, rather than a licensee having to prove
why they should be granted the licence in the first place. It is about
balance and discretion. Therefore, although I welcome and appreciate
the fact that the Government recognise that a change needs to be made,
the question is what impact it will have and whether the provisions
will actually be used at all.</div>
<a name="100223109000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000641"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> The proposal is recognition that we are not yet
ready for continental-style 24-hour licensing. The measures needed
before that change were not in position. It is not entirely clear to me
whether this change-the restriction that will now apply
between 3 am and 6 am-will actually achieve what the
Government intend. They have previously stated that the provision was
to try to address peaks of violence associated with drinking. It is
clear from evidence supplied from Guildford that the peaks of violence
happen earlier than the 3 am to 6 am slot, so it will not address the
problem in that city, or presumably in others.</div>
<a name="100223109000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Underlying
the change is the need to deal with other fundamental problems of
alcohol consumption that have not been addressed-pricing,
promotions, advertising, the strength of alcohol and under-age
drinking. Those are matters that I am sure we would all like to debate,
Mr. Cook, but you would not allow us to do so. It is
possible that the change will make a slight dent in the problems
associated with irresponsible drinking, but I think it will be a slight
dent only and there are still many major issues that we need to
address.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000642"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I anticipated to some extent the points that the
hon. Member for Hornchurch made. We had a fairly substantial rehearsal
on the Floor of the House when we debated the programme motion. He
cites alcohol disorder zones as evidence of the worthlessness of such
actions, but he knows as well as I do that they are a very useful stick
with which to prod, if not to beat, local licensing committees and
agencies involved in making town and city centres safer. They are to
some extent, the ultimate weapon to have at one's disposal,
because they bring with them a certain stigma about what a town or city
centre might be like. Quite often, partners will go to almost any
length-in other words, make the improvements they have been
offering to make but never quite got round to-to manage a
problem 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>in a town and city centre and fall short of becoming an alcohol disorder
zone. I will not, therefore, dismiss alcohol disorder zones, as clearly
I would not want anybody to dismiss the measures either.</div>
<a name="100223109000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refute the
suggestion that the Government got all of it wrong; that denies the
change in behaviour for the better in many towns and cities throughout
the country. It is not the case that every town and city centre is an
alcohol-fuelled wild west. That would be unfair to the police and those
in local authorities who take the matter seriously. A lot of people
need to take it more seriously, but many do a good job. If further
measures are necessary, they need to be targeted and proportionate,
which includes referring to times when there are specific
problems.</div><a name="100223109000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have not just woken up to the issue. As I explained to the hon. Member
for Hornchurch on the Floor of the House, he must accept that the
development of policy in such an important area as tackling
alcohol-related disorder is a never-ending continuum. We want to get it
absolutely right, often with the advice of the police and others on how
best we can do so. Pre-loading is a worry. However, if we decided to
close bars and clubs at the point when people were arriving in a
pre-loaded state, we would be moving the measures to much
earlier- 10 or 11 o'clock at night. That would
not be proportionate or
necessary.</div><a name="100223109000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked why we needed an evidence base to support such an
order. That is how the licensing system works. It is an evidence-based
system. Police and others need to bring forward evidence that there is
a problem. Sometimes in my area there is a difference between the views
of the trade, as we would expect, and how bad the situation is for
residents and how bad it is for the police. Nevertheless, it is
important that such matters are based on evidence and not the whim of a
party. We do not expect the measure to be used hugely, because a lot of
things can be used to deal with single premises or a few premises in an
area, but only when the perception of a general problem in a city or
town centre is such that those responsible for making the decision at
local level believe that it would be helpful. That is why we want the
provision in the
Bill.</div><a name="100223109000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington is absolutely right to put
the provision in the context of all the other things we need to discuss
and act on to tackle alcohol in our society, including pricing.
However, the matter is not about pricing, but what happens in town and
city centres between 3 am and 6 am. Evidence suggests that one of the
down effects of the changes to licensing was an uplift in the
statistics on alcohol-fuelled violence. It is therefore right to
introduce the
measure.</div><a name="100223109000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000643"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I do not dispute the effect to which the Minister
refers, but presumably he is not disputing the fact that in some of our
towns and cities, the uplift in violence happens at an earlier stage so
the hours between 3 am to 6 am miss the peak in
violence.</div><a name="100223109000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000644"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> That time does not miss the peak in violence
because, in reality, there was also an uplift during the hours that we
are addressing. I am not disputing the fact that in the early morning
there are problems in some towns and cities. Measures can be brought
into play at such times but, because of the uplift at a particular time
of the early morning and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div>because we want a proportionate response, we believe that between 3 am
and 6 am is the right time for the measure. If the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington is arguing that the police and local
authorities will be knocking on our door asking whether the timing is
right and will we be considering extending the measure to other times,
I cannot read into that. All I am saying is that we believe that there
is an evidential base for the measure. It will help locally both those
whose job it is to organise the night-time and early morning economy,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000646"></a>The

amendment
178.</div><a name="100223109000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000647"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> New clause 32 and the consequential amendments
will introduce a power for police officers to search the person of a
controlled individual in specified circumstances, and allow them to
seize articles of concern as appropriate. The clause fills a gap, which
has been identified by ourselves and-dare I say it?-the
courts in relation to how we deal with controlled individuals who are
on control orders in the community at the moment. The important power
of personal search of a controlled individual is on the face of the
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. We have recently had two court
judgments, the latest of which was in November last year. Members may
be aware that Lord Carlile, in his fifth report on control orders
published on 1 February earlier this month, indicated that we need to
rectify the situation and bring it into an appropriate legal
framework.</div>
<a name="100223109000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 provides that the Secretary of State
may impose "any obligations" on an individual, which are
considered</div>
<a name="100223109000488"></a><div class="hs_brev">"necessary for
purposes connected with preventing or restricting involvement by that
individual in terrorism-related activity".</div>
<a name="100223109000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Act provides a
number of obligations for the individual that the control order
"may include", but does not expressly include an
obligation for the individual to allow him or herself to be searched.
Given that the wording of the Act makes it clear that the list of
obligations that may be imposed is indicative rather than definitive,
we considered that the general power was available, but sadly-or
otherwise-the courts have taken a different view. In July last
year, the Court of Appeal held that the 2005 Act was insufficient to
authorise the imposition by a control order of an obligation to submit
to a personal search.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div><a name="100223109000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">In November
last year, as I have already indicated, the High Court handed down a
further ruling, which indicated that we could not enforce a requirement
for a controlled person to submit to a personal search prior to being
escorted by the police outside their boundary. Those two judgements,
whatever our views of them, are causing operational difficulties on the
ground. Both the Security Service and the police have assessed that our
lack of ability to search a controlled individual under the 2005 Act is
a loophole that causes difficulties for us. For example, individuals
could have mobile phones, which are not permitted outside the
controlled area, and if we cannot search the individual, would proceed
with them to alternative places.</div>
<a name="100223109000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
controlled individuals have geographical boundaries to restrict or
disrupt their ability to engage in terrorism-related activities. The
judgments make it very difficult for us to manage the risk when those
individuals need to make trips outside their geographical boundaries.
For those reasons, I have brought forward proposals that would allow
for a search of controlled individuals, which I hope will be welcomed
by the Committee. It is important, for the small number of people who
have a control order, that we have the ability for the police to
undertake searches. The numbers are extremely small-currently
about 15 individuals. We need this power and I hope the Committee will
support
it.</div><a name="100223109000348"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000648"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The amendment and the new clause underline
the practical problems with control orders and why we believe they
should be reviewed-a view consistent with the security
situation-to examine ways in which a suspect could be tried
through the normal courts system. As the Minister has said, in essence,
the provisions address points that have been brought forward as a
consequence of the Court of Appeal decision in the case of GG and the
High Court decision in BH. The Court of Appeal judgment found
unanimously that section 1(3) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005
could not be read as allowing the inclusion of a personal search
obligation and control order, and that its omission from the list of
example obligations in section 1(4) meant that there was no statutory
basis for the power to include an obligation to submit to a personal
search.</div>
<a name="100223109000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has alluded to the provisions in the separate High Court case
concerning BH, which involved the requirement to submit to a personal
search so as to enable someone subject to a control order to be
escorted outside a controlled zone. I would like to understand whether
that is a question of drafting. Was the court case, and the issue that
the Minister seeks to address, simply a point of drafting needed to
correct a legal lacuna in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, or do more
underlying concerns under the European convention on human rights drive
the amendment to permit the search in this way? What consideration has
been given to it?</div>
<a name="100223109000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister said, in his report published earlier this month Lord Carlile
recommended that this issue be addressed. Obviously, in the short term,
we recognise that this is a case for the management of control orders,
and therefore we will not object to or vote against the new clause and
the amendment that the Government have tabled. However, that does not
show any inconsistency in our broad approach regarding how we believe
it is essential to bring people to justice before the court 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>wherever possible. It is a question of getting that review done and of
examining ways in which that can be achieved. The Minister has made
various points about the short-term necessity of this provision, and we
understand that. However, it would be helpful to know whether this is a
point of drafting, or whether he seeks to address a more fundamental
issue.</div>
<a name="100223109000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000649"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I, too, have heard the Minister's
explanation. Our starting point is that we do not think that control
orders are appropriate, so we would perhaps not be in the position that
the Government are in. We would like to see the judicial process used
to ensure that there is no requirement for control orders in the first
place.</div>
<a name="100223109000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000650"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> First and foremost, this is a point of drafting,
which I hope helps the hon. Member for Hornchurch. The purpose of the
legislation is to ensure that when we search individuals on control
orders, we do so in recognition of the legal responsibilities that the
Court has indicated we need. We can have a wider debate in the future
about the necessity of control orders. I believe that they are
necessary. They are not taken lightly but they provide protection for
the British public against potential terrorist activity. They are small
in number, strictly controlled and have external scrutiny through Lord
Carlile. I would commend them to the Committee in any debate, but today
I restrict my comments to the new clauses, which are a valuable
addition to help protect the British public and ensure that individuals
on control orders can be searched under legal cover.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000653"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b><b class="B"> </b>Along with, I suspect, most if not all
other hon. Members of the House, since being elected not a week goes by
without my casework-be it letters, e-mails or callers at my
surgery-involving issues associated with antisocial or criminal
behaviour. Frequently, such behaviour is alcohol-related and causes a
huge range of problems. Such behaviour might occur in the local park
down in Fenton, or in the back alleys of Fenpark. It might occur in the
shopping centres in and around Longton, up on Sandford Hill or Meir
Hay, across at Meir where the shops are, or in some other area such as
Meir Park or Trentham. Across the constituency, time and again
alcohol-related problems are arising because people are engaging in
antisocial behaviour or criminal activity in the street due to
drink.</div>
<a name="100223109000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over the
past few years I have held a number of public meetings at which I have
brought together the police, the local authority and different agencies
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div>tackle these issues with the community. At some of the meetings,
hundreds of people have come together to address the problems arising
in their area. Time and again those problems have the common theme of
being alcohol-related.</div>
<a name="100223109000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Residents
ask me at those meetings why people are allowed to sit or stand
drinking outside an off-licence, perhaps down on the Meir, almost from
when it opens. They open the cans, drink and act in an intimidating
way, blocking the pavements where parents with pushchairs or prams are
trying to get past. They do not always engage in direct antisocial
behaviour or criminal activity, but they are often threatening or
intimidating. Residents ask me why it seems okay for people to sit on
the bandstand in our shopping area with bottles of cider all day, every
day, drinking and causing a nuisance, being intimidating through their
antisocial behaviour. They also ask me why it is okay at 9.30 in the
morning for a couple of guys to be walking through a residential area
with cans in their hands. As a can is finished, it is discarded and the
next one opened. Time and again residents ask why this is
permitted.</div>
<a name="100223109000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where it can
be shown that there is a direct link between alcohol consumption and
crime or antisocial behaviour, alcohol restriction zones can be
considered, but they, of course, relate to a specific place. There are
tough tests to get the ARZs, and there is a perception issue. A
particular community-Newstead, for example-might not want
an ARZ because it does not want people to have that perception of its
area. ARZs are time limited and often, a problem is solved in one area
because it has moved somewhere else. When that somewhere else gets fed
up with the problem and an ARZ is considered for that area, the
drinkers are moved on. Where do they move to? They move back to the
first area that was the problem and had the ARZ to start with. There
are cost implications in constantly having to go through the process of
applying for an ARZ, putting up signage and doing all the associated
things.</div>
<a name="100223109000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
those questions about why such things are permitted, I asked agencies,
individuals and residents' associations across my constituency
for their views on imposing a blanket ban across a local authority area
by simply saying, "You are not allowed to drink in a public
place unless it is a designated picnic area or a licensed premises
within the curtilage." The unanimous view of individual
residents, residents' groups and police officers was that it was
a darned good idea. People should not be routinely able to sit in a
busy shopping area or walk down residential streets from dawn to dusk
drinking, discarding cans and causing a nuisance through intimidating
behaviour, which often leads to other issues.</div>
<a name="100223109000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my part
of Stoke-on-Trent there are lots of back alleyways. People say they get
fed up with the local idiots who have filled themselves with beer
standing on the street corner on a Friday night, going past a fence or
house and giving it a good kicking, throwing over bottles and worse.
There are all the problems that come with that, and criminal and
antisocial behaviour
arises.</div>
<a name="100223109000503"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="100223109000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the new clauses I am trying to do two things: prohibit the drinking of
alcohol in public places and-through new clause 23-allow
residents to override the normal requirements of an ARZ. It would not
just be about disorder or nuisance and annoyance to members 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 459</div>of the public; people in a local authority area
could say, "No, we do not want this in our area." For
example, in the city of Stoke-on-Trent, we do not want people to be
able to walk down the street drinking alcohol, causing a nuisance, and
generating the criminal and antisocial activity that goes with it,
irrespective of the wishes of everyone
else.</div><a name="100223109000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clauses propose an authority-wide ban on drinking in public as a way of
restoring confidence and giving people ownership over their area, so
they do not have to be intimidated by groups of drinkers or constantly
have to clear up the bottles, cans and associated damage that goes with
people thinking it is acceptable to stand on the street corner and
drink for however many hours they want. If people want to drink, great;
there are plenty of pubs that we want to promote to ensure that people
go back to them. It is fine if people want to drink, but they should do
it at home or on licensed premises. Communities-our high
streets, shopping areas and parks-are not places to drink. The
clauses send out that message and would allow ordinary, hard-working,
decent people to get their cities back.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="100223109000654"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> First, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the
Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South not only for raising an important
matter but for doing so in that thoughtful way, demonstrating his
knowledge of the subject and his constituency. I do not feel that I
need to visit it, as I know it so well after his description.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> We can bring politics and
majorities into it but, when my hon. Friend's
constituents read <i class="I">Hansard</i>-as I am sure they
will-his majority will go up.</div>
<a name="100223109000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">We broadly
support my hon. Friend's proposals, but many of the powers he
proposes are already available to local authorities and the police
through designated public place orders in the Criminal Justice and
Police Act 2001. There are 766 DPPOs in existence, and that high
take-up demonstrates the popularity of the policy in its current form
and the lack of too high an evidential
barrier.</div><a name="100223109000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to point out one or two problems we have with my hon.
Friend's proposals and to compare them with the current
legislation on drinking in public place orders; for example, the
proposed exemption for private property, or any place to which the
public do not normally have access, from being part of a restricted
area. I am not sure what the scope of that exemption would be, but it
could prevent the police from confiscating alcohol in a supermarket car
park late at night, thereby reducing their ability to tackle some cases
of alcohol-related antisocial behaviour.</div>
<a name="100223109000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend raised an interesting and innovative idea about petitions. If 20
per cent. of local electors petition for the entire borough to be made
a restricted public place, the local authority can create a restricted
public place without first gathering evidence of the need for one. The
petitions duty in the Local Democracy, Economic Development and
Construction Act 2009, will require local authorities to respond to
petitions on all matters of local concern, including alcohol-related
crime and disorder. The proposed statutory guidance, which will
underpin that duty, will say that local authorities are expected to
consider the creation of a DPPO if they are petitioned on
alcohol-related crime and disorder.</div>
<a name="100223109000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
petitions duty is more accessible and less prescriptive than the
provisions suggested in new clause 23. For example, it would require 20
per cent. of local electors 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 460</div>to sign a petition to trigger a response. We estimate that in Birmingham
the figure would be in the region of 150,000 signatures. The new clause
would remove the current requirement to gather evidence before creating
a borough-wide DPPO if the local authority received a petition from 20
per cent. of local electors, yet-we keep coming back to this
issue-an evidential base is important and a crucial step in
ensuring that action is both appropriate and
proportionate.</div><a name="100223109000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the amendment would replicate existing powers, and the proposed policy
would, we believe, face difficulties that the existing policy avoids, I
am sorry to say that I cannot accept the amendment and the new clauses
and I invite my hon. Friend to withdraw them. None the less, I pay
tribute to his valuable work in drawing the matter to the attention of

Flello:</b> I would like to return to a couple of points.
First, on the electorate having their say, although an evidential basis
is crucial, it is down to the electorate to make their views known and
be listened to on some things-for example, public drinking. With
respect to supermarket car parks, I suspect that it is probably not
beyond the wit of most people to address the issue. However, I take on
board the Minister's comments. I ask him to reconsider in the
weeks ahead whether there is scope for widening the DPPO route and
making it more
accessible.</div><a name="100223109000375"></a>
