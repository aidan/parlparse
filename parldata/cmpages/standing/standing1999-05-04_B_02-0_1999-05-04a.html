<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 10, in page 1, line 17, leave out `£161.20' and insert `£45.10'. [Mr. Edward Davey.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): It is my 
pleasure to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cook, and I 
look forward to serving on the Committee under your 
chairmanship.
<P>
When the Committee was suspended, we were 
discussing amendment No. 10 to clause 1, which covers 
the duty on sparkling cider. I was concluding my 
comments and explaining why we are concerned about 
the size of the increase. Despite knowing for the past four 
years, since infraction proceedings were first initiated by 
the Italians, that that was a possible outcome, a 400 per 
cent. increase in one year is large by any judgment.
<P>
The second reason for our concern was discussed in the 
Standing Committee on last year's Finance Bill when the 
then Financial Secretary and I traded examples of 
different alcoholic beverages that were caught by the 
regulations and those that were not. In my discussions 
with Somerset cider makers, the example of Lambrini 
Bianco perry was quoted as being on sale in Liverpool 
and was causing concern among Italian sparkling wine 
producers. I said that Lambrini Bianco was not caught by 
the regulations because the pressure in the bottle was one 
bar or less. The then Financial Secretary gave the example 
of Fastini Spumante, which I have never drunk but which 
apparently has a pressure of 7.5 per cent., and maintained 
that such counterfeit brands would be caught by the 
regulations. On reflection, it seems that the Government's 
approach to protecting cider makers and catching 
counterfeit producers is wrong.
<P>
If the Paymaster General cannot accept the amendment, 
will she speak to her officials and give a commitment to 
review the regulatory approach that Customs and Excise 
has adopted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): The 
Commission complained about the lack of competition in 
1995 and there was an announcement in the November 
1996 Budget about moving towards alignment through graduation, so has not the industry had enough time for structural preparation? The amendment would simply risk 
the Commission's wrath and infraction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am disappointed by the hon. Gentleman's 
intervention. He usually pays attention to comments from 
hon. Members and I covered that point earlier. I do not 
think he was drinking cider at lunch time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No, I cannot afford it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am not casting a slur on the hon. 
Gentleman, but the Economic Secretary suggested that I 
had had a little tipple.
<P>
We are discussing a very small group of cider makers 
with very small businesses. There may have been an 
announcement in the 1996 Budget, but they did not know 
that there would be a 400 per cent. increase this year. 
They may have known two years ago that there would be 
some increase, but it will be very difficult for them to 
adjust to such a large increase.
<P>
Before the hon. Member for Croydon, Central 
(Mr. Davies) intervened, I referred to possible regulatory 
approaches. As we discovered when I read them out, the 
regulations are framed in terms of bars, mushroom 
stoppers and so on. I cannot believe that the development 
of another regulatory approach, perhaps using advertising 
regulations, is beyond the wit of Customs and Excise 
officials. In discussing Lambrini Bianco, Fastini 
Spumante and so on during last year's Finance Bill 
Standing Committee proceedings, it became clear that 
such sparkling wines were being falsely presented as 
Italian in origin. I do not claim to be an expert, but there 
may be alternative approaches to enable us to tackle 
counterfeit producers more effectively, without penalising 
the good Somerset cider maker. Perhaps the way forward 
is to introduce a regulation based on the ingredients used.
<P>
I realise that the provision follows in the footsteps of 
the Government's predecessors, but two wrongs do not 
make a right. Although the group of businesses that the 
provision will penalise is small, it is incumbent on the 
Committee to stand up for the smallest of minorities to 
ensure that they get a fair deal from the House.



<P>
I hope that, even at this late stage, the Government will 
reflect on the matter. If they were to accept our 
amendment, they could tell the Commission and the 
Italian Government that the duty increase is a step in the 
right direction, albeit at a slower pace. Therefore, they 
might escape infraction proceedings while they reconsider 
their approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I welcome you, 
Mr. Cook, to the Chair. Had you attended our proceedings 
last year, you, like me, would have been struck by a sense 
of deja vu on hearing the speech of the hon. Member for 
Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). He will agree that, 
on that occasion, he moved a similar amendment and 
made similar comments. My contribution will be brief 
and, likewise, similar to the one that I made last year.
<P>
The Bill appears to continue a policy of bringing duty 
on sparkling cider into line with duty on low-strength 
sparkling wine, which we originated under the threat of 
possible infraction proceedings, and which has the assent 
of the National Association of Cider Makers. Given that 
I represent a large cider-producing area, I respect the 
views of that association and listen to them with care. My 
constituency contains the second largest cider producer in 
the United Kingdom, as well as many valued, smaller 
cider makers. Under normal circumstances, I resolutely 
oppose tax increases, but I have to say that this one is 
more than usually justified and I have received no 
representations about it.
<P>
It is a less than well-guarded secret that small cider 
makers receive a fairly generous concession. If my 
memory serves me right, those who produce less than 
1,5000 gallons a year are entirely exempt from duty. They 
enjoy that concession for the good reason that it helps to 
protect and encourage local farmhouse cider production, 
from whence the industry originated. However, we should 
not make too much of that concession, in case a 
tax-raising Government we do not need to look too far 
for such a Government decide to end it. Many of the 
people whom I seek to protect are covered by the 
exemption, but if the hon. Member for Kingston and 
Surbiton thinks otherwise, I shall give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am perturbed by the right hon. 
Gentleman's logic. The fact that the vast majority escape 
duty does not mean that the Government can therefore 
target a large increase on a small number of producers. 
There should be no discrimination against that small 
number of producers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If the small cider makers are 
exempt from duty, they will not worry about any increase 
that affects their larger brethren. The larger cider makers 
have made no representations to me this year, because 
they agree that the policy of bringing the duty slowly into 
line with competitive low-strength sparkling wine 
products is necessary. It is therefore unwise to stir up that 
particular nest. We shall not support the hon. Gentleman 
on the amendment.
<P>
I am all for tradition in our debates, but I do not think 
that the hon. Gentleman pressed his points to a division 
last year, and perhaps we could shorten the proceedings 
if he showed a similar intention this year.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> Good 
afternoon, Mr. Cook, and welcome to the Committee.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-
Amory) displayed the same sensitivity and understanding 
towards the cider industry in last year's debate as he has this 
afternoon. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has 
displayed a lack of appreciation as to why the Government 
have to take these steps. I want to deal with four issues that 
he has raised. First, the infraction proceedings; secondly, 
the definition; thirdly, the timing issue the spread over 
four years; and, fourthly, the increase that we now face.
<P>
Given the frequency with which those issues are raised 
by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, perhaps 
we should call this debate "Cider with Davey"	.
[Hon. Members: "Oh!"	] I am sorry, Mr. Cook. I promise 
that I will not do that again.
<P>
First, the infraction proceedings were started against the 
previous Government, as the right hon. Member for Wells 
said. The duty rates needed to be changed, and the 
previous Government introduced the definition in the 
1996 Finance Bill, when they made a small increase to 
the level of duty. The definition that was part of the 
agreement under the infraction proceedings is crucial to 
this issue. The package consisted of the definition, and 
the period of time within which the Government had to 
comply with raising the duty rates. A major consideration 
for both the previous and the present Government is how 
best to assist the cider industry to adjust to those 
inevitable changes.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked 
whether the matter was the subject of horse-trading in 
relation to other negotiations in Europe. I should like to 
make it clear that the commitment was made, correctly, 
by the previous Government following the threat of 
infraction proceedings. It was agreed that the measures 
would be phased in over a number of years we are 
already late in delivering that alignment and that that 
should be done as closely as possible in consultation with 
the industry, with whom the definition was agreed.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton points 
out, the duty increase this time is very large. That, too, 
was agreed with the industry. It was how they wanted the 
phasing over the four years to be delivered, to give them 
the maximum opportunity to realign their product and to 
ensure that they come within the definition in the Finance 
Act 1996. To change the definition now, to try to delay or 
interfere with the agreement made with the Commission, 
which the industry have planned over this period, would 
be extremely foolish. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, 
it would undermine the very industry that he claims his 
amendment would defend.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The amendment must be rejected. The plan is 
predicated on the definition agreed following infraction 
proceedings, and the foundations were laid in 1996. The 
plan was delivered in such a way as to ensure protection 
of the industry and to give it the maximum amount of 
time to adjust its production and to come within the 
definition. As the right hon. Member for Wells said, the 
industry is not complaining bitterly about the increase.
I am sure that it would prefer the increase not to occur, 
but it recognises that it is a requirement within the 
proposed legislation.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton 
will accept that we must take all the necessary steps this 
year, and that the cider industry must be allowed to get 
on with selling and marketing its products to try to 
persuade people such as him to drink its products in 
preference to other beverages. I urge the Committee to 
reject the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> At the beginning of the Minister's 
comments, when she cracked her joke about "Cider with 
Davey"	, I was not sure whether she was offering me a 
drink in order to help the sales of the cider industry. She 
makes the same mistake as the right hon. member for 
Wells. Both of them talked about the industry the right 
hon. Member for Wells talked about the larger cider 
makers and both showed that they had missed the thrust 
of the argument made this year and last year. It is not the 
large cider makers who are at issue it is not an 
industry-wide problem. It is one or two perhaps three 
cider makers who produce the cider in a particular 
traditional way, using mushroom stoppers and particular 
pressures, who will be hit by the increase. The vast 
majority of cider makers will not be affected.
<P>
The Paymaster General is right to say that the industry 
as a whole is not worried it has been consulted and has 
agreed with the Government's approach. but it is not good 
enough merely to say, "The industry accepts"	. Small 
businesses have particular concerns, of which the NACM 
and the wider industry may not have taken cognisance. 
There may not be a stream of complaints, but a few small 
businesses may still be affected.
<P>
Although I understand the Paymaster General's 
arguments she may feel that she is bound by decisions 
made by the previous Government I hope that Ministers 
will learn a lesson. When negotiating with an industry and 
trying to react, for example, to infraction proceedings 
taken up with the Commission by other EU Governments, 
Ministers must ensure that their solution causes as little 
disruption as possible, not only to the wider industry but 
to individual businesses.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman say what 
percentage of the cider-making industry will be adversely 
affected? He suggests that some tiny producers will be 
badly affected and therefore the Government have not 
taken their position into account. The figures available to 
me suggest that the small producers to which he refers 
have 0.05 per cent. of the UK cider market. I am sure that 
he is not suggesting that we should put the whole cider 
industry at risk for the sake of such a small if 
well-thought-of section of the industry.



<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister half makes my point. It is a 
small section of the industry I do not dispute that but 
it does not necessarily follow that if we do not protect it, 
the whole cider industry will be under threat.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells was correct to say 
that I withdrew a similar amendment last year. I intend to 
do that again this year. But his comment that that would 
speed up proceedings is not appropriate in light of this 
morning's performance by Conservative Members. The 
fact that we have spent 15 or 20 minutes talking about 
issues that affect businesses and people in this country is 
a sign that we are getting on with the real business of this 
Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East 
Chelmsford): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 
1, line 18, leave out from `deemed' to end of line 19 
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`come into force on 1st January 2000.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There is a minor amendment to 
amendment No. 1. Although its intention is clear, its 
drafting is slightly defective. It should read: in page 1, line 
18, leave out from "shall" which replaces "deemed" to 
the end of line 19 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`come into force on 1st January 2000.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I do not want to detain the 
Committee unduly, but this is an important point. The 
amendment would delay the increase coming into effect 
from the time that is specified in the Bill of 6 pm on 9 
March the date of the Budget to 1 January 2000. Since 
1993, changes to the duty rates of alcoholic drinks have 
been deferred to 1 January. The clause sets the precedent 
of putting the change into effect on Budget day. A phrase 
within the press release that accompanies the Budget 
document says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The timing of any future rate changes will be aligned with the 
Spring Budget Cycle."<P>
</UL></FONT>	
<P>
The drinks industry is concerned that although the 
Chancellor has frozen alcohol duties with the exception 
of the rate on sparkling cider there is a general 
expectation that that will not always be the case. As a 
result of sneaking through this change in policy, the 
alcoholic drinks industry may find that increases will not 
take effect at the beginning of the following year in line 
with previous practice, but on Budget day itself. That 
would bring forward the tax increase by nine months and 
would represent a major increase in taxation among the 
stealthiest of stealth tax increases. The Brewers and 
Licensed Retailers Association, and Bass in particular, 
have drawn our attention to their fears that that may 
become an established precedent.
<P>
It is worth reminding the Committee why the delay in 
duty rates was introduced. Prior to June 1993, beer duty 
was charged on volume of original gravity. The duty was 
based on the strength of wort, which is an extract, and 
levied at the beginning of the brewing process. It was 
customary to implement Budget changes at 6 pm, but it 
was not always necessary for the price increases to come 
into effect immediately, because there was at least two to 
four weeks' worth of beer in process. The policy was then 
changed, and the duty was levied on the end product. At 
that time, a general undertaking was given that the new 
system would not involve brewers in specific extra costs. 
There was an understanding that future Budget changes 
would not be implemented from 6 pm they would be 
delayed until later.
<P>
The Budget and the reference in the press release to the 
duty on sparkling cider appear to have changed that 
policy. However, there is a suggestion that that approach 
will set the precedent that any duty increases introduced 
in future Budgets will take effect on Budget day rather 
than on a future date. That is why we moved the 
amendment, which would restore the arrangement that 
applied before the Budget and thus reassure the industry.



<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The clause has nothing whatever to 
do with beer; it relates to sparkling cider. Had the hon. 
Gentleman read the press release, he would know that the 
infraction proceedings required us to comply with the 
duty rate change by 1 January 1999. To ensure that there 
was no question of action being taken against us, and 
having taken legal advice, we introduced the new rate 
with, as I said earlier, the agreement of the industry.
<P>
The position is straightforward: we wanted to ensure 
that we met our legal obligations. The amendment should 
be rejected because it would prevent us from fulfilling the 
obligations to which the Government were committed by 
the previous Government. I hope that the hon. Gentleman 
withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster 
General for her response. If I understand her correctly, the 
duty increase was implemented on Budget day rather than 
at the beginning of the following year, which is the usual 
practice, in order to comply with the European Court's 
requirements. Does that mean that the Government's 
approach does not set a precedent? If future increases in 
alcoholic duty are introduced, will they be introduced 
under the previous arrangement? That would mean that 
the implementation date was likely to be 1 January of the 
following year.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The clause is about sparkling cider; 
it is not about beer. I have already explained why we used 
the specified implementation date. If the hon. Gentleman 
wants to discuss beer, he should do so later, at a relevant 
point in our proceedings.

<P>
</FONT><H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I shall not detain the 
Committee long, but the clause reveals the complexity of 
the Government's thinking. One should suppose that an 
increased rebate would reduce taxation, but the guidance 
notes from the Inland Revenue say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The estimated revenue effect of this change in 1999/2000 is +£20 
million on an indexed base."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As always, the devil is in the detail.
<P>
While 2000 will start with a bang for many people, for 
those with older vehicles it will start with a ban. I am 
especially concerned about how the rule will affect the 
owners of classic cars. I must declare an interest because 
my brother-in-law owns and runs the world's most 
successful classic car auction company, and he alerted me 
to the effect of the measure. However, I am not pleading 
purely in a personal capacity, because there are 650,000 
classic cars on the road, of which 42 per cent. are 
roadworthy. That means that 400,000 vehicles could be 
affected by the change.



<P>
The average mileage of classic cars is modest. On 
average, they are driven for only 1,000 or 1,200 miles a 
year, whereas the typical car is driven for more than 
10,000 miles a year. The owners of such cars are often of 
modest means. I learned to drive in a Triumph Herald, 
which is now a classic car and very fine too. One does 
not have to be that well off to drive a Triumph Herald, 
but there will be a severe tax penalty for anyone who 
wants to drive one after 1 January 2000. I see the 
Minister's official shaking his head, but as I understand 
it, when the clause comes into force on 1 October, it will 
coincide with the introduction of lead replacement petrol.
<P>
The Government have decided to treat lead replacement 
petrol, which will be used only by owners of classic cars, 
as a form of super unleaded, so it will be subject to a 
much higher rate of duty. When we are talking about 
a cost of only £20 million, it seems penny-pinching and 
mean-minded to say that those who drive classic cars 
should have to pay a higher rate of duty. Given that people 
who own and treasure classic cars, along with those who 
own and treasure works of art, face the added problem of 
value added tax on art sales from the end of June 1999, 
the Government are adding insult to injury by telling them 
that they must pay more for their petrol.

<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): As a former owner of 
a classic car, a Riley, I did not find that my family 
discussed such matters around the kitchen table. Is the 
hon. Gentleman sharing with the Committee a new 
version of kitchen table politics?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I can assure the hon. Lady that when 
I meet my brother-in-law round the kitchen table, we talk 
about little else, and for good reason. If it is true that only 
two per cent. of cars will be affected by the provision, the 
Government should show a more generous spirit in 
dealing with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I shall be brief. My hon. Friend has 
eloquently drawn our attention to the particular concerns 
of classic car owners, and I do not wish to add much to his 
comments. However, I should be grateful if the Economic 
Secretary would deal with one other small point. As I 
understand it, the provision is necessary principally 
because leaded fuel will shortly no longer be available, 
and those who cannot or have not converted their cars to 
unleaded fuel will have to use the new lead replacement 
petrol. The success of Conservative Government policy in 
encouraging people to switch to unleaded petrol is one of 
our greatest triumphs, and demonstrates the effectiveness 
of providing incentives. Nevertheless, some people will 
continue to own cars that will not run on unleaded petrol, 
and will have to use lead replacement petrol.
<P>
When the change was announced, the Budget press 
release explained that a rebate would be introduced to 
reduce the duty rate on lead replacement petrol. However, 
it stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the duty rate will be cut to 2p above the rate of unleaded petrol 
because, from 1 January 2000, this grade of fuel will no longer 
contain benzene ... But the fuel will be used in older, more polluting 
cars and it would not be right to cut the rate to the same as 
unleaded."<P>
</UL></FONT>	
<P>I draw the Economic Secretary's attention to the 
comments of the Automobile Association on that point:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is no reason why lead replacement petrol and unleaded should 
be taxed differently, and the age of the vehicle is in itself not 
sufficient reason for taxing cars using lead replacement petrol more 
than cars of the same age which are able to use unleaded fuel. Indeed 
the technical standards of both fuels are very similar, the real test 
of whether a car is environmentally sound is in the level of toxic 
and CO2 emissions."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a point to which we shall return when we debate 
clause 8, which is specifically concerned with 
encouraging the use of environmentally friendly cars.
<P>
The AA points out that many older cars, the owners of 
which will have to pay the slightly higher rate that will 
apply to lead replacement petrol, are



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"marginal, low mileage vehicles, often run by women as a second 
car or run as the main car by less well-off households ... It is unfair 
that these households should pay extra tax on their fuel for what is 
very little environmental benefit."	
<P>

That is a good point, which I hope the Economic 
Secretary will deal with. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind Committee members 
to ensure that their telephones and pagers are switched to 
"silent"	, "vibrate"	 or a similar setting, so that our 
proceedings are not disturbed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): In general, I 
support the proposals in clause 3, but I want to reinforce 
the comments made by previous hon. Members in relation 
to vehicles that cannot be converted.
<P>
Many such vehicles are to be found in poorer areas, 
and Cornwall must certainly count as one of those. An 
extraordinary number of old Metros are unconvertible. 
They are used as second cars. It is curious that car 
ownership is a criterion used for affluence, rather than the 
type of car owned. Two classic cars or two old Metros 
would count equally in the calculation of affluence, 
according to that criterion.
<P>
I am not worried about the owners of classic cars, who 
can look after themselves. However, families who rely 
on older, unconvertible vehicles will face two problems. 
I wonder whether the Government have considered any 
of the relevant figures in relation that. First, when lead 
replacement petrol is introduced in the second half of this 
year, will it be as widely available at the petrol pumps as 
other fuels? If its availability is sporadic, those with 
vehicles using that type of fuel will have to travel further 
to fill up their tanks. Secondly, those people will be hit 
with a higher duty. They could, therefore, be faced with 
a triple disadvantage: they will have to travel more miles 
to get the fuel; the fuel will cost more because of its 
relative scarcity; and it will then be loaded with the duty. 
That will have an adverse effect on poorer families who 
have to rely on older, unconverted vehicles. Will the 
Minister tell us whether any research has been done into 
the matter, the results of which might allay my fears?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): On a point of order, 
Mr. Chairman. Would it be permissible for us to remove 
our jackets?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Male members of the Committee may, 
by all means, divest themselves of their jackets. Female 
members may divest themselves of an upper garment, if 
they so wish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): The small measure that we 
are being asked to approve brings me to a point that I 
made during the sittings motion about the justification for 
Government action.
<P>
I want to pick up on the questions asked very 
properly, in my opinion by the hon. Member for 
South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed). He asked where the 
research was, and how the Government could justify not 
treating lead replacement petrol in the same way as 
unleaded fuel. The proposal could affect 2.3 million cars 
in the United Kingdom.
<P>
Although I must declare an interest as an enthusiast for 
classic cars, that is not a point that we need to debate, 
because people who run classic cars make a personal 
commitment to keep that type of older vehicle on the road. 
None the less, it shows a certain discrimination.
<P>
I recall, in a previous Finance Bill, the hon. Member 
for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) uttering a tirade 
of criticism against the previous Government's effort to 
assist classic cars by introducing a concession on vehicle 
excise duty. It was sad to hear someone who represented 
the erstwhile motor city of the Untied Kingdom, famed 
for the manufacture of cars that have become classic over 
time, attack its products in terms of maintaining their 
place on the road, and thus being the subject of this 
clause.



<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
In the notes on clauses, the Treasury states that some 
of those older cars are less fuel efficient. I should like to 
know whether the Economic Secretary has studied the 
fuel usage of, for example, the old BMC A-series engine, 
some of which moved serenely on to power early versions 
of the Metro. If she has, she might find that the fuel 
efficiency of those old cars was equivalent to that of many 
modern cars. Has she studied the fuel consumption of the 
original Volkswagen Beetle, which could also be affected 
by the proposal? If its consumption of lead replacement 
fuel is equivalent to that of some modern cars, the 
proposal is discriminatory against owners of those older 
cars, who doubtless put a lot of love, care and attention 
into maintaining them in safe condition to meet the 
requirements of the MOT. The tax that they pay is already 
high enough, but to find themselves worse off as a result 
of the Government's proposals than those with younger 
cars with equivalent fuel efficiency is discriminatory.
<P>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will enlighten us in 
some detail on the research that she has carried out to 
justify why cars with similar fuel efficiency to the two 
types that I mentioned should be discriminated against in 
the clause.
<P><B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury</B> (Ms Patricia Hewitt): Unlike the majority of Committee 
members, this is my first Finance Bill Committee and I 
shall look to you, Mr. Cook, and your fellow Chairman 
for guidance during our proceedings.
<P>
I shall speak about the purpose and effect of the 
clause and respond to the hon. Member for Guildford 
(Mr. St. Aubyn), who is practising not kitchen table 
conservatism but classic car conservatism.
<P>
The clause reduces the rate of duty payable on super 
unleaded petrol higher octane unleaded petrol by 3.7p 
per litre. It is one of the many tax cuts in the Budget and 
I hope that it will commend itself to the Committee. The 
duty rate will take effect on 1 October to facilitate the 
introduction of lead replacement petrol. We chose that 
date to allow enough time for the industry to sort out 
storage, distribution and pump logistics in advance of 
1 January 2000 when leaded petrol will be banned, except 
for a small percentage of total sales.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked how a tax-cutting measure 
could result in a revenue increase. When we produced the 
original forecast for revenue on an indexed basis, we took 
into account the fact that leaded petrol would not be 
available after 1 January 2000 and assumed the motorists 
who previously needed to use leaded petrol and had not 
converted to unleaded petrol would buy unleaded petrol 
and add their own additive to substitute for lead. Had that 
been so, all petrol would have carried duty at the unleaded 
rate. With the introduction of lead replacement petrol and 
a rate of duty lower than that for leaded petrol, but still 
2p above that for unleaded petrol, we shall see increased 
receipts compared with the forecast.



<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Economic Secretary has underscored 
the 2p differential. Why did the Treasury choose 2p as the 
differential, and why should there be a differential?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I was coming to that point, but I shall deal 
with it now. The rationale is precisely that to which the 
right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for 
Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) referred. 
Although the benzene content of higher octane unleaded 
petrol is no longer a justification in itself for a higher rate 
of duty on the petrol, the fact is that lead replacement 
petrol will generally be used in older and more polluting 
cars. We believe that a differential is still justified, 
although not the one that existed previously, which 
ensured that an older car running on leaded petrol paid 
nearly 6p more in duty than a car of exactly the same age 
using unleaded petrol. The cut in fuel duties will mean 
that owners of older cars will pay a much lower 
differential than previously.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Is the Economic Secretary prepared to lay, 
in the Library of the House of Commons, the detailed 
analysis of the older car population that justifies her 
proposition in terms of fuel consumption?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As a former Financial Secretary, the right 
hon. Gentleman will know that the evaluation of measures 
proposed in the Budget should be proportionate to their 
effect. He should also be aware that next year we will 
introduce an entirely graduated system of vehicle excise 
duty for new cars, which will take account of emissions. 
We do not have emissions data for all makes of older cars, 
and I therefore do not propose to respond in detail to the 
questions that he asked about different makes of cars. 
Because older cars are more polluting 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> May I finish this point? Because of that, it 
is right to maintain a duty differential in line with the 
polluter pays principle, which commended itself to the 
previous Government. That principle does not appear to 
commend itself to the Conservative party in opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Economic Secretary may have misheard 
me, but my point concerned fuel consumption, not 
emissions. May I ask her again whether the Treasury 
evaluated the fuel consumption proposition referred to in 
the notes on clauses?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I will certainly make available to the right 
hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members information of 
the kind that he requests, in so far as it is available. The 
general point remains: as older cars are more polluting, it 
is right to maintain a differential in line with the polluter 
pays principle. I want to stress, especially to Conservative 
Members, that that means a cut in the duty that will be 
paid on that class of petrol.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The 
Economic Secretary has just said that the proposal 
constitutes a cut. Will she tell the Committee what the 
duty on high octane unleaded petrol was before the 
Budget? What will it be as a result of the clause?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The duty on super unleaded petrol 
previously was 52.88p. Under the clause, it will fall to 
49.21p, which, if I am correct, is a cut of 3.67p per litre.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Was that the rate before the escalator that 
was announced or that came into effect as a result of 
the Budgets, or was it the rate after this year's escalator, 
which is 52p?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It is the rate currently in force, which will 
be replaced on 1 October by the rate specified in the 
clause.



<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I asked the Economic Secretary what rate 
was in place before the Budget?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am afraid that I do not have that figure 
in front of me. I shall give way if the hon. Gentleman 
would like to make it known to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The rate was 48.76p before the Budget. It 
is now 49.21p, which is an increase in duty. That is the 
reason for the figure of £20 million, to which my hon. 
Friend the Member for Guildford referred.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. The rate 
currently in force is 52.88p per litre. That will fall, on 
1 October, to 49.21p.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall raised an 
important point about the availability of lead replacement 
petrol. The cut in duty will encourage oil companies to 
make lead replacement petrol widely available. We have 
been encouraged by their response to our proposal to 
lower the duty rate. We expect lead replacement petrol to 
be available at most petrol stations, but that is a matter 
for the oil companies. The withdrawal of leaded petrol 
from 1 January will free up the petrol pumps that were 
previously used for leaded petrol and allow them to be 
used for super unleaded petrol.
<P>
Several Opposition Members have suggested that we 
should have reduced the duty further than we did, but they 
did not feel sufficiently strongly about the subject to table 
an amendment. I hope that the clause will be agreed to 
without a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I listened carefully to the Paymaster 
General. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for 
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) that the 
Government's proposal involves a tax increase. The 
rationale behind the Paymaster General's argument is that, 
by reducing the tax on super unleaded fuel, tax revenues 
will go up. We will need to bear that argument in mind 
when we consider clause 5 and discuss the level of duty 
on other products. We believe that those duties should 
also be reduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): The hon. Member 
for Guildford made much of classic cars and complained 
about the differential associated with the duty on classic 
car fuel. He said that, on average, such cars travel about 
1,000 miles per annum. Using a differential of 2p per litre, 
and the rough figure of 25 miles to the gallon at 4.4 litres 
to the gallon, my arithmetic suggests that the annual 
difference will be £2.20. Does the hon. Gentleman believe 
that it is worth detaining the Committee over such a sum?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have non intention of discussing the 
matter further. The Government are obviously hostile to 
classic cars and their owners and to those who depend on 
older cars. They will face a high cost of conversion and 
an irritating amount of tax to pay. The Government's 
proposal is mean minded, and I hope that they will not 
bring down the level in line with the other rate 
environmental objections should not apply.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> May I correct one figure that I 
inadvertently gave? I am afraid that my handwriting was 
at fault. The current rate for super unleaded petrol is not 
52.88p but 52.33p, so there will be a cut of 3.12p.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Although I have sat on four 
Finance Bill Committees, this is the first time that I have 
moved an amendment. I am pleased to move this probing 
amendment, which should establish the Government's 
intentions about a situation that is, by anyone's reckoning, 
ludicrous. Government revenue is declining and cigarette 
smoking is increasing. Whether one agrees with freedom 
of choice for adults to smoke or whether one is hostile to 
smoking, the Government's present policy is nonsense by 
any measure.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Since the Government came to power, revenue has 
declined from around £7.65 billion in 1997 to £7.4 billion 
in 1998, and it will decline dramatically again as a result 
of measures in the Budget. At the same time, black market 
smuggling is increasing it increased from about 28 per 
cent. in 1996 to 28.5 per cent. in 1998. We have the 
highest excise duty on cigarettes in the European Union, 
and only Norway has higher duty on cigarettes. I shall 
demonstrate that the higher the duty, the greater the 
incentive to smuggle and the greater the transfer from 
duty-paid cigarettes to smuggled cigarettes. It is almost a 
self-fulfilling prophecy that the amount of smuggling and 
the amount of duty haemorrhaging from Customs and 
Excise is bound to increase.



<P>
When the previous Government were in power, we had 
a 3 per cent. escalator. One of the first actions of the 
present Government was to increase that to 5 per cent. 
The proposals in the Budget will increase the duty on a 
packet of 20 cigarettes by 17.5 per cent., which amounts 
to a staggering 80 to 90 per cent. of the price of cheaper 
cigarettes. On some cheaper packets of cigarettes, 90 per 
cent. of the price will be duty payable to the Government, 
so the incentive to smuggle will be even greater.
<P>
It is estimated that about £250 million in duty is lost to 
Customs and Excise through legitimate consumption by 
people who go over the channel and bring cigarettes back 
legally, but on top of that, about £700 million in duty is 
lost on hand-rolling tobacco. I shall explain what happens 
when duty is increased and consumption "falls"	. Between 
1991 and 1998 the consumption of legitimately bought, 
duty-paid hand-rolling tobacco declined by 50 per cent., 
while the consumption of smuggled hand-rolling tobacco 
with no duty paid has increased to a staggering 75 per 
cent. of the total. The two have gone in opposite 
directions. Three quarters of all hand-rolling tobacco 
smoked in this country is now imported illegally. The 
Government recognise that, because even they have not 
increased the duty on hand-rolling tobacco.
<P>
If the Government have recognised the problem with 
hand-rolling tobacco, why have they not recognised the 
same problem with cigarettes and cigars? Their position 
is illogical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that 
the duty on hand-rolling tobacco in various continental 
countries is lower than the duty imposed on rolled 
cigarettes and cigars, which may explain the 
Government's approach?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. One 
of our most easily accessible markets for smugglers is 
Belgium. I make no comment on the Belgian police, but 
the price of hand-rolling tobacco in Belgium is a quarter 
of that in the United Kingdom. There is an incentive for 
small-scale smuggling by individuals who go to Belgium 
and bring back more than they need for personal 
consumption; there is an incentive for medium-scale 
smuggling in white vans; even more importantly, there is 
an increasing tendency for container-loads of hand rolling 
tobacco and cigarettes to be brought illegally into this 
country.
<P>
In last year's Finance Bill Committee I asked the 
Government what resources they intended to make 
available to Customs and Excise to try to stem the loss of 
revenue. People in the trade believe that the loss of 
revenue on hand-rolling tobacco and cigarettes is now 
approaching more than £1 billion, but that must be viewed 
in the context of the Government's actions since the 
previous Finance Bill. They announced an increase in 
resources for Her Majesty's Customs and Excise of 
£35 million, set against a loss to Customs and Excise 
of more than £1 billion. However, the situation is even 
more ludicrous because the increase is not £35 million in 
one year, but £35 million over three years, so the 
Government are giving Customs and Excise almost £12 
million a year in increased resources to stem the 
haemorrage of more than £1 billion.

<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): If there were a move

would the hon. Gentleman support or oppose it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am not in favour of harmonising 
taxes in the European Union because duties and taxes 
would be increased to the highest level. As I made clear 
on Third Reading, I am generally in favour of lowering 
taxes and giving the individual more freedom of choice. 
It is common sense to increase Government revenues. As 
I shall explain, in other countries where duty on cigarettes 
has been dramatically lowered, customs and excise 
receipts have considerably increased.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg rose </B><P>



<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My goodness, I have stirred up a 
hornets' nest. I give way to the hon. Member for Kingston 
and Surbiton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman 
dismisses the comments made by the hon. Member for 
Wimbledon (Mr. Casale) about the proposal to harmonise 
taxes in that area. A press release from the Tobacco 
Alliance, dated 29 July 1998, says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Harmonising tobacco tax across Europe is the logical solution 
to eradicating tobacco smuggling, yet the Government has ignored 
the obvious."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is the hon. Gentleman ignoring the obvious?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I do not want to get into a debate 
on the European Union because I am sure that I would be 
ruled out of order. I have made it clear that I am not in 
favour of European tax harmonisation, and I hope that we 
will not be forced down that path by the Government. As 
a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I want to 
concentrate on the resources available to Customs and 
Excise to stem the huge haemorrhage in tobacco and other 
duties. That is a very serious problem. Total duties in this 
country amount to £10 billion, so a haemorrhage of more 
than £1 billion is a serious matter.
<P>
One might ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to 
investigate the matter, but it seems to me, as a member of 
the Public Accounts Committee, that Customs and Excise 
should be given more resources. The increased resources 
announced since the previous Finance Bill follow a 
reduction in resources last year. Indeed, the member of 
the Public and Commercial Services Union that I have 
already quoted said that last year's cut in resources to 
Customs and Excise would have involved a loss of 1,100 
jobs through natural wastage, whereas the increase of 
£35 million over three years will create only 100 jobs. 
Therefore the resources given to Customs and Excise to 
deal with that very serious problem, which will be 
exacerbated by the Finance Bill, which I am trying to 
amend in order to reduce rates of duty 
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Let me make some progress, then 
I shall give way.
<P>
This is a serious matter, which the Committee should 
address in a non-partisan way. Many comments about the 
issue have been made by members of Customs and 
Excise, and the Committee should be aware of them. For 
example, an investigator, who asked not to be named, 
said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We're having to ignore operations because we don't have the 
funding."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a disgraceful situation. Customs and Excise cannot 
carry out its duties because the Government have not 
given it the necessary funding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
giving way a second time. It is all very well for him to 
argue that he is not in favour of tax harmonisation, but he 
seems to be arguing for the convergence of rates of duty 
on cigarettes sold in Britain and those sold on the 
continent of Europe, so as to reduce smuggling.



<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I wish that I had not given way 
to people who keep on about European tax harmonisation, 
because it is not going to happen. Although the Budget 
makes resources available for the euro heaven help us 
it makes no provision for tax harmonisation. However, 
the public should know that the interventions during our 
proceedings, lead me to believe that that will shortly form 
part of the Government's proposals.
<P>
Before I was diverted by those interventions, I was 
talking about resources for Her Majesty's Customs and 
Excise. Mr. Spendiff, of the PCSU, which represents 
many Customs and Excise employees, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is very demoralising. We just do not have the physical 
resources to intercept criminals"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a very serious problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I hope that this is not another 
diversionary tactic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I am trying to assist the hon. Gentleman 
with his argument. As the Paymaster General will know, 
there has recently been a reduction in Customs and Excise 
personnel at Plymouth. The Plymouth team was one of 
the most successful in identifying smuggled goods. 
[Interruption.] The Paymaster General shakes her head 
but, in geographic terms, I am a little closer to Plymouth 
than she is. I have met people in the Plymouth team, and 
they assure me that there has been a reduction in staff, 
perhaps by relocating some people to other areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the hon. 
Gentleman for making that point. Indeed, I intended to 
provide similar examples. At Leeds-Bradford airport there 
are not full-time front-line customs staff. In Dundee, the 
number of excise verification officers has been cut from 
five to two. If the criminal fraternity were carefully to 
study some areas of the country, they would discover that 
there is no difficulty whatever in smuggling in cigarettes. 
That is a reprehensible state of affairs, and it is high time 
that the Government gave Customs and Excise much 
greater resources.
<P>
The Government could do much more. For example, in 
France [Interruption.] I am making serious points, yet 
some members of the Committee seem to think the subject 
a joke. It is no joke for schools and hospitals, from which 
tax revenues are being diverted to deal with the problem. 
Schools and hospitals would dearly love to have that 
money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): Will the hon. 
Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I will give way to the hon. 
Gentleman in a minute and doubtless he will cause 
trouble as well.
<P>
The French customs and excise authorities are far more 
vigilant [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are here to scrutinise the 
Bill line by line. I am in favour of the job being done in 
good humour, but there should be less diversionary 
conversation on other matters. Attention should be paid 
instead to the speeches being made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, 
Mr. Cook, because I was about to make the serious point 
that because the French customs and excise authority has 
greater resources and better equipment, it is much more 
vigilant in dealing with the problem than we are. One 
piece of equipment can X-ray an entire lorry, and such 
equipment would allow Customs and Excise quickly to 
intercept contraband cigarettes on the main lorry routes 
into this country. I hope that that is a practical example 
of why the Government should increase resources to Her 
Majesty's Customs and Excise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton Brown:</B> I said that I would give way to 
the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love).



<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> As a fellow member of the Public Accounts 
Committee, I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's 
argument. His amendment is concerned with reducing the 
rate of duty. I put to him the question that his hon. Friends 
sympathetically raised about the Laffer curve: does he 
support the proposition that by reducing the rate of duty, 
it is possible to increase the amount that the Government 
receive?

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</b> Absolutely. If the hon. Gentleman is patient, I shall give him the evidence to support that 
proposition.
<P>
I said that Her Majesty's Customs and Excise should 
be given more resources. I am all in favour of the law 
being obeyed. I believe that laws should be properly 
enforced in each country and that the Government should 
be tough in connection with law and order. The Paymaster 
General announced, with much trumpeting, in a press 
release on 28 July that Customs and Excise would receive 
£35 million in extra resources. She is quoted as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`Over £800 million is lost to tobacco and alcohol smuggling 
an outrageous amount which takes much needed resources away 
from our schools and hospitals.'"	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is precisely my point. She continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`This package will give those on the front line the tools needed 
to crackdown on smugglers and protect law abiding traders.'"	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How will £12 million provide Customs and Excise with 
the tools for the job? The hon. Lady went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This activity will simply not be tolerated. Tougher use of 
existing criminal prosecution powers and the stern guidelines on 
sentencing issued by the Appeal Court also send a message to law 
breakers that smuggling does not pay."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could not have put it better. If we do not provide the 
resources, we cannot be surprised when smuggling takes 
place.
<P>
I shall provide evidence to support the proposition that 
by reducing the duty on cigarettes, we increase the legal 
amount of consumption, which reduces the number of 
smuggled cigarettes. Two recent well known examples 
demonstrate that. In 1991, Canada increased the duty on 
tobacco. The British Government have imposed the same 
huge increase in their three Budgets an increase of about 
17p to 20p a packet. Since they have been in power, they 
have imposed an enormous increase in duty that is well 
in excess of 50p on a packet of 20 cigarettes.
<P>
Canada found, as we have, that the number of duty-free 
cigarettes increased. The number coming in from the 
United States soared from fewer than one billion packets 
in 1991 to almost five billion packets in 1993 a fivefold 
increase in just two years. Canada slashed the cigarette 
duty, and by 1994-95 consumption of duty-free cigarettes 
returned to about one billion packets. That is a classic 
and stark example of how reducing duties can increase 
Government revenue.
<P>
Let me give an example that is closer to home. In 1998, 
following a huge tax increase in 1997, the Swedish 
Parliament, led by a Scandinavian Government who 
recognised the environment as being of paramount 
importance, voted to reduce cigarette tax by 26 per cent. 
to stem the tide of illegal contraband cigarettes. I could 
not give a more stark example of how the Government 
have got it wrong. Excise revenue of £10 billion is at risk. 
If we increase duties so much that Customs and Excise 
has to turn a blind eye to widespread smuggling, we put 
that £10 billion increasingly at risk. The haemorrhage has 
worsened. The loss in 1996 was £680 million; by this year 
it is expected to be more than £1 billion; by 2000 it will 
be £1.5 billion. That is a staggering loss of revenue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am interested in the example of 
Canada. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that when the 
Canadians cut the duty on tobacco, their tax revenues 
were massively hit and smoking increased significantly?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Clifton-Brown: I cannot confirm that. If that had 
been the case, common sense would suggest that the 
Canadian Government would have increased the duty 
again. However, that did not happen.
<P>
My figures show that the number of packets of 
duty-free cigarettes coming into Canada declined to 
almost 1 billion by 1994, and stabilised in 1995. The 
number decreased again in 1996, and decreased still 
further in 1997, below the level in 1991, when the tax was 
heavily increased. It would be strange if the hon. 
Gentleman's assertions were true, and I think that he 
should check his facts again.
<P>
I have almost reached the end of what I wanted to say. 
However, I will ask the Minister to state the 
Government's intention when she winds up. Perhaps she 
will not agree to the reductions that my hon. Friends and 
I propose in the amendment, but she should certainly 
agree to the lesser reductions proposed in amendments 
Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 by my right hon. Friend the Member 
for Wells. Those would mean a realistic rate, reverting to 
pre-Budget levels.
<P>
The Government must state their policy clearly, 
because every taxpayer has an interest in it. Their saying 
that they are increasing the duty to try to reduce cigarette 
consumption is like King Canute trying to drive the sea 
back. It will not happen. It is a self-fulfilling prophesy 
that the more the duty is increased, the greater will be the 
incentive to smuggle. As more cigarettes are smuggled, 
fewer legal duty-paid cigarettes will be manufactured in 
this country, more jobs will be lost, and more retailers 
will go out of business.
<P>
The Government's intention is to reduce consumption, 
but their measures will fail to achieve that, because more 
low-quality cigarettes will be smuggled in from places 
such as eastern Europe, and people will them smoke more 
polluting, higher-tar cigarettes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand that there will now 
be a Division in the House, which may possibly be 
followed by a second. In the event of there being only 
one Division, I shall suspend the sitting for 15 minutes, 
and we shall resume at 6.7 pm. If there is a second 
Division, we shall resume 15 minutes later.
<P>
<H5>5.52 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.



<P>
<H5>6.7 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall speak to amendments 
Nos. 2 to 5. I agree with the analysis by my hon. Friend 
the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and with 
his comments about the seriousness of the problem. I have 
no interest to declare I am not a smoker, and my views 
on the matter have nothing to with my habits. I smoked 
only one cigarette this year, on no-smoking day, in order 
to show my defiance of the nanny state.
<P>
The amendments would bring sense back to the 
Government's proposals. If they are not accepted, a 
Government with a natural itch to raise taxation will be 
confronted by the tempting target of the number of 
smokers in this country. The Government have 
succumbed to the relevant temptation, but massively 
overreacted. They have taxed massively and repeatedly, 
and they find themselves in a blind alley. The 
amendments would get them out of that alley and guide 
them towards a more sensible taxation policy.
<P>
The Government's relentless taxation policy on tobacco 
has undermined the revenue that they want to raise. I shall 
add to the figures that my hon. Friend has already given. 
Moreover, the Government, who like to pretend that they 
are on the side of law and order, are increasing 
criminality. They will also cause an uncontrolled increase 
in smoking, especially among young people. They are 
themselves endangering public health.
<P>
The Opposition believe that tobacco taxation has an 
important part to play in relation to health policy. [Hon. 
Members: "Aha."	] It is obvious that if one puts up the 
price of an item, the demand for it will go down. That is 
common sense, and a rather elementary part of market 
economics, which may be newer to Labour Members than 
to us. That is why we had an annual escalator of at least 
3 per cent. in real terms on most tobacco products.
<P>
We understand, but the Government do not, that 
taxation is always a matter of degree and that it is possible 
to overdo it. If one overdoes it, one can bring about 
unintended consequences, which can lead to results that 
are contrary to one's original intentions. That has 
happened in this case. The Government increased the 
escalator on tobacco to at least 5 per cent. annually in real 
terms. They are also introducing the increase that we shall 
discuss later. The Government's reasons for adopting that 
approach are rather confusing. They are in a muddle over 
tobacco and health. For example, we witnessed the 
extraordinary saga of formula one advertising. The 
Labour party had a manifesto promise to end tobacco 
advertising on formula one cars, but there was a complaint 
from Bernie Ecclestone, who pretty well owns formula 
one. The Prime Minister had him in for an interview and 
changed Government policy. Clever old Bernie even got 
his £1 million back as well.
<P>
In that rather shameful episode, the Government tried 
and failed to deal with one aspect of tobacco and health. 
They responded, in the time-honoured fashion, by putting 
the whole burden on to the Revenue, although the 
Treasury probably needed persuasion in that regard. The 
Government increased the relevant taxation in three 
successive Budgets. Incidentally, that approach is 
massively regressive it involves perhaps the most 
regressive form of taxation because it is overwhelmingly 
the low-income groups who smoke the most.



<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I agree with the right hon. 
Gentleman that if those on low incomes continued to 
purchase cigarettes after a price rise, the effect would be 
regressive. However, if the policy discouraged people 
from smoking, it would be progressive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No, I was explaining how the 
policy, which might work at a more moderate level, is 
demonstrably failing. I shall give further examples to 
establish that.
<P>
Students of the pre-Budget report, which was published 
in November 1998, will notice that the anticipated 
revenue from tobacco duties was £8.9 billion for the 
current financial year. Only four months later, the Budget 
report reduced that figure to £7 billion. In the course of a 
few short months, nearly £2 billion has gone missing. 
That conclusively establishes that we are past the point at 
which it is possible to get more revenue by putting up the 
tax rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Has my right hon. Friend heard the 
suggestion that the loss in value that he mentioned 
involves the black market valuations of smuggled 
tobacco, not the duty that would be paid? I hope that he 
will probe the Government further on this matter.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</b> My right hon. Friend makes an interesting point. I hope that the Minister will respond 
to it, as the overall position may be worse than I outlined.
<P>
The allied point is that smuggling is bad and getting 
worse. It was estimated that in 1977 smuggling resulted 
in less than £1 billion of lost revenue, which is a serious 
amount. That figure has now increased, by the 
Government's admission, to £1.5 billion in the current 
year. That was the figure mentioned by the Chancellor in 
his Budget speech, at column 185. He referred to the 
£1.5 billion a year racket, and stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we will target new resources to detect, prevent and punish this 
costly form of organised crime."	 [Official Report, 9 March 1999; 
Vol. 327, c. 185.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will provide a progress report on 
how that £1.5 billion estimate will be reduced.
<P>
The reason for the problem with smuggling is the large 
and growing disparity between taxation in the United 
Kingdom and on the continent. We now have the highest 
tobacco duty rates in Europe. Nearly 90 per cent. of the 
cost of every packet of cigarettes is duty, which gives the 
clearest possible incentive to smugglers, including 
organised gangs.



<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> I have listened carefully to the right 
hon. Gentleman's comments. I am sure that all Labour 
Members appreciate the problem of smuggling and the 
revenue problems that it poses for the Exchequer. Would 
the right hon. Gentleman be content with the duty 
proposed if Customs and Excise were given sufficient 
resources to combat and prevent smuggling? Given the 
health benefits to which he alluded, would not an increase 
in spending on Her Majesty's Customs and Excise be 
preferable to reducing duty?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No, because the Government 
are dealing with symptoms of the problem. I am anxious 
to deal not only with crime but, in the Prime Minister's 
words, with the causes of crime. Smuggling is not new in 
Britain we have often experienced problems with 
smuggling when our tax levels have been out of line with 
those of our continental neighbours. Wise Chancellors 
realised that reducing the rate of duty could increase the 
revenue and deal with the crime. That is the surest way 
of dealing with all of these problems, including the 
health problem.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall give way to the hon. 
Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has made 
me forget my point by calling me a man.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall give way to my hon. 
Friend the Member for Cotswold while the hon. lady 
remembers her question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Perhaps the hon. Lady will have 
recovered from her amnesia by the end of my 
intervention.
<P>
Is not the objective to control consumption? If 
increasing customs duties merely encourages substitution 
with contraband cigarettes, thereby increasing 
consumption because such cigarettes are cheaper, the 
increase proposed by the Government is nugatory and 
without foundation.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes. I shall go on to point out 
that it is not succeeding in suppressing consumption. 
Indeed, there is evidence that more people are smoking. 
Worse still, they are buying cigarettes in uncontrolled 
outlets from organised gangs, so young people are finding 
it easy to take up smoking. In the past, at least they had 
to visit controlled outlets and persuade tobacconists that 
they were over 16 years old, whereas now they can buy 
cigarettes in youth clubs, pubs and car parks for organised 
criminal gangs. The point made by my hon. Friend the 
Member for Cotswold is therefore extremely valid.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman. I have 
fully recovered from being mistaken for a man and I shall 
get on with the business at hand.
<P>
Would not the right hon. Gentleman's argument require 
us to deal with nicotine addiction? Is not nicotine 
addiction the cause of this crime?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, that may well be the 
case. No doubt the Government have health policies that 
deal with the problem, but they also have a professed 
policy of increasing the price of tobacco to deter people 
from smoking. However, Opposition members of the 
Committee are demonstrating that that policy no longer 
works. It undermines the Revenue and encourages 
criminality. Nor is it working on health grounds, because 
more people are smoking. The problem is not simply the 
smuggling and resale of cigarettes from the continent; 
there are also crimes connected with warehouse cigarettes, 
which are supposedly exported free of duty and diverted 
back to the home market. That process makes huge profits 
for those involved.



<P>
For the value of any substance to be represented by 90 
per cent. tax is a distortion and an invitation to criminality, 
not only by individuals bringing a few extra cartons of 
cigarettes into the country, but by highly organised 
criminal gangs who steal and divert cigarettes back to the 
home market. Moreover, legitimate outlets such as the 
corner shop are being undermined by criminality. As a 
result, illegal tobacco is now sold to young people in 
many outlets. That is a contributory factor in the 
undoubted rise in cigarette smoking.
<P>
Peter Wilson, the chairman and chief executive of 
Gallaher, said that, because of cheap imports, the number 
of smokers in the United Kingdom has risen by half a 
million, but the legitimate market has fallen by 8 per cent. 
Will the Paymaster General confirm those figures?
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): The right hon. 
Gentleman seems a little confused. He says that more 
people are smoking, but studies show that, in terms of 
numbers sold, the consumption of cigarettes has declined 
because younger people tend to smoke far fewer 
cigarettes. That explains in part the alterations in revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, I am sure that the 
number of legally sold cigarettes has decreased indeed, 
I said that the legitimate market has declined by 8 per 
cent. However, the number of illegally sold cigarettes has 
increased: the Chancellor said as much in his Budget 
speech. The figures that I have quoted derive from 
Government sources.
<P>
It is better to tackle the cause of the problem. There is 
no point in pretending that it will be solved by continental 
countries increasing the price of tobacco. The idea that 
harmonisation will come to the rescue is ludicrous. 
Continental countries have no intention of increasing 
tobacco duties, because they have to deal with their own 
problem of cigarettes smuggled from eastern Europe and 
the countries of the southern Mediterranean. They are not 
about to ride to the rescue of the British Treasury. Indeed, 
there is no European Union harmonisation policy.
<P>
Mario Monti, the EU Commissioner responsible for 
taxation, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Member states with high tax rates would have to recognise that 
tackling the smuggling problem fully may require them to reduce 
national rates."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would be the last person to advocate administrative 
harmonisation of taxes, which in practice always means 
raising taxes in the low-tax jurisdictions, much to the 
detriment of the United Kingdom.
<P>
We are faced with the problem that we are the high-tax 
country, and there is no prospect of the other EU countries 
raising their rates to the same level as ours. The solution 
is, therefore, to act responsibly by freezing and if possible 
reducing over time at least in real terms our very high 
excise duties to prevent smuggling and cross-border 
shopping.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> Is it not the case that the hon. Gentleman 
does not like tax harmonisation when it involves raising 
taxes, but if it were a question of lowering them, he might 
be in favour? He seems to suggest that we should reduce 
duty for the purpose of stopping smuggling.



<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am not in favour of 
harmonisation by administrative fiat. The market is 
sending the Government a message by penalising the 
high-tax country. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, it is 
bizarre that the Government should be in favour of tax 
harmonisation throughout the European Union. The 
Paymaster General chairs a committee of the EU that is 
charged with eliminating unfair tax competition. The 
Government are in favour of harmonisation, yet where 
they have unquestioned discretion over indirect taxes, 
they are dis-harmonising. They are taking a large gap and 
making it larger; they are making all the problems that I 
have described more serious.
<P>
Our amendment would freeze tobacco duty and, in the 
particularly serious case of hand-rolling tobacco, would 
reduce the duty to the level pertaining when the 
Government took office. Our amendment respects the 
importance of the health argument. Duty would remain 
high, even if our amendment were accepted. Tobacco 
would still be expensive in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give 
way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will 
forgive me, I wish to draw to a conclusion, because other 
hon. Members may wish to participate in the debate.
<P>
Our amendment still respects the deterrent effect of 
high prices. We should still have a comparatively high 
rate of duty. The Government must understand that the 
health argument that tobacco needs to be expensive 
does not mean large and indefinite annual increases in 
the price of tobacco. We accept that tax rates should be 
comparatively high. We do not accept that that means 
relentless annual increases, especially beyond the point 
when those undesirable side effects become apparent.
<P>
Our group of amendment should protect the revenue 
that is presently being undermined. It would also help to 
tackle smuggling by reducing its cause, and it would 
reinforce the efforts to reduce smoking by ensuring that 
tobacco was sold in proper outlets, rather than by 
criminal gangs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> I am slightly incredulous at the hon. 
Gentleman's speech. I have not felt as though I was sitting 
in cloud cuckoo land so much since the earlier Committee 
stage of the Bill on the Floor of the House last week.
<P>
Today, we have seen Conservative Members lurching 
to extremes of right-wing experimentation. We have 
listened to their arguments that we must reduce duty in 
order to increase revenues, yet they have also stated that 
their amendments respect the deterrent effect of price. 
Their proposals to reduce the duty on hand-rolling 
tobacco and freeze other levels of duty represent a 
volte-face in relation to the policies of the previous 
Conservative Government. Those policies seem quite sane 
compared with some of the statements that we have 
heard today.



<P>
The 1997 Conservative general election campaign 
guide restated the policy of having an escalator for 
tobacco duty. That is an example of how it is possible to 
break promises while in opposition. Red Book figures 
show that over the three-year period, the effect of freezing 
the duty on tobacco would be a loss of revenue of 
£1.13 billion. I believe that that is a correct assessment 
of the market for tobacco. That significant amount of 
revenue would not be available to be spent on important 
health and education services, nor to be used to deter 
smoking.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</b> The Chancellor told us during the Budget speech that the loss of revenue would be 
£1.5 billion. Can the hon. Gentleman explain why the 
haemorrhage of Customs and Excise duty on tobacco was 
£790 million in 1996 and £1 billion in 1998, is estimated 
to be £1.5 billion for 1999 and predicted to increase 
considerably in 2000? What does he intend to do about 
that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> One of the effects of the amendments 
would be to freeze the levels of duty. They would not 
alter cigarette consumption. The hon. Gentleman's point, 
however is based on how cigarette consumption has 
changed. Tobacco consumption is decreasing. The 
number of people who smoke may have increased, but 
they are young people who, incidentally, were brought 
up under a Conservative Administration who offered no 
deterrent to smoking. Although they are smoking, they are 
smoking fewer cigarettes then previous generations. That 
explains to a significant extent the trend in tobacco duty 
revenue.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Has my hon. Friend noticed that the 
Opposition delight in using figures based on research 
carried out by Gallaher, rather than official figures? Does 
he know why they prefer those statistics?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> There may be several reasons. The history 
of the Conservative party and its relationship with the 
industry may be relevant. I am interested in the statistic 
given by the scientific committee on tobacco and health, 
which said in its report to the Department of Health that 
for every 1 per cent. increase in the rate of tobacco duty, 
there was a 0.3 per cent. to 0.6 per cent. decrease in 
consumption. Let us consider the proposed duty increase 
of 6.3 per cent. We can assume on a conservative estimate 
that there would be a 2.5 per cent. decrease in 
consumption. Action on Smoking and Health told me 
today that about 1.89 billion fewer cigarettes would be 
smoked each year, which would mean about 1,800 fewer 
premature deaths from smoking each year.
<P>
We are not talking about frivolities. We must focus on 
the primary purpose of the policy and its impact on health. 
Opposing the duty changes poses a significant risk 
to health and well-being. I am saddened that the 
Conservative party has taken the line that it has. The 
smuggling argument holds no water. Spain has one of the 
lowest duty rates, but one of the highest smuggling rates, 
in Europe. Existence in other countries shows us that duty 
is not the overriding factor. The Conservatives need to 
consider whether they are taking the right line, especially 
as there is a former Secretary of State for Health on the 
Committee. Death and disease from smoking is a problem 
in this country and the duty increases are important in 
discouraging and decreasing smoking, so I hope that the 
amendments are rejected.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> If the right hon. Member for 
Wells has a cigarette only on national no-smoking day, I 
dread to think what he does during national smile week.
<P>
Both sides of the Committee recognise that there is a 
huge problem. Smuggling has increased significantly, and 
that there has an impact on Exchequer revenue and, more 
importantly, on people's health, particularly that of young 
people. We have seen a rise in organised crime, 
particularly in Kent where Mafia-type organisations are 
taking smuggling into new spheres, which is worrying. As 
the hon. Member for Cotswold said, smuggling seems to 
have a degree of acceptability among the wider 
population, but it flouts the law and denies the Exchequer 
revenue that might be used in schools and hospitals. The 
problem is huge, and it is right for us to debate it.
<P>
Until now our debate has been on the Punch and Judy 
scale how much smuggling is rising, what the 
Opposition did, what the Government are doing, and so 
on. We must stand back and examine the cause of the 
increase. Tax differentials play a part and criminals react 
to price differentials in the same way as ordinary 
consumers, but other factors, too, have arisen in recent 
years, not least the abolition of border controls with the 
single market. I presume that both sides of the Committee 
support the single market and understand its benefits. I do 
not know whether the Euro-sceptics in the Conservative 
party have changed their position on that policy, but I 
assume that they have not. I hope that Conservative Front 
Bench spokesmen will admit that the abolition of border 
controls has significantly influenced the increase in 
smuggling. We should be aware of that in our discussions.
<P>
Other factors may be more marginal than the tax 
differentials and the abolition of border controls, but they 
have an effect. For example, the channel tunnel has made 
it easier for people to travel between the continent and the 
United Kingdom and has reduced the cost. Prices on the 
ferries have fallen significantly, and with them what it 
costs for petty criminals to take their lorries over the 
channel and indulge in criminal activities.
<P>
We should not be too simplistic in our approach, 
because the solutions may to have be more complex and 
subtle than has hitherto been suggested. Perhaps hon. 
Members will reflect on the fact that tobacco smuggling 
occurs in many other countries. In Sunday Business on 
29 November, a customs officer, who was not named, 
was reported to have said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If this gets a grip, we are potentially looking at levels of cigarette 
smuggling similar to those in Italy and Spain, where two-thirds of 
all cigarettes consumed have been smuggled."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No one condones smuggling, but the problem is EU-wide. 
One reason why cigarettes are smuggled into Spain and 
Italy may be the price differential between Spain and 
north Africa, and between eastern Europe and Italy. The 
right hon. Member for Wells admitted that other EU 
countries have a problem with smuggling from eastern 
Europe, but I hope that he is not suggesting that we should 
look round the world to find out where the price of 
cigarettes is the lowest and reduce our duty to that level, 
because that would be a preposterous policy. I say to 
Conservative Members, as well as to other hon. Members 
who may be driven by more populist tendencies to slash 
tobacco duties, that we need to be more subtle in our 
approach to finding a solution.



<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I believe that my right hon. Friend the 
Member for Wells clearly said that the amendment related 
to our stance on not slashing tobacco duties. The hon. 
Member for Kingston and Surbiton spoke about subtle or 
different solutions to the problem. So before he concludes 
his remarks, will he be kind enough to tell the Committee 
what his party's solution to the problem would be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I certainly shall, because I am speaking on 
behalf of my party. Some of the right hon. Gentleman's 
colleagues have talked, both in this Committee and in 
other debates, about slashing duties. Perhaps the right hon. 
Member for Wells has been slightly more careful with his 
words, but there are more courageous ways to approach 
the issue of cutting duty on cigarettes.
<P>
A change in tax might need to be considered, but my 
party does not propose that. We should approach such a 
policy with huge caution, not least because of the impact 
on health to which the hon. member for Shipley 
(Mr. Leslie) referred. Furthermore, the evidence that has 
been supplied to date that if tax rates were reduced 
revenue would miraculously increase and smuggling 
would decrease is hardly convincing.
<P>
There are other causes of smuggling, as I have 
mentioned, and the references that have been made to the 
Laffer curve warrant analysis. We should remember that 
in 1981, President Reagan based most of his policies on 
the drawing of the Laffer curve done on a serviette for 
him by Professor Laffer. President Reagan used that as 
the basis for his policy of slashing taxes, and the United 
States Treasury went into huge deficit. As a result, deficit 
politics drove the American economy for many years, 
causing huge problems throughout the world. The 
evidence to support the Laffer curve is weak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> What is the solution?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Member for Cotswold is trying 
to steer me off course by asking about the solutions. I am 
coming to those. However, first I want to analyse the 
weaknesses of his arguments and those of his hon. 
Friends. The Conservative argument that one can cut tax 
with no revenue effect is based on thin analysis, and 
would not stand up to proper scrutiny. I caution hon. 
Members against taking that course because it would not 
be fiscally responsible. Conservative Members seem to 
have retreated, in their confusion and defeat, into adopting 
populist policies on a whim if its suits their purpose at 
any time. That is not a responsible approach for a party 
that wants to portray itself as an effective Opposition.
<P>
There are many alternatives [Hon. Members: "Aha."	] 
I do not know whether hon. Members have bothered to 
read the report on the alcohol and tobacco fraud review. 
It has been in the public domain for some time and 
the Government are consulting on some of the 
recommendations that have been implemented. I suggest 
that hon. Members should do a little more preparatory 
work before coming to Committee, so that they are aware 
of the issues. This is an important point, and the measures 
concerned hold out some hope. For example, if it would 
help hon. Members if I could read the list of 
recommendations that the Government have implemented, 
which the Paymaster General included in an answer dated 
10 February.



<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Opposition Members have called for many of those 
measures, including, for example, providing increased 
resources to Customs and Excise at ports, which would 
help to catch criminals in this country, and to the Customs 
and Excise legal office, which would help it to pursue 
cases more effectively. That is not to say that I am happy 
with the Government's policies [Hon. Members: "Oh."	] 
Nor does it not mean that their policies are not going 
in the right direction [Hon. Members: "Ah."	] The hon. 
Member for Cotswold pointed out that £35 million may 
be insufficient for Customs and Excise, and suggested that 
it should receive more resources. The Treasury might get 
a positive return if it provided additional resources. I
am keen to pursue that policy, and I hope that the 
Government will go further along that track.
<P>
Other steps could be taken to assist Customs and 
Excise. We could examine the possibility of identifying 
which tobacco products have had duty paid on them and 
which have not. Technological solutions are available. I 
am told by people more expert than I that bar coding 
could be used, and markings placed on individual tobacco 
products. How are consultations with the industry going? 
Which recommendations of the alcohol and tobacco fraud 
review have not yet been implemented? When will the 
Government issue a report? Has the possibility of 
identification been tested?
<P>
Steps could be taken to improve the co-ordination of 
agencies within the UK and integrate the UK authorities 
with our European partners. That might cause problems 
for the official Opposition, who do not appear to want 
to work with our European partners. Liberal Democrat 
Members want to do so, because integration with our 
European partners is in this country's interests.
<P>
Other steps, including changing sentencing policy, 
could be taken. We could consider revoking the licences 
of retailers who sell goods that have not had duty paid on 
them. We could also amend the beer orders, and Customs 
and Excise could notify brewers of potential purchasers 
who have contravened the law.
<P>
Many solutions are available. When I read the report 
of the alcohol and tobacco fraud review, I was 
impressed by the number of solutions that are available, 
although many of the recommendations have not been 
implemented. I hope that the Government will say 
which recommendations they are minded to implement, 
and explain to the official Opposition that slashing the 
duty on tobacco is not the right approach.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): I shall refute 
two arguments proposed by Opposition Members. The 
hon. Member for Cotswold argued that it was valid to use 
taxes to reduce tobacco consumption, and the right hon. 
Member for Wells discussed the cumulative impact of 
year-on-year tax increases.



<P>
On the first point, the big argument a few years ago 
was about the relationship between tobacco consumption 
and advertising. Every time the Labour party suggested 
reducing tobacco consumption by cutting advertising, the 
Conservative party, which was then in government, 
consistently stonewalled on our proposal. We have taken 
action on advertising, and the argument has moved on. 
The current argument is about whether tax has the effect 
on tobacco consumption that we would expect. Several 
hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Kingston 
and Surbiton, have said that there is no clear information 
on that. However, a press release published on 6 October 
1994, entitled,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Virginia Bottomley says tobacco taxation crucial in reducing 
deaths caused by smoking"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Tobacco taxation is one of the most effective ways of reducing 
levels of smoking These are the main conclusions of a report, `The 
Importance of Price in Reducing Tobacco Consumption', published 
today by the Department of Health."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The previous Conservative Government produced 
evidence, which was greeted positively by their Ministers, 
that the very strategy that the present Government are 
adopting plays an important role in reducing tobacco 
consumption.
<P>
The cumulative effect of year-on-year increases in 
taxation has been described as "over the top"	. However, 
I draw the Committee's attention to a press release 
published on 26 November 1996, entitled,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Stephen Dorrell welcomes rise in excise duty on tobacco"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have always admired the stance of the former Secretary 
of State for Health, the right hon. Member for Charnwood 
(Mr. Dorrell), on tobacco consumption.

<P>

<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): I should bring the 
hon. Lady up to date. In December 1998, her own 
Government published a White Paper on smoking, 
which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the effectiveness of continued tax increases is being undermined by 
tobacco smuggling ... The availability of cheaper tobacco, whether 
legitimately purchased abroad or smuggled, is undermining to a 
degree the health goal of our tobacco taxation strategy."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> The White Paper says that the impact of 
price increases is undermined by smuggling, which is why 
the Government have introduced measures to combat 
smuggling. It is a question not simply of revenue but of 
the impact on health.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The provision is not working.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I would ask the hon. Gentleman to read 
the relevant passage of the White Paper again, but that 
would take too much time. The handing out of free 
cigarettes at night clubs and youth clubs, to which the 
right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) 
referred, is one of several ways in which young people 
have been encouraged to take up smoking.
<P>
The 1996 press release to which I referred states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In the 1993 Budget, the Government made a commitment to 
raise the duties on cigarettes by on average at least 3 per cent. above 
the rate of inflation every year. Once again this year, we are not just 
meeting that commitment we are exceeding it with a 5 per cent. 
real terms increase on cigarettes."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That not only refers to the applying of a standard escalator 
year on year, but boasts about a real terms increase. 
I agree completely with that sentiment, and applaud the 
right hon. Member for Charnwood for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I will give way shortly, but I want to 
discuss another press release first.
<P>
I remind the Committee that the press release from 
which I have just quoted was entitled,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Stephen Dorrell welcomes rise in excise duty on tobacco."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It should be compared with a press release published in 
March 1999, entitled,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Frank Dobson welcomes tobacco tax rises."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would not normally accuse my right hon. Friend the 
Secretary of State for Health of agreeing with the 
Opposition, but the similarity of the titles is striking. He 
is described as welcoming a 5 per cent. rise in tobacco 
tax because of the impact that it will have on 
consumption and quite right too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The problem with that strategy is 
that, on the evidence of the figures, it is not working. The 
White Paper, published at the end of lase year, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The long downward trend in smoking may be levelling out. 
Adult smoking rose in 1996...We may be seeing the beginning of a 
new upward trend in smoking. Among people aged 16 and over"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this may interest the hon. Member for Shipley 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the smoking rate of 28 per cent. in England was the same as in 
1992 and was up on the 1994 rate of 26 per cent."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that an 
increase in tobacco consumption among young people, 
and among women, especially poorer women even 
among pregnant women, which is a real problem is 
worrying. That is why the Government, in complete 
contrast to the previous Government, have proposed a 
wide range of measures to deal with tobacco consumption. 
Most of those are not included in the Bill, so I will not 
go into detail on all of them. They are extremely well 
known, however, and the arguments for them have been 
well rehearsed on the Floor of the House.
<P>
Reducing smoking was among the previous 
Government's "The Health of the Nation targets. Their 
strategy did not work well, partly because they were 
hobbled by their links with the tobacco lobby. The 
Government are introducing the full range of measures 
needed, and I am sure they will achieve a reduction in 
tobacco consumption, which all Labour Members want. 
Conservative Members' arguments show that they have 
not yet resolved whether they are caring sharing Tories 
who want to see a cut in tobacco consumption, or whether 
they are keeping the Thatcherite flame alive and want to 
see a rolling back of the state and a reduction in taxes.
<P>
I hope that the Government will continue their excellent 
measures, the prime goal of which is the protection of 
people's health.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I support the 
amendments tabled by my right hon. and hon. Friends on 
the Front Bench. As the hon. Member for Northampton, 
North (Ms Keeble) was kind enough to draw the 
Committee's attention to the fact that I have form on this 
subject, I should state my view clearly. I favour 
high-priced tobacco products because I am in favour of 
using the price system as a disincentive to tobacco 
consumption. I do not resile from the words that I, as 
Secretary of State, used in the press release that the hon. 
Lady quoted.
<P>
However, I have a problem with the present tax 
increases because the year-on-year rises in the price of 
tobacco products are no longer serving the policy 
objectives for which they were endorsed and embraced by 
the previous Government; indeed, they may be 
approaching the point at which those objectives are being 
undermined. Furthermore, other undesirable side 
effects the promotion of smuggling and the facilitation 
of organised crime are occurring as a result of the 
Government's policy, and those must be addressed.



<P>
I start from a simple proposition: the Opposition are 
not here to argue for lower taxes, but the Government are 
here to justify higher taxes. That is basic in the 
parliamentary system. The Government must come to 
Parliament to seek tax revenues. In this case, the 
Government are seeking to justify higher rates of tax 
because they believe that further increases in the price
of tobacco products will deliver a further reduction in 
tobacco consumption. The Committee must examine that 
proposition. It is a proposition that must be examined year 
by year on its merits. It worked in this country through 
the 1980s, and in particular in the early 1990s. We raised 
the price of tobacco products and there was a substantial 
reduction in tobacco consumption. One or two other 
European countries had the same experience. In the 
Netherlands, price increases were agreed to and there was 
a sharp reduction in tobacco consumption.
<P>
<H5>7 pm </H5>
</P>

<P>
However, in every price-fixing process, there is a break 
line in the graph. I believe that we have reached that point. 
Additional tax increases on tobacco products will not 
deliver the policy objective that we embrace. Instead, by 
widening the gap between the price of legitimate and 
illegitimate tobacco products in Britain, they will 
introduce an extra incentive for smuggling.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbition was good 
enough, in his circumlocutory speech, to say that we were 
discussing a serious issue. There is a sharp increase in 
smuggling. Evidence clearly shows that that activity is 
attracting the attention of organised crime. We should take 
the problem seriously. Until the Government can satisfy 
the Committee that they can address those concerns, it 
would not be justified or responsible to vote for further 
tax increases.
<P>
Serious risks are associated with the present policy, 
including those of increased smuggling, lawlessness, 
activity by organised crime and the exposure of young 
people to unlawful distribution channels which may also 
distribute other unlawful products, such as drugs. 
Committee members should stop and consider that link 
before continuing the policy simply because it has been 
pursued successfully over the past decade. The fact that it 
was successful then does not mean that it will be 
successful over the next decade. Circumstances have 
changed because of recent tax increases, for which the 
previous Government are responsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> I cannot resist the temptation of asking the 
right hon. Gentleman whether he thinks that there may be 
a role for tax harmonisation in easing the problems that 
the mentions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman 
asked that question, because I was about to talk about 
European policy. I have no embarrassment in saying 
indeed, I am delighted to be able to say it that my right 
hon. Friend the shadow Chief Secretary and I see eye to 
eye. It is no great secret that we do not always see eye to 
eye on European matters, but on this issue we do. We are 
both in favour of an open marketplace between this 
country and continental Europe and of tax competition 
between sovereign taxing powers throughout Europe. We 
both recognise that the open marketplace increases the 
facility with which goods can be moved around and that, 
in that open marketplace, what is important is not tax 
harmonisation but tax competition a phrase that I have 
not heard used this evening.



<P>
Tax competition will apply increasing pressure to 
European Governments, who will find that they cannot 
maintain widely diverse tax rates. That will happen 
independently of decisions taken on the European single 
currency. The pressure that tax competition will place on 
the alignment of European tax rates arises for the best of 
all possible reasons: for the first time, Governments are 
subject to intense price pressure. My right hon. Friend the 
Member for Wells and I have no difficulty in embracing 
that kind of benign pressure.
<P>
My final point is to tell Ministers that they must not 
only justify to the Committee their proposal for increased 
tax, and answer the concerns about increased smuggling 
and lawlessness, but be clear as to their objective for the 
policy. If that objective is the maximisation of revenue, 
they may have the right policy, but they are using 
dishonest rhetoric to support their argument. They have 
advanced the case not as a revenue-maximising 
proposition, but as a public health measure. If the 
Government seek to achieve a tax increase through 
maximising the revenue on tobacco products, I do not 
support them.
<P>
Alternatively, do the Government share the two 
objectives of the previous Government on the matter? The 
Government's first objective should be to maximise the 
price disincentive to tobacco consumption, which is a 
different objective from maximising revenue, because that 
is undermined where there is substantial access to 
illegitimate tobacco products. Their second objective 
should be to minimise the opportunities for organised 
crime. I hope that Ministers will embrace those two 
objectives. If those already are their objectives, I do not 
believe that they have yet made a case for the policy in 
the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The right hon. Gentleman asked 
why we propose the measures. The simple fact is that 
overall tobacco consumption has gone down in the United 
Kingdom market, but the number of smokers has gone up.
<P>
More young people, especially women, are taking up 
smoking; they are light smokers. At the other end of the 
market, the heavy smokers are dying; they are coughing 
themselves to death. The marketeers who sell the products 
have to recruit many more young people to make up for 
the people whom they are killing.
<P>
About 80 billion cigarettes are consumed each year in 
Britain. According to the estimates of the elasticities of 
demand that I have seen, the measure will reduce that 
consumption by about two billion cigarettes, which could 
translate into about 1,800 lives saved. That is what the 
Budget measures are about. Obviously, we are also here 
to consider revenues, but our main concerns are about 
living and dying and doing the right thing.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Cotswold said, the problem of 
smuggling is serious. He said that it involved a huge tide 
of haemorrhaging smuggling whatever that meant. It is 
important to have co-ordination and harmonisation of 
activity in Europe, in terms both of the way in which we 
think about rates and of concerted action. It is no use 
saying that we cannot do that because we must always be 
competitive and never collaborative. We will face larger 
problems on the world market for instance, on internet 
sales and VAT and we must consider how best we can 
work together for everyone's good.
<P>
I am not sure how the Conservatives' new-found "get 
off the escalator"	 ideology in relation to fuel and tobacco 
will fit in with their other new idea that they would spend 
£40 billion on health and education. It remains to be seen 
whether a coherent and consistent Conservative approach 
will emerge. It has certainly not happened yet.
<P>
It is interesting that Conservative Members use 
Gallaher as a source of information. The tobacco 
industry has a history of misleading the public in terms 
of scientific research. I should like to know how 
many tobacco companies have a connection with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is giving Conservative 
members of the Committee all its good advice. That 
could create a conflict of interest, about which the 
Committee should be informed. That is a serious point. 
How many such clients does PricewaterhouseCoopers 
have?



<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I have no idea. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers has not advised us on the 
arguments surrounding the issue, which are straightforward 
and do not require expert advice. PricewaterhouseCoopers 
is assisting us with the more complex tax matters with 
which we shall be dealing in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I said earlier that the firm had preferential 
access to the official Opposition. If it has an interest in 
cigarettes or anything else that is a cause for concern. 
That is why I raised the point, which provoked derision 
from some Opposition members of the Committee.
<P>
According to the Red Book, the amendment would cost 
approximately £370 million a year. However, I am more 
concerned about the issues of health, of co-ordinating an 
action plan against smuggling, and of sending the right 
signals to people. Unlike the hon. Member for 
Cotswold and the right hon. Member for Wells, who 
smokes only on national non-smoking day we do not 
think smoking a good thing. We should try to contain the 
health problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> At no point in my speech did I 
try to promote smoking. I hope that the hon. Gentleman 
will not misrepresent me in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The slasher from the Cotswolds actually 
said that people should be free to smoke. Presumably, 
reducing duty would increase consumption, which would 
kill people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The Government are promoting a 
policy that tries to serve two masters, but which satisfies 
neither. It is a matter of intentions and consequences. The 
Government want to cut smoking, but the number of 
smokers, particularly among young girls, is increasing. At 
the same time, the Government desperately want the 
revenue from tobacco, but their policy is dramatically 
increasing smuggling. Smuggling is costing the 
Government approximately £1.5 billion a year, but their 
response is to allocate a paltry £35 million and 100 extra 
offices. If they were committed to clamping down on such 
fraud, they would do a great deal more.
<P>
If the Government's goal is truly to cut smoking, they 
would do well to re-read their White Paper on smoking, 
which was published at the end of last year. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the effectiveness of continued tax increases is being undermined 
by tobacco smuggling"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Budget contains not a single decent measure to tackle 
the problem. The White paper continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As we have continued to raise tobacco tax in the UK, the 
potential profit that smugglers can make from the differential 
between our tobacco prices and those elsewhere in the EU has 
grown."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the conclusions not of the Opposition but of the 
Government and the Department of Health.
<P>
The White Paper also says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The availability of cheaper tobacco, whether legitimately 
purchased abroad or smuggled, is undermining to a degree the health 
goal of our tobacco taxation strategy."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the Budget makes no attempt to address those 
comments. The White Paper is an extremely good read, 
and I commend it to the hon. Member for Shipley, who 
clearly has not read it.
<P>
If the Government's objective is to cut smoking, they 
should recognise that their policy is not working. As the 
White Paper clearly demonstrates, the number of people 
who smoke is increasing. Worse than that, the provision is 
regressive, not least because it will hit some of the poorest 
people in the country and may affect their health 
particularly badly.
<P>
Any Labour Member who read the White Paper would 
appreciate my argument. However, to judge by their 
comments and interventions this afternoon, no Labour 
Member has read a single word of it. It states:



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is estimated that, in 1996, there were approximately one 
million lone parents on Income Support, of whom 55 per cent. 
smoked an average of five packs of cigarettes a week at a cost of 
£2.20 per pack. That means lone parent families spent a staggering 
£357 million on cigarettes during that year."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the price of tobacco is raised, the consequences for 
those people are serious, because the price increase does 
not result in many of them giving up smoking. The White 
Paper also refers to ad valorem duty and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Increases in ad valorem duty are less effective because they 
widen the price range of cigarettes on the market, encouraging 
smokers to switch to cheaper but equally unhealthy brands rather 
than to cut down or, preferably quit altogether."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</b> I understand about smuggling and switching to cheaper brands, but if the hon. Gentleman is 
saying that increasing the price of cigarettes has no impact 
on consumption, is that another example of the 
Conservative party abandoning market economics?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I shall respond to the hon. 
Gentleman's intervention in a moment by referring to the 
effective of smuggling on children, about which I know a 
lot from my work with Childline. I shall respond not to 
the trivial elements of his comment, but to the 
substantive point.
<P>
Labour Members have spent a lot of time mocking the 
material from Gallaher, because it is an easy target for a 
Government who are committed to undermining big 
business in this country and I am not surprised that they 
revealed that in cheap jibes. I am interested in Gallaher's 
figures but not their quotes because they support the 
information in the White Paper. Gallaher states that its 
sales fell last year from £4.42 billion to £4.26 billion and 
that that was exacerbated by increases in duty. There are 
plenty of tobacco manufacturers to mop up in such 
situations, but what matters is that consumers traded down 
to less safe brands of cigarettes.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making an 
important point, particularly about single parents. I have 
often seen women smoking and blowing smoke across 
their small babies just over the river here. They then 
complain about their health and that of their babies. Does 
the hon. Gentleman accept that another issue is young 
women whose smoking can be related to complex matters 
such as image, slimming, appearance and so on?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Lady makes a fair point and 
I was delighted to allow her to intervene as she so 
generously allowed me to intervene twice when she was 
speaking. I agree that image and so forth may be a reason 
for young people turning to smoking, but we are 
discussing whether the substantial increases in tobacco 
duty will have the effect that most of us want. I speak as 
a smoker who has children and who does not want them 
to smoke, because it is a bad habit about which I have 
no illusions. The fundamental thrust of the Government's 
strategy is not about a few extra Customs officers and 
another £35 million for Customs and Excise because that 
will not go far in reclaiming £1.5 billion, as has been 
shown. If the Government really wanted to chase the 
£1.5 billion, there is much that they could do. We did not 
learn much from the solutions suggested by the Liberal 
Democrats, but we can always live in hope. The strategy 
of increasing duty does not work. We tried it and, 
although it achieved some results, it will not produce the 
end that the hon. Lady wants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that paragraph B28 
on page 157 of the Red Book on tobacco duty contains 
no words about the health objective, only words about 
receipts? Is he also aware that the matter was discussed 
on page 110 of the Red Book? Again, a justification on 
health grounds was not used. The energy tax is justified 
on page 108 of the Red Book on environmental grounds.

<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> My right hon. Friend makes an 
important point. If the Government genuinely want to 
pursue the strategies that many Committee members 
legitimately believe should be enforced, the Department 
of Health should be brought into the Treasury, which 
should be encouraged to examine what can be done.
<P>
The Government's strategy is not working. If they 
continue to pursue their policy, smoking, organised crime 
and smuggling will increase, not decrease. Last year, 
smoking increased by a single percentage point to 
23.3 per cent., but professional smuggling doubled. 
Smuggling is a big but dangerous business, not least 
because it leads to uncontrolled sales to children in 
particular. If we are really going to confront the problems 
of smuggling, bootlegging and sales to children, we must 
ask ourselves, "What morals do the bootleggers have and 
will they restrict sales to children?"	 The hon. Member for 
Kingston and Surbiton discussed his party's idea that the 
sale of cigarettes to young people could be controlled at 
legitimate points of sale. However, many smuggled 
cigarettes, which find their way into the hands of children 
and young people, never go through those channels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman discussed 
bootleggers and he mentioned Gallaher. He may have read 
Gallaher's 1997 annual report, which states: "Gallaher 
believes the gains"	 to Gallaher 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in Andorra relate to increased bootlegging trade into the UK."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is he aware that some of the cigarette companies that he 
is not prepared to condemn make vast profits by selling 
to distributors who are outside this country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The clause does not involve the ethics 
of Gallaher's sales policies. If the hon. Gentleman wants 
to have an Adjournment debate on the matter, Madam 
Speaker might provide the time for him to do so. We cited 
Gallaher's crucial evidence that last year, when its sales 
were squeezed, it noticed that people traded down their 
cigarettes. I do not want to have the trivial discussion that 
the hon. Gentleman wants to initiate. It ill behoves the 
Liberal Democrats to try to distract us from discussing 
people's health, which Conservative and, I am sure, 
Labour Members regard as a serious matter. Raising duty 
levels may mean that some of the most vulnerable and the 
poorest people in our society do not give up smoking but 
trade down their cigarettes. The relevant evidence is 
contained in the Government's White Paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that the 
current level of duty was associated with a doubling in 
the black market trade in tobacco. If so, why have 
Conservative Members proposed amendments that would 
retain what will be last year's levels of duty? Those 
amendments would not increase the amount of revenue 
that the Government would spend on attacking smuggling. 
The hon. Gentleman amply illustrated the fact that the 
current level of duty caused a huge rise in smuggling, but 
Conservative Members want to maintain that level. Why?



<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks a perfectly 
reasonable question. The answer is that our proposal to 
hold the rates at their current level constitutes the 
beginning of a strategy. Clearly, the Government cannot 
ask the opposition to propose this country's policy on 
smuggling. The Government have got to tackle that
worsening problem, which cost an extra £750 million last 
year. It is unfortunate that the hon. Gentleman is in a party 
that says that it wants to promote people's health, but 
pursues a policy that does nothing about that. An increase 
in smuggling is affecting some of the youngest and most 
vulnerable people. He should be aware that 82 per cent. 
of adult smokers start smoking in their teens and that more 
than 30 per cent. of 15-year-old girls smoke.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way 
on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Calm down. I will give the hon. 
Gentleman a turn in a moment.
<P>
Nearly 15 per cent. of 11 to 15-year-old girls smoke. 
The Government risk seeing those figures increase. The 
initiative to co-operate with legitimate retailers to curb the 
sale of cigarettes to children is welcome. I recognise that 
the Government are working on that. This is not a time to 
be trivial; we must be serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> If the hon. Gentleman can be serious, 
I will give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman removing from the 
tobacco companies any blame for the 82 per cent. of 
young people who smoke? Does he condemn smuggling 
for its role in the problem of under-age smoking, but not 
condemn the advertising policies of tobacco companies or 
people in, for example, corner shops who sell cigarettes 
to children? Is he ignoring that part of the argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Of course tobacco advertising plays 
a role, but it ill behoves the hon. Gentleman to make those 
remarks. His party was happy to take £1 million at the 
general election and to give special favours that affected 
the restrictions on tobacco advertising. I will not take 
lectures from the hon. Gentleman on how to deal with 
tobacco advertising.
<P>
We also need to consider the financial implications for 
the legitimate retailer, in particular the small trader or 
corner shop owner. Some 81 per cent. of retailers are 
worried about tobacco smuggling because it is destroying 
their livelihoods. As a result of smuggling, 90 per cent. 
have reported a decrease in sales and 45 per cent. have 
reported a dramatic decrease in sales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I shall not give way to the hon. 
Gentleman again.
<P>
Some 61 per cent. believe that smuggling and 
cross-border shopping is the most important reason for the 
decline. About 70,000 independent retailers are at risk, 
and some of them are having to close their shops. Labour 
Members may not be troubled by that, but they should be 
if their principal and fundamental strategy is not achieving 
the health aim that they desire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am sorry, but time is very tight.
<P>
It is clear that the policy is not going to achieve the end 
that hon. Members want. It is damaging the industry and 
the retailer, encouraging smuggling and not producing the 
income that the Government want. Evidence shows that it 
is not dealing with the crucial problem of discouraging 
young people from smoking.
<P>
The Government are fond of reviews. The time has 
come for a proper review of excise duty on tobacco and 
other products. It is clear that it is necessary to review the 
policy if we are not to take huge risks, not only with the 
economy but with people's health.
