<P>
No. 138, in page 38, line 29, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) The competent authority approved for the purpose of this section (the ``non-listing competent authority'') may be different from the competent authority appointed for the purpose of section 69 and in any such case references in Part VI to the competent authority shall in the case of a non-listing prospectus be construed as references to the non-listing competent authority.'.<P>

<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. It is good to have you back in the Chair.
<P>
I was in full flow, before being cut off by Mr. O'Brien, on amendment No. 138. At that stage I endeavoured to tantalise Ministers with the prospect that the amendment was no longer necessary, having been tabled some months before the recent news about changing the competent authority to the Financial Services Authority.
<P>
However, having reflected on the comments of the Economic Secretary in response to some of my questions on clause 69 about the future of the alternative investment market, it occurred to me that they represented one example of the amendment's pertinence for the future. Let us assume that the operation of the AIM market is to remain with the London stock exchange. If companies outside London that required a listing, to trade in London, were asked for non-listing prospectuses, the FSA could, we believe, act as the alternative competent authority to the London stock exchange. So the need for non-listing AIM stocks in particular demonstrates the need for the amendment.
<P>
In the past few days, we have heard about some of the complications in the London listing markets which have driven two internet companies to seek listings on the Neue Markt and on EASDAQ in preference to London, or even to go for an AIM listing, because of what they claim are excessive costs, red tape and advisory fees. That is a cause of concern and, as the new markets become ever more competitive in their bid to build up business, concern will increase if we are unable to compete on a fair basis with other electronic markets around the world that are now taking over from the more traditional exchanges. So the amendment is still relevant and perhaps we were prescient in tabling it before the summer. I ask the Minister to take it on board.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I also welcome you back, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has made further interesting points. On his comments about competition from other exchanges in Europe, the Neue Markt in Germany and NASDAQ in the United States, the stock exchange is well aware of those growing competitive pressures. Not a few United Kingdom-originating companies of the type that he mentioned have chosen to list on NASDAQ. It is an increasingly competitive field, which is no doubt one factor behind the decision by the stock exchange to demutualise and to re-assess its status in order to face up to growing competitive pressures as effectively as possible. I shall return in a moment to the hon. Gentleman's points about AIM.
<P>
I hope to convince the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends that the amendment is both unnecessary and incompatible with EC law. The relevant legislation is the prospectus directive agreed in 1989, which sets out the requirement for a prospectus when a public offer of securities is first made and is not an exempt offer— for example, because it is offered to no more than 50 people.
<P>
Any prospectus that is not exempt must meet the directive's requirements, which are implemented in the United Kingdom by the Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995, familiarly known as POSREG. When an official listing is applied for as well as a public offer, the prospectus must be approved by the competent authority for listing. The requirements are the same as for listing particulars more generally.
<P>
When there is no application for listing, there is no requirement under European Community law or in the UK for the prospectus to be pre-vetted. Those issuing the securities remain responsible for meeting the requirements of POSREG. They include the directors of a company if it issues the securities. Failure to comply with the requirements is a criminal offence. When a prospectus contains false or misleading information that has led to loss, those responsible are liable to pay compensation. The matter is serious.
<P>
When issuers want to make a public offer in more than one EC country, they can voluntarily submit the prospectus to the competent authority for listing. Article 21(2) of the prospectus directive provides that when a prospectus has been approved by the competent authority for listing in one member state, it must be recognised as complying with the laws of' any other member state in which the public offer is made. That helpfully cuts down on unnecessary and expensive duplication.
<P>
The way in which the article is phrased means that the body that approves the prospectus must be the body appointed under the listing particulars directive, which is the competent authority for listing. It cannot be another body. The only circumstance in which another body could be appointed within the terms of the directive to carry out that function would require pre-vetting of all prospectuses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. The debate is becoming technical. Are AIM stocks—stocks that are not fully listed—included?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall refer in a moment to AIM stocks, which are a separate matter.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will accept that pre-vetting of all prospectuses would be an unwarranted and unwelcome increase in the burdens on business. It is clear from the wording of the amendment that that was not the intention. Issuers would not be required to submit prospectuses for pre-vetting under the amendment, so a different competent authority would contravene the directive. That is the central problem.
<P>
AIM has nothing to do with official listing. The costs of admission to AIM are a matter for the London stock exchange as an exchange, not for the Committee to debate on the subject of the competent authority.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that his proposal would be contrary to EC law, assuming that we do not want to introduce massive bureaucracy, and that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. Before I withdraw the amendment, will he explain part of this confusing issue? If a company wanted its shares to be traded on the London stock exchange's AIM exchange, wanted to solicit funds from UK-based investors, and did not want a full listing but had to produce a prospectus, who would have the authority to vet that prospectus? Are companies that want to raise funds in the UK to list on AIM required to produce a prospectus? If so, who will vet it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman's latter point is right. It is necessary to pre-vet a prospectus if the company involved intends to circulate it around Europe and raise funds in other countries in addition to the UK. The competent authority may therefore vet the prospectus if the company's aim is to solicit investment more widely and therefore requires mutual recognition. A prospectus must be produced whenever new securities are issued, but it does not have to be vetted unless the company aims to solicit funds more widely. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point and that I have explained the position correctly; I am confident that I have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I do not wish to press the point, but I remain confused. It sounds as though a company that wants to trade on AIM in this country, whether it is based in the UK or on the continent, may solicit funds from UK investors without being subject to any prospectus requirements, and that only companies that want a full listing in London will be subjected to the rigorous prospectus standards. That is my interpretation of what the Financial Secretary said. If it is correct, there is one heck of a difference between the requirements for an AIM company and those for a listed company. However, as I said earlier, the only difference between an AIM-traded company and a fully listed company is that one is a junior, higher risk version of the other. Why, therefore, should one be subject to closer scrutiny than the other, especially in relation to the terminology of any prospectus that it circulates in order to solicit funds from the AIM market? I remain unclear about the requirements for non-listing prospectuses for AIM stocks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall attempt to clarify matters further. The fact that prospectuses for new public offers that will not be fully listed do not have to be pre-„vetted does not mean that those responsible for producing them can do what they want. Prospectuses such as those to which the hon. Gentleman refers remain subject to POSREG—the Public Offers of Securities Regulations. Failure to comply with those regulations is a criminal offence. People cannot do whatever they like. The question is whether they require pre-vetting in order to circulate their prospectuses in other countries in addition to the UK. That is the distinction that must be made. If they do not, they can proceed, while remaining subject to the Public Offers of Securities Regulations. The exchange—in the example to which the hon. Gentleman refers, AIM—makes the rules for admission to trading. It is not a matter for the competent authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall not pursue the point, or we shall be completely swamped in a welter of acronyms. I shall defer to the omnipotence of POSREG, about which I am sure we shall all go home and read more. It is a reasonable anxiety, and if Labour Members remain confused, they will raise questions later. Perhaps the Financial Secretary might like to consider the matter in a little more detail, but we shall not press the amendment at this stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 367, in page 40, line 3, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the procedure on such an appeal'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 368, in page 40, line 7, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The provisions of sections 338(3) to 338(5) shall apply in relation to the warning notices as if the competent authority was the Authority.
<P>
(5) If, notwithstanding the representations made to the competent authority before the end of the period specified in the warning notice, the competent authority decides to impose a penalty on a person under section 84, the competent authority must give the person concerned written notice of the decision it takes and must inform him of the right of appeal available to him and the procedure on such an appeal.
<P>
(6) The provisions of sections 339(1)(c), 339(6) and 340 shall apply to any such notice under subsection (5) as if it were a decision notice and the competent authority was the Authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I hope that these amendments are more straightforward. They deal with warning notices and the FSA's ability to impose penalties for contravening the listing rules. Under clause 84, the competent authority for the purposes of the official listing of securities, now the FSA, can impose penalties on a person who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``has contravened any provisioning of the listing rules''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause provides that a warning notice be served on the person concerned; the notice must indicate the right of appeal available to that person. The amendment also requires the warning notice to indicate the procedure on such an appeal. Nothing in the Bill stipulates a formal appeal procedure to the FSA tribunal. The competent authority must make arrangements for appeals under clause 87. It is appropriate for the warning notice to stipulate the appeal procedure open to the person agreed.
<P>
Amendment No. 368 provides that the warning notice and decision notice procedure applies to the competent authority, as applies elsewhere to the FSA, when it invokes its disciplinary powers. The disciplining action will be taken by the competent authority responsible for official listings and the cross references to clauses 338 and 339 relating to warning and decision notices therefore need to cater for the fact that the competent authority, and not the FSA as such, will take the disciplinary action. In practice, the FSA is likely to be the competent authority but the amendments are still valid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes some important points and the thrust of his argument is correct, although the context of the phrase in amendment No. 368
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as if . . . the competent authority was the Authority''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is changed by the fact that we now know that the competent authority will indeed be the authority.
<P>
In our debate on clause 69, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said—following the decision that the FSA should take on the competent authority function—that we intend to bring the procedures by which the competent authority imposes financial penalties into line with those followed by the FSA in carrying out its regulatory function. It follows that before imposing a penalty, the competent authority will first have to give the person concerned a warning notice, then the period of an hour to make representations; if, after that period, it is still minded to impose the penalty, it must give notice of the right to refer the matter for review to the tribunal. That is a somewhat stronger procedure than that envisaged by the clause and by the amendments. We provide not for an appeal to the tribunal against the decision but, as elsewhere in the Bill, for the tribunal to review the facts and reach its own view.
<P>
We will in due course bring forward amendments that will achieve that aim. I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels that that meets the important point that he raised and that he will be willing to await the Government amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. Things have changed and if the Government take our amendment on board in reformulating some of the clauses, we are happy to withdraw it. Before doing so, I shall allow my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) to put in his threepennyworth.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Assuming that the Government amendments are accepted, will there be a two-stage process under the procedure, or will decisions by the competent authority be referred for ratification by the tribunal.
<P>
Will the Minister spell out in a few sentences how the system will work? Is an appeal built into it or is it more like a confirmatory review? I am afraid that I do not fully understand the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The procedure will be consistent with other procedures in the Bill. Therefore, an appeal will not be provided. However, there is provision for the tribunal to carry out a review and form its own view. That is consistent with other provisions in the Bill; indeed, we discussed such a process in relation to earlier clauses. There will be a review rather than an appeal.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am conscious of my ignorance. Had I more midnight oil to burn, I might have found the answer myself. However, I suspect that the Minister may be in a similar position. I trust that he is getting reinforcement, as I would welcome further information so that I may understand what is really happening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can say with greater confidence than before that there will be a review rather than an appeal. Nevertheless, we shall examine whether we need to make changes to the arrangement that applies elsewhere, given the rather different nature of the competent authority.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I shall keep my questions brief. Will the review provide someone who is likely to be penalised with the opportunity to make representations to the review tribunal, in light of the decision by the competent authority which is under review? Will such representations be written or oral?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Certainly, there is a facility to make representations, which will usually be written. Equally, however, they may be oral, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman anticipated. The procedure will be consistent with that in other parts of the Bill.
<P>
It is early days in which to reflect on such matters. Given the special characteristics of a competent authority, there may be certain requirements. I am glad to reassure the right hon. and learned Gentleman that we shall have a longer discussion about how the tribunal will work when we debate part VIII of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

Clause 85 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 86</center></H4>
<H4><center>Statement of policy</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Clause 86 deals with policy statement and publication, making special reference to the imposition and level of penalties.
<P>
Given all the changes that are taking the place, when will the policy be made available, especially that on penalties? Will such a policy tie in closely with a penalty policy in other parts of the Bill affecting the FSA's role as a regulator of regulated financial services firms? How will that penalty policy differ from the existing stock exchange penalty policy for not conforming to listing requirements? I asked this earlier, but it relates to this clause as well: how will a prospective rebate system work? Will the revenue raised from penalties be returned either to the FSA's regulation of firms against part of its overall running costs or to listed companies against part of their listing fees?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The FSA will consult on the exercise of its functions in due course. At present, the stock exchange cannot impose a penalty—an issue that it has raised. A good deal more thinking must be done on the matter—although I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to Government amendment No. 360 to clause 99, which touches on some of the issues. However, my principal response to him is that that will be one of the subjects on which the FSA will consult in due course.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 86 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 87</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appeals against penalties</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 369, in page 40, line 29, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) The competent authority may not give a notice for payment under section 88(1) while the decision to give that notice is open to review.
<P>
(3) ``Open to review'' bears the meaning set out in section 339(7) as if references to the Tribunal were to the person or body to which appeals may be made under the arrangements to be established under subsection (1).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with the subject of appeals against penalties. It is supplementary to the amendments to clause 85, which we have just discussed, and which the Financial Secretary said that there was a case for taking on board, given the proposed changes. The amendment provides that the competent authority may not give a notice for payment of a penalty while the decision to give that notice is open to review. The meaning of the words ``open to review'' is determined by reference to clause 339(7), with the result that—broadly—a decision is open to review during the period when an appeal has been made against a decision but the appeal has not been determined.
<P>
The amendment would build on the amendments to clause 85, which we have just discussed, dealing with the fairness of the review period. The Minister may want to deal with it in the same way as he dealt with those amendments, given the proposed rewriting of the clause—this morning, the Economic Secretary said that there would be substantial changes to clause 87.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for proposing the amendment. I accept that it would be unreasonable for the competent authority to seek payment of a financial penalty until the period during which the person concerned may seek a review of the decision has been exhausted. Of course, that is our intention in relation to all the penalty notice provisions in the Bill. I therefore propose to introduce amendments in due course that will have that effect. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing that matter to our attention, and I hope that he will be reassured by my comments, and will withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 87 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 88 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 89</center></H4>
<H4><center>Obligations of issuers of listed securities</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 370, in page 41, line 5, after `action', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`additional to that referred to in section 84.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Having gone for the hat trick, clause 89 deals with obligations of the issuers of listed securities. It states what listing rules may specify or make provision for. Making listing rules is a function of the competent authority. Clause 89(1)(b) allows listing rules to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make provision with respect to the action that may be taken by the competent authority in the event of non-compliance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would make it clear that any provisions made under clause 89(1)(b) would be additional to those in clause 84, which allow the competent authority to impose penalties for contravention of the listing rules.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful to hon. Members for proposing the amendment, which may have something further to add—in one sense, at least. Clause 89 allows the competent authority to make listing rules which specify requirements with which the issuers of listed securities must comply. It also allows them to make rules about the action that the competent authority can take if those listing rules are contravened. That carries forward provisions in section 153 of the Financial Services Act 1986.
<P>
Currently, the competent authority can issue a public or private censure of issuers for breach of the listing rules. Public censure is provided for in clause 89(2)(a). Those powers are being complemented by the new power in clause 84 to impose financial penalties. Together, these give the competent authority an effective armoury to deter and deal with breaches of the listing rules.
<P>
The amendment would make it clear that subsection (1)(a) allows the competent authority to take action for breach of the listing rules in addition to imposing penalties. As I explained earlier, we want the competent authority to be able to take action appropriate to the particular circumstance. Sometimes that will be private censure, sometimes public censure and sometimes a penalty. The competent authority is required, of course, under clause 86 to produce a policy statement with regard to its policy on the imposition of penalties, which will undoubtedly cover the circumstances in which it is appropriate to do so rather than take alternative action.
<P>
I am happy to consider further whether there is any need for the hon. Gentleman's amendment to make the position clear. My initial reaction is that it is unnecessary, given that clause 84 already says that the power to impose a penalty is in addition to taking any other steps that the competent authority has power to take under this part. But we will, as I said, consider it further.
<P>
I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. On the basis that she will reflect further, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 89 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 90</center></H4>
<H4><center>Advertisements etc in connection</center></H4>
with listing applications
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The clause deals with submissions from the newspaper industry. Subsection (4) provides that a person who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``issues an advertisement . . . shows that he believed on reasonable grounds that the advertisement or information had been approved, or its issue authorised, by the competent authority''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would not be guilty of an offence. Guidance about what constitutes ``reasonable grounds'' would be helpful.
<P>
It is unclear what sort of information may be published in relation to an application for listing. It appears to embrace all such information as investors and their professional advisers would reasonably require for the purpose of making an informed assessment of liabilities. That includes a broad range of information and it may not be immediately apparent to the publisher when that type of information is being submitted to the publication under the listing rules.
<P>
The whole process by which a publisher could be held to be in breach of the listing rules is not as open as it might be. I also wonder whether it impinges on the Human Rights Act 1998 because it is increasingly important that a person should be aware of the exact ambit of the criminal offence to avoid committing it. What would happen if a newspaper publisher committed such an offence unwittingly?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The purpose of this clause is two-fold. It protects potential purchasers of securities by providing reassurance that advertisements for listed securities are subject to the supervision of the authority. At the same time, it protects issuers by enabling them to be confident that, once they have clearance for an advertisement, they will not be subject to unjustified claims for damages in respect of its content.
<P>
The clause makes it clear that any advertisement issued in connection with an application for listing must either be cleared in advance with the competent authority, or have the approval of the authority to be issued without such clearance.
<P>
Failure to comply with this requirement is, in general, a criminal offence, except where the person issuing the advertisement had reasonable grounds to believe that he had the authority's permission for his actions. However, the clause goes on to provide that where a person authorised by the FSA to do financial services business issues an advertisement without authorisation, he is to be regarded as having breached FSA rules, and will be dealt with accordingly.
<P>
The difference between the treatment of authorised and unauthorised persons is because, in the case of the former, there are already perfectly adequate remedies at hand to deal with a failure to comply with the legislation. That the position taken by the existing legislation.
<P>
This is not a new provision and I am not aware of any uncertainty about it,

Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 371, in page 42, line 33, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) to the competent authority, if the act or omission is shown to have been unreasonable, reckless or negligent; or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have now reached a meatier part of the Bill and are revisiting our old friends unreasonableness, recklessness and negligence in the context of statutory immunity applied to the FSA. In the dim and distant past before the recess we had a lengthy discussion about whether the FSA, acting as the regulatory authority, should have statutory immunity. My right hon. and hon. Friends argued forcefully that it should not, but our view did not prevail.
<P>
Apparently the FSA, in its likely role as the competent authority for listing, will also have the full umbrella of immunity in dealing with its duties as the listing authority, just as other parts, divided by whatever Chinese walls we are promised in the FSA organisation, will act as the regulatory authority. We feel that that is highly unjustified, Obviously we thought that it was unjustified that it should have the degree of immunity in its regulatory activities. There is even less of a case to extend the immunity to its new found role as the competent authority for listing.
<P>
I do not know whether the stock exchange currently enjoys immunity from prosecution or compensation if it makes a muck of its job as the competent authority for listing. However, the stock exchange does not have that immunity, so it would be worrying if it were conferred on the FSA in its new role.
<P>
A company that seeks a listing and applies to the FSA as the competent authority for approval—it might not have to wait up to six months if it is lucky—takes part in a straightforward commercial activity. It pays a listing fee and agrees to abide by the rules of the listing requirements; in return, it is listed by the competent authority. As a quoted company, it is assisted in raising capital on the markets and by the respectability conferred on it.
<P>
However, let us imagine what might happen to a perfectly respectable blue chip company that applies to be listed by the competent authority, the FSA. The company might undergo all the necessary scrutiny, provide all the necessary paperwork and pay all the necessary fees up front. However, through no fault of its own—we covered this territory in part this morning—it might not be listed within six months because of negligence on the part of members of staff in the competent authority's listing department. That negligence would mean that the six-month period would be up and that the company's application was deemed to have failed, as we discussed on an earlier clause.
<P>
The Minister mentioned compensation and that it did not militate against the company reapplying for listing. However, there is the matter of timing, because the company might have lost an important window of opportunity. It will probably be coming to the market, as is often the case, because it wants to raise funds to take over another firm, launch an expansion exercise in another part of the world or introduce a new product in the market. If it does not receive access to listing within the time scale necessary to facilitate its fundraising exercise—that might be as much as six months—it stands to lose an awful lot of money. Under the Bill, however, that commercial company will have absolutely no comeback against the FSA, as the competent authority, as regards compensation for incompetence, negligence, recklessness or unreasonableness. That is more patently unfair than even the statutory immunity that has been extended to the FSA in the pursuit of its regulatory authority duties.
<P>
We are talking about an arrangement that is little different from a straightforward commercial transaction. If someone in the commercial world applied to become a member of a club or signed up to a group, and the relevant goods and services were not forthcoming, he would have recourse to the law to sue for compensation for the injury that he had been done. However, just because the listing authority happens to be under the umbrella of the FSA for the time being—it is unlikely that that will change in the foreseeable future, other than in extreme circumstances—it is tough luck on a company that legitimately applies for listing to the FSA, as the competent authority. That is entirely unfair.
<P>
We have, therefore, tabled the amendment, which would introduce specific exclusions from exemption for three straightforward misdemeanours on the part of the competent authority. I strongly urge the Committee to adopt it.

<P>

<B>Mr Nicholas Lyell:</B> I first wish to apologise to the Committee because I may not be able to stay here long enough to hear the response to the debate. I want to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) said clearly and cogently by asking the Government to reflect on the public policy reason why an authority should or should not have statutory immunity. I am on record as saying that, in general terms, there is a strong case for the FSA to have wide immunity, but that that matter must be looked at carefully. I have worries on that front when one comes to recklessness. Bad faith is already acknowledged as not being justified and recklessness is close to bad faith.
<P>
I want to highlight the public policy reason that entitles an authority to have statutory immunity? The answer is that, if it did not, the power and might of those that it regulates and their financial muscle might be such that they could give the authority the runaround by employing expensive lawyers and tying them up in litigation, so that the overall effectiveness of the authority might be seriously impaired.
<P>
I accepted that justification for immunity as far back as the Lloyd's Bill in 1981 and, despite all the debacle at Lloyd's that followed, I was probably right to do so. We are now considering a finite aspect of the FSA's functions where it is, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham rightly said, stepping into the shoes of the stock exchange which, as far as I know, did not have any statutory immunity in that area. If I am wrong about that, I should be grateful to be corrected by nods and winks.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): The right hon. and learned Gentleman should not have asked for nods and winks. I understand that the stock exchange had statutory immunity in respect of claims against members, thus the difference under the present proposal is that the authority would have statutory immunity against all comers.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> That may be something for the Government to reflect on; I have not had a chance to research the stock exchange's position on the matter, but there will obviously be an argument for the FSA as the competent authority to be put in the same position as the stock exchange that it follows. Our debate, however, gives us the opportunity to revisit that whole area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I have also asked about the exact status of the stock exchange, but it is, of course, changing. It was a mutual organisation and, after demutualisation, it is now becoming an ordinary commercial company. The FSA is a company limited by guarantee and has an entirely different structure from what went before when the stock exchange was originally made up of private members. Since 1986, it has been made up of corporate members.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The structure is flooding into my mind. If the authority is mutual and the members agree that, as a condition of membership, not to sue it for damages, that is fundamentally a contractual position, not a statutory position. We are considering statutory immunity and I seriously question whether statutory immunity is justified in such a focused aspect, even if it is justified more widely in general terms and is subject to a much better compensation arrangement.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham put a cogent case when he said that a substantial fee will be paid for listing. It is very much a commercial operation. The authority has, in that aspect, a source of revenue specific to the activity. We are looking for a reason for the authority to look over its shoulder, so that it will maintain the standards properly expected of it. As I have said in many debates and on many topics, a good principle is that, in the public interest, everyone should have to look over their shoulder. Judges must look over their shoulder in the sense that they might be criticised by the Court of Appeal, as the Court of Appeal might be by the House of Lords, and as the Members of the House of Lords—members of a debating chamber—might be criticised democratically, despite being senior figures. That might be done with great deference and courtesy, but they could be criticised.
<P>
It is right that the competent authority is getting an income. We must see that it employs enough people of the right calibre to perform the listing functions promptly and efficiently. If it seriously failed to do so, causing serious loss, a good discipline would be for it to have to pay damages. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has made a good case for opening up the matter. I wait to read the answer as soon as I have an opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I do not wish to detain the Committee for long, but I wish to add two points to those presented excellently by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire.
<P>
First, the Treasury has conceded that the role of the competent authority for listing is commercial, and that it is different from the regulatory role of the FSA, although the legislation was originally drafted with the intention that the stock exchange would be the competent authority in that respect.
<P>
The competent authority is not excluded from liability. Clause 93(2)(a) and (b) sets out the areas in which the authority will be liable—especially for acts of bad faith and, in certain cases, of omission. The debate concerns not the principle of the authority's being liable in certain situations—that point has already been granted. Rather, it concerns the question of whether the present requirement goes far enough. We do not think that it does—negligence, unreasonableness, recklessness and negligent acts of omission should be included. I would be interested to hear the Government's views on that matter—they might not like the inclusion of all those, but they might consider that one or two should be included.
<P>
Secondly, I would like to report that, since we debated amendment No. 367, we have consulted on that issue especially with our lawyers and with the Confederation of British Industry as a representative of typical, major listed companies. The CBI feels strongly that the amendment should be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I shall reinforce the points made by my right hon. and hon. Friends. The issue is whether the FSA should be liable in law if it makes a mess of its responsibility for maintaining the list. There must be a nominated authority under EC law; since the job must be done, it has been given to the FSA. As has been noted, there would seem to be a straightforward commercial, ring-fenced operation.
<P>
It is true that immunity was contained in a general form in the Financial Services Act 1986, as the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) made clear. However, even in its general sense, that immunity was contested by witnesses before the Burns Committee. I shall not rehearse the arguments concerning that issue, some of which were made when we discussed schedule 1. The general case made then against immunity applies all the more to this specific case because, as my hon. Friends and I have said, it can be conceived of as a reasonably straightforward and self-contained commercial transaction.
<P>
Other bodies seem to get by perfectly well without immunity, such as the Serious Fraud Office and the medical and legal professions. Why cannot this function get by without immunity? As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire said, almost everywhere else in life, there is someone looking over one's shoulder, a countervailing pressure or check, to ensure high-quality behaviour. There will be little pressure on the FSA. That argument is all the stronger in the light of the Government's rather limp-wristed response to the Burns' Committee recommendations on the complaints procedure.
<P>
There would be a case for letting the matter of immunity rest if there were a powerful complaints procedure because that would prevent an inadequate performance by the FSA, but the Government have not responded favourably to those recommendations. They have not accepted that an independent investigator should be appointed by the Lord Chancellor; they have not agreed that there should be a continuous complaints procedure, so that it is not assembled on an ad hoc basis; nor have they agreed that the investigator should have the power to award compensation. The Government's only concession was that ex gratia payments by the FSA could be made in certain circumstances—nothing more.
<P>
The last of the Burns' recommendations was dismissed by the former Economic Secretary, now the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce, the hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) as leading to open season for actions against the FSA. That argument is implausible in itself, but it is extremely so when we consider the clause. It cannot possibly be an argument against immunity. The Minister said that if investigators had considerable power we would end up with light-touch regulation because the FSA would be devoting an enormous amount of energy to prevent itself from being liable. That is also a weak argument. It is implausible to suggest that we are in an era of light-touch regulation in any case. The Bill has 367 clauses and 17 schedules.
<P>
The amendment suggests that the FSA should be liable in three instances—recklessness, negligence and unreasonableness—and I want to say a little about each of these. The suggestion to include recklessness clearly falls short of what we could call bad faith. At present, the FSA is liable if it acts in bad faith. But, bad faith involves intent and some sort of forethought, whereas recklessness does not go quite that far. It suggests that there may be a lack of care. There may or may not be intent behind recklessness, but it is implausible that the Government consider that the FSA should not be liable for reckless behaviour in maintaining the list.
<P>
When I have asked Ministers about the need to deal with the test of reasonableness more thoroughly in the Bill, they have said that the FSA will have a general duty to act reasonably. If that is so, I do not understand why the FSA should not be liable if it were to act unreasonably.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On the last of the three reasons that we argue immunity should be lifted—negligence—I think that the Government have more of a case. Given the huge body of common law on negligence, I can envisage circumstances in which large firms could give the FSA the run around by bringing expensive and pointless negligence suits. However, small firms, which could not possibly go to law in that way, should be able to bring cases before an investigator and compensation should be available if negligence occurs. That will not be possible under the Bill, and I urge the Government to reconsider that provision. I am concerned about immunity generally, as I said on the Floor of the House earlier this week, but I am especially concerned about what can be thought of only as commercial transactions, the parties to which would not be immune from civil action in any other walk of life.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Recognised investment exchanges do not have statutory immunity. The Bill will give them immunity, limited to their members. That immunity will apply to the stock exchange in its capacity as a recognised investment exchange. However, as a competent authority, the stock exchange has statutory immunity for its functions, both for its employees and itself, under section 187 of the Financial Services Act 1986.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) referred to the commercial aspects. The competent authority function is not a commercial role, but a public function. That is shown by the fact that we shall transfer such functions, given the demutualisation of the London stock exchange.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> As I understand it, the exchange's immunity was included in the 1986 Act because of its being a self-regulatory body and because people would not have been prepared to serve on it if they did not have immunity. Witnesses to the Burns Committee made it clear that that argument for a self-regulating body did not stand for a public body, but the Economic Secretary has just suggested that the fact that the Government are creating a public body is justification for immunity.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not believe that I made that suggestion.
<P>
It is necessary that the FSA should not be liable for damages in respect of its regulatory functions and that it should not be liable for damages in respect of the competent authority function for similar reasons. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
Like the FSA, the competent authority needs to work within a legal structure that allows it to do so efficiently and effectively. As with the FSA, statutory immunity for the competent authority is not new; it already benefits from immunity under section 187 of the Financial Services Act 1986.
<P>
Statutory immunity is a privilege, but it is not absolute. Neither the competent authority nor the FSA will have immunity if they act in bad faith, nor if they contravene section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998. Both bodies will be susceptible to judicial review. It is vital that both bodies are protected against actions alleging recklessness or negligence. Without such protection, the proper and efficient action of the competent authority could be severely frustrated by law suits and red tape, as Opposition Members have acknowledged.
<P>
By the very nature of its task, the competent authority may often have to take regulatory decisions that have consequences for third parties. Such decisions will often have to be taken quickly, without full knowledge of the facts. The absence or weakening of immunity could also have more pernicious day-to-day effects on the industry—for example, by leading to a tendency to defensive regulation when the authority sets too stringent standards or takes longer than usual to reach decisions, to avoid the risk of legal action. That would not bode well for light-touch regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am about to finish.
<P>
On the six months point raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, applications for listing take an average of three months. There is no reason to expect that to be different in future: in fact, the Treasury currently agrees the targets with the London stock exchange.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> What has led the Minister to think that the removal of immunity for reckless behaviour could lead to an increase in red tape?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As the competent authority, the FSA may have to take decisions quickly, and may not always be able to judge the consequences. Faced with having to do that without full knowledge of the facts, the problem will be that if there is a risk of charges of recklessness or negligence, the authority will have to resort to acting in a much more bureaucratic manner so that, instead of the right regulatory decisions being made, and the right courses of action being pursued at the right times, it will become unduly anxious and generate a great deal of red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy with which to protect itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Will the Minister repeat a remark that she made earlier? I think that she said that at present the stock exchange has immunity in respect of its members because it is a mutual body but does not have immunity in respect of its listing function vis-à-vis companies that it lists. Am I correct?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, but the Bill limits the stock exchange's immunity to members that it does not have at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I cannot see that it makes any difference whatever that, merely because of EU regulations, the FSA is given the fancy name of competent authority. The listing arrangements handled by the stock exchange to date will, in essence, be no different from those that will be handled by the FSA.
<P>
It is the same quasi-commercial role. I cannot see how calling it the competent authority gives bona fide justification for introducing legal immunity.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> May I make it clear to the hon. Gentleman because I may have assented the wrong way round? I am sorry about that. The stock exchange has immunity as regards its competent authority function. It does not have it in respect of its recognised investment exchange function.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I did not intend to intervene in the debate because it has been covered so comprehensively by my hon. Friend, but I am alarmed at some of the Minister's comments. We should all agree that statutory immunity is objectional in principle; indeed, the steady march of British law since Magna Carta has been to bring everyone under the law. But there is a case for statutory immunity in some instances and in some institutions, in carefully defined circumstances. The Government are prepared to lift statutory immunity only in cases of bad faith. That is a high hurdle for anyone contemplating legal action against the authority to clear.
<P>
Bad faith certainly ought to include recklessness. We do not agree that reckless behaviour by a private company such as the FSA should not be subject to legal immunity.
<P>
With regard to recklessness, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury gave the example of the authority having to take swift action in crises. In such circumstances, the authority may lay itself open to the charge of recklessness. However, were I to be charged with reckless driving, the fact that I was in a great hurry and had to get to work quickly would not be a defence. It may be perfectly true and much may have depended on my getting to a certain place at a certain time, but that does not excuse reckless behaviour which puts everyone else at risk.
<P>
Therefore, we have no objection to the inclusion of bad faith in the clause, provided that that encompasses reckless behaviour. However, if reckless behaviour is not included, it certainly should be. Unless the Economic Secretary is prepared to provide more assurances on the matter, we are inclined to divide the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I want to add a further thought.
<P>
There are two ways in which the Economic Secretary might be of assistance. She might accept the amendment or the principle that recklessness—and probably unreasonableness—should be removed from immunity. Another approach would be to give us and the financial community greater assurance on compensation. In other words, the Government should create a countervailing force or pressure on the FSA, inducing it to offer a high-quality service.
<P>
Those who take a close interest in such matters find Government concessions on compensation inadequate and too weak to act as a check on the FSA. We would be less inclined to divide the Committee if the Government were to make further concessions on that issue.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I do not propose to make many more comments.
<P>
The Government believe that if recklessness is not covered by statutory immunity, it may become a lawyers' charter for tying up the FSA. It is not just a question of saying that the FSA should be liable for recklessness. As the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire recognised, issuers of securities are well funded bodies with ample opportunity to tie up the competent authority in lawsuits alleging recklessness, if they feel aggrieved by the competent authority's decisions. Several members of the Committee have implicitly accepted that there is a risk of that happening.
<P>
The Joint Committee did not mention the matter of the competent authority's statutory immunity. However, it examined equivalent provisions for the FSA and concluded that statutory immunity is appropriate, provided that the Government strengthen arrangements for independent complaints investigations. We have done that. The arguments that apply in such cases apply with equal force to the competent authority.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> At the risk trying your patience, Mr. Atkinson, no one who reads pages 36 to 40 of the report and the evidence that was given during the cross-examination of witnesses could possibly come to the Minister's conclusion.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government have not dealt adequately with the recommendations in the Burns report. On the issue of compensation the Burns Committee recommended that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government gives serious consideration to whether the investigator should be able to award compensation to businesses . . . damaged by FSA maladministration.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Remember, this will be an independent investigator appointed by the Lord Chancellor. If the Government decided not to go down that road, it recommended ex gratia payments, but ex gratia payments from the investigator. That is not what we have now. That is not what the Government have been prepared to concede. I will not bore the Committee by reading out verbatim what the witnesses said but anyone who is interested in the cross-examination will find what I have described in paragraphs 330 and 397 of volume II.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): I want to correct the general impression left by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie). Paragraph 139 of volume I of the Burns report says that both the British Bankers Association and AUTIF are content with the proposed immunity. It concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We consider that the proposals for immunity for the FSA are appropriate''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and later adds that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the immunity should extend to actions by non members as well as members'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
subject to the complaints procedure being reviewed, which it has been. It is difficult to interpret that as total support for the arguments presented by the Opposition. It is anything but.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We have just heard some pretty disingenuous selective quoting from the Burns Committee report. [Interruption.] Well the best example is the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) who read out:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We consider that the proposals for immunity for the FSA are appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The rest of the sentence reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provided that the complaints procedure is strengthened as we recommend below.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[Interruption.] The hon. Member did not read out the second part of that sentence.
<P>
The Burns Committee report was unanimous, but my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and I expressed grave reservations about the whole principle of immunity. It was published on the understanding that there was a strong counterbalance of the independent complaints procedure with a strong recommendation that it had a power to award compensation, as we discussed earlier in our proceedings.
<P>
We do not have a fully independent complaints procedure with a fully independent complaints commissioner who can be appointed independently. We ascertained that earlier. There is still no procedure for the award of compensation. It has by no means been strengthened according to the recommendations of the Burns Committee both in terms of its wording and the strong sentiments expressed by members across all parties of that Committee.
<P>
Please let us not use that red herring to try to mask the fact that statutory immunity is being granted not only to the regulatory authority function of the FSA, but to the competent authority of functions of the FSA without any compensation or real independence of complaints procedure to go with it. That was the counterbalancing compensation that was urged by the vast majority of witnesses who came before us and in the vast majority of written submissions from all sorts of trade and professional bodies in the financial services industry such as the Law Society and the Securities Institute, and practitioners at the sharp end from the firms that we consulted. The Government need to be a little more fairhanded on this matter.
<P>
The FSA is being placed on an extremely special pedestal. We have discussed many examples, both today and in discussing statutory immunity on previous occasions, of trade bodies, such as a builders' federation-type body, to which building firms, in this case, pay a subscription fee to be informally regulated and listed as an approved builder. Such firms agree to abide by specified rules and regulations and have attained a minimum standard of, in this case, building work. It is the responsibility of that trade body to ensure that such firms adheres to the minimum standards required by the organisation that has awarded them that charter mark to attract more business.
<P>
The analogy is close to that of a company applying for a listing, but such a trade body would be fully subject to the rigours of a lawsuit if as a result of its own recklessness or negligence it took unjustified action that resulted in a member firm losing business. The British Medical Association, the Law Society and the Serious Fraud Office are all subject to similar checks and balances within the law. Why on earth should the FSA have such extraordinary cotton wool insulation from the legal process for its regulatory functions? It is even more absurd that it should be completely protected on account of its listing functions as the designated competent authority.
<P>
With the greatest respect, the response of the Economic Secretary, who became slightly tied up in the matter, was rather limp in trying to justify what we consider to be entirely unjustifiable without the checks and balances of the compensatory measures that we advocate. As far as we know, no service standard requirement is being placed on the FSA as the competent authority. We are now told that processing applications will take an average of three months. We have no assurance that the FSA acting as the competent authority will be able to replicate that, and the six-month cut-off time, with all its adverse implications, may be reached time and again. The Economic Secretary's contention. that the statutory immunity is not all-encompassing because it will not apply to bad faith or potential contravention of the European convention on human rights does not hold much water. We know in practice how nigh on impossible it is to prove bad faith in the legal process. Only in extreme cases would people be able fully to pursue a challenge on the basis of a contravention of the ECHR.
<P>
I urge my hon. Friends and Labour Members, especially those who were privy to the discussions of the Burns Committee, to say that enough is enough. We must draw the line at the FSA being free to act entirely as it chooses, outside the remit of the law. The amendment would, introduce perfectly reasonable checks and balances that would act as an incentive for the FSA acting as a competent authority to ensure that it does a good job in the interests of its customers and consumers of financial products.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 164, in page 211, line 23, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, to the extent that the offer is made to persons in the United Kingdom,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment. As the Committee is aware, schedule 10 defines an offer to the public, subject to certain exemptions set out in accordance with derogations in European Community law. It specifically covers what we have come to know as the prospectus requirements. There is little difference between it and the existing regulations.
<P>
The amendment is designed to give the Government's confirmation that when the exemption for a full prospectus applies to an offering to up to 50 people that means—as at present—50 people in the United Kingdom and not 50 people in total. A prospectus might be sent to 48 people in the UK and another 12 outside it. That would clearly fall within the prospectus exemptions, as has been the case since 1995. By being silent on that front, the drafting poses the question as to whether the Treasury is trying to make the exemption apply on a global basis.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for moving the amendment.
<P>
The intention behind the legislation is that, in considering whether an offer is exempt, regard must be had only to the extent that the offer was made to people in the UK. If the offer is, for example, made to fewer than 50 people in the UK it will be exempt from the need to produce a prospectus in the UK.
<P>
That will be the case even if it is offered to more than 50 people outside the UK in, for example, another member state. Whether a prospectus is required in the other country in such a case is a matter for that other country. In the case of European Union member states, it will depend on how they have implemented the prospectus directive.
<P>
I am therefore happy to agree to the Opposition amendment, which ensures that paragraph 2 of schedule 10 has the correct effect.
