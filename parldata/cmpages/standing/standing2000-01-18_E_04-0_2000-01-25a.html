<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On your behalf, I welcome the Minister of State back to his place in what I understand to be rude health. Committee members who have worked under my chairmanship before will know that I have established a tradition of not permitting a clause stand part debate at the beginning and end of groups of amendments. There are a considerable number of amendments to clause 6, although some of them are grouped. I suspect that by the time that we reach the end of the debates on those amendments we shall have exhausted the subject as much as most of us will be able to stand. On that basis, it is entirely up to hon. Members whether they choose to have a stand part debate at the beginning or end of the clause, but they may not have both. I am, therefore, prepared to allow a reasonably wide-ranging debate on the first group of amendments, on the understanding that it will not be repeated.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Licences: grant</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I beg to move amendment No. 147, in page 4, line 9, at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Subject to subsection (11A) below,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this is it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 134, in page 4, line 15, leave out from `requirements' to end of line 17 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which shall be published by the Secretary of State prior to this Chapter coming into force.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 136, in page 4, line 22, leave out `if the licence authority requires,'.
<P>
No. 137, in page 4, line 23, leave out `in the prescribed manner and'.
<P>
No. 149, in page 5, line 13, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(11A) No licence shall be granted until the Secretary of State has published the duties that shall be encumbered upon the grantor.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Perhaps I may alert you to the fact that the first group of amendments is rather a motley collection, Mr. Gale. The meat of the clause may be dealt with in later groups. Our difficulty is understanding the Bill as it is drafted. We shall ask Ministers to explain and the debate may develop as we proceed. I hope that the Government will have confidence that we made good progress last Thursday and, although we may detain the Committee for some time on the next two or three clauses, which relate to the licence, I expect us to move on after that.
<P>
Amendment No. 147 simply sets up a new subsection to clause 6, which concerns the manner in which the licence shall be granted. It seems an extraordinarily complex way to grant a licence. We shall want to discuss why there are two granting authorities. We have an inkling as to the reason, but I look forward to a comprehensive explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is a complex matter. He says that there are two granting authorities. Has he noticed that while there are two such authorities in the Bill for the licence, only one body, namely the Secretary of State, can award exemptions? Does he find that strange?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting matter, but I have not seen any of his amendments that relate to that question. We are both in opposition but the hon. Gentleman may be sitting on some Cabinet Committee related to this subject so that he is bound by some sense of collective responsibility. I am looking forward to his contributions to the debate.
<P>
I was referring to amendment No. 147, and I shall stick closely to the amendments for the next few minutes. It sets up a new subsection that would force the Secretary of State to publish the duties incumbent upon the grantor—either the Secretary of State or the Civil Aviation Authority—before the licence was granted. The Minister is probably thinking that that provision is otiose because the duties of both grantors are set out in clauses 1 and 2 and we do not need to discuss them again. The question is whether the grantor of the licence should have some obligation to the licence holder or holders. After all, they are going to be doing the business—they are going to be watching the screens, managing the software and the hardware, sending out instructions to the aircraft and managing the air traffic control system.
<P>
We are dealing not with a simple but with a crucial operation. Although we envisage now that there will be only one licence holder, as we go through the Bill and look at the initial licence, we begin to wonder whether the Eurocontrol and oceanic areas are intended to be granted to separate licence holders and whether the Swanwick and Prestwick systems are intended to be operated by different licence holders. No doubt, we will discuss that when we consider the draft licence.
<P>
The question is, what are the duties that should be incumbent upon the grantor of the licence towards the licence holder? There must be an obligation not to disrupt the work of the licence holder. However many contraventions of the licence there may be, there must be an obligation to the viability and the operating continuity of the holder, whatever other difficulties may exist between it and the supervisory authority. The air traffic control operation is doing the business and it is, therefore, owed some duty to enable it to continue its job.
<P>
Amendment No. 149 would set up the new subsection (11A). Amendment No. 134 would amend subsection (2), which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A general authority may be given''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, a general authority to grant a licence—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``on condition that CAA complies with the specified requirements (whether as to consulting the Secretary of State or obtaining his consent before granting a licence, as to the provisions to be included in a licence, or otherwise)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We wondered about the intention behind that subsection and, as we were unable fully to decipher it, we decided to simplify. We were unsure as to ``the specified requirements'', which are given in the general authority, how that authority is to be given, and who will know that it has been given. We decided that it would be interesting for the Minister to explain why it should not be drafted in this way, with the second part of the clause deleted. The subsection would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a general authority may be given on condition that the CAA complies with specified requirements which shall be published by the Secretary of State before coming into force''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We mean the coming into force of the licence and I accept that there may be a deficiency in the technicality of the drafting. What do ``specified requirements'' mean and, if they are relevant, should they not be public because the ``specified requirements'' of such a general authority must be relevant to the nature of the licence and the bidders for the licence.
<P>
Finally, amendments Nos. 136 and 137 refer to clause 6(3)(d), which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An application for a licence— . . .
<P>
(d) must, if the licence authority requires, be published by the applicant in the prescribed manner and within a period notified to it by the licence authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why have a qualification to the requirement to publish? Why should the application not be published willy-nilly? Why should it be at the discretion of the licensing authority whether the application is published?
<P>
I suspect that when the existing set-up, National Air Traffic Services, applies for its licence to the Secretary of State, the Government will not want the embarrassment of having to publish the licence application. It will all be a formality at that stage and therefore it will not be necessary to publish anything. Surely the information would inform the bidding process at a later date when we expect a competitive tender from others. NATS is to remain part of the CAA, but the matter is complicated. Perhaps the Minister will explain it to the Committee. Why the information should not be published is a mystery. Perhaps it is to do with the fact that NATS will be operating under the licence regime while it is still part of the CAA, so it will all be a formality. On reflection, however, that cannot be a rational reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Portillo </B>(Kensington and Chelsea): My hon. Friend is on to a good point. The Bill appears to be written in a rather porous, all-purpose way, with plurals where there might have been singulars, as has been discussed, and with allowances made for an initial licensing by the Secretary of State and the CAA but not expressed separately—not put down as though it were a separate and a different quality of event from the subsequent CAA licensing of NATS. Such drafting leads to a Bill that has many obscurities in it—to a range of possibilities. I wonder whether my hon. Friend has reached any conclusion as to whether the Bill is merely poorly drafted or reflects a muddle in the Government's mind about how they will proceed in these matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is simpler than that. There is no conspiracy here. The Government have simply taken the wording from the previous Government's Railways Act 1993. The Secretary of State was the initial granting authority in that Act, but eventually the granting of concessions and licences moved to the regulator and the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, or the Strategic Rail Authority as it is to become. The difficulty that we found with operating that regime was that it left a great many powers still residing with the Secretary of State—powers that, in principle, he never intends to use. It is no secret that the previous Administration were considering legislation to tidy up the 1993 Act and remove all those residual powers of the Secretary of State to make the regime simpler. The Government could have learned from that in the drafting of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Were we not led to believe that things could only get better? Will my hon. Friend explain why they so evidently have not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My right hon. Friend is right. Since the Dome, of course, everything is becoming apparent. The Dome will be seen as a turning point in the affairs of this Administration. Things are not as they were intended and they are not exactly as they are intended by this Administration to seem. The Government have learned very little from the difficulties that we experienced on many issues, and this is one instance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): My hon. Friend mentioned the railways. Surely the difference is that when a railway company applied for a franchise it had to say what it intended to do. Therefore, the public could judge its performance against what it had promised to do originally. In this case, if the Secretary of State does not require the application to be published, the public have no basis on which to judge the performance of the company that has applied for the licence.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is right. My hon. Friend has a point because amendment No. 136 concerns the prescribed manner in which the application shall be published and we have no idea what that will be—whether that refers to what shall be contained in the licence application or just to whether it is published on vellum or plain paper, photocopied or printed with glossy pictures. I know what the predilection of the Government is. We need some clarification on clause 6(3)(d) as to exactly what is intended regarding the publication of the application for a licence. It must be in the interests of open government, particularly with a safety-conscious industry about which there are anxieties, that the licence application process and the granting of the licence should be as open and accountable as possible to enable anyone who has concerns to raise them. It would concern most people if the process were conducted in secrecy. Why should not the representatives of the air traffic controllers—the Institution of professionals, Managers and Specialists—be able to comment on the licensing process all the way through? The publication of the application for a licence is a requirement of good practice in this industry, where safety is of such importance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman wondered whether I might be reticent about speaking on this issue because I was a member of some Cabinet Committee that discusses this or other issues. Can I assure him and all members of the Committee that I do not serve on the Cabinet Committee that discusses this matter, nor indeed do I serve on any such Committee.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman rightly referred to the complexity of the proposals in the clause. In his amendments, for which we have considerable sympathy, he seeks to fight his way through the fog created by the clause. He pointed out that perhaps the Government are seeking merely to benefit from what the previous Government did in the Railways Act 1993. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) suggested during our second sitting that when we debated the Railways Bill I was in the Lobby with the Conservatives. If he checks the record, as I have done, he will discover that I joined his hon. Friends in the Lobby on Second and at Third Reading, to oppose the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): I was referring not to the Second Reading of the Railways Bill, but to one of the other votes on the matter. However, that has nothing to do with this amendment. May I say that, particularly after the hon. Gentleman's latest contribution, that we Labour Members find it astonishing that there is so much talent in the Liberal Democrat party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be making that point to the Prime Minister ere long.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) pointed out that it is somewhat surprising that clause 6(1) offers the potential for two different licensing authorities and that we need clarification on that. I pointed out to the hon. Gentleman that although there are two licensing authorities for the important issue of awarding licences, only one authority—the Secretary of State—is responsible for awarding all exceptions in respect of any air traffic service. That seems surprising. Will the Minister explain the reason for the difference?
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex picked up on confusion later in the Bill. Although there may be two licensing authorities—either the CAA, with the agreement of the Secretary of State, or the Secretary of State himself, after consultation with the CAA—there is confusion about which will deal with contraventions of the licence. Under clause 15, it shall be the responsibility of the Secretary of State to take out initially a temporary order and later a final order in respect of any contravention of section 8 duties. Yet, if there is a contravention of the specific duties in the licence, it will be the responsibility of the CAA to establish order. There is considerable confusion; much more openness in granting licences is therefore important.
<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North Essex will be of benefit in respect of other matters on which he has not touched. He rightly says that it is important that all bodies with an interest should be able to access detailed information about what is going on, so that they can feel confident when the licence is issued. However, some hon. Members may share my view that we should also have sufficient information to determine whether the Secretary of State has made the correct judgment on what may be competing bids for a licence.
<P>
Part I is all about air traffic services, yet there is no mention of the proposed sale of National Air Traffic Services. The Bill establishes arrangements to enable the part privatisation of NATS, but gives no details. I am assuming, as I suspect will the Committee, that the organisation that becomes the strategic partner in the part privatisation of NATS will be granted the main licence for the en-route services—the 85 per cent. of NATS' activities. Surely the Bill does not rule out another organisation making a bid. Will the Minister confirm that it will be possible, at least theoretically, for another organisation to seek to obtain the licence? I accept that that would be difficult for such an organisation, given that it would not have access to information on the infrastructure—which is covered later in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The matter is far less complicated that the hon. Gentleman might think; it is like changing a train franchise. The franchisee who loses the bid does not take his trains away and put them somewhere else. The trains transfer to the new franchisee. Therefore, the employees, air traffic controllers, hardware and software would all transfer to the licence holder. I am sure that that is the intention, although I do not blame the hon. Gentleman for not having understood it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He may well be right that that is the intention, although, as he points out, that is certainly not made clear in the Bill. The example of the railways is not an appropriate analogy because we have to take into account the rolling stock operator, who will keep the actual rolling stock separate from the franchise in relation to the train operating companies. There is some difference between the two.
<P>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's main point that the issue may be simpler than I am describing. I am raising it because it is certainly not clear on the face of the Bill. I hoped that he was using his amendment, as I am doing, as a way of teasing out from the Minister some greater clarification on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Perhaps a better example would be if Railtrack were to lose its licence and the licence were to be granted to someone else. The tracks, signalling, infrastructure and employees would transfer to a new licence holder. The operation itself would be transferred. I am sure that that is how it is intended to work, although it is not explicit in the Railways Act either. I look forward to the Minister's explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. His latter example is perhaps more analogous than the case that we are debating. We are talking of the importance of openness and clarity in the transactions that take place in the granting of a licence. I have argued that because there is lack of clarity on the face of the Bill about a number of issues, that is important. I have mentioned the possibility of competing bids for the licence. It is therefore important to have openness and clarity about the respective bids so that when the Secretary of State or the CAA, whichever ends up being the licensing authority, makes a decision between competing claims there is an opportunity for everyone to see the criteria on which the Secretary of State or the CAA has made that decision.
<P>
There will be other reasons why that is important. For example, if there are competing bids it would be sensible—this is certainly not in the Bill—to have a mechanism for a right of appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State. Again, will the Minister explain what will be the mechanism for a right of appeal in the event that there are competing claims for a licence or licences?
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Has the hon. Gentleman also noticed that the Secretary of State need only explain why he has granted a licence? He need not explain why he has refused one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> That is why I have raised the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> One of the problems is that we are dealing with something slightly akin to three-dimensional chess. We know that the Government want to take into account the amount of money that is offered, they want to take into account national security considerations, and presumably they want to take into account the quality that is offered in the bid. I well understand that it is difficult to give such things weighting. If one were not satisfied on national security, for example, one would not be prepared to accept any sum of money. I understand that the Government are in a genuine difficulty about publishing criteria. However, they are in grave danger of tumbling into something that is perhaps worse: they might be turning down licences without being able to explain what has happened. As we move ever more towards open government and as we see scandals across Europe, the public are ever less easily convinced of fair dealing unless they can see transparency in such matters. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am in entire agreement with the right hon. Gentleman. Like him, I recognise both that it is difficult to give weighting to the various factors that need to be taken into account and that there are issues to do with commercial confidence and security matters. That does not alter the broad principle of the need for freedom of information, as the right hon. Gentleman says, to enable the public to be able to look at the actions of the Secretary of State, or the CAA acting on his behalf, in this important area of the awarding of licences. A further complication, which arises out of the lack of clarity on the face of the Bill, concerns the decision on whether the bidding organisation for the licence will be expected to include within its bid the continuation of those current non-en-route services that are currently undertaken by NATS.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the Committee is well aware, NATS obtains something like 15 per cent. of its current revenues from the provision of air traffic control services at airports outside the en-route activities. It is understood by the Committee that those will be exempt services and will not be contained within the licence. Yet it has been made quite clear in speeches in this Committee, on the Floor of the House and in the utterances of members of the Government elsewhere that the bid to become the strategic partner in the new NATS enterprise will incorporate those 15 per cent. of the activities.
<P>
How will that factor be taken into account in both the bidding process to become the strategic partner and in the awarding of a licence where, for example, an organisation was not interested in providing anything other than the core services and the conditions laid down in the licence? These do not include the 15 per cent. of activities. Would companies be excluded from an application for the licence merely because they were not interested in doing that 15 per cent. of activities which are not covered anyway by the licence agreement but might be required in the bid to become the strategic partner in the public-private partnership?
<P>
My point throughout the debate is that because of the lack of clarity on the face of the Bill many issues are not clear to us. Therefore, it is vital that we put on the face of the Bill at least a mechanism that would ensure that some of these matters are brought into the open so that judgments can be made about the actions of the Secretary of State or the CAA acting as licensing authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I wish to understand the hon. Gentleman's viewpoint on this. He makes a very interesting point about the 15 per cent. of services not covered by the licence and which are not connected to the en-route services. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that it would be of benefit for the new contractor to provide those services? Is he afraid that they might not be provided at all or that they might be of inferior quality if the contractor does not bid for those services? Or is he anxious to see an opportunity for the opening up of competition? As we move into an area where the contractor will be in the private sector under private sector management, some of the questions of monopoly strike us with new force in a way that they did not when all this was a public sector activity. Is he arguing that here is an opportunity for greater competition? Would he welcome it if some of the bids did not include the 15 per cent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The right hon. Gentleman tempts me to go slightly further than we are discussing now. He will be well aware that a number of the air traffic control services provided at individual airports currently are not provided by NATS. They operate under a system of contract, tendering and so forth. Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether it is the intention of the Government—I would support them on this—that those services will continue to be bid for in exactly the same way and that the new public-private partnership will be required to operate similarly. I would have no problem with that, and I hope that that is a clear answer to the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Finally, there are a number of other issues in relation to the amendments that the hon. Member for North Essex will be moving in a few minutes. Rather than take up the Committee's time later, may I say that we have no difficulty with the notion that the Secretary of State or the CAA, in consultation or in agreement, should be the licensing authority. The hon. Gentleman seeks to change in a later amendment. I would not want anything in my opening remarks to have suggested that we object to that. However, I believe that there needs to be much greater clarity in the way in which some of these decisions will be taken and I look forward to the Minister's reply. I hope he will explain to the Committee that which is not explained either on the face of the Bill or in the explanatory notes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I do not want to be rude to the parliamentary draftsmen because I am sure they were not responsible for this, but clause 6 is a most extraordinarily drafted piece of legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex and the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) are right: this is either a curiously archaic form of drafting or there was a plot behind clause 6. Like my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex, I think that there is a plot behind this. I think that the clause has been drafted in a particular way to meet a particular set of circumstances that are not yet clear to us. I hope that the Minister will be able to throw some light on what the intentions are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Deputy Prime Minister, over his long career has done tremendous service to the English language? Perhaps we are seeing the direct influence of the Deputy Prime Minister in the drafting of this Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I agree with my right hon. Friend. I cannot believe that a parliamentary draftsman would write this and I am sure the influence of the Deputy Prime Minister is stamped on it. It is a curious Bill. Clause 1 talks about ``managers of aerodromes''. Now that is a wonderful expression—aerodrome. I have not heard it used since about 1939.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> How old are you?
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I am getting on a bit.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not mean to go too far down the road on prejudices in parliamentary drafting, but some of us still listen to the wireless every morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> Both you and I, Mr. Gale, are traditionalists in our own way. If you look at clause 6 and the amendments that we have tabled to simplify it, it is the most extraordinary thing. In subsection (1)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A licence may be granted by—
<P>
(a) the Secretary of State after consulting the CAA,''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(b) the CAA with the consent of the Secretary of State, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) the CAA in accordance with a general authority given by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is obscure. What is the difference between (a), (b) and (c)? In the notes on clauses it is clearer. Referring to clause 6 they say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It envisages that the initial licence will be granted by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The plot thickens. Why do we have this complex, obscure clause when the notes on clauses tell us that the intention is that the Secretary of State should grant the first licence? That is what I cannot understand, Mr. Gale, unless there is a particular purpose here. I believe that the aim is not to allow proper competition, but that there will be some sort of stitch-up deal at the end of the day. One reason why we think that is that, as amendment No. 136 says, the details of the application do not have to be published. That points firmly to the idea that this will be a stitch-up. There will not be a proper competition to run the services. The clause has been drafted in such a way as to give maximum flexibility to the Secretary of State in order to achieve that fudge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): The wording of the Bill is extraordinary. It is double-worded all the way through and one wonders sometimes whether the Government have full confidence in the CAA. One of the post-war success stories has been the Civil Aviation Authority. Looking at the record of the CAA in Britain and looking abroad, I believe that we have been very lucky at the way it has conducted its duties since the war.
<P>
The Minister should first express his confidence in the CAA. Taking NATS out of the organisation, begs the question about the remaining duties of the CAA—economic and safety regulation and the general duty of aviation policy. The Bill contains means of recouping some of the charges for that, but I hope to receive some assurance that the CAA will still be properly funded to fulfil its role in aviation policy and those roles that do not necessarily purely reflect its role of economic regulation within the Bill.
<P>
The wording could have been more elegant. It could have said, ``The Secretary of State will grant the first licence and thereafter''. We have a much longer and more complex Bill and those Opposition Members whose job it is to look for snags, hitches, complications and so on have had far more to talk about than they would have had if the Bill been more elegantly drafted.
<P>
When the Minister responds, will he say a word about the continuing role of the CAA, and in particular whether it will still be fully funded for those aspects of economic regulation that are not covered by the present Bill?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> Although I feel somewhat chastened by the assaults made in the course of this brief discussion on the terminology of the clause, I must explain to the Committee that much of it is drawn from the previous Government's Railways Act. When it comes to allocating responsibility for terminological difficulties, the Opposition should consider their own responsibilities in such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is typical of the hon. Gentleman to have produced that fact with a great flourish of triumph. What it demonstrates is that this is a copycat Government who not only copy what we did successfully but never learn from or improve upon what we did. That is what we are criticising the hon. Gentleman for. I never thought that he was such a fan of the Railways Act.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am sure that you would reprimand me, Mr. Gale, if I were to respond to the hon. Member for North Essex by dilating on the many achievements of the present Administration which are in such marked contrast to that of the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> is not the hon. Member for North Essex being somewhat generous to the Minister?. Will the Minister confirm that not only is he not a fan of the Railways Bill, as it then was, but that he joined me in the Lobby to vote against it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Some exactitude has been secured in the course of our proceedings. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Bath has discovered what his own voting record was on a not inconsiderable issue before the nation at that time.
<P>
To be more serious, I am conscious that succeeding amendments will permit fuller discussion of the Government's intentions under the clause. The hon. Member for North Essex made that point. However, a number of the questions that he raised may be more appropriately dealt with later in our exchanges. That goes for a number of the other issues raised during the debate, not least two licensing authorities, competition, appeal—indeed, nearly all the issues that were raised in the initial set of exchanges. As the late, lamented Ernie Bevin might have said, we have been treated to a ``tour d'horizon''. I hope, on behalf of the Government, to respond to those issues in extreme detail in due course.
<P>
It is now my intention to deal with the present set of amendments in the order in which they appear on the amendment paper.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 147 and 149, tabled by the hon. Member for North Essex, would add a new subsection requiring the publication by the Secretary of State of the duties of the grantor of an operating licence before such a licence is so granted. However, the duties of the Secretary of State and the CAA, the only possible grantors under the Bill, are already set out in clauses 1 and 2. While I understand that the hon. Gentleman is seeking greater procedural openness—something to which the Government are sympathetic and to which I shall respond in due course—the proposed amendments No. 147 and 149 add nothing to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is the Minister saying that the grantor owes no duty to the licence holder whatsoever?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The duties and responsibilities are set out already in clauses 1 and 2, which have been discussed by the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 134 would replace the parameters governing the provision to be included in a general authority given by the Secretary of State to enable the CAA to grant licences with a more general term. The amendment is a little surprising. On the one hand, by requiring publication the amendment would create greater openness; on the other hand, it would increase the Secretary of State's discretion as to the scope of any general authority. The amendment sets out some parameters. It is our intention that only one licence will be issued at the outset, and we do not expect to issue more in the foreseeable future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Minister makes the rather bizarre claim that the clause as drafted restricts the Secretary of State rather more than the amendment does. Surely he is ignoring the words in line 17 ``or otherwise'', which give the Secretary of State a free hand to grant or not to grant as he sees fit, whereas the amendment specifies that the Secretary of State will lay down the absolute terms and conditions under which he will do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I take the drift of the hon. Gentleman's contribution, but it is our considered interpretation of the implications of the amendment that it would serve to increase the Secretary of State's discretion as to the scope of any general authority. We are determined that there should be some parameters in this process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is exactly those parameters, the so-called specified requirements, that the probing amendment is designed to elucidate from the hon. Gentleman. If he is saying that the amendment would not require the Secretary of State, or even the hon. Gentleman, to set out those parameters, that may be so. Will he give us an idea of what those specified requirements would be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I pay the penalty for the transparency, openness and generosity with which I wish to conduct this Standing Committee. Were it not for the interventions of the Opposition I would have come to deal with the question posed by the hon. Member for North Essex about the specified requirements for the CAA to grant licences under general authority. He also asks whether they will be public.
<P>
The answer is that a general authority is a normal part of the regulatory landscape. The purpose is to allow the Secretary of State to ensure that certain conditions are included in the public interest, for example with regard to collaboration with other providers or to the universal services obligation. Let me add that the general authority would normally be published. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that will not happen for some time because it will not be needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that no licence will be granted for some time? That is the implication.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am saying that the general authority will be published in due course, but it certainly will not need to be published in due course, although we expect to move to issuing the licence within the foreseeable future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Will the Minister explain why the general authority is not needed for some time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As I understand it, we would expect to issue the general authority after the granting of the licence, and that will not occur for some time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> There is a muddle somewhere. Perhaps the Minister will reflect on what he has just said. He says that the licence will come first followed by the general authority. Would he like to assert that again?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I apologise for any unnecessary confusion that I have created in the Committee. The first licence will be granted by the Secretary of State, not by the CAA. I hope that that serves to clarify that issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I am not sure that it does wholly clarify it. We all knew that already. We read in the explanatory memorandum that the initial licence would be issued by the Secretary of State. I want to understand what the Minister is saying about the general authority not being published until some time after the licence. Will he please explain that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> May I undertake to come back to the right hon. Gentleman on that point? I need to look for inspiration on that matter. It is important and I shall certainly offer some clarification in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Earlier, the Minister said he did not anticipate the granting of any other licence for the foreseeable future. We have already read in the licence that the term is up to 30 years. Are we legislating for 30 years hence, with all this complication enabling additional or new licences to be granted? It seems to be an extraordinarily far-sighted Bill if that is the case—perhaps, unnecessarily so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That is certainly a reasonable argument and I am not trying to evade the issue. If the hon. Gentleman reflects on later amendments that he has tabled, he will find that that precise matter will be the subject of debate in the Committee and we will deal with it then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. We seem to be making heavy weather of something, which perhaps reflects the lack of clarity on the face of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will agree that it is incumbent upon him to give at least some sign of the likely duration of the first licence before we move on to the CAA's operation. I hope that we are not stretching your patience too far, Mr. Gale, but may I refer to the Government's response to the consultation on this matter? They said that the Government,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``recognises the constraints and conflicts pointed out by respondents to the consultation and will seek out the optimum balance between incentivising the licence holder and allowing for flexibility in the future structure of the industry.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government clearly recognise that there is a balance to be struck. They have had plenty of time since that consultation and, by now, must have some view as to the likely time scale for the operation of the first licence. Will the Minister explain?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not wish to inhibit the flow of sensible debate. That is precisely what we are here for. By the same token, however, interventions must be brief. The hon. Gentleman has been here long enough to know that he will have the opportunity, if he catches my eye, to intervene again later, or to make his own contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me reassure the hon. Member for Bath that the duration of the licence is a matter to which we shall return on later amendments on the clause. At that stage, we can have a full debate. It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I offer a further clarification on the general authority. The licence will be issued by the Secretary of State. It is anticipated that it will last several years. Subsequent licences will be issued by the CAA. Therefore, the general authority will not be needed until later, when the CAA issues subsequent licences. I hope that that is helpful to the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea. I apologise for not being able to offer a more precise response to his earlier intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> With the indulgence of the right hon. Gentleman, I would rather make progress at this stage. There will be plenty of opportunities to return to this matter.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath asked why only the Secretary of State and not the CAA would be able to grant exemptions. The explanation is that the licence, or exemption, will be required by law. Therefore, any rules or conditions attaching to exemptions may be set only via secondary legislation, subject to parliamentary approval. To delegate to the CAA's administrative discretion will be to devalue the effect of statute and create uncertainty. Exemptions, therefore, must be reasonably stable. We can return to that matter.
<P>
Let me answer a further question raised by the hon. Gentleman. He asked about the strategic partner's possible reluctance to take on the airport air traffic control—the 15 per cent. of NATS business to which he referred. The strategic partner will have to take on the NATS contractual commitments and be prepared to fulfil them effectively. Its interest or otherwise in continuing to compete for contestable services, such as airport air traffic control, is up to it. The licence will not cover such services.
<P>
That is all I need to say now in response to the questions raised.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister responded to two questions. I am grateful for his response to the second, but on the first—about the difference between what is in clause 6 in respect of the issuing of the licence and of the exemptions—the hon. Gentleman told the Committee clearly that it was because of the legislative status that the exemptions would be given in law. However, surely the Minister would acknowledge, on the granting of the licence, the CAA can become the licensing authority only with the Secretary of State anyway? I wonder if the Minister could explain what the distinction would be for the exemptions. Clearly, the CAA cannot do that without the agreement of the Secretary of State about licence giving.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That is a specific and detailed question to which, with the hon. Gentleman's agreement, I will aim to respond in due course.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 136 and 137 would remove from the licence authority the discretion to require applicants for a licence to publish their application and to prescribe the way in which such an application is to be published. Once again, I note the intention behind amendment No. 136 to engender greater procedural openness and am happy to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 137, however, is curious. As clause 6 stands, if an application is to be published, it must be published in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations. If the licence authority requires the application to be published, it seems desirable for publication to be done in the most appropriate, open way and that is what clause 6(3)(d) would achieve. The reference there to publication, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the licence authority requires'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is taken from the usual legislative precedent, the Railways Act. Section 8(3)(c) of that Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the Secretary of State so requires''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again we have drawn on an inspiration close to the heart of the hon. Member for North Essex. For clarification, we are accepting the principle of publication as expressed in amendment No. 136, not the precise wording of the amendment. We want to check its compatibility with the clause.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Member for North Essex also mentioned non-publication of the NATS licence. The explanation is that there will be no application for the NATS licence because the licence itself will be subject to extensive consultation—much more so than for any water licence for example—and must be operative when the Bill enters into force. We will be happy to publish further drafts of the licence as we proceed. In the light of those comments and my undertaking on the principle of amendment No. 136, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> First, in a spirit of bonhomie and sympathy with the Minister, I would not want to have to defend the Bill's drafting either, nor would I want to face the sort of cross-questioning that he has just faced. However, these muddles—I say this in a spirit of bonhomie, too—will continue unless the Minister explains this portion of the Bill. I am slightly surprised that we have not yet had such an explanation because he said several times that he would tell us what this part of the Bill is all about as we reached later amendments.
<P>
It seems perfectly logical that an entity in the Bill, which begins at clause 6 and goes on to clause 14, deals with the granting and modification of licences and the possible reference of licence conditions to the Competition Commission. Everyone on the Committee has noted—the Minister himself admitted it, at least by implication—that the Bill's drafting is horrendously difficult. Although the Minister has said repeatedly, ``We will come to that in later clauses'', the selection of amendments causes us to leap around from clause to clause. The next set of amendments, for example, refers to clauses 6, 10, 11 and 12. It is therefore recognised in the selection of amendments that there is a strong connection between the clauses that we are embarked upon.
<P>
So why does the Minister not deal with this part of the Bill by telling us how it will all work? Until he does so we will all be confused, including the Minister. He should be telling us exactly how he believes that these powers will be used, what the Secretary of State will do at the beginning, what the Civil Aviation Authority may do after that, and what the general authority that we have been discussing has to do with it. The whole panoply should be set out for us, including the way in which it all relates to competition issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a powerful point. All the confusion over the drafting of this part of the Bill comes from the double licensing provision—is it the CAA or the Secretary of State? Given that, as we have heard, the general authority may not be used for many years, surely it would be simpler to provide that the Secretary of State should issue the licence to NATS initially, with some other clause covering future eventualities for subsequent licences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I will build on that argument when I speak to the next group of amendments, but my hon. Friend is right. There is an issue about how the Bill is drafted, whether it should be differently—and better—drafted and whether it is necessary for it to look forward to events that lie, probably, 30 years ahead. However, whatever is in the Bill needs to be explained to hon. Members.
<P>
Precisely when a Minister chooses to set out the lie of the land is always a genuine problem for a Standing Committee. In this case, it would have been logical to give an explanation at the beginning of our consideration of this part of the Bill, but the Minister failed to do so. He said that we would come to it under later amendments, but one wonders whether we are always going to come to it piecemeal, discovering bits and pieces of the story by accident. That is not going to give us the full picture or lead to a good debate. Moreover, it is making the Minister hesitant.
<P>
I noticed, for example, that the hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that the licence will last several years. From my reading of it, it appears that it will last for 30. To describe 30 years as several seems extraordinary. The Minister is beginning to worry about these matters because he has not taken the opportunity to explain what it is all about to the Committee. I invite him to do so. I do not think that he is ready now, so I am not saying that he must do so before we conclude the debate, but it is becoming rather urgent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> To pick up on my right hon. Friend's comment, it would be helpful if, when the Minister replies to the next group of amendments, he sets out what will happen when the Secretary of State gets up in the morning and decides to issue a licence. What will he do and in what order, and how is the clause meant to explain that to us? If we knew, we could give him more constructive help to improve the drafting, if possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I reinforce what my hon. Friend said This is a matter of enormous concern to the travelling public. We are not debating some obscure legalistic argument; we are talking about the fears and safety of hundreds of thousands of people who travel by air over the British isles every year. It is important that they know what is happening and what the Government are proposing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes, I can imagine passengers getting on an aircraft thinking, ``I wonder whether the Secretary of State will issue a licence today.''
<P>
We should have a process that people in the industry think is easily understood. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) raised a serious point. Some further explanation is required to assist the Committee in making speedier progress.
<P>
On amendment No. 149, as expected, the Minister the Committee that all these duties are clear—that everything is set out in clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill. We are looking for obligations that the grantor might have towards the licence holder. The Bill does not set those out. The duty of the grantor must be to maintain a service. The licence holder might breach the conditions. Indeed, the nature of these licences is such that there are numerous continuous technical breaches of the licence, which do not matter very much. There may be breaches of the licence that become relevant, but an obligation is implicit in the duties in clauses 1 and 2, which needs to be translated into an obligation to the licence holder, so that it may carry on doing its job. That is a reasonable question and it has not been answered. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman wishes to come back to it later.
<P>
On amendment No. 134 and specified requirements in a general authority, let us be clear that a general explanation in this part of the Bill might be useful. What does a general authority look like, contain, express and empower the CAA to do? Is not that general authority to grant a licence relevant to the CAA's ongoing role as regulator? Therefore, does not it have to be issued fairly early on? If the CAA is to be the regulator, it must have power to take away a licence. If it does not have a general authority to issue the licence, where is its general authority to take it away? It is feasible that the authority to do one goes with the other. I leave aside the foreseeable future because that comes later. We return to there being a significant breach of a licence condition and the CAA wanting to exercise some authority. If it does not have a general authority from the Secretary of State, how is it meant to exercise that regulatory role?
<P>
Perhaps I should move amendment No. 136 formally now.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. Perhaps I had better clarify the position. First, now is not the appropriate moment to move amendment No. 136, if it is moved at all. Secondly, I understood the Minister to have said that he was prepared to accept it. It is up to the hon. Member for North Essex whether he chooses to move it. If he wants to do so, he must indicate that to the Chair at the appropriate time. If he accepts the Minister's reassurance, he will not want to move it at all.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for that clarification Mr. Gale. We have just had a visual indication that the amendment has been accepted in spirit rather than in fact. I shall not, therefore, move it. I am also grateful that the prescribed manner in which the application for the licence shall be published has been clarified. I confess another shortcoming in the drafting of our amendments. Is there a prescribed manner in which the application has to be made?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The prescribed manner is set out in clause 5 and I am assured that we will consider that.
<P>
I understand the drift of the concern expressed by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea, but to some extent he is complaining about procedures in Standing Committee that are well established and conventional. Where amendments are on the amendment paper, the Committee proceeds by responding to the amendments. That was the procedure that you set out at the beginning of this morning's proceedings, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I notice that the Minister is becoming reluctant to give way to me. I do not know why that should be. My understanding of the way in which Chairmen conduct themselves and my knowledge of your character, Mr. Gale, lead me to believe that, if we are entering into a part of the Bill where one clause is pretty closely linked to another, provided that the Minister exercises due discipline he will be unlikely to be ruled out of order if he takes time to explain that the following clauses have a strong thematic link and that together they add up to a story that he wants to make available to the Committee. I am surprised that he should try to use that as a reason for not doing so. There is time for him to put the case together, cancel the lunch at Granita or wherever he is thinking of going today and come along this afternoon and let the Committee have a good explanation. If he is going to a tapas bar, he can have lunch in half an hour, which will give him plenty of time to write it out.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the statement that I made earlier this morning has been prayed in aid, I had better clarify the position firmly for the record. It is entirely a matter for Ministers how they choose to respond to inquiries from hon. Members on either side of the Committee. It is not something in which the Chair can or should properly intervene. I have made it plain to hon. Members that it is my custom as Chairman—it may not be the custom of every Chairman—to permit a clause stand part debate either at the beginning or the end of a clause and the debates on the amendments, but not both. I have taken that view in a number of Committees because the complexity and interlinking of clauses suggests on occasion that it is intelligent to allow a debate at the beginning rather than at the end. Obviously, if one does that and one wants to make progress, one does not do both. It is for the Minister to decide how he wishes to respond to individual amendments and inquiries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale, I assure the Committee that there will be ample opportunity for a broader description of the purposes of the clause as we go on. Before we get to that point, I should like to respond to the question raised by the hon. Member for North Essex on the duties of the CAA and the Secretary of State to the licence holder. In addition to the general duties in clauses 1 and 2, the regulator must act reasonably in examining his functions under chapter 1. If he does not, he will be subject to judicial review by means of which the licence holder can, for example, ask the court to quash the regulator's decisions or require the regulator to account for relevant factors that he may have overlooked. Chapter I also contains a right for a licence holder to challenge an enforcement order made against him.
<P>
I hope that that is a helpful explanation and that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We should move on, but I hope that matters will become clearer as we do so. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 133, in page 4, line 10, leave out paragraph (a).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 142, in page 4, line 40, leave out paragraph (a).
<P>
No. 144, in page 5, line 5, leave out `the Secretary of State or'.
<P>
No. 145, in page 5, line 5, leave out from `CAA' to end of line 6.
<P>
No. 158, in Clause 10, page 6, line 27, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
No. 171, in Clause 11, page 7, line 15, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
No. 172, in Clause 12, page 8, line 31, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I have been entrusted to speak to the amendment by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex and I feel touched and honoured by that compliment. I hope that I do not let him down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Thinking of the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> As the hon. Gentleman can attest, there is no age at which one stops thinking of the future.
<P>
I feel like a man being tossed pieces of a jigsaw, which would be bad enough if I did not feel that the man tossing the pieces could toss me only those that he has already tossed. We accept that, as the Minister said, there will be an opportunity for a broader understanding of the issues that lie between clauses 6 and 14, but I ask him to specify when it will be. It is very well to say that there will be jam tomorrow—an expression that comes easily to a member of the Labour party—but we want to know when that debate will happen. We want the Minister to make the tour of the horizon and we would relish his entering into ``extreme detail''—he promised to do both during the previous debate.
<P>
The drafting, whatever its origin, is curious. Subsections that apply conditions, rules or states of being are followed by subsections that disapply the previous subsections in broad circumstances. The whole thing is rather like dancing a Charleston—two steps forward, two steps back. That is the limit of my understanding of the Charleston—
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford): You never move on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> My career has been notable for not being moved on.
<P>
The explanatory notes treat us to a sort of nouvelle cuisine, full of morsels of explanation, elegantly presented pieces of information that sit in glorious isolation and are thoroughly unsatisfying.
<P>
If there is a lack of clarity in the Bill, our debate, the Minister's explanations and the Government's mind, there are great dangers for the future. I am thinking of amendments Nos. 133, 142, 144 and 145. No one can serve two masters, as that leads to confusion as to where duties and obligations are owed. The probing amendments would remove the Secretary of State from the scene so that the CAA became the only licensing authority.
<P>
If it is unclear whether the ultimate authority is the Secretary of State or the CAA, how will investors know what they are getting into? The hon. Member for Bath made a similar point. How will bids be put together? What reassurance can there be about a regime in which an organisation is able to act with the authority of the Secretary of State or qualify what the Secretary of State does, but in which the Secretary of State can intervene and change what the authority does? That seems extremely curious.
<P>
Even more fundamental is the fact that, although the Committee is pretty much agreed that, in terms of the safety culture, separating the functions of the regulator and the provider of air traffic services is a step forward, we must forget or leave out the fact that an organisation that provides a service that is regulated by someone else must also feel ownership of the safety responsibility.
<P>
If NATS is responsible to the CAA in some respects and to the Secretary of State in others—or, indeed, if it could be responsible to either one in the same respect—we risk considerable confusion about where the final responsibility lies for safety. Buck-passing and a transfer of authority will result. It will be the beginning of laziness. Lines of direction and of responsibility will become unclear.
<P>
From what I have heard of the Minister's explanation, which has been rather partial, it seems that, because the second licence cannot be awarded for another 30 years, such confusion is being entered into to ensure that the Bill can stand in place unamended for that time. That seems to be an extraordinarily heavy price to pay for such a distant eventuality.
<P>
Chapter I deals with how the licence may have to be amended. Why should the licence need to be amended—not least, because technological change cannot be predicted? We recognise that the licence cannot be expected to remain unchanged throughout the transformation in technology that may lie ahead. I cannot imagine why it is assumed that the Bill is likely to stay unamended for 30 years, or why we must go to the trouble and confusion of having a double-headed Bill.
<P>
It also concerns me that the Bill does not seem to allow the devolution of responsibility implicit in what the Government say. The Government's case is that it is okay to privatise NATS, because the Civil Aviation Authority will not be responsible for the provision of air traffic services. They say that separating the regulator from the provider will make for a healthy safety regime and that Conservative Members need not worry too much about safety.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex implied, the Bill does not read as if the Government are devolving authority wholeheartedly to the CAA. It reads instead as if the Secretary of State still wants to keep his sticky fingers in place in all sorts of areas. It has that hesitant quality that ministerial speeches have—the hesitant quality of a Government who are not quite sure whether the devolution of responsibility to the CAA will work or whether, in the end, a lot of reserve powers will need to be kept in the hands of the Secretary of State.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): That being the case, why does amendment No. 133 simply delete subsection (1)(a), which provides for a licence to be granted by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State after consulting the CAA''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and leave in place paragraph (b), which allows a licence to be granted by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the CAA with the consent of the Secretary of State''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is almost the same? Does the right hon. Gentleman not accept that the Secretary of State should have the final say in the granting of a licence, which contradicts what he said? Should not he ask also for the deletion of paragraph (b)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> All I can say is, ``Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya!'' I do not know how Hansard will report that. In view of what the Minister has been saying about how the Bill should be debated, the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Geraint Davies) need not feel too smug or be too critical of our amendments. We clearly do not intend literally to remove the Secretary of State from the Bill. We are provoking a debate and we seek explanations. [Hon. Members: ``Oh!''] It is all very well hon. Members saying ``Oh''. That is how we provoke debates in this House. It is the way in which we seek explanations. Any criticism of our drafting by Labour Members is pretty damn rich, when one considers that the Bill has ensnared not only the Opposition but the Government in its limey stickiness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My right hon. Friend says that we do not seek to remove the Secretary of State's function of issuing of licences, but does he not agree that the Bill would be much cleaner if we did? We originally sought to remove subsection (1), but the Public Bill Office would not allow it. That change would have removed the Secretary of State's right altogether and left the issuing of licences to the CAA in perpetuity. Would that not have been much cleaner?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> My hon. Friend tries to draw me into saying how I would have drafted the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> A lot better—[Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> As my hon. Friend presses me—I would not otherwise have said so—I would have written a set of clauses that described what the Secretary of State would do when granting the initial licence to the CAA. I would have written another set of clauses describing how the CAA would act as the licensing authority for NATS. I would then have made it clear—it is the whole point of chapter I—that the regulator is different from the operator. The Bill, of course, does not do that. It apparently says—I say this only after the little explanation that we have heard so far—that an initial licence will be awarded by the Government to the CAA and that, as the Minister said, the CAA would not issue a second licence for several years. However, the licence implies that it will be 30 years.
<P>
My complaint is that the whole confusion is based on something that it is supposed might happen in 30 years. The Bill contains much unnecessary confusion—suspicions of a lack of confidence in the CAA, of there being two masters, of continuing political interference and particularly of the fact that the Government do not know what they are doing.
<P>
The Minister has at least explained why the licence will be issued to the CAA. For example, condition 3 of the licence says that the CAA can make a reference to the Competition Commission, and condition 15 says that the licensee
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall use best endeavours to second recently experienced and appropriately qualified air traffic controllers to the CAA''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear that the licence is intended to be issued to the CAA, not to any other licensee and that the CAA will not issue it to a subcontractor thereafter. It puzzled me that we were being offered that sort of licence, as it was clearly inappropriate for subsequent licensing.
<P>
The Minister has made it clear that our understanding that a licence would be issued by the Secretary of State to the CAA and that it would then issue a sublicence to the contractor is wrong. The licence will be issued by the Secretary of State to the CAA. That raises the question of how the CAA becomes separated from NATS. At what point does that occur? At what point do the regulator and the operator become separate? I see no mention of that in the Bill or in the licence conditions.
<P>
You said, Mr. Gale, that it would be convenient for the Committee to consider also amendment No. 158. I am happy to abide by your ruling, but it covers a rather different issue. The link between the amendments is that No. 158 would remove another of the Secretary of State's powers, but otherwise it is a long distance from the amendments that I have been discussing so far.
<P>
If the CAA has proposed to the licensee a variation in the licence conditions, which the licensee has explicitly or implicitly accepted, why should the Secretary of State have the right of veto over that variation? There is a thematic link between that matter and what I have been discussing, in that providing that power implies a lack of confidence in how the CAA will use its power. Otherwise, I cannot understand why the Secretary of State should not simply accept that the CAA, to which he has devolved authority, and the licensee are content with the change in condition. He should exercise some restraint, favour non-interference by politicians and small government and not get involved. I cannot envisage circumstances in which the Secretary of State will believe that he must have that power of veto. It will lead to extremely unhelpful confusion.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
On a different issue, amendment No. 171 to clause 11 relates to the Competition Commission. It states that the Secretary of State can oblige the Commission not to proceed with a reference or give effect to a variation and that it must comply with the Secretary of State's directions. Our difficulty is that the explanation of the clauses lacks a description of the canopy of how the Bill will work. We have heard no explanation of how competition policy will sit alongside the licence conditions and their variation. Given that a correlation exists and that the Competition Commission will be involved, an additional point should be made. The introduction of the Competition Commission into the field brings yet another authority into play, in addition to the CAA and the Secretary of State. A third master now seems to be involved, except that clause 11(5) states that the Secretary of State may disregard the Competition Commission's decisions. That power constitutes a fourth source of authority, the four being the CAA, the Secretary of State, the Competition Commission and the Secretary of State's veto. Indeed, I have missed one out along the way—as we have discussed, the Secretary of State may veto proposals agreed between the CAA and the licensee.
<P>
I hope that the Committee is by now thoroughly confused. The matter is thoroughly confusing. I have heard of using a double-barrelled gun to be sure of hitting one's target, but we are dealing with layers of different political and non-political authority lying alongside each other most curiously.
<P>
The explanatory notes on clause 14 explain that the Secretary of State may modify conditions as he considers expedient in exercising powers under the Fair Trading Act 1973. Is that an accurate explanation of the Bill? If so, it raises other issues—whether it is satisfactory for the Secretary of State to act in a way that he regards merely as expedient, whether exercising powers under the Fair Trading Act implies that he can do that only within the realm of competition policy and whether those powers can be used to achieve ends other than those dictated by such policy.
<P>
Amendment No. 172 takes us, with a leap, into yet another clause—12. From subsection (5), we learn that the Secretary of State may instruct the Competition Commission to leave matters out of its reports if he does not think that they are in the public interest or if he believes that they might be contrary to someone's commercial interests. I shall not dwell long or hard on that. I shall say simply that it needs a good deal of explanation. When we make references to independent bodies, we expect to discover what they think. It is all very well to say that matters that are prejudicial to people's commercial interests must not be published, but we also want to know that the decision has been made in a way that recognises those people's commercial interests and that nothing was hidden or could fall under the description of having been subject to undue influence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the particularly worrying part of clause 12 is the expression ``against the public interest''? One could understand that prohibition if something were against commercial interest, but the moment the Secretary of State is given the right not to allow a matter because of public interest, the question becomes the definition of public interest, which surely gives open season to judicial review. We are telling the courts and everyone who cares to that they should challenge the Secretary of State on why he has taken a decision in the so-called public interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I think that my hon. Friend will be aware that, under certain powers, matters will be under investigation—for example, an investigation by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, that will touch on company affairs and even on hon. Members. It is in such areas that there is now the greatest demand for transparency and candour.
<P>
My hon. Friend makes a good point. To give the Secretary of State the power to deem that something will not be published because it is not in the public interest is to give a very broad power. It is a bit like saying that one should use one's common sense, My common sense is different from that of Labour Members, and similarly my view of what is in the public interest may differ from someone else's. It is a rule of human nature that the view of public interest taken by a Government is much more restricted than that taken by the public. The phrase ``against the public interest'' therefore needs a great deal of testing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Can the right hon. Gentleman imagine any circumstances in which it would be in the public interest not to publish something in a Competition Commission report?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I am the bearer of little imagination and for the time being I cannot imagine that. However, I did not draft that part of the Bill—the Minister did and it will be for the Minister to explain what he believes he might want, in the public interest, to stop being published. I am not sure whether I understood the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's intervention, because he is so subtle. Did he mean that that expression was otiose? That is what I imagine he meant and what I feel to be the case—in other words, it sounded as though he supported my amendment. Is that what he meant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that we are entering new areas with the Bill and that the Government have built in certain safeguards, partly because of the unknown terrain into which we are moving? If national security were involved—or whatever—it might be in the public interest for something not to be published. Would it not be better to incorporate some safeguards, which the right hon. Gentleman is moving to delete, into the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> The hon. Gentleman keeps saying that I am moving to delete things—I am moving merely to debate them. The value of our debate has been demonstrated. Many questions have arisen this morning that have not yet been answered. The hon. Gentleman has made a stab at saying what he believes the public interest could be and the Minister may give the same definition in due course. Whenever we ask questions about the Bill, the Government's routine response is to say not that new circumstances have arisen, or that the Bill breaks new ground, but that it is merely the Railways Act rewritten, with ``Railways'' taken out and ``Airways'' stuck in. We are interested to know whether that will happen here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, Central has partly clarified the purpose of his intervention by mentioning security. Of course, we all understand that there may be security reasons for not allowing these modifications. However, the danger in the expression ``not in the public interest'' is that the Secretary of State could reasonably argue that everything he does—from the moment he gets up in the morning to the moment he goes to bed at night—is in the public interest. Indeed, if it is not in the public interest, we want to know why. No matter how capricious the decision, it could be argued that it was in the public interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I agree with the thrust of my hon. Friend's point. Let us focus on what clause 12 is about—references to the Competition Commission. Subsection (5) is about excluding what can be published as a result of a reference. We are not dealing with references to the security services or an investigation by MI5 or MI6, but with investigations by the Competition Commission. The Secretary of State is being given the right to put a blue line through the paragraphs that he considers not to be in the public interest. It is a broad and sweeping power.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, Central is clearly an imaginative chap. Perhaps he could apply his imagination to circumstances in which the Competition Commission could come up with phrases or findings that were against national security. I confess that I am coming to the limit of my imaginative capacity at that point. A great deal of explaining remains to be done. I have not spoken at length, but the Government are a little nearer the lunch break—they may need that period to construct some explanation of what is going on in these clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea was initially modest about his range of abilities. We subsequently encountered recollections from a former Secretary of State and memories of the playground. I shall be interested to see how the Official Report presents the first intervention by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central. I shall also be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on the first series of amendments, particularly regarding the powers of the Secretary of State.
<P>
I wish to focus on amendments Nos. 171 and 172. It is important for the Committee to understand general principles as well as specific points about clauses, especially as the Minister may have been holding back on us this morning. We have not yet received the big picture. When the Minister finally chooses to reveal it in depth and in full technicolour, I hope that he explains why the Secretary of State might order the Civil Aviation Authority not to proceed with a reference to the Competition Commission. The draftsmen have had enough foresight to realise that competition issues might be at stake, so it is important to understand why the Secretary of State can say no. On what grounds can such an intervention take place? We remain unguided on that matter.
<P>
I should like to echo some of the points raised by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea about amendment No. 172. On what grounds might the Competition Commission's report or parts of it—not be published? The whole point of having a transparent process, which will hopefully increase public confidence, is so that we can see the outcomes of any inquiries and understand the grounds on which particular decisions have been taken. The public interest is a notoriously vague term, which Ministers use in many different circumstances. Perhaps we could have some clarification. Opposition Members share the instincts of many others in that we are greatly concerned that the Government are cloaking themselves in this great set of powers with no clarity as to when and how they might be used.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The main thrust of this group of amendments is, why should the Secretary of State have so many wide-ranging powers bestowed on him and why is the Bill not simpler? Here is an opportunity for the Minister to tell the story of how licences will be issued.
<P>
As for the intervention of the hon. Member for Croydon, Central on my right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea about clause 6(1)(b), if the hon. Gentleman had tabled an amendment to that effect, we would have enjoyed discussing it. It was a perfectly reasonable point to make, but it did not add much to our understanding of the Bill.
<P>
On Amendment No. 171, I am genuinely mystified about why we need to complicate the Bill with competition issues. Will the Minister explain why competition needed to be brought into the Bill, particularly as he suggested that there would not be more than one licence holder for the foreseeable future? It might have been simpler to leave that matter aside. It may be included because we were already providing for more than one licence holder, but if so, why does clause 11(5) provide that the Secretary of State can direct the Competition Commission not to proceed with a reference? That suggests that the Government do not really want competition in the Bill. Perhaps it is necessary to include such provisions because there are two licence holders—the fact that there may be more than one licence holder might mean that the Bill falls foul of competition legislation. Why not set aside that competition legislation? I am left wondering whether there is some external—perhaps European competition obligation. Will the Minister explain how European—competition arrangements will apply to this part of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> My hon. Friend makes the Bill sound a great deal simpler than it is The plot thickens, because clauses 75 to 77 give the CAA, as economic regulator, concurrent powers with the Director-General of Fair Trading under competition legislation over the supply of air traffic services. These powers are said to be consistent with those of the utility regulators. Thus, it is not just that competition is in the Bill; it is dragged into the Bill in two completely different places. Again, I hope to hear from the Minister why he has decided to proceed in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We may have to have an extensive debate on competition later. The amendments were grouped together because of the relationship between these provisions and the Secretary of State. What is the point of having competition in the Bill if the Secretary of State can just set it aside? He can direct, he can veto, and he can then direct what the Competition Commission can do. That is an extraordinarily complicated way of going about things. I have here the Utilities Bill, which I have not yet read. It is obvious that its provisions will overlap this Bill's—along with the Fair Trading Act 1973, the Competition Act 1998, and so on. It is extraordinarily complicated to issue a single licence to a single operator to operate air traffic control services. We require further explanation.
<P>
On amendment No. 172, examples are not what we want. The ``public interest'' is an indefinite and wide interpretation. It is a catch-all for information that may be commercially sensitive. Commercially sensitive matters, or ones relating to safety and national security, could have been specified. The term ``public interest'' seems to be a retreat to the type of secrecy in government of which this Government say they are not in favour. That raises the question of how this part of the Bill interacts with the Freedom of Information Bill, which sets out different classes of information?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> This is a filibuster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No, it is not a filibuster, but a genuine question. I know that freedom of information is close to the hon. Gentleman's heart. Which classes of information will we be dealing with and what should be exempt? Why is that not dealt with in the same way as in the Freedom of Information Bill? There is no consistency.

<P>

<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I am rather stunned by the Minister's accusation of filibustering. Would my hon. Friend care to speculate on the time that might have been saved if Ministers had explained what the clauses were about, instead of making us winkle it out piece by piece, amendment by amendment, note by note across the Committee? How much faster progress could we have made if everything had been set out for us at the start?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Indeed; how much faster progress we could have made if the explanatory memorandum had not been such a—[Interruption.] It is an attempt to precis the Bill in the simplest possible terms, but it does not deal with many of the complexities in the Bill
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, Central said that we are in unknown territory and that we need additional safeguards. Non-disclosure, because of public interest, can so often turn into a convenient retreat for Ministers. Civil servants would argue that disclosure would not be in the public interest, and Ministers would say, ``Oh, really. I think that is very good advice.'' That would cover up all embarrassment. I do not impune the Ministers in Committee; they have never been anything but open with me on all matters, for which I am grateful.
<P>
It jars that ``public interest'' is the stark catch-all that Ministers seem to use to protect whatever might turn out to be inconvenient in the future. This process should be simple and open. If there is no openness, confidence in the safety of the system will evaporate, leading to a less safe system. Why not have more openness and more specificity about what might have to be retained secretly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I have a few passing comments to make The Bill is about evolution, in that the Secretary of State has control over the new system. There is a great deal of public interest involved, in terms not just of competition, but of quality, safety and security The Secretary of State should have a clear and central role in licensing, which, in time, will devolve to the Civil Aviation Authority. It is not the case that the Secretary of State will issue a licence to the CAA, which will issue a licence to the new National Air Traffic Services. A licence will be issued to the new NATS either by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the CAA, or by the CAA, after taking advice, and authority from the Secretary of State. That is clear.
<P>
I do not mean to give a big yah-boo, or to pick holes in amendments Nos. 133 and 142, but we need to be clear about where we are coming from. The amendments would strip the power of the Secretary of State to act in the public interest. I know that there are concerns that anything could be said to be in the public interest, and legitimate points are being made in the probing amendments. Safeguards have been built into an area of great public concern to ensure that there is a backstop, allowing the Secretary of State to intervene, Over time, the CAA will take on that regulatory role and the Secretary of State can take a back seat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have three brief points to make about that argument. First, we have a good independent regulator. Secondly, the powers are not specified as back stop or temporary powers. Thirdly, there is no withering of such powers. They are not simply there for the introduction of the Bill, but are existing wide-ranging powers. I should prefer to trust to the proven and experienced CAA, which has an unrivalled track record in civil aviation safety regulation. That is the thrust of the matter. Why is the Bill not more simply cast in that direction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As I said, we are moving into a new area and our considerations are not simply competition. They include other matters that were mentioned by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea, such as safety, quality, price, and so on. It is not possible to map out every scenario about who might own 49 per cent. of NATS down the line. Clearly, there are matters that might be in the public interest.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea asked about the tight parameters of the Competition Commission and where the public interest comes in. The flexibility in the drafting enables various forms of corporate governance to be put forward as part of the bidding process. Hon. Members will know that the Airline Group is trying to put together a bid on the basis of non-commercial return. It might argue, because it has a vested interest in safety, that it could add value. Hon. Members may not agree, but those are some of the complex issues that will emerge. Given that there is some uncertainty about the scenarios that may emerge and the impact on public interest, we wonder whether we should cut off opportunities at this early stage. The Bill builds in various safeguards and we expect the Secretary of State to take a lead role in the issuing of licences. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I associate myself with the comments made by my right hon. and hon. Friends about the failure of the Minister to give us a proper introduction to the Bill. We are handicapped and we have to take pot shots, in the hope that we can hit something and discover what is in the Minister's mind. The explanation of the hon. Member for Croydon, Central that because we are moving into an unknown territory, the Bill must cover all eventualities is wrong. I do not think that Parliament can gaze so far into the future at this stage. The correct thing would have been a far more simple Bill, and if modifications were to be made later, in the usual tradition of Parliament, another Bill could have been introduced in the fullness of time The Bill appears almost to be trying to legislate for Martians arriving in spaceships in the air traffic control area of Prestwick. It is nonsensical to look forward to something like that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree, though, that the hon. Member for Croydon, Central spoke simply, coherently and to the point? I got the sensation that he might understand the Bill, which is not something that I have felt about other Government Members. 
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. The same thought puzzled me. I was not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was guessing, or was just informed on the subject. My suspicion is that Labour members of the Committee are equally ill-informed about the Bill as Opposition members and that they have not been let into the secret of the Government's proposals.
<P>
I should like the Minister to deal with two points. Is one of the reasons why the Secretary of State holds on to all these powers some fear that, say, the European Union will move in to take care of traffic control and want a European body? [Interruption.] I am not known as a Euro-sceptic. If the EU gets its way with controlling air traffic space, it might not be in the interests of the Competition Commission to say that that was necessarily in the interests of the British public, but the Minister may wish to overrule that because of other agendas in Europe. Is that an area in which the Secretary of State may want to retain powers?
<P>
What effect does the Minister think that all the restrictions—the Secretary of State's residual powers, and the ability to intervene and to overrule the Competition Commission—will have on potential investors in the service? My guess is that putting large sums of corporate money into this sort of thing would not be attractive if one was unable to envisage precisely the impact that the Secretary of State would have. Investments could be prejudiced by a decision of the Secretary of State effectively taken arbitrarily under powers in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will deal with those two points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> My right hon. and hon. Friends have drawn out an important point. As the Bill is worded, it is very much an either/or Bill. There is either the Secretary of State, or the CAA. Throughout, everything seems to be duplicated. If the regime is to be purely that the Secretary of State is given the first licence, and the CAA, based on its record, is the economic regulator for the National Air Traffic Service, I cannot understand why the Bill is so worded. My right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea is right to say that that is a little confusing. The Bill does give the Secretary of State residual powers. As we know, when that happens, Secretaries of State, even if they did not intend to do so, end up using the powers one day and start interfering in the way in which a NATS licensee is regulated. Our general concern is that we are giving the Secretary of State many powers to intervene at a future time in the economic regulation of NATS.
<P>
It is important to create a robust regime if we want to give the public confidence. The wording of the Bill does not make that completely clear; it is confused, with a good many either/ors. Ministers need to make more of a statement of confidence in the CAA as the main authority. A few people have begun to say that a licence will be given and that eventually the CAA will do this or that. What I think we need is timetables. After the Secretary of State grants the first licence, at what point does that body become the economic regulator? Will it be the day after, or a month or six months after? We need a timetable from the Government to show how they see events marching. That would allow us to understand better the nature of the Bill. At present, it is likely to cause more confusion and more hours of wasted debate. Most of us have better things to do, even though we wish to scrutinise the Government. We would like nothing than more than a better-worded Bill that is clearer to the House and the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Before I turn to the amendments, and lunch, it may help the Committee if, as promised, I begin to paint the bigger picture about the licensing arrangements—[HON. MEMBERS: ``In extreme detail.''] Extreme detail will follow. I want to begin paint the bigger picture with a description of the licensing process.
<P>
When the Bill comes into effect, a licence will be needed for NATS to continue to provide its en route services. The Secretary of State will issue the licence, which is being developed in consultation with the CAA and NATS, and more widely. It will last a considerable time. As with other regulatory licences, the precise length is a matter of fine judgment. The 30-year minimum in the draft that is before the Committee is a benchmark; a firm figure has not been settled.
<P>
However, although United Kingdom and oceanic airspace will be licensed to NATS, other airspace may fall to be licensed to the UK authorities. Subject to international agreements, the CAA will do that under a general authority—of which we have spoken—not at present but conceivably within the lifetime of the licence to NATS. That general authority will be the subject of consultation at the relevant time, and will be published. It will probably specify what conditions must be included in licences—to safeguard key aspects of service provision, for example, and for any matters on which the CAA should consult the Secretary of State before issuing a licence—for the proper co-ordination of public policy. These are only examples; the authority will have to reflect the circumstances at the time. The initial NATS licence will be agreed with the CAA, as described. I hope that that helps the Committee so that I am permitted to move on.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> To pick up the Under-Secretary on one query, he said that, in future, other airspace areas may be subject to a licence if they are not part of existing oceanic or Eurocontrol. Is he saying that we might be licensing areas outside the current United Kingdom airspace, and, if so, will he give an example? I am mystified as to what that means unless, of course, he intends to split up existing airspace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It is a good question, to which I think that I have the answer. The hon. Gentleman may remember that on Second Reading I described the potential for the expansion of NATS, which, of course, is critical to our approach to the public-private partnership. It is certainly conceivable that there will be airspace beyond the European and Atlantic contexts in which licences may fall to be offered at some stage. I have painted a picture of the possibility of technology permitting control of air traffic movements on the other side of the world. We have to understand this proviso in that context.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My understanding is that, if, say, another sovereign state on the other side of the world invited NATS to provide air traffic control services, they would be licensed under their own domestic regime. Surely they would not depend on regulation by another sovereign state half way round the world. That is unrealistic, unless, of course, the hon. Gentleman envisages our being under some superior licensing arrangement envisaged by the European Commission. I should be grateful for further explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It might help the Committee if I clarify that by saying that we would license airspace agreed for United Kingdom control under international agreements, but—although my imagination winged across the world and I think that there is an exciting future for NATS under the public-private partnership—not for foreign areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> International airspace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> International airspace. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I understand that NATS looks after air traffic control for the Republic of Ireland. How would that agreement be affected? Would the CAA or the Irish Government regulate those services?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My understanding is that that is the subject of joint agreements and will continue to be. The question is perfectly reasonable, and I will seek to offer the hon. Gentleman a precise explanation of that in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I think that the Minister, to paraphrase his response to an earlier intervention, said that the expansion of NATS was critical to our public-private partnership. The implication is therefore that, without further expansion, he has grave concerns about the economic viability of the Government's proposal. Will he confirm whether he meant to say that expansion is critical?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No. My intention, which I certainly made clear on Second Reading, is that the PPP will offer an injection of not only private capital, but entrepreneurial skills that will enable NATS to take advantage of the expected opportunities for expansion in air control. We have spoken about the context of the consolidation of air traffic control on several occasions.
<P>
I shall deal with the amendments in extreme detail. The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea spoke to several amendments that appeared to be designed to remove the Secretary of State's ability to grant an operating licence in respect of the provision of air traffic services. So far as I am aware, all previous utility legislation has given the Secretary of State and the sector regulator powers to grant licences, and in all cases the Secretary of State has granted the first licence. I ask myself why the right hon. Gentleman feels that it would be undesirable to follow precedent in this case.
<P>
Let me explain in more detail why it is important that the Secretary of State grants the first licence in this case. The right hon. Gentleman may be reassured if I briefly set out the Government's intentions. We propose that the Secretary of State will grant the initial licence and only the initial licence, with the CAA granting any subsequent licences. It is important that the granting of the initial licence should reside with the Secretary of State, because the initial licence, its duration and the initial charge control exert considerable influence on the sale price, for which the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament. That is consistent with all precedents.
<P>
Only certain air traffic services are intended to be licensed—generally those enjoying a monopoly position in the marketplace, the en route services. The Committee will see from the terms of the draft licence that we are thinking in terms of an initial licence period of round 30 years. In addition, it is likely that there will be an initial period of exclusivity granted to the initial licence holder, NATS, during which no further licences will be issued. We are considering options, but a period of exclusivity is far from unprecedented, and we are thinking in terms of up to 20 years. The Committee will notice that that is the earliest notice period proposed under the licence.
<P>
It is clear from what I have said that we do not anticipate that the CAA will grant licences very often. The Secretary of State will grant only one, the first, which he will copy to the CAA as regulator. I hope that the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea is reassured that, once the initial licence has been granted, the Secretary of State will have no further role as the licensing authority. I hope that on that basis he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This is a simple point. The initial licence will be granted without the establishment of a new regulator—unlike for water, rail and all other privatised industries. Instead, the Bill establishes a licensing regime under a well established regulator, who is entirely capable of granting the licence. Much of what the Under-Secretary is saying is irrelevant. Why should that experienced and established regulator not grant the first licence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not follow me. I thought that I offered a singularly cogent reason why it was the Secretary of State's responsibility to grant the licence, and I do not retract from that proposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> One of the reasons that the Under-Secretary gave was that the Secretary of State may need to adjust charge controlling—by which the Under-Secretary means charges to the airlines that fly through our airspace—in order to sell the licence. Is the Under-Secretary seriously suggesting that charges might be ramped up slightly in order to inflate the price? What does he mean? Surely the business should be sold as a going concern on the basis of existing charges that reflect market conditions, and should not be subject to manipulation by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It is a question not of manipulation but of accountability. As a member of a responsible Opposition, the hon. Gentleman should take the Secretary of State's accountability to Parliament on the sale price extremely seriously.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 158, 171 and 172 would remove the Secretary of State from the licence modification process. I agree that, since the Government will retain a sizeable shareholding in NATS, it is desirable that the Secretary of State's quasi-regulatory activities should be kept to the irreducible minimum. However, the amendments go too far. The Government do not anticipate using these powers except in exceptional circumstances, but the provision is important as part of a range of checks and balances built into the licence modification procedure. The Secretary of State's power to veto a proposed modification is a long-stop safeguard against the possibility that the regulator and the licensee might agree a modification that went against the public interest in the provision of relevant services.
<P>
Amendment No. 171 would remove the Secretary of State's ability to veto the making of a reference. Although that power is well precedented in utility regulation, to which I shall return in due course, the hon. Member for North Essex is seeking its removal. I assure him that the power will be used only rarely, but it is important, because it is intended to cover the unlikely but not impossible circumstances in which the regulator contemplates asking the Competition Commission to make a public interest finding in an area that also engages the Secretary of State's wider public interest. An example may help.
<P>
The current draft of the licence includes the provision of advisory services to helicopters in the North sea—a key national resource. At some time in future, the CAA might try to remove that activity from the licence on the ground that an alternative provider has emerged and provision of the service is therefore contestable. Let us suppose, however, that the Secretary of State took a more cautious view of the prospects for competition, and thought that the time was not yet right to rely entirely on it. It would not be in the public interest for the provision of those services to be jeopardised, nor might it be in the public interest for them to be provided by an unregulated monopoly supplier. That would certainly happen if this activity were removed from NATS' licence on the assumption that there was competition, but that competition did not materialise. Under those circumstances, the Secretary of State might well feel that to proceed with the proposed reference would not be in the public interest. That is why clause 11(5) is in the Bill and why the Government believe that it should stay there.
<P>
Amendment No. 172 would prevent the Secretary of State from directing that material be excised from a report by the Competition Commission. The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea asked about precedents. In fact, precedents are to be found in all the sectoral regulation statutes—the Telecommunications Act 1984, the Water Act 1989, the Electricity Act 1989, our old friend the Railways Act 1993 and the Fair Trading Act 1973. They will all be familiar to the right hon. Gentleman and they ought to afford some reassurance to the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), who was worried about the appearance of these provisions in the Bill. They were not included in the preceding Acts because they were a potential deterrent to investors, but we have no reason to believe that they will be a deterrent in this case.
<P>
Perhaps an explanation of why the Competition Commission is involved in these arrangements will help to allay hon. Members' concerns. There is scope for competition to take place in segments of the market. The airport air traffic control market is already competitive. The Competition Commission's role in licence modification is not confined to competition. It will exercise a broad public interest judgment as its predecessor body, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, did for many years.
<P>
When the Competition Commission undertakes an inquiry, it can require any information that it believes is necessary to assist in its deliberations, irrespective of whether that information may be sensitive. The commission makes its report to the sector regulator, who sends it to the Secretary of State. He or she then gives parties who are affected by the report, which the Committee will note is still unpublished, an opportunity to request that parts of it be deleted for reasons of confidentiality. That can be, and for the most part is, driven by commercial considerations but issues of national security can also arise.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Smith </B>(Vale of Glamorgan): I am delighted to hear those remarks because Cardiff international airport—Wales' premier airport—is in my constituency. It lies within a five-mile radius of the largest Royal Air Force support base in the United Kingdom, which has a large number of air traffic movements. There is much co-operation—in fact, I think that approach routes up to five miles from the RAF base are dealt with by Cardiff airport's very modern air traffic control system. It is precisely such arrangements that could inadvertently be revealed by such reports. We would want some sort of control over that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes a powerful point as well as slipping in an effective advert for his local airport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I was going to ask the Minister whether he could give an example of an issue of national security that might be revealed in a Competition Commission report that the Minister would not then want to publish. Before I could do so his hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) gave an example with which the Minister apparently agreed. Is the Minister really saying that a Competition Commission report might reveal that there is joint handling of air traffic at Cardiff airport between the military controllers and civilian controllers which is already publicly known because we are debating it here and that that is the basis of wanting this power? The Minister appeared to imply that he was accepting his hon. Friend's example as a good one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> In some respects I have to say that I ought to defer to the right hon. Gentleman on this matter. He was, after all, Secretary of State for Defence and ought to know very well that it is by no means inconceivable that the sort of analysis that the Competition Commission carries out could involve serious issues of national security and that it would be inappropriate for those to be put on the public record. In that context I again ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> The debate has been quite successful in that it has changed the Minister's approach to the Committee. In two passages he was relatively helpful. He set out, although not in ``extreme detail'', the way in which the licensing regime would work. Subsequently, he remarked on the interrelation between the varying of the licensing conditions and competition policy. I should like to thank him for that. I would like to thank him in the best way possible, which is to say that when he behaves in that way, the Committee will make better progress and there will be a better spirit We will all know what we are talking about and we will be able to debate these matters pithily but consistently with achieving public interest, which means a full discussion of what the Government intend to do.
<P>
I have one tiny point to make to the Minister. It would be helpful if he listened to our arguments rather than to the arguments that have been inferred from the amendment paper. I never argued that the initial licence should not be granted by the Secretary of State, but rather that the Bill was clumsily drafted because his was the only licence in which we would be interested and that the other licences lay many years down the road. That was the basis of my argument. Neither did I ask the Minister for a series of precedents on the issue of public interest although I well understand why he would want to quote them.
<P>
A couple of matters remained relatively obscure. I think I understood them and I would like the hon. Gentleman's confirmation. Other licences could be issued to areas that are not en-route areas within the 30-year period—even if it turns out to be a different period when the Government have given full consideration to what the licence duration should be. When we pressed the hon. Gentleman on that matter I think we understood that these were likely to be international areas. I should like to have an example from him. I think that he is thinking about the mid-Atlantic airspace. As there was a little confusion during that part of his speech, I should like him to confirm that within the period of the licence that will be issued by the Secretary of State to the CAA, another licence might be issued. An example is an international area and an example of such an area is the mid-Atlantic. The Minister said that only en-route services would be licensed. That being the case I think I understood correctly that other services that might be provided, such as air traffic control at an airport, are not the subject of a licence but rather the subject of an exemption. Piece by piece, we are all beginning to understand this matter better.
<P>
Another thing that the Minister said that was not quite accurate was that once the Secretary of State has issued his licence he plays no further role as licensor. We then went on to discuss our amendment, which sought to leave out the Secretary of State's right of veto over a variation of conditions that had been agreed between the CAA and the licensee. Self-evidently, if the Secretary of State is still vetoing, he has not been excluded from the licensing process. It is an on-going responsibility. The Minister needs to choose his words carefully. I shall check with Hansard, but I think that he said that once the Secretary of State had issued a licence he would play no further role as licensor. The Minister then said that a number of the powers that we were seeking to amend were there for use in extremis and as long-stop safeguards.
<P>
