<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/036/1999036.htm">Employment Relations Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce (South Dorset):</B> On a point of order, Mrs.
Dunwoody. I do not know whether you can do anything about it, but
on Second Reading at column 180 on 9 February 1999, I playfully
suggested that the Whips were listening carefully to the speeches
of Labour Back Benchers to decide whether they were suitable to
be selected as members of the Standing Committee, given that some
of them were in dispute with the line taken by the Government.
The Minister suggested&#151;also playfully, I thought&#151;that
a blacklist might be in preparation.
<P>
I have checked the list of members of the Committee, and not
one of the Labour Members whom I commented on, who were less than
loyal to the Government's line, have been selected. Only four of
the people who spoke later in the debate were selected, none of
whom had referred to the number of people who would be allowed
a ballot under the Bill. I do not know whether you can do
anything, Mrs. Dunwoody, but at least I have been able to put it
on the record that the Government seem to be afraid of allowing
their colleagues a proper discussion of the Bill. I hope that in
the fullness of time we shall find out whether the Government
will fully debate the contentious clauses.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am very grateful for that interesting point
of order. During my 30 years in the House of Commons, I have
frequently been astonished at the inability of the Whips on both
sides of the House to realise the innate brilliance of those of
us who from time to time raise our voices. It comes as no
surprise to me that the arcane processes of the two Front Bench
teams are confusing, and I am happy to say that the selection of
members of the Committee is nothing to do with the Chair.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</b> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Employment Relations Bill,
the Committee do meet, with effect from Tuesday 23 February, on
Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock and
on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock, except that the Committee
shall not meet on Thursday 11 March.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
May I say, on behalf of the Committee, how pleased we are to
be once again under your control, Mrs. Dunwoody, to debate an
important Bill. In hindsight, it is true to say that I enjoyed
the sittings on the National Minimum Wage Bill under your
chairmanship, and I hope that members of the Committee will be
disciplined enough to ensure that we do not have all-night
sittings and that we can deal with the Bill in a more appropriate
fashion.
<P>
However, having listened to the point of order of the hon.
Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce), I am now pleased that there
are more Conservative Members present than turned up to support
him on Second Reading. We have the army, but where is the
general, the man who said that he would take the Government apart
on employment relations? Obviously, the right hon. Member for
Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) has decided to walk away from the fray
and leave it in the capable hands of the hon. Member for Daventry
(Mr. Boswell). The hon. Gentleman will feel lonely occasionally,
knowing that his general is miles behind the front line enjoying
the life of Riley, while he is trying to paper over the cracks
because his colleagues are unable even to raise a titter or do
anything in relation to the Bill.
<P>
The sittings motion sets out the times and dates for our
discussions. I propose that, with effect from 23 February, we
meet on Tuesdays at 10.30 am and 4.30 pm and on Thursdays at 2.30
pm&#151;except Thursday 11 March, which I understand is not
convenient for some members of the Committee. I hope that hon.
Members will find those arrangements satisfactory, and that they
will contribute to an orderly, successful and detailed scrutiny
of the Bill. The latter comment is made for the benefit of the
hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), who is, I know, looking
for a successful outcome of the Committee's scrutiny.
<P>
I am pleased to say that there will be some co-operation
between the Front-Bench teams. I take the view that the
Opposition should maximise their opportunity to scrutinise the
Bill. In my role as Minister, I want to be as helpful as I can
in giving the Committee information and clarification, just as
I did when we considered the National Minimum Wage Bill. I have
an important piece of legislation and an important set of
principles to get through the House, to which we are committed,
but I shall ensure that anything significant that might improve
the Bill will be given adequate and appropriate consideration.
It is important to take a positive view about the relationship
between Front Benches.
<P>
The Bill will have a positive effect upon the everyday
working lives of millions of people. It is important, especially
with complicated legislation, that the Committee should be given
clear explanations; I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will
find the explanatory notes helpful. The explanatory notes, which
replace the more familiar explanatory memorandum and notes on
clauses, are an innovation. They are intended to be more helpful
and user-friendly. I have to confess that my officials and I are
still wary of the new format, and we would welcome any positive
suggestions for their improvement. The document is intended to
inform and clarify, so that hon. Members&#151;Government or
Opposition&#151;are able to spend their time in Committee
positively and effectively.
<P>
I look forward to a lively and constructive debate this
morning. I am sure, however, that I shall at some stage have to
return to the battlefield, to answer comments from both sides of
the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> May I welcome you, Mrs. Dunwoody,
and your co-Chairman, Mr. Peter Atkinson, to the Chair of this
Committee. As the Minister of State said, we very much enjoyed
your presiding over the Committee when we considered the National
Minimum Wage Bill. That was a long and difficult Bill, but you
chaired the Committee with great humour and panache.
<P>
It is nice to have what the Scots would call the old firm
back in place. The Government are again represented by the
Minister of State, though he has a new lieutenant, the Minister
for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, whom we welcome. We even
have the same Clerk. I also see one or two familiar faces on both
sides of the Committee. I shall not dilate on the matter now, but
it is nice at a time of rapid constitutional change to have a few
points of fixity&#151;one reason why I am a Conservative.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> It is certainly a great
pleasure, Mrs. Dunwoody, to serve for a second time under the
leadership of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr.
Boswell). It is also a pleasure to joust again with the Minister
of State, Department of Trade and Industry. Will my hon. Friend
confirm that if the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry had
been prepared to serve on the Committee, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Wokingham would have been delighted to duff him up as
effectively in Committee as he did on Second Reading?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention.
My hon. Friend is a welcome and worthy member of the Committee,
because he has a moderating influence on me. He brings me to a
point that I wanted to make.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham has many
commitments, but if the Secretary of State had been disposed to
attend the Committee, my right hon. Friend would have thought it
appropriate to attend. However, he is spending his time extremely
constructively; for instance, he is attempting to point the
Government in the right direction on genetic engineering&#151;a
direction that they seem ill-disposed to take. I shall pass on
that, but should like to mention a couple of other points.
<P>
We are grateful for the Minister's explanatory notes. I have
felt, and, I think, have said, and readily say now, that his
Department produces extremely helpful and rather fuller
explanations than many Departments. That suggests that it is
addressing the issues that the Bill raises, which we are glad
about. Although it was the subject of some flippancy on Second
Reading, I am especially pleased that he has published, as I
suggested to him in private correspondence, some decision trees
to aid the process of working out what will happen in relation
to trade union recognition, for example. That is a good way of
legislating and providing explanatory material.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset seems to have some
doubt about the loyalty of Labour members of the Committee. I,
however, have absolutely no doubt that, once we have presented
our arguments with, I hope, our typical force and cogency, they
too will begin to have their doots about what is going on.
<P>
This is an important Bill, or, rather, Bills within a Bill,
and it is important to set it in context. It is, effectively,
three major bills wrapped up into one. One Bill deals with
statutory trade union recognition; one extends employee rights
and remedies; and one introduces new policies under the parental
leave directive.
<P>
Although we can piece our way through the Bill and may have
occasion to ask questions about it from time to time, it is,
perhaps, a pity that the Bills have a rather different status.
Some of them, like the national minimum wage legislation, are
entirely discretionary policies of Her Majesty's Government, and
are what I might refer to in shorthand as domestic legislation,
although the whole Bill is domestic legislation in that it is
being considered by Parliament. However, they are matters on
which the Government have simply taken a decision, such as trade
union recognition.
<P>
Obligations arise from the parental leave directive, which
cut in because this Government have decided, in a reversal of the
policy of their predecessor, to introduce the European social
chapter. That has implications, because we are legally obliged
to fulfil directives. In the case of some directives being
implemented into domestic legislation, the Government may
introduce on their own accout an element of gold-plating, going
beyond the strict requirements of the European obligation.
Although they are different, and at various stages in Committee
we shall want to draw out those points, each of the three
developments&#151;the domestic-only legislation, the European
obligation and the possible gold-plating of a European
obligation&#151;have their root in decisions that the present
Government made. Had a change of Government not taken place in
1997, none of those measures need have been implemented. None of
the costs need have been imposed on business. Perhaps that would
have been far better, but that is a matter for the substance of
the debate.
<P>
Although previous legislation is not under consideration in
this Committee, except by implication, some evidence suggests
that things are not going quite so well as the Government
intended. I and several of my hon. Friends said on Second Reading
that we were worried not only about what was said&#151;the
slogans and pledges that the Government had introduced&#151;but
about the perhaps genuinely unintended consequences for business
of what had already been put in place. For example, as the
Minister will perhaps confirm, the minimum wage regulations will
not come into being until later, when we shall consider them in
another context. However, it is already clear that au pairs, for
example, present a problem in relation to the national minimum
wage. Certainly, that needs to be clarified, and I await the
Minister of State's clarification. There is a problem under the
working time directive, which is not a social chapter&#151;

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are debating the sittings motion for
this Committee.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, I am well aware of that, Mrs. Dunwoody.
I say only that it is important to read the small print of all
employment measures. Newspaper boys present a problem, which must
be resolved. The application&#151;ensemble and
cumulatively&#151;of all those measures to business presents a
more general problem. Are employers&#151;small ones as well as
large&#151;in the dark about what is going on? Have they either
the administrative infrastructure or the inclination to keep the
necessary records and, indeed, to comply with the legislation?
If they have, will they do so cheerfully and willingly or
grudgingly as though under an obligation?
<P>
All members of the Committee will be concerned by a report,
which was published in one of the Sunday newspapers, produced by
the reputable legal services partnership&#151;Peninsula Business
Services. The newspaper commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Labour has failed us, say businessman.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> When asked, `Do you feel that this Government is
business-friendly and considers the position of employers?', 80
per cent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of that substantial sample of, I think 3,000&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``said no. An even greater number . . . said that they would
think twice about setting up in business''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in the current circumstances. That should be a matter of
concern to all members of the Committee.
<P>
A wider and more subtle implication, other than the immediate
response of business to what it might think of as another load
of bumf, is that, however good the Government's
intentions&#151;of course, we accept the Minister of State's
integrity and his enthusiasm to discuss them in
Committee&#151;policies that raise the cost of employment are
likely to backfire by creating more unemployment.
<P>
We might return to such matters in substantive debates, but
I draw the Committee's attention to the interesting economic
brief in The Economist of 6 February, which referred to the work
of Messrs. Di Tella and MacCulloch in econometrics. I got about
as far as regression analyses before getting slightly out of my
class. That serious piece of academic work concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Flexibility, it appears, increases participation in the
labour force as well as the number of people in work:
unemployment will fall only if the rise in participation is less
than the rise in the number at work. A straightforward regression
finds that flexibility does in fact reduce unemployment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That interesting thought was confirmed by another article in
one of this Sunday's papers, which dealt with the experience in
Germany, where typically what is occasionally called the European
social contract or the European social agenda is fully in play.
The aricle in The Sunday Times refers to Mr. Dussmann, who is a
successful bookseller in Berlin&#151;a city with high
unemployment. He fought a protracted court battle with the trade
unions, which said that his plans to stay open&#151;that is, to
serve customers&#151;until 10 pm broke local labour laws. He
finally won the case after 18 months, but he did so by
reclassifying all his 100 employees as senior management. Mr.
Dussman states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is the typical German disease. Complications, too much
detail and too much bureaucratic control.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are anxious that the German disease does not become the
British disease or prevail here.
<P>
As always, we shall approach the detailed consideration of
the Bill in a constructive spirit. I hope that we can dispose of
one Aunt Sally from the start. Opposition Members have no
intention of approaching the Bill in the spirit of union bashing.
The Minister of State will know that I have much experience in
the voluntary sector.
<P>
He may not know, although he may be interested to do so, that
I spent my formative years on a co-operative or co-partnership
farming venture, which happened to be managed&#151;with
considerable success&#151;by my late father.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> A collective farm.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend, perhaps unhelpfully, says that
it was a collective farm. Not quite. It was in the UK&#151;in
Essex, to make a further disclosure. I was an Essex man.
<P>
I and my hon. Friends&#151;and I hope all members of the
Committee&#151;share a keen sense of the desirability of good
employee conditions and the vital importance that employees and
their bosses work together co-operatively, in whatever legal form
that may take. However, not everything in the co-partnership
world is automatically sweetness and light, even when intentions
are good. True partnership must be based on the free association
of people, in a climate without fear or coercion. That generally
means that partnership is not enforced purely because the law
says that it must be.
<P>
I have also run my own small business and, as the hon. Member
for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) said eloquently on Second
Reading&#151;I did not interrupt him because of the time
limitations on that debate&#151;small businesses have a huge
contribution to make in terms of dynamism and the creation of
employment. However, we all realise that matters that are
straightforward for a large, perhaps multinational, company with
a human resources department and experts, or for a trade union
that deals regionally or nationally with companies that have such
facilities, are not so simple for a small business. I do not want
to be trapped into saying that that means that all large
businesses are nice to their employees and always get it right:
of course that is not the case. We must debate the matter.
However, it is more difficult for the individual entrepreneur,
well intentioned as I believe most of them to be, simply to keep
up with the legal requirements. The Sunday Times article that I
quoted also said&#151;I hope that it was a piece of journalistic
licence:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Many businessmen are already planning to flout the
minimum wage legislation when it comes into force in April. More
than a third of those surveyed said that they planned to break
the law''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that they will not do that, but it is not always easy,
however hard one tries, to keep within the red tape.
<P>
There is a danger in the way in which the Bill is
structured&#151;though not, it now seems, in the way it is to
be debated&#151;that over-concentration on the procedures on
trade union recognition and numbers might lead us to overlook the
fact that many new costs and burdens will fall on all employers,
from those who have one employee&#151;myself, for
example&#151;upwards. A Government do not always realise it, but
a small business may be under commercial or administrative
pressure and the easiest course of action may be for it not to
employ anyone; indeed, it may have no option but to employ no
one. Ministers can declare all the family-friendly policies they
like, but none of them are of benefit to someone who does not
have a job. That is the essential perception that we bring to the
debate.
<P>
It is important to realise that the effect is not necessarily
that of a simple knock-down. We should not visualise a scenario
of a loud-mouthed employer going into a saloon bar and saying,
``I've sacked the lot&#151;I don't want anything more to do with
it.'' That may happen, although he or she might act with rather
more tact in such a case, but it can be achieved in much subtler
and slower ways. People do not like making someone redundant, and
I do not blame them for that. It is a horrible job. But, the job
can often be done perhaps rather more slowly, but no less
inexorably, by natural wastage and zero recruitment. That is the
killer of new jobs that concerns us.
<P>
I do not need reminding that this is a procedural motion. Our
attitude in dealing with the Bill and amendments will be not only
what might be called macro constructive but micro constructive.
In last year's legislation on the national minimum wage,
Government Back Benchers rather unworthily suggested that every
proposal that we made was a wrecking amendment. It was not. It
is necessary to look at the small print and details of proposed
legislation to get it right. It is very much in the interests of
employers and the Government&#151;and, indeed,
employees&#151;to do that, rather than to pass measures quickly
into law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): It might be
helpful in illustrating my hon. Friend's point to refer to press
reports this morning that the Secretary of State is now engaging
in rowing back from some of the steps taken last year in the
National Minimum Wage Act 1998. Had the Government listened more
carefully then to our constructive arguments, they may not be
having such problems today.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It might be helpful if hon. Members were
to listen to me as well. We are debating the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am about to draw my
remarks to a close because I am conscious that other hon. Members
wish to speak.
<P>
My main concern is the procedure outlined in the Bill. Of
course, the Government can pray in aid some sort of electoral
mandate for the Bill. However, there may be some disagreement
about what exactly was meant in the election manifesto on
recognition procedures, for example. I do not believe that the
Transport and General Workers Union is entirely happy at the
outcome. Little accidents and unintended consequences are almost
certain to come out again if we do not examine the Bill properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend referred to the obligation to try
to improve the Bill, and he also spoke of the Government's
mandate. The hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) seemed to think
that that was amusing. Does my hon. Friend agree that the
obligation to try to improve the Bill, not least through tabling
amendments, is an obligation on every member of the
Committee&#151;not only Opposition Members? It is ridiculous if
the hon. Member for Corby thinks that the great British public
have given a mandate for the precise contents of the Bill,
unamended, and that he need only sit back and let it happen. Does
he have no obligation to try to improve the Bill?

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I noticed the
body language coming from the Government Whip, too. Labour
Members on the Back Benches may not want to amend the Bill, but
nevertheless, I hope that they will feel able to share their
concerns with us about the small print, so that collectively,
perhaps we can improve the Bill. If it has to be like the old zen
joke about what one hand clapping sounds like, we shall do it
from this side, but it would be much better if opinions were
heard across the Committee.
<P>
The Bill is stuffed with regulatory requirements, even when
they are subject to affirmative resolution. The Minister of State
knows that regulations are not amendable; they are
non-retrievable weapons. If a mistake has been made&#151;even
if it makes the Secretary of State furious, as allegedly the
newspaper boys issue has done&#151;it is impossible easily to
retract it without tabling new legislation.
<P>
We need to consider the proposed legislation in advanced, so
that we can form the shape of future regulations under the
blacklist provisions in clause 3. There is also a raft of
regulations under the parental leave and employment agency
provisions. I object strongly to the rather smaller print; even
substantive primary legislation is shoved into the schedules.
Clause 1 merely enacts schedule 1, for example. I do not know
whether it is my advancing years and difficulty in reading the
small print, or whether the Government are attempting to reduce
the amount of paper consumed by the Bill&#151;or even hope that
people will pay less attention than otherwise&#151;but it is
disturbing that so much appears in the schedules and not in the
main clauses of the Bill. The provisions can be enacted and then
slotted into the appropriate places in the substantive
legislation, with which we are familiar.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My final point concerns the question of the order of
consideration. I have spoken at such length because I regret that
we are in such a hurry to proceed with the Bill. It has been
difficult to pick up the Government's intentions. I did not know
until yesterday that they intended to start with the parental
leave provisions. Our first tranche of amendments to the first
part of schedule 1 amounts to more than 25, and at a strike rate
of about two and a half amendments per page, we have a lot to get
through in the time. However, I am anxious to get on with it.
Some amendments to the parental leave provisions will no doubt
be tabled shortly, in good time for our consideration next
Tuesday.
<P>
In conclusion, I wish that Ministers, in their rush to get
on with their general election pledges and to put their slogans
into law, would take the details of their proposed legislation
more seriously. It is true that they consulted for several months
after publishing ``Fairness at Work'' last spring. The main
reason for consulting was because the Cabinet was split on what
to do, so its members were consulting primarily among themselves.
The small print affects real businesses and real jobs; it can
land people in court for breaches of the regulations or in
employment tribunals for compensation, but we are still none the
wiser about it. To take only one example, although efforts have
been made to clarify the matter a little in the explanatory
notes, what is a domestic emergency for which an employee can
take leave? Is it a dead granny&#151;reasonable enough,
perhaps&#151;or a burst boiler? What about an Arsenal home
match?
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): That is an
emergency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That would indeed be a sad case, as I think that
I heard the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr.
Woolas) saying. He may know that my loyalties lie elsewhere.
<P>
Our experience of the legislation passed by this Government
so far is not encouraging. We had to fight to get a debate on the
regulations on working time. They are not amendable and snags are
now turning up, such as au pairs and the minimum wage, and
paperboys and the working time directive. It is a pity for
everyone that that is so.
<P>
We in the Opposition will do our utmost in Committee to probe
the details of the Government's intentions in a constructive
spirit. In turn, it is high time that the Minister and his
colleagues realised that if they mean business about helping
business, they have an obligation to go for minimal changes and
sensible practical definitions. Our fear is that they will not
be up to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): Good morning, Mrs. Dunwoody.
May I add my welcome to you in the Chair? I am sure that we shall
be in safe hands, as we have been in the past. It is interesting,
and perhaps reassuring, to see so many of the usual suspects back
with us. I hope that that means that we shall have a constructive
time in Committee.
<P>
The Minister said that he was doing his best to provide
explanatory notes as a new way of pursuing legislation through
Committee. I welcome that. He also said that the Government were
learning as they go, which was honest of him, and I accept that
constructively.
<P>
I am concerned about the use of average figures in the impact
assessment document that has been provided. It is clear from the
comments that have been made so far that what may be average to
organisations across the spectrum is not average to a very small
firm or a very large firm. To a firm affected by a figure the
figure is not average, but critical. I shall be trying to test
out with the Minister not the average impact, but the actual
impact on employees and firms at the extremities of the Bill.
<P>
We welcome the principles behind the Bill. It is important
to set minimum standards of employment. That is good for
employees and employers. Businesses throughout the country tell
me about the need of decent employers for protection from the
not-so-decent employers&#151;the firms that realise cuts in
their costs by exploiting their work force. Protection from
cowboys is as important for employers as protection from
exploitation is for employees.
<P>
Decent employment standards pay rewards to employers who are
prepared to invest in them. The rewards come from commitment,
loyalty and reduced absences from work because of illness or
stress. We shall want to test and probe the Government on certain
areas.
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, the Government have set down
some good and well-intentioned principles about protection of
employees, but the Bill makes no provision to protect them from
discrimination through ageism. It contains much detail about
protection of employees who are discriminated against because of
their membership or non-membership of a trade union and, as we
debate it, I should like the opportunity to debate protection of
the work force from discrimination by ageism.
<P>
The Bill needs simplicity and balance. It is wrong to assume
that all employers will act unfairly to their employees if they
are given the chance to do so through lack of regulation. That
is not the case, nor are all employees paragons of virtue who
never exploit a situation. Human nature at its worst and best
must be considered when we are examining how the Bill will apply.
We must debate it forensically and in detail. I hope that the
Minister will accept that when I probe, test and challenge the
Bill, I do not do so on ideological grounds, but because I want
the legislation to work. I am not seeking a political stand-off;
I am genuinely concerned about how the Bill will work in the
workplace.
<P>
We must not end up with a goldmine for lawyers. So much of
the Bill is dependent on subsequent regulation by the Secretary
of State and so much of its meaning will be tested by precedent
in the courts that if we do not make clear the meaning, I can
imagine that there will be court cases lasting for many years.
That would benefit no one but the legal profession. I have no
great aversion to the legal profession, but I do not understand
why we should legislate for the benefit of its income or
pensions.
<P>
We must ensure that small business is not overwhelmed with
the burden of red tape. As the Bill stands, I am concerned about
the lack of detail in the regulations. In too many cases, it
allows the Secretary of State to make regulations as and when he
sees fit. Business needs a clear picture of what the Bill will
mean to it. I hope that we end up with a Bill that the average
business man can pick up and know what it means to him, and what
he must do. It is important that we end up with regulations that
are clear and specific, and not left to the whim of the present
Secretary of State, nor of future Secretaries of State who might
wish to sabotage the meaning of the law. We do not want that
opportunity left open: we want a Bill that is clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the ideal
would be for the Department to table draft regulations while the
Bill was under consideration in Committee&#151;or during the
Bill's later stages? Even if the Government did not wish to hold
to the details&#151;it would be necessary to consult on those
as well&#151;we would have a clearer picture of what was
intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point.
My worry&#151;I am sure that the Minister is aware of
it&#151;is that allowing so much of the meat of the Bill to be
left to consultation and subsequent regulation means that the
collective talent of the Committee cannot constructively be
brought to bear on those details. It is often assumed that we are
here to wreck Government legislation. That is not the case. Why
should we bother, if we were not trying to make the Bill work?
<P>
The Government will surely get their Bill. They have a
mandate and they have the votes. We want not a Bill that is full
only of good intentions but one that sets out clear standards of
good practice that should benefit employers and employees for
years to come.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I am pleased to be a
member of the Committee, because I believe that the Bill could
severely affect the prosperity of my constituents&#151;both
employers and employees of the many businesses in Bromsgrove. I
fear that the Government have not learned the lesson of the 18
years of Conservative Government. During those 18 years, the
Conservatives had a fantastic record on employment.
<P>
The Government love to tell us that more people are in work
since they came to office. I wonder why that is the case. Perhaps
it is due to the Conservative's legacy of employment regulations,
which are an incentive to employ people.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Does the hon. Lady not understand
that a company was lost every three minutes during the 18 years
of Conservative Government?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> But does the hon. Gentleman not understand
that when we compare the United Kingdom with similar countries
in the European Union, we have a much better record of
employment? Sadly, businesses fail; we do not want them to fail,
but it happens. The hon. Gentleman's comparison is not relevant;
we must look at the wider context, which undoubtedly shows that
we have a better employment record. That is what worries me about
many of the Bill's provisions, and that is why we want sufficient
time to give it proper scrutiny, and perhaps even to change the
Minister's mind on a few issues.
<P>
As I made my way here this morning, Mrs. Dunwoody, I happened
to see an article in today's edition of the Financial Times,
which seemed to epitomise the naivety of the Government's
attitude to pay and employment conditions. That article reported
that the Secretary of State for Health was thinking of paying
doctors in accordance with clinical outcome&#151;on whether
their patients lived or died. I have to ask Labour members
whether they want the best doctors to treat the most
life-threatening conditions, such as cancer. Doctors may not,
want to do so if their pay is to be dictated by the number of
their patients who live.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The hon. Lady raises an interesting point. She
may be familiar with the Peter principle, which states that
everyone rises to his level of incompetence. Does it apply to
her?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbridge:</B> I have not heard of that principle, and I
do not accept the hon. Gentleman's charge, although it may apply
to some Labour Members, but that is for him to pursue.
<P>
The Minister has referred to the number of Conservative
Members who were present on Second Reading. I am pleased to be
on the Committee because I was not able to speak in that debate
although I wanted to do so, because I was serving on the
Committee that considered the Tax Credits Bill. Sadly, the number
of Conservative members of the Committee is small, but come
nevertheless attended the debate. We find it hardly surprising
that there is a massive turnout of Labour Members today because
so many of them are sponsored by trade unions. It is not
surprising that they turn out in droves when their vital
interests are affected.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey </B>(Wentworth): Perhaps the hon. Lady would
allow me to correct her: no Labour Member is sponsored by a trade
union. The arrangements do not allow for that. Trade unions have
links with constituency parties, but the old sponsorship system
no longer exists.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes my point. The nature
of those arrangements is a matter for the Labour party, but he
has amply demonstrated the fact that a financial arrangement
exists between Labour constituencies and trade unions. I thank
him for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> The relevance of the point made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey) was that there were
no existing agreements between Labour Members and trade unions.
However, the hon. Lady made the further mistake of assuming that
arrangements exist between all constituencies and trade unions;
there is no agreement between my constituency and any trade
union.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbridge:</B> Clearly, the hon. Member for Eccles is
whiter than white in that regard, but most of his colleagues are
not. They have links with trade unions and I stand by my point
that it is not surprising that so many of them turned out on
Second Reading to defend their own interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I do not think that my hon. Friend is being
unfair, but there is a far more benign explanation for the
numbers on the Labour Benches on Second Reading. Through no fault
of their own, Labour Members have far less to do than we do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman may not intervene in
an intervention.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbridge:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and
Sale, West (Mr Brady) made a fabulous point and I am happy to
allow my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry to comment on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I apologise for my premature intervention.
<P>
The real concern among members of the Committee and indeed
among Labour Back Benchers may not be Labour links with trade
unions&#151;which my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove was
adumbrating&#151;but their links with business.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Clearly, there are few such links, otherwise
the Government would not have come up with the legislation. The
links that they have will get them into trouble and the links
that they do not have will get them into even more trouble when
the business community fully appreciates the content of the
legislation.
<P>
Before I was interrupted so many times, I was trying to
explain why the legislation is extremely important. Longbridge
car plant is partly in my constituency and partly in that of the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden), and we are
both concerned about its future. However, I put matters in a
different context: I fear that one of the reasons why the old
Austin works was in such difficulty was the activities of Red
Robbo. My heart pounds a little faster for fear of what might be
unleashed. Nevertheless, A German company&#151;BMW&#151;now
owns Rover's Longbridge car plant, the future of which hangs in
the balance since last week's boardroom takeover by people whose
views on its future are still unclear.
<P>
My great worry is that, as the new chairman of BMW has stated
on record, BMW and Mercedes&#151;the other major German car
manufacturer&#151;have had great difficulty because of Germany's
employment regulations, which mean that 4.5 million people are
unemployed there. Much of Germany's car manufacturing is
out-sourced to eastern Europe. One of our fears for the
Longbridge plant is that, because of employment regulations in
the British market, BMW is threatening Rover car workers by
saying that it will build a plant in Hungary to make the
successor to the Rover 75. My worry is that the Bill might
encourage BMW to do that, rather than to invest in the Longbridge
plant, which is what we want to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I rise with some reluctance because all
hon. Members have to make their comments, and I have been in
opposition, but there comes a point when sensibility and a sense
of proportion are needed. We are all committed to the delicate
negotiations on the Longbridge plant, and anything that is said
must not lessen the capacity to maximise the potential for a
positive outcome. The fact of the matter is that, as the hon.
Lady must know, the original rescue plan has been agreed by
Rover's management, the owners of Rover in Germany and the work
force. That is the basis for the discussions.
<P>
The hon. Lady has digressed and is making a political point
that could undermine the outcome that we all want&#151;the
continuation of car production at that plant. I ask her to desist
from such party political banter when we are in delicate
negotiations to secure the future of the plant.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps we should remember that we are
debating the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Yes, of course, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I feel
that I have to respond to what the Minister has said because my
constituents work in that car plant. BMW has made it clear that
it is considering whether to locate in Hungary. I do not consider
that matter to be party political, but the Minister turns it into
an insult. It is not party political; it is about ensuring that
jobs stay in this country. Conservative Members fundamentally
disagree with Labour Members on that matter. It might be party
political in the Minister's eyes, but in my eyes it is about
ensuring that my constituents have jobs to go to. I do not accept
the inference of the Minister's remarks.
<P>
<B>Barbara Follett (Stevenage)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I will not give way; I have been given strict
instructions from the Chair, so I shall return to the sittings
motion. The wider context of the Bill is that, although the
economy is still growing&#151;thanks to the service
industries&#151;British manufacturing is technically in
recession. Conservative Members think it inappropriate to
introduce more employment regulations when, as I have said, we
have successfully created jobs in the British economy in the
past.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry referred to the
problem presented by newspaper boys. When that problem came to
public attention last week, I was especially incensed by the lack
of clarity about what the Bill would mean. I listened to the
radio, and the Government were quoted as saying, ``We don't
believe these paperboy regulations apply to the British job
market, but, of course, it will be up to the courts to decide.''
Is it fair that newsagents should worry about whether they can
afford to employ paperboys and about whether they will have to
defend themselves in court if they do not give paperboys the
relevant employment protection and benefits deemed appropriate
under the European social chapter? It is simply unreasonable that
the measures will have to be tested in the courts and that the
Government do not know what the impact of the regulations will
be. In our scrutiny of the measures, which will take us well
beyond paperboys' perks and conditions, we must truly understand
what is proposed in the regulations.
<P>
Like my hon. Friends who have already mentioned it, I was
pleased to read in this morning's newspaper that the Secretary
of State is reconsidering what was described as a &#163;200
million burden on businesses resulting from the minimum wage
requirement to place, among other things, the minimum wage level
on wage slips. I am pleased that the Government now wonder
whether that is a sensible way forward or a totally unnecessary
burden. We are grateful when the Government listen, and we want
ample&#151;indeed, maximum&#151;time to try to persuade Labour
Members, especially the Minister, that some of the measures in
the Bill may be antithetic to employment practices and to
businesses in general. We are pleased that the Government have
moved, somewhat after the introduction of the minimum wage
legislation, and are therefore optimistic that more progress can
be made in this Committee if we are given time to make our
points.
<P>
We are worried about the way forward that the Government are
taking. I, for one, worry whether the maternity provisions are
appropriate. I have often heard employers bemoan having taken on
young women, only to find that those young women were no longer
able to work because of maternity&#151;[Interruption.] One
Labour Member&#151;I am not sure which&#151;says, ``What a
shame''. It is a shame if such a young woman will not be given
a job because there is a young man with the same qualifications
and the employers fear that she will become pregnant and get the
instant right to maternity leave. That is a serious anxiety.

<P>

<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I give way to my hon. Friend, who might have
more sensible points to make than Labour members of the
Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I fear that the Government have, to some extent,
recognised my hon. Friend's point, but are handling it wrongly.
In legislative terms a young man can now become pregnant as well,
which will add considerable costs to business over and above
those that she mentioned.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are debating the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for reminding us
of that. However, my hon. Friend makes a good point. Paternity
leave is another facet of the burdens that will be placed on
businesses.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons </B>(Rochdale): I hope to clarify the hon.
Lady's point, so that I understand her intervention. Does she
agree with the current exploitation of pregnant young women, who
are unprotected? Should they continue to be discriminated against
because they are pregnant?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I am afraid that the hon. Lady, with whom I
served on the Committee that considered the Tax Credits Bill,
makes a further point that is not sensible. A balance should be
struck, and that balance will be seen in different terms. Having
spoken to employers, I am worried that employers will
discriminate against young women when problems arise, if they are
able to take maternity leave. We are bound to disagree on the
matter. However, I am making a sensible point about balance; the
hon. Lady's intervention errs on the side of lack of
sensibleness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): I was pleased
to hear the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) express
an interest in maternity leave. For a moment, I thought that she
was about to give us some good news, but obviously not. I realise
that the hon. Lady cannot speak for her party on this matter but,
in the unlikely event of her party being returned to government,
would she like the measure concerning maternity and paternity
leave to be rescinded? I am asking for her personal view.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Labour Members always want to scream at
Conservative Members, ``What will you do when you come back into
power?'' However, in two years' time, when I expect the general
election will be held, we will have had ample time to see what
has happened as a result of the measure. We shall then take our
view. If the Government press forward like this, it will have a
deleterious effect on employment practices and damage employment.
We shall then have to decide what to do. At present, sadly, it
is for the present Government to decide such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is wise to warn of the dangers of
burdensome regulation. Does not she think that the problem for
Government Back Benchers is that they always support deregulation
in general, but invariably oppose it in the particular? Does she
agree that a litmus test of the commitment of Labour Members to
minimal regulation is whether any of them will table a
deregulatory amendment during our proceedings?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be brief.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> We must watch with interest whether my hon.
Friend the Member for Buckingham made a relevant point about our
proceedings. [Laughter.] That such action will be put into
practice is very unlikely. Like the hon. Member for Eastleigh,
I fear the impact of the maternity and paternity provision on
small businesses. It is not impossible for an employer with lots
of employees to organise affairs so that an employee can take
paternity leave. A sales director of a company with fewer than
10 employees&#151;or perhaps more; it depends on the
company&#151;who takes three months' leave will hardly do a lot
of good for other people in the company, for sales or for
profitability and, thus, for employment prospects. There are
great problems with that provision.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, what
constitutes emergency leave? Our fundamental problem with the
regulations is that it is not possible to legislate for all bad
employers. It is not possible to legislate against sin. We do not
support bad practices. We wish that bad employers did not exist,
although we believe that the majority of employees are good.
Wherever I, my friends or members of my family have worked, the
employers have given leave in emergencies, but regulating on such
matters will cause more harm than good. As with everything else,
it is a matter of balance which, we believe, the Government have
got out of kilter.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am glad that Labour Members are now being
whipped into life. I shall repeat the declaration that I made on
Second Reading. During the early stages of deliberations on
Bills, hon. Members make clear their financial interests, even
those that they had in the past. On Second Reading, I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``For some 12 years I ran an employment agency in
Yorkshire. I have not actively traded in employment agencies for
10 years, but until the last general election I was an adviser
to the Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services. I am
currently an adviser to Trevor Gilbert and Associates, which is
an expert witness practice''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it deals in employment matters, particularly for those
injured at work&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``but which also owns a business employment
agency.''&#151;[Official Report, 9 February 1999; Vol. 325, c.
180-181.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was somewhat distressed that I should have been attacked
for making that declaration. I make a clear declaration whenever
necessary, and I am somewhat critical of other hon. Members if
they do not. I am particularly keen to ensure that Labour Members
who gain a financial benefit in respect of their constituencies
to fight their election campaigns should tell us which trade
unions give them money, especially as it is now allowed under
Labour party rules&#151;it avoids them having to make a
declaration in the Register of Members' Interests&#151;and also
whether they are members of a trade union.
<P>
I have no argument with members of trade unions becoming
Members of Parliament. Their experience could be valuable to the
Committee. When we come to the clauses dealing with employment
agencies&#151;the reason for my declaration&#151;I hope that
the Committee will be pleased to know that at least one member
of the Committee has worked in an employment agency and
understands the regulations. I am afraid that Labour Members may
not understand that this is the most regulated part of the
employment market, but I want them to know that I shall be trying
to help the Committee. I shall not be trying to mislead it or
working on behalf of anyone else. I am not briefed by FRES or by
Trevor Gilbert and Associates. I hope that the Committee accepts
that I shall be speaking from experience.
<P>
I am sorry that the Whip has disappeared, because I was about
to mention Whips&#151;in general rather than in particular. We
have already seen that one trick of the Whips is to make sure
that Committees have the right constitution. It may be that three
hon. Members rose because the Whip had temporarily stepped out
of the Room.
<P>
During previous debates on employment matters, I have
mentioned that the Whips on both sides had already started
discussing the timetabling of the Bill. I know that my hon.
Friends, particularly the three of us on the Back
Benches&#151;my hon. Friends the Members for Buckingham and for
Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) and myself&#151;can
continue until whatever hour the Whips ask. We have the same
loyalty as Labour Members; if our Whip has made a deal with the
Government Whip about reaching a particular clause at a certain
time, we shall fill the time as necessary.
<P>
Labour Members should know, however&#151;this is why I am
letting the cat out of the bag&#151;that when the Government
Whip says, ``No, you cannot speak because we have done a deal
with the Opposition, and if you do speak the deal will go out of
the window'', I and my hon. Friends would be happy to share the
time&#151;especially with those Labour Members who have
difficulties with particular clauses.
<P>
Even if the Government Whips think that they have denied
Committee membership to all slightly aggressive or disloyal
Members, our Whip would be only too pleased to ensure debate on
any helpful amendments tabled by Labour Members. The hon. Member
for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) said that I was not to say that he would
sit down and allow the Bill to go through unamended. He is a
great personal friend of mine and a charming gentleman; I hope
that that comment does not destroy his political career. However,
I must give him some friendly advice. If he takes my advice and
intervenes in our debates, he might end up as the debater of the
year at the next Channel 4 awards, but I suspect that his
parliamentary career will not take off.
<P>
With regard to the timetable, I understand that we shall not
get into the meat of the Bill until we return next week. I hope
that that deal has been done with the Whips.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the
management of the Committee and the timetable is a matter for me.
Arrangements made by others in the House of Commons are not a
matter for the Chair. If they were, I suspect that they would be
rather better organised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am not suggesting that any of those things
happen through some connivance with the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. The
connivance tends to be between the Whips who then tell their Back
Benchers what they want them to do and at what time.
<P>
I am referring specifically to the timetable. Organisations
need time to prepare. I had a frantic telephone call from someone
at the CBI saying, ``You're on the Bill. Can I send you briefings
and so on?'' We all need time. I know that the Minister is
currently talking to a number of organisations about the
regulations that will flow from the Bill, especially those
applying to employment agencies, under clause 28. Any information
that the Minister and his Department are willing to give to
organisations to allay their fears about the Bill should also be
available to members of the Committee.
<P>
I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the
explanatory notes. I have made speeches about the need for a
document that explains in full how the Bill will read when the
amendments have been made. It is a very helpful document, and I
congratulate the Minister&#151;probably the only time that I
shall do so in proceedings on this Bill&#151;on it. I hope that
we can work on that basis as we proceed.
<P>
I notice that clause 33 refers to the measures that will be
subject to positive resolutions. It is important for the Minister
to tell us which regulations he has in mind. If he does not have
time to do that, we may have to delay the Bill, but I suspect
that he does know, so perhaps he will tell the Committee what
they are.
<P>
We should have a good chance to discuss the Bill in full. I
am sorry that we shall not be sitting at 9 o'clock on Thursday
mornings. The Modernisation of the House of Commons Committee
suggested that there could be such morning sittings. Everyone
else in the country starts at 9 o'clock in the morning. Nobody
thinks that such hours are not gentlemen's hours. Starting the
Committee at 2.30 pm on Thursdays is an extraordinary way of
going about our business. If we are changing how we do business
on Thursdays to allow hon. Members to get back to their
constituencies earlier on that day, we should sit at 9 am, rather
than at 2.30 pm, thereby using the best of the day to ensure that
the Bill is fully discussed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): May I say what a joy
it was to hear that you would be managing the passage of this
Bill, Mrs. Dunwoody. I had the pleasure of a similar experience
during the passage of the Finance Bill last year. Your
fair-minded, robust approach and good humour will serve us well
in this Committee.
<P>
It is a great honour to serve in this Committee at such a
historic time and to witness the passage of a Bill that will
offer a new era of industrial relations in Britain in the new
millennium, after an era of tension and strife. The law will now
be changed as we move towards a time of partnership and success
in a global economy. In terms of competitiveness in the global
economy, UK plc must obviously focus on productivity, human
capital, expansion and sustainable growth and see them as the
basis of future prosperity for all people in Britain. Our debates
must concentrate on that.
<P>
Members of the Committee have a range of experience. Many are
from the newly modernised trade union movement that offers, as
well as traditional industrial benefits, consumer and financial
benefits to its members. Many of us are from the business world.
My background is in multinational companies and starting up
businesses. I was also leader of the largest council in London.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Daventry, I am sad that the right
hon. Member for Wokingham is involved in genetic engineering and
cannot be with us, although we all suspected that. The hon.
Gentleman mentioned the article in The Economist on 6 February
that related to flexibility. It is worth thinking about the
relationship of the Bill to labour market flexibility. We are in
the modern world of working men and women with family lives. The
essence of the Bill is to enable flexible involvement of women
in a new labour market so that they can participate fully and get
away from the rigid, old ways that were characterised by men
working and women being at home. We want the maximum productivity
from all those in the workplace and the Bill will help to achieve
that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry said that we did not want the
German disease of complications and bureaucracy, as if the German
economy could be consigned to the historical scrapheap. When we
consider the performance of the German economy, such as the
number of strikes&#151;which is 12 days per thousand compared
with 78 days per thousand in this country&#151;and the
productivity gap, which is more than 20 per cent., one begins to
wonder why there is industrial success in Germany. I argue that
that is rooted in a history of good industrial relations and
partnership.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are
talking about the sittings motion. I am not responsible for what
goes on in Germany.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not share some of the comments in the
Sunday press about the need to re-fight world war two each time
that particular country is mentioned. I respect the employment
successes, as well as the difficulties, of other countries, but
compared with most of our continental competitors as well as our
friends, we have a lower level of regulation and a much lower
level of unemployment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Davies&#151;on the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Yes, on the sittings motion. We are in
a different business cycle and if we econometrically accounted
for that&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am aware of the business cycle. I am
also aware that we are debating the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In beginning to conclude my remarks, I must
reiterate that the Bill will bring to the labour market the
flexibility that families need in the modern world. It will
underpin a new era of higher productivity and enable both small
and large companies to succeed in the new world. We greet with
glee the new renaissance in industrial relationships.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Laxton </B>(Derby, North): Unlike some members of the
Committee, I have not previously served on a Committee under your
chairmanship, Mrs. Dunwoody. I have it on good authority that at
least one Opposition Member who tried in the past to take
advantage of your chairmanship came out very much on the wrong
side. I shall endeavour to ensure that that will not happen in
my case.
<P>
I trust that the problems that we have had with the sittings
motion will not prove insurmountable and that we shall move
quickly to discussing the Bill. I think that Opposition Members
will trail two themes across the debate: the cost of the
legislation to business&#151;I am sure that my hon. Friend the
Minister will be able to pacify any concerns on that
score&#151;and the impact that it will have on employment and
business prospects. Indeed, the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss
Kirkbride) has already made the latter point and I shall briefly
deal with it in a moment; as for the hon. Member for South
Dorset, I direct him to my comments on Second Reading about my
wide-ranging interest in and experience of industrial relations
and business activity.
<P>
If we consider some of the clear facts and
figures&#151;rather than the fiction&#151;on the subject, we
see that many of the best British companies recognise trade
unions. Indeed, many of the best, most efficient and most
productive companies go far further. They already give time off
for domestic circumstances and in many cases take a broad and
reasonable view on the time that employees can take off for the
crises that occasionally occur in everyone's life.
<P>
I welcome the opportunity to participate in the Committee.
Many Labour Members, unlike Conservative Members, made
considerable efforts to speak on Second Reading to ensure that
they could serve on the Committee. I know that I reflect the
views of my hon. Friends in saying that we shall listen intently
to the debate and scrutinise the amendments; in fact, I suspect
that the Minister will table some amendments. I and my hon.
Friends will seek to use our experience in responding to the
debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> We need a thorough and rigorous analysis of the
Bill, which will necessitate substantial sittings for many weeks.
Such rigorous analysis would have been necessary in any case, but
the Minister's response to the Second Reading debate has made it
more necessary&#151;he made no attempt to answer the concerns
and grievances of Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> To prevent the hon. Member from talking
about that for the next 20 minutes, I can tell him that I made
the commitment on record that I would give detailed answers in
Committee to every question asked and that if the hon. Member
concerned was not selected to serve on the Committee, I would
write to him or her with a detailed answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for reminding us
of that commitment. It was made necessary by his abject failure
to respond to the points made on Second Reading. The Minister's
winding-up speech in that debate was entertaining and witty and
was enjoyed not only by his own party but by many Opposition
Members. The difficulty&#151;this is at the root of our need for
lengthy sittings&#151;was that the Minister's wit and invective
were in inverse proportion to the substance of that speech. He
spent 10 minutes in general knockabout and banter, then briefly
troubled himself to refer to some of the contents of the
legislation&#151;by which time he had only about eight minutes
left.
<P>
The Bill is substantial&#151;containing no fewer than 38
clauses and five schedules&#151;and I hope that the accompanying
regulations will be even more substantial. That is why I am
concerned that there should be a thorough debate. I was genuinely
shocked when the hon. Member for Corby reacted in the way that
he did to the reference to a mandate. My hon. Friend the Member
for Daventry was making the point&#151;which will no doubt be
made again in our proceedings&#151;that the Government were
given a general mandate for the terms of the Bll. However, it is
naive to suppose for a moment that the majority of the British
public know what is contained in the detail of the Bill. All
legislators have a duty to scrutinise Bills in detail before
accepting or opposing them.
<P>
I was also concerned to hear the hon. Member for Derby, North
(Mr. Laxton), who is a valued member of the Select Committee on
Trade and Industry, say that he expected that the Minister would
table some amendments. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's
expectation is justified, if the proceedings of the National
Minimum Wage Bill and the Competition Bill are anything to go by.
However, it is not just the Front-Bench Members of either party
who are under the obligation to scrutinise legislation&#151;all
Members of the Committee are under that obligation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> That may have been only an assumption on my part;
we need to await the passage of time to see if my hon. Friend the
Minister tables such amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> That is a helpful clarification. If I infer from
it that the essence of an amendment is starting to percolate in
the hon. Gentleman's mind and that we shall shortly see the
fruits of his labours in the form of several, perhaps critical,
amendments, that will be a welcome public service, for the people
of Derby, North and for the Committee.
<P>
Conservative Members have serious concerns about the Bill.
First, there is a direct conflict between what Ministers said
when they were shadow Ministers in opposition and what is now
being done. I said on Second Reading that two examples of
ministerial statements were flatly contradicted by the Bill. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer said on 11 April 1997, when he was
shadow Chancellor, that Labour would not impose burdensome
regulations on business because he knew that successful
businesses needed to keep costs down. I believe that that is
contradicted in the Bill. It will be necessary during our debates
to study the conflict between rhetoric and reality, not only in
general but in particular.
<P>
The second example is that the departed Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry, the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr.
Mandelson), who is sadly not serving on this Committee, said last
November that burdensome regulations would not be introduced.
However, rigorous scrutiny is needed precisely because burdensome
regulations are being introduced, which will increase costs to
business and detract from its competitiveness.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Ministers have previously said that as long as both the
Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress
are brassed off everything is all right. There is compromise;
they have upset both sides, split them down the middle and that
is good enough. That is not the Committee's concern. We are not
involved in that extraordinary subterranean world of shady
dealings with which Ministers are so preoccupied. We are
concerned with producing good legislation and straight dealing
for the benefit of our constituents.
<P>
It is a great pleasure to serve under your austere but
impressive chairmanship and under the wise counsel of my hon.
Friend the Member for Daventry. It is also a pleasure to serve
on a Committee with the hon. Member for Stevenage ( Barbara
Follett)&#151;the colour-coded, media-friendly, authentic
representative of new Labour 1999&#151;because she made a
substantial contribution to previous Committees and we look
forward to what she has to say about the dangers of
over-regulation under the Bill.
<P>
On union recognition, we are anxious that firms of 50
employees or fewer should be excluded from the Bill. In a
friendly spirit, I ask the Minister of State to answer a simple
question&#151;in fairness, I have asked it before&#151;and to
do so without abuse or invective. Why do the Government use a
different definition of the term ``small firm'' in the Bill from
that used in the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act
1998? There might be a good answer. He has said elsewhere that
several different definitions could be used and that one could
argue the toss about them but that the Government thought that
they had made the right decision. In fairness, I hope that he
will accept that that is not an answer but an evasion.
<P>
Why have small firms been defined as those with 50 employees
or fewer in previous legislation but not in the Bill? Many firms
would like that question to be answered. I hope that the Minister
for Small Firms, Trade and Industry&#151;who has a duty to
safeguard the interests of small firms, which I am sure that he
takes seriously&#151;and the Minister of State will agree that
that is a reasonable question. I should like them to answer it.
Some 200,000 to 300,000 small firms would be excluded from the
ambit of the Bill if the Government were prepared to opt for the
deifinition that we favour and that they have adopted in other
legislation.
<P>
All members of the Committee should be concerned about the
raft of so-called family-friendly policies&#151;I use that
expression advisedly&#151;introduced under the Bill. The
Government have estimated the likely annual cost of the parental
leave directive. I hope that I will not be accused of excessive
cynicism if I say that those figures, which the Government
trotted out just before Second Reading, could conceivably prove
to be underestimates. I fear that the estimates could prove to
be low and many business people fear that the costs will be much
greater.
<P>
We know that the right hon. Member for Hartlepool is
untroubled by the costs because, as he legendarily observed, they
constitute a tiny fraction of the total employment costs borne
by business. I have made the point before, and it will need to
be reiterated during our proceedings, that individual
regulations, almost inevitably, constitute only tiny fractions
of the total cost to business when considered on their own. In
isolation, they are small. It is the cumulative impact that can
be so damaging and can make the difference between a business
thriving or standing still, between a business keeping its staff
level constant or having to reduce numbers of workers, or even,
in a worst-case scenario, between a business surviving or going
under.
<P>
I hope that Ministers will present more specifics about the
regulations. The Minister will be aware, as his Government have
signed up&#151;an act of crass folly&#151;to the European
social chapter, that the parental leave directive allows for
parental leave agreement entered into by a European Union member
state to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal
constraints in a way which would impede the creation and
development of small and medium-sized undertakings.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I doubt that those noble words will be easily translated into
practical action: I think that the directive itself will damage
small and medium-sized enterprises. Nevertheless, in the spirit
of constructive engagement in the Committee, we must try to make
a bad Bill better. I entreat the Minister of State to present
more detail.
<P>
We welcome and listen with interest to the contributions of
Labour Members. However, neither in Committee nor on Second
Reading have we heard much to date from Labour Back Benchers
about the interests and needs of small firms. It is about small
firms above all that I am worried. On Second Reading, the
Minister of State referred to several thriving companies that,
as a matter of principle and practice, implemented
family-friendly policies. They had no difficulty in doing so and
no problem with the requirements of union recognition. He made
a fair point: it is a matter of fact. If I remember rightly, he
also referred to Asda. However, I am worried not about such
firms, which can, on the whole, look after themselves and contend
with the Bill. I am bothered about the small employer who is
struggling to make progress.
<P>
We should thoroughly analyse the detail of the Government's
proposals. In that context, I issue another appeal to the
Minister of State&#151;to his gentler nature, his softer side,
his cuddly instincts. Perhaps I do so in vain. Perhaps on what
I gather will be the relatively rare occasions on which we shall
be favoured with the presence and utterances of the Minister for
Small Firms, Trade and Industry, I might do better to appeal to
him, because he is the male version of the hon. Member for
Stevenage. He is new Labour 1999 in his courtesy and manners. In
this sitting, however, I appeal to the Minister of State&#151;

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I use a knife and fork as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful for that assurance. Those attending
to our proceedings will be extremely interested to learn that the
Minister of State uses a knife and fork when consuming his food.
I hope that he will forgive me if I remind him of my anxieties
that are directly relevant to small businesses.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been astonishingly indulgent, but
I would not want hon. Members to take that as a sign of how the
rest of the Committee will proceed. Let me make it plain. We are
debating the sittings motion, which is precise. We cannot have
a Second Reading debate and I hope that members of the Committee
will bear that in mind. If they make points relating to our
timetable, I am happy to accept them. Members of the Committee
should be a little careful about what they are doing because the
patience of the Chair is not unending.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful to you for that guidance, Mrs.
Dunwoody, and I assure you that I shall immediately heed your
strictures.
<P>
I shall now draw my remarks to a close, a fact that will be
greeted with warm relief by Labour Members. In so doing, I wish
to ask the Minister of State to agree that there should be
sufficient time for him to tell us whether he has studied the
Family and Medical Leave Act 1993. That could help small
businesses and it is directly relevant to family-friendly
policies, although a different approach has been adopted in the
United States of America.
<P>
Has the Minister had a chance to consider the Regulatory
Flexibility Act 1980, which is directly relevant to the extent
to which small business can influence the regulatory policy by
which it is to be affected? Will he arrange to be provided for
his Red Box a copy of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
Fairness Act 1996? Again, if we were to adopt a similar approach
to that adopted in the United States, that could impact directly
on the working lives of people in this country. I doubt whether
such extremely important legislation is a well-thumbed tome, but
we could learn a great deal from our friends across the Atlantic.
<P>
I urge the Minister, in all seriousness, to consider how the
United States has married decent standards with competitive
performance. If he is willing to continue his transition from old
Labour into a model member of the new Labour Government to the
extent that he will accept American imports for the better
government of the United Kingdom, I shall warmly welcome him on
board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> This will be the first time that I have served in
Committee under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall be
making a short contribution to the debate on the sittings motion
and I hope that my body language does not prompt any more
long-winded contributions from Conservative Members.
<P>
I am particularly interested in the regulation of employment
agencies, but I have perhaps a slightly different perspective
than that of Conservative Members. Since the general election,
I have made it my business to draw to the attention of the House,
as I did in my maiden speech, in an Adjournment debate and in
questions to the Prime Minister, the impact of the unscrupulous
employment agencies on my constituents. I have made it clear that
I represent my constituents and do not have to worry about
declaring a potential conflict of interest, as the hon. Member
for South Dorset had to do both on Second Reading and now in
Committee. It is up to members of the Committee to judge in whose
interest he speaks.
<P>
The realities of life under the current so-called heavily
regulated employment agency industry is that many of my
constituents experience low pay, no holiday pay, no sick pay, no
job security and no training. There is no clarity of
responsibilities between employment agencies and the companies
in which their employees work. There is certainly no job training
or opportunity for personal development.
<P>
Frankly, if we are to see fair standards in the workplace,
the regulations of the 1970s desperately need a root and branch
overhaul. The legacy of the Conservative Administration means
that in Corby the 1930s queue at the factory gates has been
replaced by the 1990s queue for the agency bus that runs around
my constituency. I hope that there will be sufficient time for
a proper look at the inadequacies of the regulations that govern
employment agencies, so that we can create fair minimum standards
for all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am pleased to serve under your chairmanship,
Mrs. Dunwoody. Sadly, I missed the opportunity of being a member
of the Committee that considered the National Minimum Wage Bill,
which I gather from this morning's proceedings was a most
entertaining and rewarding experience.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove observed that the
Government have learned nothing after 18 years of Conservative
Government. It was most informative that the hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) should have said, ``Oh yes we
have'', because it implied that he takes a certain position on
the relationship between what is supposed to be an Opposition
party and the Government.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is of immediate relevance to the sittings motion for me
to make it clear that the official Opposition will scrutinise the
Bill properly. We have a philosophical objection to much of it,
and serious doubts about its practical implications for business.
I am sure that the Minister of State is in no doubt that, in the
spirit of an adversarial Parliament, we shall do our best to
highlight those parts of that Bill that we believe that we can
improve by placing it under the most intense scrutiny and
pointing out some of the problems that it will bring if it is not
amended.
<P>
I am pleased that we are sitting in Room 10 because we can
draw inspiration from the fine paintings on the wall. Hon.
Members came dangerously close earlier to mentioning the war, but
we can see the picture, ``King Alfred Inciting the Saxons to
Prevent the Landing of the Danes'', while trying to defend
English employment practices and, English practices in dealing
with trade unions and in workplace negotiations against a
continental model. That model is alien to us, and experience in
Europe has demonstrated that it is less effective and less likely
to create jobs and investment than is our own model.
<P>
I could not serve on the Committee that considered the
National Minimum Wage Bill last year because I was serving on the
Committee considering the School Standards and Framework Bill.
However, I have a sense of deja vu, because the two Bills have
a great deal in common. They contain precious little detail in
key respects, and both set out enabling powers for the Secretary
of State to bring forward regulations. It is not an adequate way
to introduce major legislation, especially a Bill that will have
such a heavy impact on business. It will mean that our debates
will suffer from a lack of clarity and cause the business
community more worry about what the regulations might do. It is
done for the Government's convenience, I suspect because they
need to appeal to two separate audiences among Labour Members,
but it does not make for good legislation.
<P>
It is important that we scrutinise the detail of the Bill as
far as we can. The Minister of State said that he will try to
give more detail as our debates proceed. Will he be so good as
to guarantee that, as clauses are debated, he will give Committee
members the draft documents that the Government will seek to
consult upon that are relevant to each clause? Only if the
Committee has those documents can it see the Government's
thinking; only then will its debates be properly informed about
the Bill's wide provisions. Indeed, it may help the Government
to do that, as it may assist them to win their battle to become
business-friendly.
<P>
The Government may have no intention of introducing
regulations that would give new scope and wider powers to trade
unions, and may draw the provisions tightly in relation to
so-called domestic incidents. There may be much less to fear in
the Bill than businesses expect; as my hon. Friend the Member for
Daventry mentioned, a business survey at the weekend suggested
that many businesses fear what the Bill might bring.
<P>
Only if the Minister of State undertakes to bring forward the
Government's draft proposals at each stage, only if he shows good
faith by telling the Committee of the Government's thinking, will
the business community, the commentators watching our proceedings
and Members of the House at large have any faith in the
Government's stated determination to bring forward an intelligent
piece of legislation.
<P>
As I suggested earlier in an intervention, it may save the
Government considerable discomfort if they now bring forward
details for the Committee to debate&#151;as it is meant to
do&#151;rather than leaving it to a later stage. The Secretary
of State may find, as his predecessor did while the National
Minimum Wage Act 1998 was making its way through Parliament, that
he has to retract certain proposals, recognising that their cost
to business will be unacceptable. I urge the Minister of State
to give us details of the Government's proposals to inform our
debates. He should realise that that would be to the benefit of
good legislation. It would also benefit the Government.
<P>
I hope to go one better than the hon. Member for Croydon,
Central (Mr. Davies). We have reached a seminal point in the
development of employment policy. We need to know whether, as the
Prime Minister said in Bristol on 2 February, the Government
intend to reduce regulation on business and that costs on
business should be reduced in this country and in Europe, or
whether we should take the Bill as a true indication of the
Government's position. The Government have a golden opportunity
to show that they have learned something from the 18 years of
Conservative rule and that they realise that costs on business
must be reduced, not increased.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John Healey:</B> I, too, look forward to our detailed
scrutiny of the Bill in the debates listed in the sittings
motion, which I hope we are about to pass. I am proud to be one
of the usual suspects described by the hon. Member for Eastleigh
when he mentioned proceedings on the National Minimum Wage Bill.
I am glad also to be serving under you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and your
co-Chairman, Mr. Atkinson. To borrow one of the Government's
soundbites, made in relation to the Immigration and Asylum Bill,
the conduct of the Committee will be firm, fast and fair.
However, I shall take that comparison no further.
<P>
I welcome the Bill and I am pleased to be serving on the
Committee. The Bill will help us to strike a better balance
between employers and employees and between work and home life.
In case on one else does, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the
Minister of State, who has done more than anything to bring the
Bill this far.
<P>
Although he is not in his place at the moment, I welcome also
the hon. Member for Daventry, who led for the Opposition on the
National Minimum Wage Bill Committee. He is serious and sensible,
and rarely lapses into the political posturing that is
unfortunately all too common from some Conservative Members. I
welcome particularly his commitment that the Opposition will not
engage in union bashing.
<P>
The Bill will not turn the clock back, as the hon. Member for
Altrincham and Sale, West maintained on Second Reading. It will
not be a partial rolling back of employment law and trade union
immunities to the 1970s. It genuinely takes us into new territory
and creates a more modern framework for employment law. It does
so in four ways.
<P>
First, it introduces into British statute individual legal
rights; the Europan model is set beside the British tradition of
free collective bargaining. Secondly, it introduces a raft of
family-friendly rights and policies&#151;the right to parental
leave, equal rights for part-time workers, an extension of
maternity leave, and time off for domestic incidents or
emergencies.
<P>
Thirdly, it gives legislative recognition to the growing
practice of partnership in the workplace. Employers and
employees, business and trade unions are increasingly working
together. Unions are seen clearly to have a strong stake in the
success of business; they have a role in helping to manage change
in a way that maintains competitiveness in the companies in which
they operate. They are seen increasingly as partners, rather than
adversaries, by the management dealing with them. Fourthly, for
the first time in two decades, we have an employment Bill that
is not partial to or prejudiced against one side of industry.
<P>
There are two other aspects of the Bill that are perhaps less
high profile, but which I regard as important matters that must
be considered in Committee. Clause 28 deals with employment
agencies. Private employment agencies have an important role in
helping the effective working of local labour markets. For the
first time, the Bill properly sets standards for the operation
of such agencies and the treatment of staff within them. It will
provide the opportunity to bring in proper rights of protection
for agency staff and, in so doing, hold out the possibility for
private employment agencies to work more in partnership&#151;a
proposal made by the Employment Sub-Committee, on which the hon.
Member for Altrincham and Sale, West and I are lucky enough to
serve. The Federation of Recruitment and Employment Services
proposed a joint task force from the private sector agencies and
the Employment Service to consider how they can start to work
more closely together. A prerequisite for that is to have proper
standards in the private sector.
<P>
I am glad that the sittings motion will allow us to deal
effectively with clauses 22 and 23, on the Central Arbitration
Committee. The Bill's proposals will give the CAC welcome and
important independence from the Advisory, Conciliation and
Arbitration Service. The CAC will have a separate, and much more
significant function when the Bill reaches the statute book. It
will have a critical role in the smooth implementation and
operation of the legislation long after the Committee has
finished its work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> It has been an interesting, if somewhat
predictable, debate. Given the nature of this morning's
discussion on the sittings motion, we have seen a setting out of
stalls. I take that in the spirit in which it was intended and
I give all members of the Committee an absolute assurance that
I shall provide as much detail as I can on clauses, subsections
and schedules, and that I shall gladly entertain questioning and
scrutiny.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I have not told you anything yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister does himself an injustice. He has
already imparted some important information. I merely want an
assurance that he will not only give us such detail but that it
will be available in good time, and well in advance of the
sitting when we shall be considering the relevant clauses, so
that we can consider it and table amendments, as appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall provide as much information as I can.
No information will be given only to Ministers and not to the
rest of the Committee. I shall try to be as helpful as I possibly
can. That does not guarantee that 100 per cent. of information
relating to the regulatory regime will be available. However, the
Committee can be assured that the Government will be clear about
where they are coming from and why, which is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is known in the Tea Room
as Yankee Doodle Dandy. That is probably why he spent a great
deal of time today asking me to exclude the working time
directive and to stay up late at night reading American
legislation. I shall desist from doing so in the next few days,
but I may take him up on his offer some time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way and
for the further information that he has imparted. While I
recognise that we cannot expect full details of every clause at
each sitting, will the hon. Gentleman tell us, before our
proceedings conclude, how long the consultation period will last
and what notice he expects to give business of the regulations
that they will have to implement, the costs of which they will
bear?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We shall continue on the basis of how we have
worked so far. We shall give substantial room for genuine
consultation, because the whole purpose of the regulations is
that people feel that they have some ownership of them and
understand their quality and excellence. The regulations are
framed so that individuals, or small or medium-sized enterprises
have a clear understanding of them.
<P>

As soon will be the case with the minimum wage, much effort
will be made to provide information to small businesses on how
to use the regulations and how to understand specific issues. We
are clear about the investment that we are willing to make to
ensure that the regulatory regime is friendly in terms of usage
and that its purpose is clarified. Much time and effort will be
put in by the Government to ensure that that will happen.
<P>
Members of the Committee raised specific issues, many of
which I shall deal with at our next sitting. However, one or two
of those issues should not be left to lie as statements of
intent. It is untrue that the Bill is not technically proficient.
The White Paper and the Bill have both received accolades from
people in employment relations about the quality of effort that
was put in to produce them through partnership and the subsequent
consultation. That process will continue.
<P>
It is in our interests to ensure not only that the Bill is
excellent technically but that it will modernise employment
relations. It will help to combine work and family life; it will
underpin a flexible and efficient labour market and retain a
skilled work force, which is necessary to compete in a modern
economy. Complementing that will be a change of culture and
partnership in the workplace. We want to make changes in
individual workplaces through co-operation, commitment and a
resolve by the work force to ensure that the business succeeds.
The hon. Member for Daventry made an important point about jobs
and rights. I could not agree with him more, which is why
alongside the proposals is the commitment to ensure that
partnership is about ensuring that the Company succeeds.
<P>
The good relationship between the employer and the employee
underlines that commitment to fairness and good standards in the
workplace. There is no incompatibility between fair standards in
the workplace and giving the work force the responsibility to
react effectively to ensure the success of the enterprise. That
is the whole basis of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised various issues about
small businesses. I put it on the record again that the
Government are friendly towards small businesses; we are
committed to them, as we are to entrepreneurship. Will Opposition
Members consider alongside each clause the position of small and
medium-sized enterprises; the establishment of the capital fund
of &#163;150 million, and the enterprise fund that is dedicated
to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises? They must
bear in mind the research programme for universities; &#163;20
million will be dedicated to universities; opportunities will be
provided for small businesses to transfer their knowledge into
a business acumen to bring new products to the marketplace.
<P>
I bring to the Committee's attention the regional development
agencies and cuts in corporation tax&#151;the lowest ever level
of corporation tax for small businesses. Also to be considered
alongside the Bill is the Late Payment of Commercial Debts
(Interest) Act 1998, the new deal for the self-employed and a
range of other matters. We have taken specific action to help
small businesses.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister's commitment to small businesses
is welcome, as are some of the measures that he has outlined,
although we may have doubts about others. Does he not concede
that the opinion expressed in the survey to which I referred is
that small businesses do not agree with the Minister? If nothing
else, he has a major communication job to do in convincing small
businesses to overcome their cynicism and doubts about what he
says are his intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I take a pinch of salt with surveys done by
companies whose job it is to drum up business for themselves and
ask small and medium companies to part with huge sums for help
and advice, putting up Aunt Sallies and then knocking them down.
<P>
Small and medium enterprises need not be worried about the
Bill because they have a direct relationship with officials in
the Department, Ministers and the organisations that represent
them. For example, we sat down with small and medium enterprises
to produce toolkits for the system to implement the minimum wage
regulations. We have sat down with them on many other issues. We
shall continue to have a permanent daily working relationship
with small and medium enterprises, and we shall genuinely address
their concerns.
<P>
The legislation that we introduce is fair and effective; it
does not disrupt the economy or the life of small or medium
enterprises. That is in stark contrast to the Conservatives,
under whom a business went bust every three minutes of every
working day. An extraordinary number of businesses was lost, but
we will create, sustain, promote and develop business.
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckingham asked about parental leave and
the hon. Member for Eastleigh asked about cost analysis. I shall
be happy to discuss those matters at the appropriate time. Cost
assessments are produced independently of Ministers by economists
who use accepted models for estimating average costs. There is
no ministerial involvement or interference to put the appropriate
assessments in the public domain.
<P>
The Bill will address the current costs to industry. Some
&#163;25 billion is lost to business through unregulated time
off. The Bill will help business deal with that huge on-cost.
Nearly &#163;2 billion is spent on continual recruitment with
no return on the investment. The Bill will help to reduce those
costs. Such reductions in costs are significantly better than the
minuscule amounts&#151;they are a price worth paying&#151;that
have been quoted for the potential on-costs of the introduction
of some of the Bill's provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am glad that the Minister accepts the points
that I have made. I do not doubt the validity and independence
of the figures produced, but I stress that they are averages. It
is important to deal with the extremes, because that is where it
hurts most.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is
saying. However, given the myriad of businesses in Britain, is
he seriously suggesting that the assessment system should be able
to identify every single business? That would be impossible and
infeasible. We shall provide specific, detailed information on
the costs. Some companies will face no costs, others will face
minimal costs and those without proper standards will face
additional costs. However, those costs will be counterbalanced
by the other average figures&#151;the &#163;25 billion, the
&#163;1.8 billion, and I could cite other figures&#151;that
business organisations independent of Government say are lost
because of poor business practice. The Bill will address all
those matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckingham tried to tickle my fancy on
the working time directives and paperboys, but what he said was
just plain wrong. That was a mischievous story, and those who do
not want people to have paid holidays jumped on the bandwagon.
The working time directive does not cover paperboys and
papergirls in the way that hon. Members have suggested. Following
the consultation process, it did not and never will cover people
who are still at school. They are covered by the young workers
directive, which does not provide for holiday pay. Some time ago,
the Government gave a commitment to review child labour laws with
partners and stakeholders. We are now doing so, and at an
appropriate time, we shall propose changes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the Minister of State is making an important
statement of position, will he make it clear that the Low Pay
Commission spokesman's reported remarks that the working time
directive applies to paperboys are therefore misconceived?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Whoever made such statements and whatever
their source, they did not come from official sources. The story
ran for a day only, because, having received clarification from
the Government, the newspapers realised that it was a nonsense
of a story. Those who continue to perpetuate the story talk
nonsense.
<P>
I hope that, following our discussions this morning, the
Government and the Opposition will take as much time as is
necessary on each section of the Bill to ensure that we
scrutinise it effectively. We shall have time for jocular
comment, but I hope that we do not spend a lot of the time on the
jocular and miss out the important things. I do not mind; I can
debate the jocular for ever and a day. I do not mind such banter;
it is all part of the process, but I hope that next week the
Committee will concentrate more on the facts than on fiction.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Employment Relations Bill,
the Committee do meet, with effect from Tuesday 23 February, on
Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock and
on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock, except that the Committee
shall not meet on Thursday 11 March.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister to move the order
of consideration, I should like to make two announcements. First,
copies of a financial resolution connected to the Bill are
available in the Room. Secondly, I remind the Committee that
adequate notice of amendments must be given. As a general rule,
neither I nor Mr. Atkinson intend to call starred amendments at
either morning or afternoon sittings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses
8 to 10, Schedule 3, Clauses 11 to 15, Clauses 17 to 26, Schedule
4, Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clause 2, Schedule 2, Clauses 3 to 7,
Clause 16, Clauses 27 to 35, Schedule 5, Clauses 36 to 38, new
Clauses, new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall give a short explanation of the order of
consideration, as we have departed from the order of the
provisions of the Bill in three respects.
<P>
First, we propose that the schedules be taken immediately
after the clauses or groups of clauses to which they relate, a
common practice that makes for logical discussion and that I
found useful in our consideration of the Competition Bill late
last year. It will assist proper discussion of the Bill.
<P>
Secondly, we propose that clauses 1 to 7 and their associated
schedules be dealt with later in the Committee's discussions,
after we have tackled the institutional matters in clauses 22 to
26 and schedule 4.
<P>
Thirdly, we propose that clause 16, which deals with the
protection of employees who are subject to collective bargaining
arrangements from being pressured into signing individual
contracts, should be taken immediately after clauses 1 to 7, as
it is part of that family of measures. Clauses 1 to 7 deal with
matters relating to trade unions. As clause 16 deals with
collective bargaining, and is consequential to the proposals on
union recognition, we felt that it would be appropriate to
consider it alongside clauses 1 to 7.
<P>
As some of the provisions tend towards the complicated, we
have included flow charts in the explanatory notes, which the
hon. Member for Daventry not only welcomed but suggested. I hope
that members of the Committee will find them helpful. Given that
complexity, we felt that hon. Members might appreciate extra time
to study those parts of the Bill before we debate them in detail.
<P>
The Government will table several amendments that are
designed to improve and clarify schedule 1. By taking the
schedule later in our deliberations, we shall have more time to
consider those amendments properly and in context.
<P>
The order of consideration has the added benefit of allowing
the Committee to examine the statutory recognition procedure
after we have considered clauses 22 and 23, which deal with the
structure and proceedings of the Central Arbitration Committee.
As the hon. Member for Daventry pointed out, that committee will
be given a fundamental role in the operation of the new
recognition arrangements. It is therefore sensible to take the
family of measures together and I have been open about the
reasons for that. There is no question of my hoping to stifle
debate on the provisions&#151;even if I wished to do so, I am
sure that hon. Members would not permit it.
<P>
The proposed order of consideration will allow us to start
with the proposals on parental leave and time off for domestic
incidents. Hon. Members will rightly want to know the
Government's intentions on those important matters.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have had a constructive debate. The Minister
has been in one of his more conciliatory and positive moods; we
are particularly grateful for his explanation of the remarkable
reordering of consideration. If the proposed order of
consideration is more convenient for the Committee and for the
Department and is likely to lead to better consideration and
ultimately better legislation, we shall not stand in its way.
<P>
I still have one or two concerns; I emphasise that I do not
want to make a meal out of them or be unduly tetchy. First, the
Government have a regrettable tendency to compress the time
between publication of a Bill and Second Reading and between
Second Reading and the Committee stage. If I may draw on my
expereince of many years ago, there used to be a saying in the
farming world that sheaves of oats should stand in the field for
three Sundays. There is much to be said for following that
principle&#151;even if the weather is fine&#151;in regard to
legislation, because one can reflect on its meaning and get it
all down properly.
<P>
Secondly, the Minister has given us an explanation about a
situation that I had not until yesterday afternoon realised had
arisen. We would all have appreciated a bit more notice about the
reordering. It will not have escaped the attention of Committee
members that&#151;to take up the point that you rightly made
about starred amendments, Mrs. Dunwoody&#151;at our first
practical chance to get into the detail of the Bill and table
amendments, we made what was, after the Second Reading debate,
the reasonable inference that clause 1 and schedule 1 would
follow the sittings motion. We therefore tabled many detailed
amendments&#151;which I assure the Minister were designed to be
constructive&#151;and which would have been starred today and
no doubt been taken at our next sitting. However, now we find
that the whole thing has been turned back to front and that we
must table another lot of amendments. They will be tabled, but
a little more notice, particularly to those directly involved in
the preparation of amendments, would have been helpful.
<P>
I do not want to end our constructive discussions on a note
of undue heat and I advise my hon. Friends to accept the motion.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses
8 to 10, Schedule 3, Clauses 11 to 15, Clauses 17 to 26, Schedule
4, Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clause 2, Schedule 2, Clauses 3 to 7,
Clause 16, Clauses 27 to 35, Schedule 5, Clauses 36 to 38, new
Clauses, new Schedules.<P>
