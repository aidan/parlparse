<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton </B>(Congleton): I beg to move amendment No. 12, in the long title, leave out `intention' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`purpose'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Having left some time for hon. Members to decide whether to table further amendments, and not wanting to be accused of bouncing the Bill through Committee, I note that this is the only amendment. I am sure that the Committee will want to deal with it expeditiously.
<P>
When I submitted the Bill's long title—hasten to add that I had to do that fairly quickly—I had in mind the commonsense interpretation of the word ``intention''. However, when considering the detailed drafting of the Bill, and following extensive consultation with academic lawyers and parliamentary counsel, I came to the conclusion that the word ``intention'' could have a different meaning from that which had in mind, so I opted instead for the commonsense word ``purpose''.
<P>
I need to answer the question posed during the Committee's second sitting, which is whether the word ``purpose'' is ambiguous and impractical, as has been suggested. The Minister for Public Health is on her way following a previous engagement. I understand that she is stuck in traffic. As she is not here, and I am about to answer some of her comments, I shall write to her. Her officials will obviously see the full text of our debate, but it will be courteous to write to her and ask her to reply to some of the criticisms that I am about to make of what she said.
<P>
At column 15, the Minister stated that the words of clause 1—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>purpose or one of his purposes—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
switched the focus of the law from the patient's best interests to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the purpose or one of the purposes of the doctor.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I must ask, how does it do that? Does the law against purposefully killing patients by an act do so? I think that the answer is obvious to one and all. The Minister also reiterated that the criminal law of homicide uses the concept of primary intention, not the concept of purpose; but what does primary intention mean if not purpose? the Minister may think that it includes foresight, but that is because of the artificial legal meaning of ``intention'', which the Bill avoids.
<P>
The Minister said that it was unclear how ``purpose'' would be interpreted in practice. The presumption in statutory interpretation is that words bear their ordinary and natural meaning. The ordinary meaning of ``purpose'' is aim. The Minister said that the word ``purpose'' does not get round the problems associated with the word ``intention'' because the Bill states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>purpose or one of his purposes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
But ``purpose'' means ``aim'' whether or not it is the doctor's sole purpose. Just because a purpose is not the only or main purpose does not turn it into foresight.
<P>
The Minister added that there would be practical difficulties in working out what someone's purpose might be. That may be so, but that is equally true of the legal prohibition on purposeful killing by an act—and, indeed, of the legal requirement for proof of purpose or of state of mind. Criminal cases typically require proof of a state of mind.
<P>
The Minister added that the possibility that the clause would damage effective palliative care, by affecting the provision of proper pain relief, would cause most concern to the House of Commons. She said that if a doctor was aware that administering palliative care—in the patient's best interest—might also hasten death, the Bill
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would render the decisions of the doctor . . . contrary to the law. [Official Report, Standing Committee C, 16 February 2000; c.16.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand that the advice that she has been given on that point is deeply confused. First, the Bill prohibits omitting, not giving, treatment. How could a doctor be liable for giving treatment under a Bill that prohibits omitting treatment? Secondly, her criticism must apply to the existing law on administering palliative care, on the basis that its prohibition on intentional hastening of death may extend to foreseen hastening of death. That is an argument for amending the existing law, not the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): Are we not in difficulty, given that the Bill's promoter has tried throughout our proceedings to equate acts of omission with acts of commission, but now argues that they are distinct? As a clinician in such matters, I should find it confusing to have to work to a statute that would allow me actively to intervene in terminal illness in such a way that death might follow, but would bar me from, for instance, refraining from treating bronchopneumonia that was not distressing to the patient, which would have the same effect as actively administering some medication.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is an intervention, not a speech. If the hon. Gentleman seeks to catch my eye later with a view to making a speech, I am sure that he will succeed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> I am grateful for that intervention. I hope to deal later with some of the hon. Gentleman's remarks from previous Committee sittings. The hon. Gentleman is telling the Committee that he found it difficult in practical terms to be a clinician before 1993 when the law was changed following the Bland case. All that the Bill would do is return us to the pre-1993 situation. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman, the BMA or others argued before 1993 that the law was not right and made it difficult for them to practise their skills—by acts of omission or commission—but that is what he said.
<P>
My third point in response to the Minister's comments is that several judges have in any event applied the doctrine of double effect in relevant cases. They have held that a doctor acts lawfully if his or her purpose is to alleviate pain, not to hasten death. Relevant judgments were those of Mr. Justice Ognall, in the 1992 case of Regina v. Cox and, in 1999, Mr. Justice Hooper, in Regina v. Moor. The Bill applies the same, sensible distinction to omitting treatment.
<P>
The Minister also commented on the Bill's reference to the responsible person's
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>purpose or one of his purposes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She claimed that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>brings into question the entire principle of double effect.—[Official Report, Standing Committee C, 16 February 2000; c.17.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On the contrary, the word ``purpose'' was chosen precisely to incorporate that principle. Does the Minister suggest that the word ``purpose'' includes foresight?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been listening carefully to the hon. Lady, who has courteously explained why the Minister is not here. We are in some difficulty. Although the hon. Lady is trying to relate her remarks to the word ``purpose'', the purpose of the debate is not to revisit the Minister's arguments in an earlier debate, but to explain why it is necessary to change the long title of the Bill. I must ask her to confine her remarks to that matter.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale, for that advice. I was merely trying to answer some of the points that were made about the difference between the word ``intention'', which in legal parlance includes foresight, and the word ``purpose'', which has a simple and straightforward definition in the dictionary—it means ``aim''. However, if you feel that I have been treading where I should not, then I shall conclude my remarks.
<P>
I have explained the reasons for changing the word ``intention'' to ``purpose''. The long title was produced quickly. It was only on reflection and after taking further advice that I decided to use the word ``purpose'', which matches the long title with what is used throughout the Bill. We have debated the difference between intention and purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Joe Ashton </B>(Bassetlaw): I do not think that the amendment is a wrecking amendment to the Bill, but it is another attempt to wreck the Law Lords decision on the Bland case. It took 18 months of legal wrangling, involving the Law Lords, the hospital trust and Tony Bland's parents, to determine whether the machine could be switched off. The case went on for ever, until the Law Lords eventually decided that it could be switched off. As the hon. Lady said, the Bill is designed to put the law back to what it was. But it was in chaos. Before the Bland case, no one knew what it was. She wants to put the clock back.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> In a second.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Having issued a ruling, I must stick by it and confine the debate, which I do not want to inhibit, to the change of the long title, which is the subject of the amendment. The hon. Gentleman should not rehearse earlier arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I will not take a minute.
<P>
Many of the Bill's opponents thought that it was unamendable, which is why so few amendments were tabled. However, on Report, a large number of hon. Members—lawyers and doctors—who did not have the chance to speak on Second Reading because there was no time and who were not selected to sit on the Committee, will have more to say about the legal and medical difficulties. The hon. Lady said that we met today to give opponents of the Bill a chance to table amendments, but they will have to be tabled by other hon. Members because, unlike the hon. Members for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) and for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge), I am not a doctor. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) has done his best to put up a prolonged opposition, but it is not possible for us to debate legal amendments. I could force a token Division to show that opinion is divided, but I do not want to delay the Committee. However, I do want it on the record that the Bill is an obfuscation of the change that was made to the law. It is designed to deter doctors from taking part in such a practice.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> I must just say that the Bill clarifies the situation. If the hon. Gentleman reflects on what has followed the Bland judgment—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are debating not the Bill but amendment No. 12, which changes the Bill's long title. It does no more than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I have finished, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I will speak to the amendment. The Bill is elegant in its shortness, but it is not clear. It has certainly confused me. The amendment would help to clarify it. I had hoped that the Bill would use ``intention'' throughout, but changing the sensible use of ``intention'' in the long title to ``purpose'' at least makes it consistent. I appreciate why the amendment has been moved, but it does nothing to improve the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome the Minister to the Committee in its closing stages. We appreciate her courtesy in explaining why she could not be here earlier.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
