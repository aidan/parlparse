John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): It is
good to be back to our consideration of the Bill, Mrs.
Humble. Our amendments would ensure that apprenticeship standards are
what employers actually desire, and would result in less bureaucracy,
because those standards would not have to be revisited in response to
the concerns of employers. The employment body expressed support for
amendments in that spirit during the evidence sessions, which I confess
is partly why we are debating it now. The CBI representative
said:</div><a name="09031268000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;priority
for our members is to ensure that the apprenticeship programme
encourages strong employer involvement and that the programme is more
fit for purpose&#151;delivering the sort of skills that are in demand
by
business&#148;.</div><a name="09031268000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
spokesman went on to
say:</div><a name="09031268000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
introduction of apprenticeship standards and minimum periods of time
off, for example, are making our members
nervous&#148;.</div><a name="09031268000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
doubt we shall discuss that later, when we come to the relevant parts
of the Bill. The spokesman for CBI then
said:</div><a name="09031268000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Standards
are fine. It is just specific standards for minimum periods of time off
that are not needed. Each framework has to ensure that it accords to
the blueprint at the moment.&#148;<i class="I">

Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee, </i>3 March 2009;
c. 6-8, Q5, 12 and
19.]</div><a name="09031268000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
spoke earlier of the dynamic nature of skills needs and therefore the
necessity of apprenticeship frameworks to respond to those changing
needs. The best way for that to happen is for employers to be in the
driving seat. The Minister has emphasised that he thinks so, too. For
that reason, we share the view that sector skills councils are of
pivotal importance. John Lucas of the British 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>Chambers of Commerce added that he was positive about the planned
increase in apprenticeships and that it was a</div>
<a name="09031268000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;long-term,
positive thing for business and for the
economy.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
supported the comments of Richard Wainer of the CBI, but
emphasised:</div><a name="09031268000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
think that apprenticeships need to be employer led and employed
focused. Obviously there has to be a high-quality programme element to
them too.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>3 March 2009; c. 9,
Q19.]</div><a name="09031268000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
have said, we do not dispute that: it seems to be the orthodox view.
What are apprenticeships if they are not things that appeal to
employers as much as they appeal to learners? That is implicit.
However, it is important that the consultation process on
apprenticeship standards is right, and I am not sure that describing
that process as being built on persons that the chief executive of
Skills Funding thinks appropriate is as clear as saying that
representatives of industry and education should be consulted. Why does
the Minister consider that it is less important to consult those people
than I
do?</div><a name="09031268000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031268000505"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): We are back to the question
of consultation. We discussed before lunch in connection with my
amendment, but we are now dealing with a different clause, which makes
it clear that the Government envisage consultation taking place, but
only with consultees determined at the discretion of the chief
executive of Skills Funding or, presumably, the National Apprenticeship
Service.</div>
<a name="09031268000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
apprenticeship is a triangular relationship between the employer, the
employee and the training provider. The needs of employers and the
ability of training providers to deliver the training that is to form
part of the apprenticeship framework should be considered during the
framing of standards. It would therefore be appropriate to consult
employers and providers specifically. Having that in the Bill would be
appropriate, as the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
says.</div><a name="09031268000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the relationship is triangular, perhaps in future the Government ought
to give some consideration to the learner voice, although that is
slightly outside the scope of the amendment. As apprenticeships evolve
and become more popular, not only is it necessary for the employer and
the training provider to have a view on what is included in the
apprenticeship qualification, but I hope that the views of the
learner&#151;the young person or adult&#151;on the quality of
provision will be considered as
well.</div><a name="09031268000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000506"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and
Skills (Mr. Si&#244;n Simon):</b> Hello again,
Mrs. Humble&#151;that could be a song, could it
not?</div>
<a name="09031268000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
listened to the hon. Gentlemen&#146;s arguments and sympathise with
that they are trying to say. The hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings quoted Richard Wainer of the CBI as though his remarks during
the oral evidence session somehow contradicted Government policy or
what is in the Bill. They do not. Every word the hon. Gentleman quoted
is
correct.</div><a name="09031268000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of responsiveness, we are slightly in danger of
misunderstanding how the mechanisms might work. Amendment 46 would
affect even the slightest change in &#147;The Specification of
Apprenticeship Standards 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>for England&#148;, which is a big document&#151;not big physically,
but in the sense that it is very important&#151;which is being widely
consulted upon as we speak. The consultation is due to be reported back
in mid-May. Under the amendment, even the slightest change would
require a full-scale consultation with every stakeholder in the
sector.</div><a name="09031268000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000507"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The document is big enough to be comprehensive, but
not so big that it is bureaucratic or adds to red
tape.</div><a name="09031268000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000508"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The hon. Gentleman put that beautifully. The
document is admirable in that respect. I shall take that as a
congratulatory plaudit for &#147;The Specification of Apprenticeship
Standards for England&#148; from the Opposition Front-Bench
spokesman. However, my point remains&#151;in order to vary the SASE
document by even the slightest comma, under the provisions of
amendment 46 the chief executive would have to undertake a
full consultation. To me, that does not constitute
responsiveness.</div><a name="09031268000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall respond to the question about learner voice from the hon. Member
for Bristol, West before I press on with some more details. It is
anticipated&#151;Opposition Members on both sides of the gangway
should be reassured&#151;that consultation will be wide. The emerging
National Apprenticeship Service has already established a key
stakeholder group, comprising for example the CBI, FSB, TUC, AOC, ALP,
TASSC and LSIS, to provide views and feedback on the
SASE.</div><a name="09031268000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000509"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I congratulate the Minister on his acronyms but,
if I interpret them all correctly, they are all learning providers and
not
learners.</div><a name="09031268000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000510"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> In which case, I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on
his extraordinary command of acronyms. The national learner panel chair
is a member of the NAS stakeholder group as well, representing the
views of
learners.</div><a name="09031268000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
fully understand and support the sentiment behind the Opposition
amendments and hon. Members&#146; aims in tabling them. We&#151;I
am sure that I speak for all members of the Committee&#151;must
strive to ensure that everyone with a legitimate interest has the
opportunity to influence the standards set for apprenticeships in
England. That includes industry bodies, employers, colleges and other
providers, sector skills councils, learners and others.</div>
<a name="09031268000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments relate to consultation on the drafting and modification of
the specification of apprenticeship standards for England. I am sure
that the Committee knows by now that we have already published the
draft specification, which is out to public consultation until mid-May,
as I just said. The consultation has been drawn to the attention of key
stakeholders, a number of whom have been involved in its initial
development. The specification and the consultation questions are
widely available on the internet. I assure the Committee that it is
intended that any subsequent significant modification to the published
specification would be subject to a similar level of consultation
before being laid before the House for parliamentary
approval.</div>
<a name="09031268000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that we have sufficient measures in place in the Bill to ensure that
the views of all parties are taken into account, without the need for
these amendments. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>Indeed, I would not want inadvertently to reduce the breadth of future
consultations by specifying particular groups that must be consulted. I
hope that that gives hon. Members the reassurance that they wanted and
that they will feel able not to press their
amendments.</div><a name="09031268000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000511"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I take the point that the Minister has made, that
all members of the Committee want to see consultation that is
meaningful. I also take the point that he believes, as I do, that
employer engagement is particularly important in developing standards.
Nevertheless, for the record it would be useful to press this amendment
to a Division, just to emphasise the significance of consultation with
employers.</div><a name="09031268000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000526"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Clause 23 allows the Secretary of State to direct
the chief executive of Skills Funding to

specification of apprenticeship standards for England...providing

will be debating that issue in a few moments. It would be useful, for
the record, if the Minister could give some indication of the
circumstances in which the Secretary of State would give such a
direction. We have emphasised in our considerations so far that
ministerial involvement in such matters is best when it is minimal,
because the apprenticeship frameworks and standards and the
responsiveness of apprenticeships will be best defined by teachers,
employers and the agencies charged with that mission. In what
circumstances and why, when and how might such a direction be
given?</div>

the Secretary of State to direct the chief executive of Skills Funding
to modify the specification of apprenticeship standards for England and
to make an order bringing the modified specification into effect,
provided that the requirements in clause 25 are met. This clause is
important in that it gives us the flexibility to change the
specification of apprenticeship standards for England. Without such
flexibility, we would be unable to make changes, to respond to
employers&#146; needs, which might change over time, or to adjust the
bar in the specification so as to better reflect the rising quality of
the programme that we expect to deliver. We intend to consult on the
content of any modifications, even though that is not a requirement for
a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000528"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I have no desire to delay the Committee unduly, but
these matters are important and it is useful to give the Minister the
opportunity to put some of the detail on
record.</div><a name="09031268000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
24 makes it clear that if a specification of apprenticeship standards
for England is brought into effect under clause 22, or an existing
specification is modified under clause 23, frameworks that have been
issued under clause 12 may not meet the requirements of the new or
modified specification. Subsection (1) provides that a recognised
English framework that fails to comply with a new or modified
specification will not automatically cease to be recognised, and
subsection (2) states that orders under clause 22, subject to the
negative resolution procedure, may provide for such a framework to
cease to have effect as a recognised English framework. My question is
simple, and I know that the Minister will have the answer to hand. What
is the timetable for that process? Clearly, if there has to be further
parliamentary authority under the negative resolution procedure, there
will be a time during which the framework still exists before it
ceases. What is that time frame, and what issues need to be considered
regarding frameworks that fall between the cracks and into that
gap?</div><a name="09031268000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000529"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I will just talk through the provisions in this
clause. In developing the statutory framework for our apprenticeships
programme we have sought to ensure continuity of provision, even during
transitions. We recognise that over time the specification of
apprenticeship standards for England might need to change and the
clause provides that when such change occurs a recognised English
framework will not automatically cease to be recognised because it
fails to comply with the new or  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>modified specification. However, the clause includes provision for such
a framework to cease to have effect  as a recognised English
framework. Those two  provisions are essential to the smooth
working of the specification of apprenticeship standards for England
and of apprenticeship frameworks. Without them, a change to the SASE
could invalidate many existing frameworks, without there being
arrangements to  replace
them.</div><a name="09031268000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally,
there must be the sanction of a framework not being recognised when it
has ceased to meet the minimum criteria in the SASE. We intend to
ensure that employers and apprentices who start a framework do so in
the confidence that it will not change before they complete it, and to
ensure that sector skills councils are given sufficient time to make
the changes that are necessary to make their frameworks fully
compliant. The normal period for consultation will be three months plus
40 days in the House for the negative
procedure.</div><a name="09031268000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="09031268000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000546"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> It is worth saying at this juncture that our
considerations are getting ever more exciting. The clause sets out what
must be included in the specification of apprenticeship standards for
England. Subsection (1) provides that the specification must specify
requirements in relation to the content of recognised English
frameworks  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>at level 2, known as apprenticeships, and level 3, known as advanced
apprenticeships and that it may specify requirements in relation to the
content of recognised English frameworks at other levels, for instance
level 4, known as higher apprenticeships. The effect of
subsection (2) is that the specification must require
English frameworks to specify requirements for the issue of
apprenticeship certificates, including levels of attainment required
for the award of a certificate. It must also require each framework to
identify the principal qualification in respect of that
framework.</div><a name="09031268000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
question raises a matter in order to allow the Minister to put his
response on the record. How does this differ from the existing
arrangements? I am not clear how these matters are dealt with in law at
the moment. Does this mark a significant change from existing practice?
Before I speak of excitement too much, I remind the Committee of what
Chesterton said about dull men and
excitement.</div><a name="09031268000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000547"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The fundamental difference between these provisions
and the position in law at the moment is that the provisions are not in
law at the moment. It is fair to say that the specification of
apprenticeship standards for England will have much in common with the
existing apprenticeship blueprint. Obviously the SASE, as we all know
by now, is currently out for consultation and one would not want to
pre-empt that. But it is reasonable to say that there will be much
common ground between the two documents. The difference is that this
specification is being put on a statutory basis for the first time in
200 years: the current blueprint does not have statutory
force.</div><a name="09031268000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000550"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> We have raced through the last few clauses, but it
seems unreasonable to deny the Minister the opportunity to contribute
further to our deliberations, given his outstanding performance when he
agreed with me previously and again today. I shall not offer any
plaudits&#151;he said earlier that he was seeking
plaudits&#151;unless they are fully
deserved.</div>
<a name="09031268000467"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="09031268000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause applies to both England and Wales. The apprenticeship agreement
will be a contract entered into between the employer and the
apprentice. The Government expect it to set out both the on-the-job
training and the learning away from the work stations that will be
delivered. My first question is a reprise of a question that came up in
an earlier Committee sitting and is about the quantification of those
terms. Are we going to measure or stipulate the time spent on the job?
We have debated that briefly, but I would like it to be clear. The
logic of the clause and this part of the Bill seems to suggest that we
should. The contract will make clear what role an apprentice will be
qualified to hold on completion, and it will stipulate the supervision
that an apprentice will receive throughout the period of
apprenticeship.</div>
<a name="09031268000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings
me to my second question, which is about the quality as well as the
quantity of supervision. I paint a picture&#151;some might call it a
romantic one&#151;that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>for me sums up, describes and illustrates what an apprenticeship is in
the eyes of most laymen, and what it should be in the eyes of those who
believe strongly in the apprenticeship system. It is a picture of a
willing learner, learning a craft or skill at the side&#151;some
might argue at the feet&#151;of an experienced craftsman. We
therefore need to know that that craftsman is experienced, qualified
and competent to transmit the knowledge&#151;the
understanding&#151;that we wish an apprentice to gain. We need to
know how long the apprentice will be mentored and what form that
mentoring will take.</div>
<a name="09031268000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) sets out the conditions that must be satisfied by an apprenticeship
agreement. The agreement must be in a form that is to be prescribed by
the Secretary of State. Subsection (3) gives the Secretary of State
power</div>
<a name="09031268000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to specify
provisions that
must&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09031268000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
must
not&#151;</div><a name="09031268000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;be
included in an apprenticeship
agreement&#148;,</div><a name="09031268000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is precisely why I am asking these questions. Subsection (4) enables
the apprentice to enter into successive apprenticeship agreements
relating to the same framework, even where that has ceased to be a
recognised English framework.</div>
<a name="09031268000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the clause stipulates those powers, it is important that we know how
they will be realised and what they will lead to in terms of quality
and quantity, and the contractual expectations of an apprentice and of
those who provide training for an apprentice. I hope that the Minister
will be able to elucidate, and by so doing, illuminate these
matters.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000551"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I want to make different points to those raised
by the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings. Those of us who
at 10.25 am rushed off to Innovation, Universities and Skills questions
for a morning of deliberation on such matters, will have heard the hon.
Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) ask a question about clause 30.
Representations were also made to me yesterday by some non-governmental
organisations that had concerns about the clause, although it was too
late to table amendments for today. The main concerns were about
perceived barriers for people with learning difficulties in fulfilling
the requirements of an apprenticeship agreement. We touched briefly on
that issue in an earlier debate, but I am asking for reassurance from
the Minister that all consideration and support will be given to young
people or adults with learning difficulties who wish to access an
apprenticeship agreement. If necessary, an assessment should also be
made of their needs in order to fulfil the requirements of the
apprenticeship agreement.</div>
<a name="09031268000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Minister
for further education, he may know that many colleges do their best to
ensure that they offer an inclusive education. If he has not done so
already, I recommend that he goes to the National Star college outside
Cheltenham, which I visited a couple of years ago. It specialises in
the provision of further education and skills training for adults with
special needs and learning difficulties. He will know that there is a
broad spectrum of special needs and difficulties, and the hon. Member
for Buckingham referred specifically to those who may be somewhere on
the autistic spectrum. I am simply asking the Minister for an assurance
that all consideration will be given to people with learning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>difficulties or special needs and that a needs assessment will be
provided, to ensure that we offer the inclusive opportunities for
expanded apprenticeships provision that those on all three Front
Benches want.</div>
<a name="09031268000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000552"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Starting with the last point, yes, I can give the
hon. Gentleman those assurances. We have talked about it. I think that
my right hon. and hon. Friends will talk later about the specific
provisions for people between 16 and 18 with special needs. On Tuesday,
we talked about the provisions that I think are in clause
111 &#151;I may have got the number wrong before&#151;which
lays down a duty and commits funding to ensure that nobody is excluded
or disadvantaged because of a learning disability or difficulty from
the many benefits of an apprenticeship.</div>
<a name="09031268000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000553"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I know that the Minister is going to deal with the
substantive remarks that I made, but before he moves on I would like to
address the intervention by the hon. Member for Bristol, West. First, I
raised those matters on a previous occasion in Committee and the
Minister pledged to come back to us with some details, inasmuch as
information is collated and available, on the number of young people
and others with learning difficulties and disabilities who have
apprenticeships. I hope that he will reaffirm his intention to do
that.</div><a name="09031268000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham&#146;s remarks are highly
pertinent to this part of the Bill. Does the Minister expect to make
the provisions for people with learning difficulties and other
disabilities absolutely clear in guidance? Without that, I fear that
they may be disadvantaged.</div>
<a name="09031268000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000554"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I said at the time that I did not think some of the
figures that the hon. Gentleman asked for were available. We are
looking at the others, but we have not got them yet. The latest data
are for 2007-08, when 28,900, some 12 per cent., of those starting an
apprenticeship had learning difficulties and/or disabilities and
10,900, some 10 per cent., of those completing an apprenticeship had
learning difficulties and/or
disabilities.</div><a name="09031268000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Learning and Skills Council individual learner record identifies a
range of different learning disabilities and difficulties, from visual
impairment and mental health difficulties to temporary disabilities
after illness. For learners who consider themselves to have a learning
disability or difficulty, that field of the ILR records the
learner&#146;s main disability. If a learner has more than one
disability, the main one will be recorded. It would be best to address
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments when we discuss clause
82.</div><a name="09031268000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
make a little progress I shall move on to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
opening remarks. He wanted to know to what extent we will measure and
stipulate the components of the agreement. He said that we had debated
those briefly&#148; on Tuesday; we have a slightly different time
sense. I thought that we had gone into those matters at some length and
in some detail, but I am more than happy to repeat the
position.</div>
<a name="09031268000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The number
that will be specified is 280 guided learning hours, which is in the
SASE document for consultation. We expect that consultation to conclude
that about 250 of those guided learning hours should be at off-work
stations. We do not intend it to specify 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>exactly what the configuration of those hours will be, or in what year
they should fall; that will be a matter for employers to agree with
apprentices. We do not intend to stipulate, either on the face of the
Bill or in the SASE&#151;as we went into at some length on
Tuesday&#151;the amount of time spent in the workplace. As I said
several times, we consider that to be a truism: an apprenticeship is a
job, an apprenticeship will always happen in the workplace.</div>
<a name="09031268000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The quality
issue is partly addressed by having a minimum specification of the
amount of time that has to be spent in formal tutored guided learning
off the work station. The rest of the quality issues that the hon.
Gentleman talked about are in, as I am sure he knows, the document that
is becoming legendary in the Committee Room, &#147;Specifications of
Apprenticeship Standards for England&#148;, which is currently out
for consultation, just in case that little detail had escaped anybody.
They can be found on pages 21 and 22 of the document, which the hon.
Gentleman described with some wit&#151;if I may paraphrase&#151;as
a brief and slim, yet comprehensive and almost elegant document. That
is the substance of the answer to his question. Clause 30 allows us to
prescribe the form, but does not impose too much detail or too much
inflexibility.</div><a name="09031268000146"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000559"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Perhaps I could just beg your indulgence,
Mrs. Humble, and thank the Minister for the figures he gave
on disabilities and learning difficulties, which I asked for on Tuesday
and he was able to provide, briefly, a few minutes
ago.</div><a name="09031268000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
34 enables the Secretary of State to modify the application of clauses
30 to 33. It deals specifically with the apprenticeship
agreement&#151;that is, that the apprentice enters into a contract
with the employer and sets out the on-the-work and off-the-work
learning conditions. As a point of interest, in the clauses that we
dealt with a few moments ago, the nature of that contract changes. The
previous contract was a contract 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>for an apprenticeship as defined in common law, which will now change as
a result of the Bill. That is a matter for those whom one might
describe as &#147;the
geeks&#148;.</div><a name="09031268000468"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="09031268000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, the apprentice enters into a contract and sets out his
on-the-work and off-the-work learning conditions in the way we have
described. However, that is not the case for Crown servants, members of
the armed forces and parliamentary staff. We have tabled this probing
amendment, the Minister will be delighted to hear, to determine what
specific circumstances would necessitate the use of the power set out
in subsection (5), which allows the Secretary of State to
modify the Bill in relation to those employees. That examination is
even more urgent, as Government amendment 179 proposes to roll that out
to include clauses 83 to 91 and the 16 to 18 apprenticeship
entitlement. The explanatory notes
state:</div><a name="09031268000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
power is needed to make the Bill work properly in relation to these
classes of people, given their particular circumstances: for instance
the fact that they may not have contracts of
employment.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Has
he properly examined what those circumstances might be, and will he
specify them for the Committee to consider more
carefully?</div><a name="09031268000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Minister would also be so good as to shed further light on why
Crown employees may have no contracts of employment. That seems rather
curious, certainly with regard to parliamentary staff, whom we know to
have contracts of employment, so I do not fully understand why they are
included in the list, but perhaps he will know more than I do about
that.</div>
<a name="09031268000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely the
explanatory notes to clause 30, which indicate that apprentices enter
into a contract with their employers, would negate the situation I have
described. It would be good to clear up this matter on the following
grounds: the specific circumstances that would evoke the clause; and
whether employees of the Crown have contracts of employment under their
apprenticeship entitlement. Those are important matters, although
relatively technical. I hope that, following the suave and
comprehensive response that the Minister is about to give me, we will
not need to push the amendment, but we do need answers to those
questions.</div><a name="09031268000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000560"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on raising the
issue. He asked some pertinent questions on what is an arcane piece of
drafting. The simple answer is that the clause is intended to make the
Bill&#146;s apprenticeship provisions apply to Crown servants and
parliamentary staff who do not have legal contracts of employment or,
as they are termed in the Bill, &#147;contracts of
service&#148;,&#151;I will not go down that geeky road. The
provisions of the Bill as drafted would not apply to them because they
do not have contracts of service, and a contract of service is a
necessary part of the definition of an apprenticeship.</div>
<a name="09031268000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, too, was a
little confused about that and never asked anyone about it, but the
conclusion I came to was that &#147;parliamentary staff&#148; in
this context does not refer to the staff and researchers of MPs,
although they are Crown servants, but to those we call officers of the
House, such as the Clerks and the Serjeant at Arms. The technical
reason for Crown servants such as parliamentary staff and members of
the armed forces not having contracts of service is that the Crown is,
in theory, able to terminate such contracts at will despite any
contrary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>term within a contract. That is seen to be part of the wider rule that
the Crown cannot fetter its future executive action by
contract.</div>
<a name="09031268000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
declined the hon. Gentleman&#146;s invitation to geekiness on the
matter of contracts of apprenticeship, contracts of service and
contracts of employment, I cannot resist noting
that:</div><a name="09031268000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
one of the leading cases, Dunn <i class="I">v.</i> R, (decided in 1896) the Court
stated that employees of the Crown held office during the
&#145;pleasure&#146; of the Crown unless statute provided
otherwise. A contract to employ a Crown employee for a fixed term was
deemed to be against the public interest and
unconstitutional.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that note&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> My hon. Friend

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000564"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Clause 35 specifies that careers advice in schools
must give consideration to apprenticeships as an option, but fails to
give any grounds on which such advice and guidance would be given.
Furthermore, it makes no account of the fact that an apprenticeship is
a specific programme of training, relevant to a specific occupation.
Our amendment relates advice on apprenticeships to consideration on
apprenticeships as a path to a particular option.</div>
<a name="09031268000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an
important aspect of the Bill. It is widely acknowledged that, if we are
going to grow the apprenticeship programme in the way that the Bill
intends and the Opposition advocate&#151;the whole House 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>would acknowledge that we have been the champions of apprenticeships,
certainly since I have been in my current
job&#151;</div><a name="09031268000171"></a>

Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):</b> I am not
sure that we would acknowledge that, but I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for giving way.</div>
<a name="09031268000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000566"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Well, there are one or two people in the deep
recesses and far corners of the House who have not recognised that, but
we continue to make our case with force so that even they will
ultimately appreciate that the Opposition intend&#151; when elevated
to government, should the people of Britain grant us that great
honour&#151;to create 100,000 new apprenticeships. That would be a
massive boost to the apprenticeship programme.</div>
<a name="09031268000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
must not test the Committee&#146;s patience too much, and I will
return to my main theme. In order to achieve the objective of the
growth in the apprenticeship programme, it is critically important that
we provide the right kind of advice and guidance. That does not apply
just to young people, about whom I shall say a few more words in a
moment, but to all those who might consider an apprenticeship. It is
too easy to categorise apprenticeships around school leavers. However,
particularly in the current economic circumstances, adult
apprenticeships are a vital means by which people can reskill, upskill,
gain new employment, fulfil their potential and gain new opportunities.
We need good advice not only for young people, but for all who consider
an apprenticeship as a path to an
occupation.</div><a name="09031268000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
failings of careers advice have provoked a great deal of criticism,
particularly concerning the range of opportunities in vocational
training and qualifications. Schools too often overlook those pathways
in their effort, albeit well intentioned, to ensure that students
progress along more traditional academic
routes.</div><a name="09031268000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031268000567"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman
speaks of students pursuing traditional routes. Does he share my
concern that careers advice in schools often points females down
traditional routes for young women and does not encourage them to
consider a broader range of careers and less familiar
routes?</div><a name="09031268000176"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000568"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Yes. Questions were raised a few hours ago on that
matter at Innovations, Universities and Skills questions, which
interrupted our Committee considerations. It is absolutely true that
the advice that is offered should be gender-neutral. I hate to sound
politically correct because I am not politically correct, as you know,
Mrs. Humble. That is about as politically correct as I ever
get. Every option must be made known to all who might wish to pursue
it.</div><a name="09031268000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I am sure the hon. Lady is indicating, the record speaks for itself.
There is a gender slant in apprenticeships in different areas. For
example, many boys go into engineering. Girls are often directed into
hair and beauty or caring roles. That is partly because of choice, but
it is also due to the lack of the information that would open
people&#146;s minds to alternative opportunities. I endorse the
sentiment behind her intervention and I gather from her contributions
so far that she takes great interest in these matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div><a name="09031268000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">A more
fundamental issue is that we are not balanced in our articulation of
the vocational opportunities. Irrespective of gender, we do not make
enough of the vocational opportunities. That is a cultural phenomenon.
Some people in positions of influence&#151;I do not include the
Minister, of course&#151;fail to understand the sense of worth and
value that can come from non-academic accomplishment. As a society, we
have become preoccupied with the notion that only through academic
prowess can people gain a sense of achievement, worth and pride. I do
not buy that for a
moment.</div><a name="09031268000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
frequently visit FE colleges and see the wonderful things that are
being taught and learned. I often think, &#147;If only I were clever
enough not to be academic. If only I were clever enough to be
practical, as my father was.&#148; I am tied to the route that I
guess most members of the Committee have pursued. The careers advice
that we offer young people and mature apprentices should be more
objective. It should be more comprehensive and open up vocational
pathways. It should be more fair-minded in emphasising the value of
practical learning and the importance of craft. We must elevate the
practical.</div><a name="09031268000469"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="09031268000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have already said, there are doubts that that is currently happening.
The House of Lords&#146; Select Committee on Economic Affairs, of
which we have heard a great deal already, said in its report,
&#147;Apprenticeship: a key route to skill&#148;
that</div><a name="09031268000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;schools
fail to inform young people about the opportunities offered by
apprenticeship and other work-based training such as Entry to
Employment. This failure is further compounded by the failure of
government to provide a service that offers basic information on local
labour markets, earnings, career prospects and training opportunities.
A number of our witnesses expressed concern at the lack of suitable
careers guidance and information for young
people.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill should have been an opportunity to put that
right.</div><a name="09031268000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
Professor Alan Tuckett, who is very respected in the field of adult and
community education, described the Bill as a &#147;missed
opportunity&#148;, he was not speaking about the particular matter,
but he might have been. The Bill is a missed opportunity not only in
terms of adult learners or community education&#151;as the professor
meant&#151;but in terms of careers advice and guidance. We could have
had measures in the Bill that put into place an independent, all-age
career service, which sits alongside Connexions, with a presence in
schools and colleges up and down the country. In the witness sessions,
I made that point to the representative from Connexions, and he broadly
agreed with me. I asked whether an all-age adult independent career
service of that kind would re-professionalise careers advice, and he
answered in the affirmative. When I asked him whether the Government
should have been firmer about the matter, he agreed that they should
have been more determined to put into place the kind of advice and
guidance that is essential if we are to rebuild the nation&#146;s
skills and rejuvenate the apprenticeship system.</div>
<a name="09031268000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">In July 2005,
the then Department for Education and Skills recognised that Connexions
was not able to provide information on training opportunities for young
people at formative stages of their school career&#151;that was in
its own review on advice and guidance. The Department was concerned
that Connexions was trying to do that, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>and also provide all kinds of other advice, in particular, to a number
of vulnerable young people, who faced many challenges. The effect of
creating that jack-of-all-trades has been to de-professionalise careers
advice and dilute what it offers to many young people, who might, if
given personal information, have considered an apprenticeship or other
forms of vocational training.</div>
<a name="09031268000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
alternative vision, as I said, is of an independent careers service for
all ages, as it is in other parts of the UK&#151;we are disadvantaged
in England in this respect; Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have a
different system altogether. The service should also have a presence on
the high street, because if we look at the shocking statistics on
social mobility, it is clear that those people who have the wherewithal
tend to be those who prosper. The most disadvantaged in our
society&#151;the most detached economically and socially&#151;often
do not have that wherewithal because of familial inexperience of the
available options, the social groups that they operate in, or simple
access to information. By having a paucity of good advice, we cement
social disadvantage and frustrate social mobility. Good advice and
guidance is essential for giving those who currently have a raw deal
the chances that they deserve. As a champion of the dispossessed, hon.
Members would hardly expect me to advocate anything other than the best
deal for the most disadvantaged of our
countrymen.</div><a name="09031268000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause recognises these failings and the Government have taken some
tentative steps in the direction that I have outlined, but they simply
do not go far enough. In failing to inform learners about the true
opportunities that apprenticeships offer, they limit the ability of
students&#151;specifically those for whom academic studies is not the
best option&#151;to understand the full potential of the vocational
pathway.</div><a name="09031268000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall say a word or two more about the prejudice built into the system.
It is true that some schools&#151;typically independent
schools&#151;offer extremely good careers advice. However, not many
disadvantaged and dispossessed people go to independent
schools.</div>
<a name="09031268000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000569"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I do not want to denigrate in any way the fine
work of independent schools, but is the hon. Gentleman aware of a
consistency in relation to independent schools offering advice on
apprenticeships to all of their
pupils?</div><a name="09031268000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000570"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I have no doubt that, given the history of
independent schools and the good quality advice they offer, the
mechanisms are in place in many of those schools to offer a full range
of options to their students. Given the kind of people who are giving
the advice, it might be that they slant it in favour of the academic
route. However, certainly compared with elements of the state sector,
typically more time, resources and energy are put into advice and
guidance given in independent schools than in many state
schools.</div><a name="09031268000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000571"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way on that
issue. I have, anecdotally, picked up on concerns from people in the
further education sector that certain schools, including independent
schools, are simply not inviting the FE sector in to offer careers
advice. If they do invite them in, they insist that they talk only
about the HE options with which they are linked. That cannot be
right.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div><a name="09031268000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000572"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I bow to the hon. Lady&#146;s better knowledge. I
am certain that if an independent service with a presence in schools
and colleges were free to operate and offer the range of advice that I
seek, the outcomes would be more positive than the current situation
where, frankly, whether someone gets good career advice is a matter of
chance, rather than being something on which someone can
rely.</div><a name="09031268000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that it largely depends on how advice is handled in the
curriculum, which teachers do the job, and the resources that are
allocated&#151;typically, independent schools are much better
resourced. However, the hon. Lady is right. The situation may well be
as the Minister implies: although independent schools allocate a lot of
time to offering advice and it is well resourced, it is skewed towards
particular routes.</div>
<a name="09031268000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want all learners to understand all the options that are available to
them. However, as I said, it is also important that we do not close the
door on advice when people leave school or college. Adult advice is
critical, and the Bill takes some steps in that direction, as I said,
but why not have an all-age, independent careers advice service? Why
not take this opportunity to re-professionalise careers advice in that
way?</div><a name="09031268000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must ensure that children can dream of their future and that those
dreams can be made real. They should be free to dream of craft in the
way that William Morris did with such superb results. How wrong it is
that the political descendants of Morris should place so little
emphasis on the significance of craft that they are not prepared to put
advice and guidance in place to ensure that a new generation emulates
that great man&#146;s achievements. Our amendment aims to go some way
to achieving that, tying apprenticeships to careers and to a real
future for real apprentices, enabling young people and mature learners
to see the path down which they can travel if they wish to become
vocational learners and the craftsmen of the
future.</div><a name="09031268000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will give a full reply, because advice and
guidance, as I said at the outset, is pivotal to whether his ambitions
to build the nation&#146;s skills succeed or
fail.</div><a name="09031268000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031268000573"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Williams</b>: This is one of the more important clauses in the
Bill. We have 256 to get through, and I doubt whether we can do so if
we continue to have such long speeches. The clause is important and
deserves a lot of time and consideration. As it is the only clause that
deals with information, advice and guidance, it is surprising that it
is not right, and that it has attracted a lot of criticism from outside
this place. The heart of that criticism is that the Bill requires a
careers adviser to consider only what they believe is in
people&#146;s best interests. We and many other people believe that
that is simply not strong enough, particularly as one of the drivers of
the Bill, as we have heard so often from the Under-Secretary, is to
enhance the status of apprentices and to encourage more young people in
particular to consider apprenticeships and other vocational courses as
a viable career option. It is a shame that the clause does not require
a careers adviser to mention specifically those opportunities that are
open to young
people.</div><a name="09031268000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
careers advice should be independent, and that has been touched on.
Indeed, the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings thought that
independent schools were good at giving independent advice.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>should be not just independent, but impartial and independent of the
setting in which it is delivered. The Minister for Schools and Learners
seems to support that. On 22 October 2008, he gave evidence to the
Children, Schools and Families Committee&#151;my hon. Friend the
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole is a member, and I used to be a
member&#151;and
said:</div><a name="09031268000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
think that there is sufficient evidence that some schools are advising
pupils to carry on in that institution not because it is necessarily
the right thing for that pupil, but because it is the right thing for
the
institution.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that the Minister believes that it is vital that the person
giving the advice should do so without regard to the particular
interests of the institution&#151;the school or college&#151;in
which it is
delivered.</div><a name="09031268000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
advice and guidance should be aspirational and challenging&#151;the
hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport mentioned that during Innovation,
Universities and Schools questions this morning&#151;particularly in
the context of challenging gender stereotypes. The hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings said that his political correctness
could go only so far, and that advice should be gender neutral. I do
not think that is strong enough. There are entrenched differences in
the career opportunities that people believe are open to them, and the
advice should challenge those preconceptions that people or their
families hold. Parents especially may not always see clearly what
opportunities are open to their children if they and their families
have had the same occupation, and have lived in the same community, for
several generations. My father, both grandfathers and all four
great-grandfathers were miners; I was the first Williams&#151;to
paraphrase Neil Kinnock&#151;to go to university rather than down a
mine, and I was lucky to be encouraged to do
so.</div><a name="09031268000470"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09031268000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
stereotypes in the career options taken by young people, particularly
in apprenticeships, need to be challenged. On advanced apprenticeships,
the Library briefing, which we are using to help us in our
deliberations, states that, of the number of entrants for vehicle
maintenance and repair apprenticeships, only 1 per cent. are women. I
do not know whether the women in the room will sympathise with this,
but my women friends often tell me that they feel that garages mislead
them about the nature of the work being done on their cars. Indeed, I
have often felt that myself, so maybe having more women going into
motor maintenance would counter
that.</div><a name="09031268000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Child
care has been in the news today, and 98 per cent. of entrants into
child care apprenticeships are women. That means that some young boys
may not have a male role model, which could have a detrimental effect
on their development. The only occupation that is more or less balanced
is hospitality and catering, where 51 per cent. of the entrants are
women.</div><a name="09031268000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031268000574"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): Does my hon.
Friend agree with the YWCA that that is leading to a gross inequality
in wages and lifestyles? Girls tend to go into lower-waged
occupations.</div><a name="09031268000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000575"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> Absolutely. My hon. Friend makes an excellent
point. I refer back to vehicle maintenance. I am sure that, every time
we take our cars for repairs, we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>have an almighty shock when we discover how much they often cost. Such
highly valued, in terms of remuneration, and highly skilled occupations
seem to be closed off to young
women.</div><a name="09031268000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000576"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will also recognise
that many of the skills and trades on offer through the apprenticeship
system&#151;plumbing, electrical trades and so on&#151;offer
significant opportunities for young women, once they are qualified, to
work on a self-employed basis. That offers enormous flexibility to
manage children, and all the other things that women often have to do,
as well as providing a good
income.</div><a name="09031268000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000577"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention,
which speaks for itself as an entirely valid
point.</div><a name="09031268000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
support the amendments. It is important that advice is aspirational and
challenges stereotypes wherever they are held. In the new educational
landscape that we are embarking on, it is vital that by 2013 every
young person should be able to access a diploma. Furthermore, it is an
aspiration of the Government&#146;s that every young person who wants
to enter an apprenticeship should be able to do so. We can disagree
over whether the 50 per cent. target for entry into higher education is
a valid one, but we all want everyone who could benefit from HE to
enter into it, which leads me to the importance of progression. Not
only is it important that people receive advice on the different
academic and vocational pathways that are open to them, but also that,
once they access those pathways, they continue to receive inspirational
advice and guidance to ensure that they understand the available
progression
opportunities.</div><a name="09031268000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the universities of Derby, Sunderland and London South Bank,
which is just across the water from us, already recognise
apprenticeships as an entry qualification for HE. I hope that other
higher education institutions that now offer foundation degrees and
other vocationally oriented higher educational qualifications will look
at the new diplomas and apprenticeships as valid claims for
entry.</div><a name="09031268000207"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000578"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman, who is making
a cogent argument, supports our view that there should be a better
route from apprenticeships into HE that creates a pathway for a
vocational learner from a diploma through to an apprenticeship and
beyond? Many will not want to take such a path, but those that will
should have it facilitated for them; barriers could be removed via
financial support, for
instance.</div><a name="09031268000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000579"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
I am not sure what the Conservative proposals for smoothing the path
from apprenticeships into higher education are, but they sound like a
worthwhile objective, which I
share.</div><a name="09031268000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
conclude by referring to an amendment that for some unknown reason was
not selected for discussion. Whatever the nature of the advice and
guidance that is offered to young people, it should be open to
inspection by Ofsted. Will the Minister comment on how an assessment of
the careers advice and guidance that is provided for in the Bill will
be made? Much store has been set by it, but how will we know that it is
of sufficient quality to deliver the objectives that we all
share?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div><a name="09031268000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000580"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> It is a pleasure to take over the ministerial
baton from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, and I pay tribute to the
excellent way in which he started our proceedings. I have discovered a
charming and conciliatory side to his character&#151;I knew it was
there, hidden away. It is an equal pleasure to respond to the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings. He is
iconic of a certain type of parliamentarian. I will not start to guess
what type, but he has certainly demonstrated that in our proceedings so
far.</div><a name="09031268000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to put to rest the misconceptions about the effect of the clause
and explain how it fits with the duties that are already in
place. Legislation under section 43 of the Education Act 1997, as
amended by section 81 of the Education and Skills Act 2008, which we
remember debating just last year, already requires secondary schools to
provide a programme of careers education to their pupils&#151;the
change that was made last year&#151;and in discharging this duty, to
provide impartial information and to give advice that promotes the best
interests of their
pupils.</div><a name="09031268000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will be underpinned by the statutory guidance that is currently
in preparation and which I have been considering. My Department will
consult formally on the guidance later in the year, and I expect it to
set out core information and advice on 14-to-19 learning options,
including apprenticeships, which all young people should receive. I
reassure the Committee that every young person will get information on
apprenticeships, thanks to the implementation of the amendment made
last year, which was implemented through statutory guidance.</div>
<a name="09031268000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
evaluation of those matters will be included in the self-evaluation
process. The delivery of information, advice and guidance by local
authorities, as delivered by Connexions, which was also the subject of
the 2008 Act, will be assessed as part of the comprehensive area
assessment carried out by the local
authority.</div>
<a name="09031268000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000581"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Indeed, Kieran Gordon, the expert witness from
Connexions, referred to the 2008 Act. He said that it
&#147;might&#148; make the matter more assertive. The matter he was
referring to is the independent advice and guidance that we have been
discussing. Why does this Bill not mirror that in the strength of its
provisions? Mr. Gordon feels that it does not go far enough.
Is he
wrong?</div><a name="09031268000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000582"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I will go on to develop that point and directly
address it. It is important to establish in the minds of the Committee
that every young person will get information about apprenticeships as a
result of the statutory guidance. Mr. Gordon has not yet
seen the guidance and so he is not in a position to judge&#151;no one
is&#151;because we have not yet agreed it or published
it.</div><a name="09031268000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
young people will have specific needs and will want further advice on
apprenticeships that reflect those needs. The clause emphasises the
duties of schools with regard to apprenticeships by requiring them to
consider the best interests of each pupil when giving advice. The
effect of the clause will be to ensure that schools provide appropriate
and differentiated advice that is tailored to meet the needs of
individuals.</div><a name="09031268000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
established that every pupil gets information on apprenticeships, there
will be some who are not suitably qualified for them. It would be
unreasonable to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>burden schools and make them give pupils advice and guidance on
apprenticeships if they are not suitably qualified. That is an example
of why the stance taken in the Bill is correct, when the matter is
considered in conjunction with what we are doing in statutory
guidance.</div><a name="09031268000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000583"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> That is a good point, but it is not a very good
point, if I might say so, because we are talking about a pathway. The
sort of advice given to a young person who was not suitably qualified,
in the Minister&#146;s terms, might be about pre-apprenticeship
training, which, once they had gone down a path, might lead to an
apprenticeship. I am not sure that we would not give advice about the
destination as part of giving advice about the
journey.</div><a name="09031268000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000584"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am sure that that is the kind of matter that
will be well covered by the information in the comprehensive element of
the statutory guidance which we want to see in every school. How those
sorts of pathways, as set out in the qualification strategy last year,
will affect people&#146;s options later on in life as they continue
learning and move into work will be set out in that guidance. I hope
that I have briefly and relatively accurately set out for the Committee
why we think that we have taken the right
decision.</div><a name="09031268000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Gender
and other equality issues, as explored by the hon. Member for Bristol,
West and by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport, are
important. At the moment, in terms of the apprenticeship routes, some
apprenticeships are very much dominated by one gender, and the ones
dominated by women tend to be the lower-paid apprenticeship routes. We
have recently been raising the minimum apprenticeship wage to assist
those working in the care sector and hairdressing, for
example.</div><a name="09031268000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope&#151;it is certainly our intention&#151;that, through the new
information, advice and guidance standard, which will apply to all
local authorities, and through the changes that we are making in the
Bill and through the previous Act, we will raise considerably the
standard of information, advice and guidance for young people. However,
those are not the only things that we are
doing.</div><a name="09031268000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are establishing a network of advocates from among school leaders
through the National College for School Leadership. We are delivering
classroom materials and case studies as part of the Department&#146;s
careers education support programme and making personal, social and
health education, which is where much of the careers education takes
place, a statutory subject. In addition, 800 14-to-19 briefing sessions
are taking place with schools and colleges to explain the options for
16 to 18-year-olds so that there is better information in
the school system as a whole. We are currently reviewing the
information, advice and guidance element of the schools self-evaluation
form in terms of the Ofsted inspection and we are improving the online
guidance and services, which so many young people are now using, to
improve the quality
further.</div><a name="09031268000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was glad that mention was made of the diplomas, which offer routes into
apprenticeship as much as into the full range of higher education
institutions and into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>work. The experience so far of those who have been learning through the
diploma route is that we have still got a bit further to go on the
gender of pupils taking options in diplomas, but there are good
opportunities for us to use the engagement offered to learners by their
involvement with diplomas. Those learners are really enjoying the
diplomas. We are getting positive feedback, which in turn can
allow us to challenge things. On the elements of the equality duty,
getting more young people of all genders who want to go on to be
architects, surveyors, estate agents, builders, electricians or
plumbers into the construction and built environment diploma, for
example, is a route into an apprenticeship that would help to break
down some of the
barriers.</div><a name="09031268000471"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="09031268000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools
could do more to ensure that young people receive advice about
apprenticeships. That said, there is good evidence of Connexions
offering some success between the autumn of 2002 and 2004. Ofsted
carried out four inspections of 28 Connexions partnerships, and 89 per
cent. of those were rated as satisfactory or better and 60 per cent.
were rated as good or better. Since its inception, Connexions Direct,
the national service, had handled more than 1.3 million contacts from
young people by the end of last year, with around 25,000 young people
now contacting the service. The service is popular and, from assessment
and feedback, the vast majority&#151;92 per cent.&#151;of young
people are satisfied or very satisfied with the quality of service that
they received. We want to do better, so we are including the measure in
the
Bill.</div><a name="09031268000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
23 would address some of the points in different ways. I noted that the
hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings did not want to table an
amendment on an all-age careers service, so I shall not take up too
much of the Committee&#146;s time responding to that element of the
debate. Suffice to say, there are differences between the needs of
adults and young people in the issues that they face and the solutions
that they require. There is a difference between an all-age service and
an all-age strategy. We are in the process of developing our all-age
careers strategy so that we can link the common issues, but in terms of
the service, one size does not fit all, and it is important that we
have discrete and articulated services to suit the needs of different
groups in our
society.</div><a name="09031268000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would ensure that when young people receive advice and
guidance, they have a clear understanding of what apprenticeships are
about and what they can mean for developing a career. I am happy to
agree that any advice they receive should cover those points, which
would help young people come to an informed decision about which route
is for them. I shall certainly ensure, as we develop our guidance to
schools later this year, that that is
achieved.</div><a name="09031268000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
different interpretation of the amendment might be that it is another
ingenious means by which the hon. Gentleman can perpetuate his
contention that the apprenticeships that we have delivered, and will
continue to deliver, are somehow less than real apprenticeships. That
ground was covered so eloquently and ably by my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary that I do not propose to go over it again. On the basis
of my assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will, with his
customary good grace and good manners, feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div><a name="09031268000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000585"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> It is true that I am immensely well mannered. I
make no comment about grace, because that would be far too
bold.</div><a name="09031268000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000586"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that
to describe himself in Committee as immensely well mannered is a little
vulgar.</div><a name="09031268000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000587"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I am both well mannered and a little vulgar. That
is because I do not come with the gilded history of the Minister of
State for Schools and Learners&#151;public school, Oxbridge and all
that stuff. I share the antecedents of the hon. Member for Bristol,
West, which is perhaps why I empathise with his remarks about the
importance of giving all young people the best advice, so that we can
feed social mobility by that
means.</div><a name="09031268000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point about independent schools, which the Minister did not fail to
comprehend, but with which he was incapable of empathising, was that if
the wherewithal resides with those who are already disproportionately
advantaged, we will cement social division and inhibit social mobility
unless we redistribute advantage. Advice, information and guidance is
critical to such
redistribution.</div><a name="09031268000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much
of what the Minister said was fair, and occasionally good, but it was
certainly not good enough. I do not cite my views&#151;he might take
them to be prejudice and feel that I am partisan on such things.
Instead, I cite the expert witness, Kieran Gordon. He could scarcely
have been more critical of the Bill. I asked:</div>
<a name="09031268000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Has
the Bill gone far enough on strengthening the mechanism by which
quality independent advice can be offered to young
people?&#148;</div><a name="09031268000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
said, in a simple
sentence:</div><a name="09031268000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
do not think it
has.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
I asked him whether the kind of careers service that I have advocated
herein would reprofessionalise careers advice as a separate
professional discipline. He said, in an even shorter sentence,
&#147;It would.&#148; He went on to
say:</div><a name="09031268000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
issue we might have with apprenticeships&#151;referencing back to
those schools with sixth forms&#151;is that the young people entering
apprenticeships tend to be the same cadre of young people that the
school wants to attract back in to do A-levels or the 16-to-19 elements
of the
diploma.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
said that there can be &#147;a conflict of interests&#148;
accordingly. He also said that the Bill does not go far enough in
respect of the
ability</div><a name="09031268000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
promote and make young people aware of
apprenticeships.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Apprenticeships,
Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,</i> 3 March 2009;
c. 57, Q155 and
156.]</div><a name="09031268000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could
go on. What was clear was that Mr. Gordon&#146;s analysis
was altogether closer to that of the Opposition than that of the
Government.</div><a name="09031268000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000588"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman has quoted at
length from what Kieran Gordon said and I am sure that Mr.
Gordon was an excellent witness. However, does he not recognise that
Mr. Gordon did not have the benefit of my excellent
contribution to this debate today, where I have explained in some
detail the interplay between the Education and Skills Act 2008 and the
provision in this Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div><a name="09031268000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000589"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> As I said in an intervention, Kieran Gordon
referred to the 2008 Act, and although it is certainly true that he
would not have heard the Minister for Schools and Learners
today&#151;unless he had the power of prophecy or something
similar&#151;he understood that the 2008 Act was firmer about this
issue than is the Bill. I think that what he had expected was, as I
indicated earlier, a Bill that mirrored the 2008 Act with a firm
commitment.</div><a name="09031268000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me put this issue in context. In 2008, a study by YouGov found that
only 24 per cent. of teachers agreed that apprenticeships are a good
alternative to A-levels. That is a far smaller proportion than the same
survey found among parents, for whom the figure was 43 per cent., or
among young people themselves, for whom the figure was 52 per cent.; as
for employers, 55 per cent. felt that apprenticeships were a good
alternative to A-levels. The Skills Commission&#146;s report on
progression through apprenticeships, which will soon be published,
reveals that teachers consistently underestimate the extent to which
young people, parents and employers value apprenticeships. For example,
although 47 per cent. of teachers believe that young people think that
apprenticeships are not a good alternative to A-levels, only 19 per
cent. of young people think that they are not a good
alternative.</div><a name="09031268000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2008 YouGov survey also found that teachers have less knowledge of
apprenticeships than of any other learning route, except for the Welsh
baccalaureate. I know almost nothing about the Welsh baccalaureate, but
I am sure that either the hon. Member for Bristol, West or the
Under-Secretary will be able to enlighten us about it in due
course.</div><a name="09031268000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why we need this all-age professional career service. The hon.
Member for Bristol, West is right that it needs to be independent, but
it also must have empiricism and offer advice that is not slanted and
gives real emphasis to the vocational pathway. That means talking about
apprenticeships to people who are not yet ready to pursue them, so that
they can understand where they might end up. If we do not articulate a
strong case for apprenticeships at all stages, people will not dream of
an apprenticeship as the outcome that they might
achieve.</div><a name="09031268000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Young
people start to think about university long before they can go
there&#151;when they enter secondary school, perhaps even earlier. My
own son told me when he was five that he wanted to go to Trinity
college, Cambridge. I said, &#147;Why Cambridge?&#148; He replied,
&#147;Because it is in the fens and you could still read me my
bedtime story and I would be able to come home for my hot
dinners.&#148; That seemed to me as good a reason as any to go to
Cambridge. However, it illustrates that, very early in their lives,
people start to dream of what they might achieve. If we do not make
enough of vocational pathways, those dreams will be slanted very much
by their familiar experience, the social group to which they belong and
the interfaces that they enjoy during their
childhood.</div><a name="09031268000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment, as the Minister fairly said, does not go as far as we would
wish. A new clause might do just that. Perhaps we will have a chance to
debate one later on. But the amendment would at least take us further
than the Minister is prepared to go and further down the line that
Mr. Gordon wants us to take. It would take us towards the
elevation of the practical, which lies at the heart of all of my
considerations of this matter. In so doing it would feed social
mobility by adding opportunity to those across society, but
particularly those who are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>most disadvantaged. For that reason, and because of our passion for
vocational education, because of our belief in independent, free and
fair advice, and because of our support for the careers profession too,

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
37</h4><a name="09031268000014"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Apprenticeship
sectors</div><a name="09031268000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">2.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000604"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Clause 37 requires the Secretary of State to
specify apprenticeship sectors. The Government intend them to be based
on the current sectoral coverage of sector skills councils which, as we
have heard, are employer-led, independent organisations, whose goals
are to fill skills gaps and shortages, improve productivity and the
skills of everyone in the sector&#146;s work force. The Minister
spoke earlier about the scope of the sector skills councils and how
that might change, as skills needs change and as skills themselves
alter. How is that flexibility consistent with the
clause?</div><a name="09031268000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000605"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Clause 37 provides that the Secretary of State must
specify the sectors, trades or occupations covered by the
apprenticeship scheme and that he do so by order. The clause is
necessary to the effective function of the apprenticeship scheme.
Apprenticeship frameworks  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>need to relate to a particular skill, trade or occupation included in an
apprenticeship sector. Places on the apprenticeship scheme for young
people need to be in a specified apprenticeship sector and young
persons have to choose two sectors. For them to be able to choose two
sectors, it needs to be clear what the sectors are and what the choice
is, which is why they need to be
specified.</div><a name="09031268000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifying
the sectors across which apprenticeship places are to be available will
also ensure that opportunities for tackling particular skills gaps or
shortages are identified. It will also mean that the National
Apprenticeship Service can operate its national
vacancy-matching  service properly, supported by sectoral
knowledge and understanding of the sector skills councils. The clause
is therefore critical.</div>
<a name="09031268000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000606"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I was wondering whether the Minister would say
something about flexibility for sector skills councils. The
specification of sectors would presumably need to change if sector
skills councils were to broaden their scope to encompass different
skills. We spoke earlier about whether that would be affected by the
Bill, and if so, in what
way.</div><a name="09031268000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000607"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I assume that, because the clause gives the
Secretary of State the power to issue an order, if it were necessary in
the future to vary the designations of the sector skills councils, my
right hon. Friend would issue a fresh regulation to that
effect.</div><a name="09031268000273"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000610"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It is a pleasure to take over the shadow ministerial
baton from my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The
Deepings. Henceforth, there will be no more juicy or ursine prose from
Opposition Members. Our contributions will become more prosaic and, if
I may so, a little dull&#151;with the Liberal exception, of course. I
am sure that we shall be hearing plenty of ursine and porcine phrases
from Liberal Democrat Members.</div>
<a name="09031268000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 39 is
an important provision giving employees the right to request time off
to train or study. Proposed new section 63D(3) of the Employment Rights
Act 1996, which the clause would insert,
states:</div><a name="09031268000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
application must be made for the purpose of enabling the employee to
undertake study or training (or both)&#148;.</div>
<a name="09031268000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is refreshing to see
a reference to study and training in an education Bill from the present
Government, rather than the catch-all words &#147;learning&#148; or
&#147;learner&#148;, which have become the latest jargon designed
to obfuscate rather than to clarify. &#147;Time to Train&#148;, the
consultation document published last year by the Department for
Innovation, Universities and Skills, talks about giving
employees</div><a name="09031268000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
right to a serious conversation with their employer about their skills
development&#148;.</div><a name="09031268000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservatives agree with that right. The proper training is essential
in any business&#151;for example, restaurant staff should know the
details of a menu. I am sure that the staff at the restaurant that my
hon. Friend was at last night knew the menu backwards and were able to
describe it to him extremely well. Other examples showing how the right
training is essential include doctors in a GP surgery, accountants
providing tax advice and employees fitting components on an assembly
line. A business that fails to train and develop its staff will not be
successful. Sometimes, however, an employee&#146;s personal ambition
might be overlooked by an employer. An employer might be happy, for
example, to let a good kitchen assistant continue in that role rather
than let them train to be a chef. Another example could be a staff and
associate specialist doctor who wants to train to become a
consultant.</div><a name="09031268000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
impact assessment
states:</div><a name="09031268000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Over
a third of people with poor literacy and numeracy receive
benefits...compared with less than one in ten of those with better
skills.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why the Conservative party makes no apology for its focus on reading
in primary schools, or for its insistence that, instead of the
whole-language approaches that have dominated over the past 40 years,
schools employ tried and tested methods such as synthetic
phonics&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I thought that I
would get that into my first major contribution to the line-by-line
scrutiny.</div><a name="09031268000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
impact assessment considered three options: doing nothing, employing a
voluntary approach and legislating for a right to time to study. The
Institute of Directors
says:</div><a name="09031268000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
merits of pursuing a voluntary approach were not adequately explored.
No evidence was presented to support the implication that employers are
not open to training requests, deny employees 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>the opportunity to discuss training needs or do not treat requests
seriously. Employees already have the &#145;right&#146; to request
training &#151; there is no bar to these conversations
whatsoever&#148;.</div><a name="09031268000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
IOD adds
that</div><a name="09031268000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Skills
are crucial to the UK's future competitiveness, but so is the
maintenance of a low regulatory environment in which business and
enterprise can flourish. The introduction of a right to request
training is not simply the wrong solution, it adds to the pipeline of
impending regulations that will add to the administrative burden on
employers. This is undesirable in any case. In the middle of a
recession, it is spectacularly
unhelpful.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s response to those genuine concerns expressed by the
IOD would be helpful.</div>
<a name="09031268000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000611"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I hope that before the hon. Gentleman sits down he
will share some of his own views on the IOD&#146;s views, as that
will help me to formulate my
response.</div><a name="09031268000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000612"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I certainly will. In fact, I already have&#151;I
said that Conservative Members support the right to train. Measures
could be introduced to relieve the administrative burden on businesses,
while maintaining the right of employees to request time to
train.</div>
<a name="09031268000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The IOD
points out that many businesses hold regular appraisals with their
employees, during which employees&#146; training needs are discussed.
It therefore suggests in its brief to the Committee
that</div><a name="09031268000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where
employers already offer documented annual appraisals which include
discussion of training needs, such provision will constitute grounds
for fulfilment of the right to request training
obligations...Without such a change those employers that already
provide opportunities to discuss training needs will become subject to
repeat requests for training: a burden that penalises those
organisations that already have existing provision for training
discussions.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
11, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, has the same source. That
amendment states that an employer can refuse an application for time to
study made under proposed new section 63D of the 1996 Act
if</div><a name="09031268000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
documented discussion of training needs resulting in a decision on
whether to extend such provision to the applicant took place within the
previous 12
months.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree with that sensible amendment, which is designed to assist
companies that have a good and exemplary approach to training and staff
appraisal.</div>
<a name="09031268000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 103
would amend clause 39 in a similar fashion. The CBI has said that it
&#147;supports the new right&#148; to request training</div>
<a name="09031268000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in principle,
but it must be implemented in a way that is flexible for business, with
the focus on skills development and not
time-off.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
points out that data from the Learning and Skills Council show that
business invests about &#163;39 billion a year on training. The
CBI&#146;s survey found that 89 per cent. of firms have a training
and development plan. It therefore wishes the legislation to be clear
that</div><a name="09031268000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where
a firm already has good arrangements for discussing training in place
(eg. annual performance reviews), training needs can be dealt with
through these existing arrangements without recourse to
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="09031268000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
103 would therefore insert a preface to proposed new section 63D(1) to
ensure that it will apply only if a suitable arrangement for discussing
training is not in place. That is a sensible
amendment.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div><a name="09031268000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">We support the
objectives of clause 39, which are to ensure that recalcitrant
businesses do what they should to encourage their employees to improve
their skills, but if we take the CBI figure of &#163;39 billion spent
on training and compare it with the calculated benefits of the clause
of between &#163;200 million and &#163;400 million&#151;set out
in the impact assessment on pages 76 and 77&#151;it is clear that
current training expenditure is up to 100 times greater than
the anticipated benefit of the new right. That shows that the clause is
aimed at a minority of businesses, so it makes sense to try to ease the
administrative and regulatory burden of the provision for those
companies that already have exemplary training and appraisal processes
in place.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000613"></a>Annette

has just made regarding deaf children shows that synthetic phonics is
not always the best method of teaching children to
read?</div>
<a name="09031268000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000614"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It is the best method of teaching children to read.
There is no question about that; all the evidence demonstrates it.
However, there might be alternative and additional methods for children
with specific neurological or aurological conditions. That is not a
reason for not applying synthetic phonics in all mainstream primary
schools in the country, because the method works for the vast majority
of children who do not have neurological or aurological conditions. If
we can deal with all those children first, we will have the resources
to focus on those with very special needs who require extra
help.</div>
<a name="09031268000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NDCS goes
on to say that, according to reports,</div>
<a name="09031268000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;many teachers
currently spend one morning over a four year course looking at the

NDCS believes that teachers should be entitled to training on how to
teach children with special needs. Amendment 77 is a probing amendment
that is designed to ensure that the provisions of the clause will apply
to teachers who want to improve their skills in teaching children with
special needs. If the Minister clarifies that the clause applies to
teachers in those circumstances, I will not press the
amendment.</div><a name="09031268000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seek the Minister&#146;s clarification regarding another group of
professionals. The British Medical Association is concerned about a
group of doctors known as staff 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>and associate specialists&#151;a grade of doctors that used to be
called, more simply, non-consultant career grade. Such doctors might
use the provisions of the clause to seek further training to help them
progress. The BMA&#146;s concern is that an NHS trust might not
regard it as beneficial to its operation for junior doctors to improve
their skills and progress, because they are too valuable in their
current role. However, it would be beneficial to the NHS as a whole if
all doctors in that grade could improve their skills.</div>
<a name="09031268000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
section 63D(4) of the 1996 Act states that the training or study must

performance of the employer&#146;s
business&#148;.</div><a name="09031268000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
BMA would like clarification of what the business is for the NHS. Does
it apply to the trust in which the doctor works, or to the NHS as a
whole? The BMA argues that SAS grade doctors need improved access to
training to develop the specialist knowledge and skills that would
enable them to offer their potential to the trust and the wider NHS.
That is essential to the modernisation of the NHS and would deliver
improved patient care. The BMA seeks clarification on the definition of
&#147;the employer&#146;s business&#148;. Is the business the
trust or the NHS nationally? I would be grateful if the Minister

under the clause, so I will be brief in discussing this group. We
welcome the recognition of the importance of training, particularly by
private sector employers, for the good of businesses and their
employees.</div><a name="09031268000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
share some of the concerns outlined by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton. Many British businesses have exemplary records in
providing training for their employees. My experience from working in
the private sector for large companies and consulting firms for 17
years before becoming an MP was that the quality of the training was
often second to none. It formed a superb part of my professional and
personal
development.</div><a name="09031268000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">None
the less, some businesses do not do their best to provide training for
their employees. It is those businesses that we should provide with a
legislative nudge, but it is important that the nudge does not unduly
affect the performance and practices of businesses that already provide
such opportunities. We should ease the regulatory burden on
them.</div><a name="09031268000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberal
Democrat amendment 11 reinforces the amendments that were tabled by the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Businesses should be
able to show that they have good appraisal procedures, which include
discussion of the training needs of employees. All hon. Members are
employers. A key part of the appraisals that I hold with my staff is
asking what training they need to enable them to perform their role to
a better standard. I am sure that we all undertake such discussions and
that they are documented. The purpose of amendment 11 is to make the
provision unnecessary if a training discussion has already taken place
as part of the employer&#146;s personnel practices, as long as it has
been held in the preceding 12 months and was
documented.</div><a name="09031268000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000616"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I thank and commend the hon. Gentleman for his
brevity; I have rather more remarks to make than I would ideally like,
but I shall try to get through them. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>I shall speak to amendment 11, and given that this is the
first time that we have spoken about this big issue in clause 39, I
shall make a few general remarks about the clause and the policy as a
whole. Before I do so, I shall quickly respond to one or two of the
questions from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton,
which may not be covered in my otherwise voluminous remarks.</div>
<a name="09031268000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
slightly hurt and disappointed that the hon. Gentleman chose to read
out all those very intemperate words from the IOD, even though he
explicitly, on behalf of his party, does not agree with any of them. He
only did it because the IOD was beastly about the policy. The CBI, as
he knows, welcomes the scheme&#151;as do the hon. Gentleman and the
Liberal Democrats&#151;and the extra opportunities that it brings for
learning in the workplace. I will come on to the teacher issue later,
but the basic answer is, yes, teachers will certainly be covered by the
legislation and will have the right to request the training that they
need to teach young people with all manner of learning difficulties and
special
needs.</div><a name="09031268000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
doctors, the answer is that the employer will be the trust. That is a
fundamental principle of the legislation. We are defining an employer
and an employment relationship in the normal way that they are defined
in law. In the circumstances the hon. Gentleman mentioned, the
doctors&#146; employer would be the NHS trust rather than the NHS
generally. If there is an issue of the sort the BMA highlighted, we can
look at the matter again and talk to colleagues in the Department of
Health about them looking at it as well. Altering the legislation to
change the definition of &#147;employer&#148; is not the way to
address the problem. We decline to do it, but if there is a problem,
colleagues elsewhere in government will look at it and I will join
them, if
necessary.</div><a name="09031268000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall say a few words about the policy in general. The hon. Gentleman
mentioned the &#163;38.6 billion that employers spend on training. In
this place, we sometimes forget that employers spend their own money
investing in training because they know, more than anybody, how
important it is and what a difference it makes to the success of their
business. Although I recognise that employers invest a great deal in
training, that investment is not universal. Too many adults struggle
with low or out of date skills, and about a third of employers do not
provide any sort of training for their staff. That is 8
million people a year going without training of any kind. Ultimately,
that is what the provisions are intended to address.</div>
<a name="09031268000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
provisions, employees will be given a new right to make a statutory
application to their employer for study or training. In essence, it is
a request to spend time undertaking study or training that will improve
their effectiveness at work and the performance of their
employer&#146;s business. The new right is closely based on the
flexible working model, with which employers are familiar and which the
CBI, at our oral evidence session, described as an outstanding
success&#151;I am paraphrasing. We have stuck to that model pretty
closely, which should make a big difference and make it easier for
employers to work with the new arrangements.</div>
<a name="09031268000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Employees
will be able to request any training that will make them more effective
at work and improve the productivity of the business that employs
them.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div><a name="09031268000319"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031268000617"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): What will happen if the
employer disagrees with the employee on the effectiveness of that
training? What will happen if the employer says, &#147;I do not
believe that training will make you more effective in the job you are
doing or any of the jobs that we would be able to offer you subsequent
to that
training.&#148;?</div><a name="09031268000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000618"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The employer and the employee will need to have a
meeting and the employer will have to give reasonable grounds why they
do not feel the training is appropriate. It will be for the employer to
determine the grounds and what is reasonable.</div>
<a name="09031268000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
will be of particular importance to employees in organisations that do
not operate effective systems for considering the learning and
development needs of their staff. Mindful of the need to protect
business from excessive burdens, the standard position will be that
employees will be able to make a statutory request that the employer
needs to consider only once in any 12-month period. Employers will need
to consider requests seriously, will need to hold a meeting to discuss
the application with the employee where appropriate and will need to
respond within a set time frame. Who will cover the costs of the
training and whether the employee will be paid during the time spent
training are matters to be agreed between the employer and the
employee, but there will be no obligation on the employer to meet
either. There are a number of acceptable business reasons that an
employer can use to refuse a request, including where the training
would not improve the employee&#146;s effectiveness or improve the
performance of the employer&#146;s business. Giving employees a right
to a serious conversation with their employer about their skills
development will help to encourage and support adults to improve their
skills and to rise as far as their talent will take them. The right to
request time to train goes with the grain of what the best employers
are already doing, as Members have said. It will help to encourage
others to follow that example, change the culture and develop the
skills we need for the future.</div>
<a name="09031268000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 103
would have the effect of preventing employees whose employers have in
place an annual review system for considering training needs from being
able to request time to train. I assure the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton that I understand the aims of the amendment and
I recognise that  many employers are doing good work, which
perhaps the legislation&#151;and we certainly&#151;ought to
recognise  and appreciate. The amendment is closely linked to
amendment 11, tabled by the hon. Member for Bristol, West,
which by adding a further reason for refusal to the list  of
permissible grounds in new section 63F (7) has a similar
aim.</div>
<a name="09031268000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000619"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> What will be deemed a reasonable amount of time to
train? I am sure it is covered in the Bill. Would it be two weeks a
year or four weeks a year? What would be deemed the maximum amount of
time someone could take off in a year to train and increase their skill
levels?</div>
<a name="09031268000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000620"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The answer is as before. It would be a matter for
employers to agree with employees but the employer will have the
determining say.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div><a name="09031268000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our approach
would not be to exclude employees in a firm operating a good annual
review system from the right for time to train, as proposed by
amendment 103. The proposal goes against the grain of what we are
trying to do, which is to shift the culture and move basic assumptions.
The amendment risks making the eligibility criteria too complicated. We
think it is important that the right is accorded to every employee who
meets the basic eligibility criteria. We do not want to risk putting
off any employees who want to exercise that right, particularly those
who need it most. In essence, we want to keep the decision over whether
to exercise the right with the employee. We want to encourage people to
take responsibility for their own training and development and we think
employees will be best able to judge whether they need to use the right
to access the training they need to get better jobs.</div>
<a name="09031268000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, and if we were going down that route, we would prefer the
proposal set out by the hon. Member for Bristol, West in amendment 11,
which would not deny the employee the right to make the request but
would add to the permissible grounds on which an employer could refuse
the request, as the employer would already have invested time and
effort in considering the employee&#146;s needs and would have acted
on meeting them where
necessary.</div><a name="09031268000473"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="09031268000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aim of the policy has always been to ensure that an employee has access
to a serious discussion with their employer about their skills and
training needs at least once a year. It is therefore right that as a
matter of course we take account in some way of the circumstances in
which that is happening, but we do not want to commit to introducing
such an additional reason on the face of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09031268000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">We anticipate
that those who had their training needs addressed following some sort
of training review are less likely to feel that they need to exercise
the right, so we question whether that is a necessary additional
safeguard for employers. The Bill as drafted carefully balances the
rights of employers on the one hand with those of employees to make the
request on the other. It is important to take time to consider whether
adding to the permitted grounds for refusal could upset that balance.
We did not consult on the basis of the situation set out in amendment
11, and before we made any changes of the sort proposed it would be
important to take account of the views of all interested
parties.</div>
<a name="09031268000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
amendment raises a range of second order issues about how to define
some of the relevant terms to ensure that it does not create potential
loopholes for employers to avoid their responsibilities. What, for
instance, would a satisfactory appraisal and development system look
like? All those are important issues, and I hope that it will be clear
from what I have said that we have considered them carefully, and I
hope that hon. Gentleman will accept my assurances that we will
continue to do so. I also hope that, while these issues remain
unresolved, hon. Members will understand that I do not feel comfortable
accepting either amendment today. However, there is a power set out in
proposed new section 63F(7)(j) that will enable the Secretary of State
to specify additional grounds on which requests may be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>refused so that we can bring in such a reason through regulation if
discussion revealed that there was support for such a measure, and
those would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny under the negative
resolution procedure. I hope that that explanation is welcomed by hon.
Members opposite and that, on the basis of the commitments I have made,
they will agree to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09031268000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
77 concerns a different issue. It would include in the Bill a specific
reference to qualified school teachers with responsibility for teaching
children with special educational needs to ensure that they are
eligible to make requests for time to train where training would ensure
that the needs of the children could be met. The hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings has told us what underlies the amendment, and
I have been happy to assure him that the training needs of such people
will be met under the legislation.</div>
<a name="09031268000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to highlight a couple of things quickly before moving on to address how
the amendment would affect the clause. The first point worth noting is
that all teachers have, as the amendment suggests,</div>
<a name="09031268000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;responsibility
for educating children with special educational
needs&#148;,</div><a name="09031268000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">particularly
now that we have more inclusive learning environments. Specially
commissioned materials have been created through the inclusion
development programme, which is funded by the Department for Children,
Schools and Families, for serving teachers and the assistants who work
with them on areas of SEN that we know they find difficult. The first
of those materials, on children who experience communication
difficulties, was published in 2008, and similar resources on autism
are to follow this month.</div>
<a name="09031268000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
supporting a series of practical measures for training teachers through
the Training and Development Agency for Schools, such as the creation
of new study unit material that training providers can use to
strengthen those elements in their courses. Funding has been provided
to encourage training providers to take up the units, and pilot
institutions are working with others in clusters to show how the new
resources can be successfully incorporated into existing courses. I can
assure the hon. Gentleman that there is already action in hand to
address the issue.</div>
<a name="09031268000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the amendment and clause 39, I can confirm that, under new section 63D,
employees who are teachers of children with special educational needs
are treated the same way as other employees. There is no need for
specific provision to accommodate them. Teachers will be qualified as
employees under these provisions and will be able to make requests for
time to train, where they are employees as defined in the Employment
Rights Act 1996 and met certain other limited conditions. They must
have been employed by their employer for the necessary period specified
by the Secretary of State. They must not fall within
subsection 7 of new section 63D and, on that
basis&#151;finally&#151;I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09031268000335"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000621"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I listened very carefully to the words of the
Minister. I am sorry that he was offended by the beastly remarks of the
IOD. I am happy to cite its views; as a pluralist, it does not worry me
that I do not necessarily 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>agree with every word. I thought that it raised some important and
necessary points and the Committee has benefited from the IOD&#146;s
views, given that it represents a large swathe of British
business.</div><a name="09031268000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am reassured by what the Minister said about teachers, that they will
be covered by the provisions in clause 39. That is a welcome assurance,
but he underestimates the concerns of the teaching profession about the
lack of training for SEN&#151;half a morning in a four year course,
though it may well be longer than that&#151;but the NUT has produced
its own report about the difficulties faced by the teaching profession
when it comes to helping children with special educational needs in the
best way
possible.</div><a name="09031268000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
doctors, could the Minister confirm that the employer will be the trust
and not the NHS as a whole? That will be a disappointment to the BMA,
but it will be encouraged by his promise that the matter will be raised
with the Department of Health. If he were to participate in
those discussions, if the BMA were to press the matter, I am sure that
it would be happy to hear that.</div>
<a name="09031268000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that the Government were mindful of the need to prevent burdens
and that is a reason why he ought to be trying to find a way of
incorporating these provisions into the legislation. He argues that an
amendment would take away the right to request time off in
circumstances where there are annual appraisals. Well, yes, we are
suggesting taking away the right to request time off to train where
employees have the right to request time off to train&#151;it just
makes absolute sense. I listened very carefully to what he said and I
detected some softening when it came to the wording of the amendment
and that he was more inclined to accept, or was more sympathetic to,
the wording prepared by the IOD, which has been tabled as amendment 11.
If the hon. Member for Bristol, West were to press amendment
11 to a vote, I am sure that I could persuade Conservative members of
the Committee to support his
amendment.</div><a name="09031268000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000622"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> If we were to move for a vote soon I would be
minded to press, with your indulgence, Mrs. Humble, for a
Division to take place specifically on amendment
11.</div>

Gibb:</b> No, I am very happy. On the basis of that assurance
from the hon. Member for Bristol, West, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
amendment 103 and I look forward to support amendment 11 when it comes
to the
Division.</div><a name="09031268000342"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000625"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment 104, in clause 39,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000626"></a>The

amendment 10, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000627"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The amendment seeks to put into clause 39 an
additional detail that an employee would have to include on what is to
become known as a &#147;section 63D application&#148;. As currently
drafted, the employee has to put the proposed subject matter of study
for training on his application: where and when it would take place,
which would provide or supervise it, and what qualification it would
lead to. The amendment adds a fifth requirement, to provide the date
when the employee last made a request for training. That is because
clause 39 gives the statutory right, as the Minister has just said, to
ask for time off to train or study only once in every 12 months, as set
out in new section 63F of the Employment Rights Act 1996. The
IOD&#151;I am sorry to cite it again&#151;argued that such an
amendment would make the administration less onerous for businesses,
and would also stop the frequency of declined requests on the grounds
that they fell within 12 months of the last request made by an
employee. It agreed that this would be a very simple addition to a
section 36D application and an easy piece of information for an
employee to include in his application, but it would be hugely
beneficial in terms of time saved for employee
years.</div><a name="09031268000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 10,
in the name of the hon. Member  for Bristol, West, is a similar
amendment, which we  also support. It is important, when
introducing and imposing such duties on the business sector, that we,
as legislators, do everything that we can to minimise the
administrative burden. All Governments claim that they want to do that;
the Minister himself said that we want to prevent such measures from
becoming a burden. Well, here is a classic opportunity for the
Government to help, by simply accepting one or the other of the
amendments.</div>
<a name="09031268000347"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000628"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> In line with the position of the hon. Gentleman
speaking for the official Opposition, we do not have any preference for
either of the amendments: they say exactly the same thing, though in
slightly different places in the Bill. They both try to reduce
administrative burden, which is important to all of us. It should be
done wherever possible, without hampering the provision of
training.</div><a name="09031268000348"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000629"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am getting a little confused regarding the
amendments. On the previous amendments, my position was that we did not
want to put them on the face of the Bill, but we took the point, which
we thought was fair, and we were looking into doing it by regulation. I
thought that everybody would be delighted, but apparently, the
amendments will still be pressed to a
vote.</div><a name="09031268000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
amendments 104 and 10, we do not think that they are essential, but we
agree that it will be a useful right for employers to have, and we
firmly intend to achieve the aim by regulation. While it is not a
detail that needs to be on the face of the Bill&#151;it is too fine a
level of detail for that&#151;we intend to achieve it by regulation,
as how it is done regarding flexible working arrangements. On that
basis, I eagerly anticipate that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton will withdraw his amendment, because we are, on 
this occasion, certainly&#151;rather than
possibly&#151;going  to do exactly what he and other hon.
Members want, but by regulation.</div>

Minister has convinced me that we have achieved what we set out to do.
I look forward to that regulation, and on the basis of the

Brooke:</b> I will, of necessity, be rather brief, as you,
Mrs. Humble, will appreciate that a handover is taking

debate. I will make my points clearly and concisely.</div>
<a name="09031268000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">All four

be difficult to challenge or rebut in any way. Amendment 247 makes that
same point. Amendment 248 is particularly important. If a permissible
ground for refusal is the burden of additional cost, how much is that?
Is it &#163;1, &#163;2, &#163;10, &#163;10,000? We have to have
something to tighten that up and add</div>
<a name="09031268000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unreasonable in
proportion to the value to be derived from the proposed study or
training.&#148;</div>
<a name="09031268000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no doubt that
that needs to be tightened up, even if the Minister finds it impossible
to accept the amendment today. On amendment 249, it is easy to add
weasel words to &#147;insufficiency of work&#148;. It would be much
clearer to make the test &#147;inability to provide sufficient
work&#148;. I hope that the Minister will regard those comments
favourably.</div><a name="09031268000474"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000634"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> In order for these provisions to work properly it
needs to be clear that an employer has decided whether a ground
applies. Including the term &#147;reasonable grounds to think&#148;
introduces a level of uncertainty and creates a more complex test. The
grounds on which employers may refuse requests are quite extensive and
it should be possible for employers to reach a considered view as to
whether a ground applies in a particular case, as they already do for
flexible working requests. In practice, when considering declining
requests  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>employers will have to consider which of the permissible grounds for
refusal applies and why this ground or grounds apply. They will then
need to explain this to their employee when they notify them of the
decision. The requirement for the notification will be set out in
regulations.</div><a name="09031268000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
flexible working provisions on which this was based work in exactly the
same way and they work very well. They also contain a provision that
the employer may refuse an application only if he considers that one or
more of the prescribed grounds applies. There is no requirement for the
employer to have &#147;reasonable grounds&#148;. However, if the
employer does not have reasonable grounds to think that a particular
ground of refusal applies, it is assumed that he will not be able to
give the necessary explanation in the decision notice and it is open to
the employer to challenge the decision on the basis that it is based on
incorrect
facts.</div><a name="09031268000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
248 and 249 both propose changes to the reasons for refusal in
subsection 7 of new section 63F. I sympathise with the
intention behind amendment 248, but I assure the hon. Lady that it is
not necessary to achieve its aim and it would be too restrictive.
Accepting the amendment would limit the use of the additional cost
reason to an unhelpful extent. It would mean that an employer could
cite this reason only where they were able to show that the additional
costs were greater than any value to be gained from the proposed study
or training. We also think that the provisions as they stand already
cater for this.</div>
<a name="09031268000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an
employer carries out a cost-benefit analysis and concludes that the
costs outweigh the benefits, this seems likely to mean that overall the
proposed study or training will not lead to an improvement in the
performance of the employer&#146;s business. In which circumstance we
think that an employer could pretty certainly use the ground in section
63F(7)(a), which states that the proposed study or training to which
the application relates would not improve the performance of the
employer&#146;s business. Equally, the employer could conclude that
were they to meet the costs in circumstances where no overall benefit
was derived, it could have a detrimental impact on the performance of
the business. In such a case the ground in subsection (7)(g),
&#147;detrimental impact on performance&#148;, could be cited.
Therefore, we think there is ample coverage already to address to scope
of these amendments.</div>
<a name="09031268000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 249
would have the effect of redefining one of the permissible grounds for
refusal set out in section 63F(7). Rather than specifying insufficiency
of work, it would refer to inability to provide work during the periods
that the employee proposes to work. While I understand what hon.
Members might mean with this amendment, we do not want there to be any
suggestion that an employer would have to seek to provide alternative
work for the employee at relevant times such as where the employee
suggested a change to their current working arrangements to accommodate
the training. We want the sufficiency of work during the period
proposed to be considered in the light of the employer&#146;s current
business situation.</div>
<a name="09031268000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course
there is a need for flexibility and there can&#151;and probably will
be&#151;discussions between an employee and employer about how to
accommodate the training request which might result in some
rearrangement by an employer.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div><a name="09031268000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">The employer
does not have to rely on that reason for refusal if they do not want
to, but we think that the available reason for refusal is better looked
at from the perspective of insufficiency of work rather than the
employer&#146;s inability to provide it. That will be a simpler
reason for employers to apply.</div>
<a name="09031268000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
on that basis hon. Members will feel able to withdraw their
amendments.</div><a name="09031268000368"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000649"></a>Annette

clause 39, page 20, line 37, at

that employee is employed by an employer who employs less than 20
employees;&#146;.</div><a name="09031268000390"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000650"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to take
Government amendments 183 and
184.</div><a name="09031268000391"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000651"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> According to my information, the amendment refers
to line 27, but it should apply to line 37. The suggestion
for the amendment has come from the Federation of Small Businesses. It
urges the introduction of an exemption for businesses with fewer than
20 employees so that they can continue to hold one-to-one informal
meetings, without the need for union representation.</div>
<a name="09031268000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">The figure of
20 is based on the number of members that a union must have to be
recognised by a business.  If we translate this to even smaller
businesses, with perhaps three or four employees, it puts the measure
in context as to whether it would be practical. The Federation of Small
Businesses makes the point that the best way in which to engage small
businesses with the policy  is to keep it informal, making it
easy to identify necessary
training.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div><a name="09031268000393"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000652"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> We believe that the amendment is a sensible measure
to support small businesses, provided that it is put into the right
place in the Bill. According to the impact assessment, 1,019,295
micro-businesses that employ fewer than 10 employees. That represents
83 per cent. of firms, but 20 per cent. of employees. Taking that
number up to 20 employees, as proposed under the amendment, the
proportion would increase to somewhere between 20 and 37 per cent. I
guess that it would increase by about a
quarter.</div><a name="09031268000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government might argue that the amendment would deny this important
training right to too many people&#151;to one quarter of employees;
but, we would argue that to lose one employee in a firm of just 10 or
20 people for a period of training could be disastrous for
that company. Then, no doubt, the Minister would argue that new section
63F(7) provides grounds for refusal of a request for training in those
circumstances, but there is an administrative burden in dealing with
the request. The manager of the firm, presented with an official form
that purported to give an employee the right to time off, would then be
required to look up  the provision, read the legislation and
determine that  he could refuse the request on the grounds of
new  section 63F(7)(c),</div>
<a name="09031268000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;detrimental
effect on ability to meet customer
demand&#148;,</div><a name="09031268000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
he might then have to prove. Since most people who run small businesses
are not lawyers, the manager would almost certainly have to take legal
advice to come to that view. It would be better, therefore, to remove
small businesses from the provisions all together.</div>
<a name="09031268000396"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000653"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am slightly confused now about which part of the
Bill the amendment seeks to amend. I previously took the amendment to
be related to the part where it would actually be inserted, rather than
the part where the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole
subsequently told us she intended it to be inserted. Where it would
have been inserted, it would
have&#151;</div><a name="09031268000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000654"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. For the Minister&#146;s benefit, I read
out that the amendment is proposed at clause 39, page 20, line 37. We
are debating that part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09031268000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000655"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> In which case, we are talking not about whether we
exempt small firms from the provisions all together, but about whether
we exempt small firms merely from the part of the Bill that deals with
the opportunity to take a colleague along to the meeting at which the
right to train is requested. On that basis, although I shall go into a
little bit more detail, I shall take a little more convincing if hon.
Members seriously believe that the Bill requires an exemption to the
provision for people to take a friend to a meeting.</div>
<a name="09031268000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Evidence
shows that, of employees without a level 2 qualification, about one
quarter are in a workplace with 10 or fewer people. It therefore
follows that employees in smaller businesses are more likely to be in
need of support when discussing with their employer a request for time
to train. We also want that right to be as simple as possible for
employers to operate, so setting up different rules for different
groups of business would add complexity and break the close alignment
that we seek with flexible working, which has been recognised as a
factor in making the new right easier for employers to work
with.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div><a name="09031268000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">We therefore
see no reason to restrict who is given the right to have a companion go
with them to meetings about new section 63D applications. I also draw
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to the way in which the provision
has been defined in the indicative regulations that were provided to
the Committee. They state that a companion must be, first, someone
selected by the employee, and, secondly, a worker employed by the same
employer as the employee. That is quite straightforward and reflects
our policy intention.</div>
<a name="09031268000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000656"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I hope that the Minister, before he concludes his
remarks, will speak to his own, Government
amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000657"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I shall and, indeed, was just about to seek
permission to speak to Government amendments 183 and 184.</div>
<a name="09031268000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 183
relates to the scope of the regulation-making power in new section
63F(4) and how it can be applied to people who act as companions. The
amendment would make a technical change to new section 63G(1) to make
it clear that the regulation-making power at new section 63F(4) was
wide enough to enable regulations to be made about the rights of those
who act or seek to act as companions not to suffer detriment, and about
unfair dismissal. It is clearly important that those people receive the
proper protection when they act as a companion under the
provisions.</div>
<a name="09031268000475"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div>
<a name="09031268000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 184
is a minor technical amendment that would simply ensure that new
section 104E in the Employment Rights Act 1996 was consistent with the
other provisions that clause 39 inserts. The amendment would correct a
minor error in new section 104E, replacing &#147;learning
support&#148; with &#147;section 63D&#148;, the term that is used
elsewhere in the clause. On that basis, I urge hon. Members to withdraw
their support for the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000661"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Both amendments seek to allow employers to act if
the employee is not using the time off to attend the course, which is
perfectly reasonable. I am slightly concerned about the many cases
where there will be good reason for not attending a course, such as
being rushed into hospital, so would prefer some softening on the edges
of the amendments, which both seek to do the same
thing.</div><a name="09031268000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
taught in a college of further education for many years, so I am aware
that students can turn up for the first session and then not again for
a long time. It is important that we give employers the backing to
support training; therefore, some provision needs to be made, but
possibly it should be a little more humane than what is in the
amendments.</div><a name="09031268000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000662"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Briefly, these IOD-inspired amendments were tabled
to tackle the very real issue of what happens if the employee, having
been granted time off to study, simply fails to attend courses. They
impose a duty on the employee to inform their employer that they are
not attending the course. That seems entirely reasonable, and we
support the direction of travel taken by the two
amendments.</div><a name="09031268000413"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000663"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> First, I was not at all surprised to learn that the
hon. Lady spent a long time in a further education college. She
revealed herself in the past few minutes to have picked up a set of
competencies, as they are now called, which show her to be practical,
resourceful and resilient under testing circumstances&#151;skills
which I do not doubt she honed in the FE
sector.</div><a name="09031268000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton tells us that people
need to have their training attendance ensured and enforced, and they
certainly do. Our firm belief is that those provisions are in place in
the Bill, and that the amendments are
unnecessary.</div><a name="09031268000415"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031268000664"></a><b class="B">Bill
Wiggin</b> (Leominster) (Con): Is it the Minister&#146;s
understanding, therefore, that if an employee did not turn up at his
training and did not say anything about it at all, that would be
grounds for a gross misconduct charge or lead to
dismissal?</div><a name="09031268000416"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031268000665"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I cannot say whether that would lead to dismissal.
Would it be a disciplinary issue? Yes, and I shall explain
why.</div><a name="09031268000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Leominster will be fascinated to learn that proposed
new section 63H, which is to be inserted in the Employment Rights Act
1996,
states:</div><a name="09031268000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
employee must inform the employer if the employee...fails to
start&#148;</div><a name="09031268000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div><a name="09031268000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fails
to complete the agreed study or training...undertakes, or proposes
to undertake, study or training that differs from the agreed study or
training in any
respect&#148;.</div><a name="09031268000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
includes a requirement to inform the employer of any change as to when
the agreed study or training is to take place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div><a name="09031268000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
the section is wide-ranging. It will capture instances of failing to
attend more than two consecutive periods of study or training, as
proposed by the amendment, if it had been agreed that the employee
should attend those periods. It is better to include this broader
requirement than to set what might be arbitrary minimum requirements
for attendance, which might not in any event apply to all training
requests that are granted. Many will not involve more than one period
of study. The measure will give employers the assurance and oversight
that they need to monitor whether employees are fulfilling their
responsibilities.</div><a name="09031268000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings us to the nub of the issue and amendment 13. If
employees are required to report the fact that they failed to start or
to complete the agreed study or training or that they undertook a
different course of study or training, why is there no corresponding
power for employers to withdraw support if those events occur? In our
view, legislating for the circumstances in which an employer could
withdraw their support, having previously agreed to a request, would
make the provisions complicated and difficult to operate. It is not
done like that in flexible working, which works very well. If we gave
employers a right to withdraw support in the Bill, we would have to
give employees a right to appeal in the Bill. In the interests of
flexibility, it is best to allow the employer and employee to reach an
agreement between themselves on the circumstances in which the employee
should no longer be able to continue with the agreed study or training.
That will enable the individual circumstances of the employer and the
nature of what has been requested and of the absence to be taken into
account.</div><a name="09031268000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
certain circumstances, the employer&#146;s normal disciplinary
procedures may apply if the employee fails to attend the agreed
training. In other circumstances, in which the employee&#146;s
request was only for a short course or on-the-job training, the
employer&#146;s withdrawal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>of support would be unlikely to be so significant. The employer may
consider taking into account the failure of an employee to attend a
course when dealing with future requests. We plan to issue guidance to
employers and employees to assist with this aspect of training. We
shall consult stakeholders and business representative bodies on the
guidance before it is
issued.</div><a name="09031268000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is one other minor point, which I hope hon. Members will not mind me
mentioning here. It is not accurate&#151;hon. Members generally have
not done this today&#151;to refer to time off when considering
training under these provisions. This is a right to request study and
training. In many cases, that will not be time off. It is important to
bear it in mind that time associated with the new right will be spent
training for the good of the business. On the basis of all those
comments, I hope that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole
will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09031268000424"></a>
