<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000349"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you all for submitting
evidence and for coming to be questioned this afternoon. We will start
with a question from James
Brokenshire.</div><a name="0901286000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><a name="0901286000350"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): The Bill deals
with certain offences and the creation of mandatory
requirements. The Secretary of State may set out national mandatory
requirements, and local authorities will be permitted to impose
additional requirements on licensees within specific areas. Will
witnesses state what information they have been provided with to date
on the conditions that will be expected? One difficulty for the
Committee is understanding what conditions are likely to be required.
It would be useful to hear from industry representatives and the police
the types of conditions they expect to see imposed through the
mandatory code requirements, given that the code is yet to be drawn up
and
finalised.</div><a name="0901286000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>Certainly. On behalf of the
Association of Chief Police Officers, I largely welcome the proposals
in the Bill. As for examples of mandatory requirements, the things that
spring to mind that need discussing are a range of possibilities around
pricing&#151;special officers, two for the price of one, 24 hour
drinking, vertical drinking spaces, and trying to create an arena where
more people sit down and drink, rather than cramming a lot of people
into one place. There is also a real opportunity to do something about
advertising and the sale and presentation of drink. I can best
exemplify that by describing the sort of things I saw in my local
supermarket over Christmas. There were mountains of phenomenally
reduced very strong lager&#151;50p a can&#151;and drink could be
purchased from different parts of the premises, rather than through the
normal cash till. There are a range of options that it might prove
useful to discuss and form some agreement
on.</div><a name="0901286000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shane
Brennan:</b></i> We do not know&#151;we are in the dark, as
Members are&#151;exactly what will come forward. We know in broad
headline terms that the Government are considering things like price
and promotions, as my colleague has just said. They are also
considering issues such as the training of staff and other things,
particularly in the category B area. The biggest concern that we have
at this point is that we do not know the scale of what we are talking
about or the parameters of what we are looking at. That limits the
ability of what we can say at this stage in terms of
specifics.</div><a name="0901286000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> I expect to be told broadly what might be in
categories A and B on Thursday. Parts of the on-trade have been invited
to meet Home Office officials, so we might have some idea on
Thursday&#151;we are expecting so. However, before we get
there&#151;or possibly after, if we are not told&#151;we face the
same problem as other people on the panel. You can speculate, and if
you do so, you face enormous costs, which is the biggest problem that
we are concerned about under these circumstances. As a Parliament, how
can you be asked to approve an enabling clause, when we really have no
idea what is included, let alone what the costs or the benefits
are?</div><a name="0901286000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000351"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Department of Health published a code at
one stage that set out certain requirements that got into the public
domain. Is your understanding that that is the model, or will the
Government be moving away from that?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div><a name="0901286000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> My understanding is that large parts are no
longer likely to be included, but we have no certainty about that. The
document to which you are referring seemed to be like a basket of
everything that anybody could think of&#151;it was truly a basket
case. One has to remember throughout that the mandatory elements of the
proposal relate not only to the places that Shane and I represent, but
affect all licensed premises, whether a hotel, restaurant or tourism
venue. Many castles and the like have licences, as well as Wimbledon
and Ascot. All those venues would be affected by any
code.</div><a name="0901286000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000352"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Mr. Shenker, perhaps you could
indicate your thoughts on the conditions issue and the effectiveness
and appropriateness of the mandatory conditions
route.</div><a name="0901286000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Don
Shenker:</b></i> To start with, I would like to say that we
are broadly in favour of the Bill and are very much in favour of the
introduction of a mandatory code&#151;or enabling powers for a
mandatory code. As all the speakers have said, the point of having the
enabling power is that there can be some consultation on what would be
the most useful elements to have under national
conditions&#151;category A&#151;and which would be local. They have
to be proportionate to countering the level of harm that we have seen
in both the on-trade and with some of the loss leading and deep
discounting through the off-trade. Clearly, the evidence shows that to
try to tackle price, it would be far more effective to do so on a
national level. Even sectors of the industry would say that if you are
going to do anything about price, it is easier to manage it on a
national level rather than locality by locality. I will defer to my
colleagues perhaps to argue something different.</div>
<a name="0901286000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly, some of the more
ridiculous price offers have to be tackled&#151;for example, where
women can come in free between 10pm and 2am, or can have free vodka all
night. Some of those promotions, which we have seen in different
localities, have to be tackled. The question is whether to tackle them
on a national level, by having a ban on happy hours throughout, or
whether to leave them to local decision making. After consultation, we
will get greater understanding of those issues. At Alcohol Concern, we
do not have a definite view yet as to what the absolute national or
local conditions should be. We are very keen that price is tackled,
both in the on and off-trade. We are keen, too, that price promotions
of the type that I have mentioned are dealt with. However, it is clear
that many premises act responsibly, and they should not be burdened too
much with a national condition. We have to find the right balance, in
short.</div>
<a name="0901286000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><a name="0901286000353"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): The category B conditions
are local measures that could be applied in areas where there is
concern about anti-social behaviour or nuisance&#151;the kind of
issues that are one of the licensing principles, if I may put it like
that. The issue here is that if a particular venue is said to be
causing disruption, you can effectively seek a licensing review under
the existing powers of Licensing Act 2003. In other words, the local
authority can review the licence and additional conditions can be
imposed. The category B requirements seem to have the potential to
fetter local authorities, saying they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>only able to impose the conditions prescribed by the Home Secretary.
What is the Local Government Association&#146;s view of the
interrelationship between the existing Licensing Act review provisions
and the proposals of this second limb of the mandatory code, with these
additional conditions that local authorities could
apply?</div>
<a name="0901286000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
White:</b></i> A lot of this relates to the difference
between dealing with a single premises and dealing with a collection of
premises. The difficulties with dealing with single premises is that
local authorities do not have the power to initiate a review&#151;it
has to be done by the police. I think I understand the reasons, but it
is a problem for us and local residents find it difficult to
understand. We would first urge that councils themselves, using
information not least from local councillors, should be able to
initiate a review of a particular premises. That would make a huge
difference with problem premises.</div>
<a name="0901286000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where you are dealing with
collections of premises, there is not a great difference between having
nationally imposed conditions and locally permitted conditions.
However, nationally imposed conditions will naturally be ham-fisted and
will not necessarily take local circumstances into account. Local
conditions imposed by councils could have certain advantages, if an
area had more than two premises with similar difficulties. Often, that
will not be the case. There will be a pub with vertical drinking, and
next door will be the nice restaurant where that sort of thing does not
take place. Then, there will be the other pub where older people go
because they do not want to go to the younger pub. In those
circumstances, local conditions are not going to be very useful.
Nevertheless, we welcome additional flexibility&#151;the more powers
we have to exercise locally, the better. We remain nervous about any
national approach to licensing conditions, whether that is a national
imposition or a national position.</div>
<a name="0901286000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000354"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Do you have any concerns about the local
condition procedure? We want some certainty and, if local authorities
are to have discretion, it must be clear how they will exercise that.
From my perspective, the provisions have some echoes of the procedures
adopted with the alcohol disorder zones and that whole regime. Do you
see some parallels and equally some of the issues raised in relation to
the effectiveness and appropriateness of ADZs?</div>
<a name="0901286000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
White:</b></i> There are parallels with alcohol disorder
zones, and there has been lobbying from many quarters, not least
ourselves. Councils should have stronger powers in that regard.
However, I do not feel that this is as useful a way forward compared
with simply having a regime under which there is clarity through a
licensing policy that is there for all to see, which is debated,
discussed and refreshed every so often, and which the trade can see in
a particular area. Dealing with individual premises as problems arise
might help a bit, but, other than in extreme cases, it probably will
not do
so.</div><a name="0901286000038"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000355"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Mr. Brennan, perhaps I can ask you
about the potential business impact of the changes. In particular, page
23, paragraph 19 of the regulatory impact assessment&#151;this
relates the impact assessment of the code of practice for the alcohol
industry&#151;which states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div><a name="0901286000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However, we recognise
that in the short run, there is the potential for significant
transitional costs including job losses and the closure of small
businesses.&#148;</div><a name="0901286000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">How seriously
should we take that
paragraph?</div><a name="0901286000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shane
Brennan:</b></i> I think we need to be very concerned about
what that might entail. It is very specific about the conditions in the
consultation&#151;we are in the dark on these. If we look at the
recommendations of the regulatory impact assessment, such as training
requirements, the estimates are in the tens of millions of pounds for
the industry&#151;I think that those may be conservative. In other
areas, such as tackling under-age sales, those requirements, which are
placed on a blanket basis across all types of premises, are so
inflexible that they may impose significant and inappropriate costs on
premises. It is alarming that that may lead to the closure of
businesses at this
time.</div><a name="0901286000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000356"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> There is a balance to be struck between harm
reduction and the importance of ensuring that we deal effectively with
binge drinking, but we need to do that in a proportionate way. In terms
of the impact of the measure, do you have any feel of the numbers we
are talking about? Are we talking about hundreds of businesses that
might close? Can you give any feeling to the Committee based on what
you know thus
far?</div><a name="0901286000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shane
Brennan:</b></i> It is hard to do that, because we do not
have the details about exactly what has been said. Looking at the
figures in the regulatory impact assessment, we have estimated a cost
of about &#163;100 million for the training requirements.
Imposed on our sector, that would significantly undermine the
operational ability of tens of thousands of smaller businesses. Whether
it would force them to close, I do not know, but it would certainly
affect them. The British Beer and Pub Association has worked on those
problems in its
sector.</div><a name="0901286000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Don
Shenker:</b></i> I cannot see how anyone would object to the
training of people who serve intoxicating substances. People who serve
alcohol are serving an intoxicating substance, and they must consider
the law in relation to under-age sales and serving to drunks. It would
be completely remiss of anyone to argue that there should not be any
training. We need to establish that it is good practice to ensure that
people are trained.</div><a name="0901286000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way in which people are trained is a matter for debate. Having looked
at the regulatory impact assessment, I was surprised at the cost. We
found online training at a fraction of the cost outlined in the RIA for
bar server training. We found a &#163;20 per person online course
from Learn2Serve. There are low-cost ways of doing this, and there are
low-cost ways for licensing authorities to be confident that people who
are serving alcohol in their locality have been trained, whether they
are a student on a summer break or a long-term member of bar staff. It
should be established that training is good practice, and large
retailers and producers all talk about the training that they provide
for their staff. We are asking for training to a minimum standard to be
a mandatory condition to serve alcohol, which is an intoxicating
substance. The question is: what is a minimum standard?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div><a name="0901286000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> To pick up on what has been said, and on
Mr. Brokenshire&#146;s question. I think everyone knows
that 39 pubs are closing a week&#151;that is 39 families losing their
businesses. We must remember, too, that they employ accountants,
cleaners, bar staff and others. We are talking about a large number of
people in our sector alone. We have a calculation just on duty, and we
think that over the next five years, the escalator may well cost 59,000
jobs in our supply chain for brewing and pubs. That does not take into
consideration the off-trade or other elements. What is striking about
that quote&#151;and there are a number of other quotes in the
RIA&#151;is that it effectively says that it is a price worth paying.
I thought it was bad enough to say that to people who were losing their
businesses last July when it was originally written, but to include it
in a document published this winter, when we are touching 2 million
unemployed, will be quite offensive to most people.</div>
<a name="0901286000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is also striking about the
RIA is that it projects the cost of a 1 per cent. fall in alcohol
consumption. That has been achieved, according to the latest figures
from Customs and Excise. There has been a 5.1 per cent. fall in all
alcohol consumption over the past 12 months, which shows the
impact the current state of the economy is having on our businesses.
What is also significant about the RIA is that it contains no costing
at all for unemployment&#151;in other words all the people I have
just referred to. There is, quite rightly, a costing for the impact on
the economy of violence and health of alcohol and the like. There
should also be a costing for the social costs of unemployment, because
the state has to pay out benefits. It is not a balanced RIA, and it has

Brokenshire:</b> Mr. Craik, I just want to come
back to you, and then I will wrap up my line of questioning. I know
that others want to come
in.</div><a name="0901286000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000358"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I do not want to cramp your style in any sense,
Mr. Brokenshire. I want you to have the opportunity to
question witnesses as you feel fit, but I must protect the right of all
parties, including Back Benchers, to ask questions. If you and
Mr. Ruffley have not brought your questions to a close at,
say, 4.30 pm, I will probably move on. If we have spare time left at
the end, I will obviously come back to Members who have already asked
questions.</div><a name="0901286000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000359"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bayley. I come back
to Mr. Craik. The Bill gives some new powers to the police,
although there is some suggestion that the police have wide-ranging
powers anyway to deal with young people in possession of alcohol. What
do you think these provisions add to what you already
have?</div>
<a name="0901286000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> There is a lot in these provisions that we
would, and did, ask for. There is some additional proportionality
around the deterrent effect of the increased sentences. More
importantly, the measure solves some real practical problems for the
officers on the street, such as the ability to distinguish
between  15 and 16-year-olds, to engage in discretionary
interventions that are preventive, such as taking them home and working
with other agencies to prevent them from being drawn into
criminalisation around alcohol. Those first and second opportunities,
particularly in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>clauses 28 and 30, come from our officers on the street saying,
&#147;This is quite awkward at the moment. We need clarity around
this. We need to be able to do something positive with them and not
just resort to arrest at the end of the
day.&#148;</div><a name="0901286000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
some very positive things in the Bill. There are some practical things,
such as the ability to review licensing now, not when the licence is
due for renewal, and to respond to the public&#146;s needs now. It is
quite a broad and well-balanced package. If I were asked whether this
largely provides what we need in relation to the licensing industry and
offending around alcohol, I would probably say yes, given that there
may be some unforeseen things in the future. What it gives us now is a
base to take a more positive view of licensing in future. A very
negative picture has been painted historically, and there is a lot of
doom and gloom around drink-related violence. There is an opportunity
now not just to label places as alcohol disorder zones and deal with
premises as a problem. For example, the Civic Trust is currently
developing purple flag zones, which are based on the concept of the
blue flag for beaches. They will paint a positive picture and describe
a more positive narrative of places for safe, sensible and sociable
drinking in the future. That will be a credit to those places, and will
bring some positivity to the debate rather than the historical
negativity. There is a useful opportunity now to go forward with a
different view.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000360"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Bill makes it an offence for a person
under 18 to possess alcohol in a public place without
&#147;reasonable excuse&#148;. What do you understand by the term
&#147;reasonable excuse&#148; in this
context?</div><a name="0901286000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> Under-age drinking is about what they are
going to do with the alcohol. Are they going to drink it in public? Are
they taking it home, and are they demonstrably on their way home? This
allows officers the discretion to take some intervention with kids who
are on the street all the time. They tend to be, from my experience on
the street, the same kids over and again. It is not the average kid on
the block. These are a relatively small number of persistent kids who
make life miserable for everybody else. The measure enables our cops to
focus&#151;not just dealing with them in the sense of prosecuting
them for offending, but taking those early opportunities with other
agencies to intervene and to speak to parents. An example is what is
going on in south Tyneside, where, between the local authorities, youth
services and ourselves, we have rented a premises, where we take the
kids. We bring their parents along, and that is where the intervention
starts, for both the parents and the kids. It is not just about
enforcement.</div><a name="0901286000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000361"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> But do you not already have the power to take
children back to their parents if they are in an unsafe
situation?</div><a name="0901286000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> Yes, if they are likely to come to harm. This
is specifically for those who carry alcohol. May I tell you about an
experience I had three or four months ago in the summer? The same two
kids were stopped twice in the same afternoon. You take the drink off
them, they go away, and they come back again. It is important that my
officers have the ability to help make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>the problem go away from the street at that time, and not just do
something that results in a prosecution. That is why I think that it is
a well-balanced package in that
respect.</div><a name="0901286000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000362"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I will call Mr. Holmes soon, but
Mr. Ruffley may come in
briefly.</div><a name="0901286000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><a name="0901286000363"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): Thank you,
Mr. Bayley. I will observe your strictures and keep it
short.</div> <a name="0901286000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chief
constable, a question for you on the alcohol provisions, in particular
clauses 26, 27 and 28. As you will understand, we cannot make sense of
them in this Bill unless we understand the precursor provision, since
those three clauses do not create new offences, but merely toughen up
existing law. In clause 26, for the offence of consuming alcohol in a
&#147;designated public place&#148; where a direction from an
officer is ignored, the fine available is bumped up. Clause 27 toughens
up laws against persistently selling alcohol to under- age
individuals. Clause 28, in relation to under-age drinking, says that
officers will be able to confiscate alcohol from under-age drinkers,
whether or not there is an intention to consume that alcohol. So, we
are merely talking not about new law, but about hardening existing
law.</div> <a name="0901286000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, there were quite a few comments from hon. Members to the
effect that those existing laws that I have referred to were not being
properly enforced. Could you give us a better understanding of that and
anecdotal evidence? How many prosecutions or sanction detections are
there under those three precursor pieces of legislation that relate to
clauses 26, 27 and 28? Do you have that
information?</div><a name="0901286000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> No, I do not have that data with me here now.
But what my officers would see as the advantage of the hardening up is
the practicalisation, if I dare make that into a word, of making the
legislation operable to them on the street. There is a notion that you
cannot move on some kids because you cannot tell their ages and they
are not required to give you that information. This is about making it
simple and workable for the cops. I do not think that it will mean more
people coming in through the criminal justice system at
all.</div><a name="0901286000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000364"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> That is quite interesting.</div>
<a name="0901286000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that all of us like to
be seen to be firm on law and order and, therefore, in and of
themselves, these clauses are not problematic for me at all, since they
are toughening existing legislation. However, a repeated theme crops up
in our deliberations in Parliament: if only the existing law tackling
alcohol misuse and its associated disorder could be enforced. The
police do not have the resources they need. Perhaps you can furnish the
Committee with a written submission on the profile of sanction
detections. We are not going to pick on Northumbria, chief constable,
do not worry. I would like data from the Association of Chief Police
Officers on the enforcement levels of existing legislation,
specifically, of the precursor legislation that relates to clauses 26,
27 and 28&#151;not 29, because that is a new offence&#151;so that
the Committee can understand whether the existing law is working,
because it may not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>be being enforced enough, which is what I mean by not working. It may be
perfectly reasonable legislation with the right sentiments and previous
Ministers may have been right to propose it, but do you, the police,
have the resources to utilise the existing powers, never mind new ones?
We would value your ACPO data.</div>
<a name="0901286000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> We will obviously provide what we can. On
enabling resourcing, these are powers that neighbourhood cops and the
response officers who are out there 24/7 use. They are dealing with the
kids who are out late with drink in the parks, on the streets, and
hanging around the estates and the blocks of flats. These are the
powers that the cops on the street on normal patrol in the
neighbourhood use when they are tasked with dealing with drink-related
disorder in their communities. I guess that we probably have as much
human resource in the police service as we have ever had, and we are
probably unlikely to get
more.</div><a name="0901286000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was interested in this morning&#146;s debate about the tensions. If I
had more resources, would I put them into local policing, as I have
just done with another 160 officers in my force, or would I
use them for more serious matters? It is not simply about pouring more
resources on to neighbourhood streets so that there are more officers
doing more, it is about making measures practical and workable for the
officers. I see the clauses as a response to demand, so officers do not
have to move some kids on, when they cannot move other kids on; do not
have to seize alcohol in some circumstances, when they cannot in
others; and can get the job done there and then. Then the public will
see the outcome there and then, and not only see that some kids are
moved on, while others are not; and that some are prosecuted, while
others are not; that some are taken home, while others are not. It is
about giving officers the opportunity to create clarity in their
responses for the benefit of the kids&#151;so that they understand
what is happening&#151;and for the public who are disturbed by kids
drinking in their streets, their parks and their neighbourhoods. It is
about more than just figures, it is about
workability.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><a name="0901286000365"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): To pick up where we have just
left off, I can see the argument about giving more clarity to officers
and I can see the benefits of the change in the law that allowed
officers to seize opened alcohol. I have been out on patrol in
Chesterfield with officers and seen them doing that&#151;it is
effective. However, I am still puzzled by some of the suggested changes
and by how much they are, in effect, window dressing. You used the
phrase &#147;deterrent effect&#148;, but you can already fine
people &#163;500 for consuming alcohol in a prohibited area, for
example, and the point was made on Second Reading that nobody has ever
been fined more than &#163;250, so what is the point of increasing it
to
&#163;2,500?</div><a name="0901286000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> I think that there is a deterrent impact. You
could argue about whether it works. ACPO supports something that would
enhance that deterrent effect and is proportionate. We hope that that
would have an effect on sentencing and the financial tariffs imposed,
but that is for the courts to decide.</div>

more then &#163;250, when it could be &#163;500, would they go to
&#163;1,250 to split the difference again? Is it purely a
psychological deterrent?</div>
<a name="0901286000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike

offenders is clear and obvious, that there is a reassurance value for
the public, and that there is a practical application for

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000368"></a>Paul

whether they thought tougher sentences were
needed?</div><a name="0901286000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike

that people can already be prosecuted for serving alcohol to somebody

much
used.</div><a name="0901286000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> It is difficult because there is time in
between occasions to change the licence holder. Having the opportunity
at the second offence means that we can get in quickly enough. To catch
people doing that is quite an expensive process requiring undercover
test purchase officers or trading standards officers. It is not an easy
thing to do: it is time consuming, and having to do it three times has
meant that people have been slipping through the
net.</div><a name="0901286000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000371"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> One of the things that pub landlords in my area
are indignant about is that all the pressure in the past seems to have
been on them, as licensed premises are the easiest to get at through
regulation. Yet they will say that most of the binge drinkers who are
drunk in their pubs are drunk when they arrive at 9 pm, having bought
cheap alcohol and then drunk it at home before they go out. I assume
you would agree with that,
Rob?</div><a name="0901286000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> There is a growing tendency socially for
people to consume large quantities of alcohol before they go out. All
the statistics show that. We have an obligation to which we must
adhere, which is not to serve people who are drunk. I would like to
emphasise that as far as we are concerned, there are clauses in the
Bill that we support and that we do believe that tackling bad premises
is important.</div>
<a name="0901286000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are right, though. We feel,
as representatives of the pub industry, that it is all too easy to
pursue the landlord and the pub and not necessarily other sets of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>circumstances. As to a code, we have said in our evidence that we do not
want one because that will add to the regulatory burden.</div>
<a name="0901286000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">One thing that must be done,
however, under any form of regulation, is to impose an equal burden on
a small pub or convenience store, which has a low throughput, as on a
big supermarket, for example, which has a high throughput. Otherwise,
if a regulation is imposed on those small venues, it is in effect
closing them. We think that there are other ways of achieving the
objectives.</div><a name="0901286000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to the chief constable&#146;s comments on cost and the question of
prosecution&#151;and remembering that that power of three strikes is
a very new one&#151;I have here the Home Office&#146;s
&#147;Practical guide for dealing with alcohol related
problems&#148; and on page 12 it
states:</div><a name="0901286000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Reviewing
a Licence can be undertaken whether or not there has been a
prosecution. It can prove to be an often quicker and more cost
effective solution&#148;.</div><a name="0901286000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
fact, although there are recommendations in the Bill for increased
prosecutions, and actions taken at a tighter level, the Home
Office&#146;s own document encourages people to review a licence
without a prosecution. There is an oddity
there.</div><a name="0901286000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000372"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Shane, one of the problems with off-licence sales
is that they are more accessible to people who are under age than are
licensed premises&#151;and that would apply to convenience stores.
Another is using alcohol as a loss leader, which presumably you would
argue is more a supermarket issue.</div>
<a name="0901286000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shane
Brennan:</b></i> Yes, loss leading is a supermarket issue and
I do not represent supermarkets. The point about their being more
accessible is one that needs to be understood more clearly. It is
illegal for any premises to sell alcohol to anyone under 18. It is an
imperative responsibility of all licensees to prevent under-age people
from buying alcohol in their premises. So, I do not know whether it is
more accessible. There tends to be a parity of targeted test purchasing
by people who seem to be a problem. There tend to be relatively similar
levels of failure across all different kinds of businesses whether
large, an off-licence or a pub. I am not sure that accessibility is an
issue in itself with regard to under-age sales. It is about stopping
those young people from getting hold of that product, which retailers
have to do. If they do not do that then they have to be prosecuted or
have action taken against them to prevent it from
happening.</div>
<a name="0901286000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000373"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Chris, from a local government point of view,
which is the biggest issue that you want to see tackled by this
legislation&#151;the issue of licensed premises or that of
off-sales?</div><a name="0901286000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
White:</b></i> It has to be off-sales. A previous speaker
mentioned the positive aspects of licensing. We must remember that a
community without a pub or small shop is in serious difficulty.
Legislation should be framed to be generous to pubs and shops where
possible. If they are operated properly, they are places where alcohol
is sold under supervision. In many areas, shops and pubs work closely
with local authorities to ensure that they are operated properly. That
is surely the regime that we want to see. Although I would not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>advocate hammering supermarkets, legislation should ensure that outlets
that are beneficial to the community and to the delivery of a good
licensing policy are helped wherever
possible.</div><a name="0901286000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000374"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Paul, may I say, as I did to your Conservative
colleagues, that I will move on to questions from Government Members at
about a quarter to
5?</div><a name="0901286000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> It is important that you remember we are not
concerned just with enforcement. There are many licence holders in
off-licences and some fairly hapless licensees whom we support and
advise. We help them through their difficulties. If they are in a
difficult neighbourhood where lots of kids persistently try to get
alcohol, we work with them and help them to work with each other under
schemes such as pub watch to avoid the problem. I emphasise that we are
not concerned just with
enforcement.</div><a name="0901286000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Don
Shenker:</b></i> The point about people who turn
up to pubs drunk, having consumed alcohol from supermarkets and
off-licences, goes back to the point about the rise in consumption that
we have seen. Leaving aside arguments over whether that is dipping down
or staying the same, rising consumption has been driven largely by the
cut prices we have seen in off-sales. We must consider what are the
root causes of young people drinking and of crime and disorder in
relation to off-premises. Those problems are largely due to the sale of
alcohol in supermarkets and price promotions in the
on-trade.</div><a name="0901286000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must be
able to tackle the issue of price, otherwise we will see continuing
problems of crime and disorder. We know that having minimum prices in
the on-trade and off-trade will cut down on crime. The consultation
will look closely at the effect of the enabling power on that.
According to university of Sheffield research, if there was a 30p
minimum price in supermarkets alone crimes would be reduced by about
3,800. There is good evidence to show what happens when minimum prices
are introduced for alcohol. That would not necessarily impact on
revenues for the drinks industry. Although the volume of sales might go
down, the price increase would mean that the profits go up or stay the
same.</div><a name="0901286000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000375"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I have one final question for Rob on voluntary
agreements versus mandatory agreements. Pub landlords and club owners
in Chesterfield had a voluntary agreement not to have happy hours,
women drinking free promotions and so on. As the recession started to
bite in the run-up to Christmas some of them broke ranks and were
followed by others. Can such agreements be voluntary or must they be
mandatory?</div><a name="0901286000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> On pricing, we used to have the point of
sale promotions policy, which we discussed with Ministers. I raised it
at the Prime Minister&#146;s summit at No. 10 because we received
legal advice that our operation of it was illegal under competition
law. One of the problems on the issue of price is which schemes can be
operated legally by a group of pubs, even in concert with police and
local authorities. Our advice is clear that such schemes cannot be
operated. Therefore, they must come from other powers. We are not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>convinced that there will be powers that can control price, as Don has
suggested. That comes back to your original point about hammering pubs
as against other venues.</div>
<a name="0901286000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was interested in the
Minister&#146;s comments during the Second Reading debate, when he

<a name="0901286000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was interested in the fact that he said
&#147;might&#148;, because I think there is a lot of doubt in the
Government&#146;s mind as to what powers they can take or give to
local government to tackle the issue of price and promotions. If the
Minister could clarify what is actually intended, I think every
sector&#151;the health sector, the regulatory sector, and the
industry sector&#151;would be overjoyed. We believe that you could
toughen our standards document and operate it against problem
venues.</div><a name="0901286000094"></a>

65</b><a name="0901286000376"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): I want to ask
about the practicality of some of the measures around policing in
public places. There are obviously a number of areas that have total
bans on alcohol in public places, such as several town centres,
including Northampton. Can you say from your experience of policing
such measures what lessons you would take from that about actually

terms of officers&#146; interpretation and
management?</div><a name="0901286000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> Two things matter. One is early intervention
in response to difficulties that the public express. The other is the
ability to task officers to use powers very quickly to make a
difference. So, there is a question of whether we can identify the
problem quickly and whether we can respond quickly enough, which the
measure will enable us to do. There is also a question of whether the
officers have the ability, together with the powers, to make all the
problems go away&#151;together with their partners, as this is not
just a police thing. There is also a question of whether we can not
just get the problem moved off the street for the time being, or a day
or two, as some of our powers allow, but find the individuals
responsible and work with partners to stop the
cycle?</div><a name="0901286000096"></a>

compliance, it will happen on a street when we are not looking. But in
terms of making a real visible difference to the people who live there,
which is really what matters, I think we are capable of making a
success of
this.</div><a name="0901286000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000378"></a>Ms

Yes.</div><a name="0901286000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000379"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> There are particular issues, obviously, about
young people drinking in public places, particularly parks, about which
people have a big grievance. How are you going to manage this, and how
would police officers practically police these kinds of measures,
assuming that the park is a public place, and draw the line between
young people who may be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>drinking and those who might be causing a nuisance, given that we must
consider picnics, pop concerts and so
on.</div><a name="0901286000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> Yes, it is fairly clear from the circumstances
when you get there whether kids who should not have been drinking have
been moved on by the police and have gone to the local park or
riverbank to continue that misbehaviour. That is not the same thing as
meeting someone who is having a picnic. You have to trust the
discretion and judgment of officers on the
street.</div>
<a name="0901286000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000380"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> You are quite confident that all that is
manageable?</div><a name="0901286000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> I think it happens day in and day
out.</div>
<a name="0901286000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> All the evidence that we have in relation to
confiscation is that the police manage it well. I said to Vernon in a
meeting that we had a few months ago with other associations that we
actually wanted greater confiscation powers, because it is that public
nuisance to which you are referring, such as at bus stops and in parks,
that causes a large part of the grief for most of the population.
Therefore, the Home Secretary announced about this time last year a
campaign on confiscation around half-term, which worked very
effectively. I welcomed it on the day she announced it, and I have said
that we would like more confiscation powers. We believe that that works
well with the
police.</div><a name="0901286000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> It is important to note that
confiscation, banning orders and those sorts of things should not be
permanent. The idea is that we should solve the problem, and once we
think we have solved it, we return to a new normality. We might have to
come back to that again in six months or a year, but it should not be a
permanent
thing.</div><a name="0901286000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000381"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I want to ask about the code. Obviously, its
content is for the future, and everyone seems to have their wish list
of nine items that they would like in it&#151;I know that I have
mine&#151;but the key issue for this part is the process. What is
your view on the extent of the consultation? The industry will have
input, but this is a massive community issue, and it is very important
that young people have the opportunity to have some input. How would
you like that to be
managed?</div><a name="0901286000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000382"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I call Mike Craik. Forgive me for shouting your
names if it is not immediately obvious to whom a question is addressed.
That is for the benefit of the <i class="I">Hansard </i>writers. If I really want
to stop you from talking, I shall shout your name very loudly and
repeatedly.</div><a name="0901286000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> You might have noticed that at the start I
hesitated to be the first to suggest a list. I do not think that it
should be a police-constructed list&#151;you are absolutely
right&#151;because this is about hearing all the voices, including
those concerned and particularly young people, who are traditionally
difficult to reach, but are becoming increasingly easier to reach
through IT, schools, the internet and that sort of thing. There are
real opportunities to get some good ideas and pull them together. At
the end of the day, someone has to make the choices and decisions, but
as long as all our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>voices are heard, better choices will be made. I would not for a minute
suggest that it should be just the police&#146;s
choice.</div><a name="0901286000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shane
Brennan:</b></i> I urge that there should be no rush and that
we take time to think through the implications. Some very costly and
complicated things might be brought in, and I am concerned because we
have been told that there will be a shortened consultation period for
this&#151;perhaps eight weeks instead of 12. That is unnecessary and
could be quite dangerous, given what might come in. The biggest concern
is that there will be perverse consequences. I understand that there
are real concerns about targeting and whether this is the right way of
doing things&#151;that is an issue&#151;but mechanisms might be
brought in that have perverse outcomes and harm other parts of the
industry more than the industry people at whom they are targeted. Those
things need to be properly thought
through.</div><a name="0901286000110"></a>

70</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000383"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Is it right that some 14 per cent. of your
members&#146; income is from alcohol-related
sales?</div><a name="0901286000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shane
Brennan:</b></i> On average, but there is a lot of variety in
our sector&#151;from grocers to more off-licence based
businesses.</div><a name="0901286000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Don
Shenker:</b></i> From our perspective, community groups must
be consulted properly. A concern that we have picked up from our
stakeholders is that community groups do not feel empowered to complain
about, or do not know how to complain about, a local pub or nightclub.
Obviously, as residents, they have the power to do so, but people
frequently do not know what the process is. We need to ensure that
consultation goes to various communities and young people so that
people who are affected by rowdy and disorderly behaviour resulting
from premises that are not acting responsibly can have a say on the
sort of measures that they would like to see in local, or even
national,
conditions.</div><a name="0901286000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000384"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Finally, what do you say to those who say that
this is stigmatising young people still
further?</div><a name="0901286000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Don
Shenker:</b></i> On the persistent public possession of
alcohol by young people, it is not clear to me whether the offence is
being found in possession three times within three months as well as
failing an acceptable behaviour contract, or whether that is no longer
one of the measures. The youth alcohol action plan said that we were
trying to drive down youth drinking through the use of acceptable
behaviour contracts, and that the Government would seek to introduce a
new offence of failing an acceptable behaviour contract. Our concern is
that if there is no carrot alongside the stick, you might find a lot
more young people being criminalised not for behaving in a disorderly
or irresponsible manner, but simply for drinking in a public place. I
accept what Mike says about people who consistently upset their
communities, but I would like some reassurance that this is not too
much of a broad brush, and that we are looking at a mixture of carrot
and stick.</div> <a name="0901286000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having some
sort of acceptable behaviour contract would be a better approach,
meaning that we could provide some support for young people who are
persistently causing trouble in relation to their drinking, as opposed
to just drinking. We know that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>more young people are drinking in public&#151;that has been
evidenced&#151;and young people who drink are drinking more. However,
we have to be careful that we do not stigmatise young people who, on a
summer&#146;s day, want to do exactly the same as any 25-year-old
wants to and drink in a public park, for
example.</div><a name="0901286000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
White:</b></i> A couple of brief points. There is a clearly a
risk of stigmatising young people generally in our society. They get a
bad press and we do not give them a great deal to do of an evening,
particularly at those times when they want to socialise with each other
and not with their parents, and between 16 and 17. Although I am not
proposing any solutions to that, we have to be wary of the press that
they get and the feeling that they have, which is that the police are
agin them in respect of some of these rules, albeit for reasons that we
fully understand. Nevertheless, that is how they
feel.</div><a name="0901286000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also
like to emphasise that the complaints that I get in my community are
about not the behaviour of young people, except on the margins, but the
behaviour of people who should know better, including the criminal
activity of people in their 20s who have too much to drink and make
noise and commit disorder offences. That is the key issue in many of
our communities. Although that is not particularly addressed by these
clauses, it is the major
problem.</div><a name="0901286000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><a name="0901286000385"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I have a
question on the same issue, which I shall address to Mike in the first
instance. You are saying really that clause 29 will make operational
and practical the powers that you already have. That suggests that more
young people are going to be brought into the criminal justice system.
You have talked twice about mechanisms that exist to divert young
people from the sort of behaviour that might result from their drinking
in public places, but how confident are you that those sort of
multi-agency programmes exist in our communities? I have seen little
evidence of such programmes, particularly ones directed at 16 and
17-year-olds.</div><a name="0901286000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> Yes, the one that I alluded to&#151;the one
in south Tyneside&#151;was separately funded, but there are
opportunities for
that.</div><a name="0901286000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although there is
anxiety about the criminalisation of young people, I think that the
young people whom we are talking about are few in number. We know who
they are; they are already known to us in terms of being criminalised.
It is not that often that completely new people come into this arena.
If I go out with my night shift and late turn in any of my basic
command units, I see that my officers are dealing with the same kids
over and over again. They are not meeting new people. In some
communities, hardly any new people come in, although there are those
who may grow into such behaviour. One of the more positive things that
I would like to do is to take the notion of partnership intervention
beyond dealing with an individual who comes to notice three times and
ask who are the younger brothers and sisters who are going to be the
next generation and can we direct some partnership intervention at them
as well.</div><a name="0901286000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some work in
Newcastle is going on to try to identify the number of people who cause
the most harm and cost to the health service, the police service,
social  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>services and the youth service. Who are they? Who is in their network?
Can we target them positively, and not for criminal justice
intervention, but for preventive intervention, because I do not want to
be arresting their younger brothers and sisters in five years? Our
capability to do that is dependent on finding out who they are, what
the problem is and where the place is. With such an opportunity, our
limited resources can then be focused on the people who need our
attention the most, not on places, premises, property and
parks.</div><a name="0901286000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000386"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> Nevertheless, would not we conclude that,
even if it is a small group&#151;I am not sure that it is always a
small group in some of our cities, but let us assume that it
is&#151;without resources being directed at preventive strategies, we
are going to bring more young people into the criminal justice system,
and everything should be done to avoid
that?</div><a name="0901286000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> Yes, and if all we do is to shotgun our
resources at an area without focusing on the people who are the
misusers and mis-sellers, there is a possibility of that happening. I
think that we should restrict the possibility of that and focus on the
people who need the preventive intervention as well as those who do not
respond to it and ultimately need
enforcement.</div><a name="0901286000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shane
Brennan:</b></i> There is no desire from the industry to see
lots of young people being put through the criminal justice system with
courts and custodial sentences, but we think that there need to be
consequences for young people&#146;s actions. The case in point, our
members will say, is that we are very aware of the consequences of
doing wrong and selling to under-age people. If we sell to one person,
we may face significant penalties. There are six different ways in
which you can be prosecuted for under-age sales. However, the young
person whom we refuse&#151;and we refuse millions every
month&#151;can go to the next shop down the road and try it on again.
That feeling of lack of consequence&#151;a fear factor&#151;is
absolutely critical. That is why we welcome the powers, although not
necessarily the ones about taking them to court. This is about making
sure the police can go up to them and say, &#147;Do not do that.
I&#146;m taking that alcohol off you. Move away from here because
this is not good for the
community.&#148;</div><a name="0901286000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000387"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> May I move on briefly to consultation
about the code? The view of my local community is that it is very hard
for communities to make their voice heard in the operation of the
Licensing Act 2003. When there are consultations about reviews of
licensing, for example, they seem to get drowned out by the voice of
the industry or police or some other institution. I wonder, Don,
whether you have any advice about what we can do to make sure that
community voices are better
heard?</div><a name="0901286000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Don
Shenker:</b></i> That is a very good question. There are
things you can do. You can work at a local level, disseminate
information through local community groups, for example. The internet
is another method. You have to try to work locally through local
champions and use community approaches to try to engage with people. If
you simply put up a consultation document on the Home Office website
you are going to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>get the usual suspects responding to it. It needs to be disseminated
through local organisations and local public health
groups.</div><a name="0901286000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
White:</b></i> There are two distinct issues about involving
the community. There is the issue about involving them in this
consultation and in consultations on local licensing policies. That can
be done more easily through use of the internet and so forth, provided
that we are confident when receiving the replies that they are not from
an unrepresentative minority. I am concerned that you get those who are
gung ho about licensing legislation and those who are very restrictive.
I have come across pressure groups that have said, &#147;No, we do
not think you should be allowed to put tables outside a pub.&#148; I
think that if we could move to non-vertical drinking outside pubs, it
would probably be an improvement in our social fabric. The group that
advocates that in my area is deeply unrepresentative. You have to
screen that out and behave intelligently.</div>
<a name="0901286000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also the specific issue
about the degree to which local people can influence a particular
licence application or variation or initiate a review. Local
councillors do not have the right to represent their community at
hearings. They have to be asked specifically by a resident so to do,
which is a cumbersome process. While all of us in this room are
confident about talking in a public place in a quasi-judicial setting,
many others are not so confident, particularly the neighbours of the
applicant premises, not because there would be threats but because you
do not like going to a public place and saying, &#147;My next door
neighbour&#151;as is or will be&#151;is a nuisance to me and I do
not like what they propose.&#148; That is a very big thing to say.
Likewise, there is no consistent guidance as to whether a local
authority can advertise the fact that a licence application is in or is
to be varied, in the way, for instance, that a planning application is.
Some authorities take the view that they should do that, others take
the view that the legislation tends to imply that they should not.
Local people would feel more confident if they knew that, were such a
proposal to be made, they would not have to notice a notification stuck
to a lamp post or outside the premises concerned. That would give them
a lot more confidence that they were part of the
process.</div><a name="0901286000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000388"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I do not want to squeeze the Minister out of the
questioning, so I will call him to
speak.</div><a name="0901286000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000389"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Alan Campbell):</b> My first question is to
Chief Constable Craik and follows on from the previous question. If it
comes to a choice between a mix of mandatory powers and local
conditions or local permissive or voluntary conditions available to
existing licensing committees, what do you think ACPO&#146;s choice
would be?</div>
<a name="0901286000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> We would support mandatory powers,
particularly in relation to the issues I mentioned earlier, to set
those initial starting conditions and to ensure that there is
consistency and that people understand it. There should also be local
flexibility to deal with different issues and environments wherever
they may be. The obvious example is that dealing with
under- age drinkers in a park presents a different set of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>problem-solving tasks to dealing with grown-ups who should know better
misbehaving in a town centre on a Friday or Saturday night. On behalf
of ACPO, I support some mandatory powers, but I think that they should
be consulted upon, discussed and agreed, and I should not be the one
making them
up.</div><a name="0901286000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000390"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Mr. Hayward, we need to take
seriously your concerns about pub closures, not only at this time, but
at any time. Are not many pubs closing because there are simply too
many of them, given the changing lifestyle of the British public? Is
that a fair
comment?</div><a name="0901286000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> It is. There are a multitude of reasons why
pubs are closing. We could have a lengthy discussion about that if the
Chairman would allow us, but I am sure that he would not. There is no
doubt that there are a range of issues, but if you were to ask the
companies and individual landlords what the factors are that burden
them, as Mr. Holmes mentioned earlier, the answer would be
duty and regulation. That comes through not only from my sector, but
from the whole tourism and hospitality sector. One has to remember, as
I said earlier, that that impacts on all licensed premises because it
is mandatory policy, so there will be a regulatory burden on them all,
whether it is a historic castle that happens to have a licence, which
many of them do, or a restaurant.</div>
<a name="0901286000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000391"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Mr. Brennan, campaigns have suggested
that around 40 per cent. of premises sell alcohol to children on at
least one occasion and that two thirds of children claim that they have
been able to purchase alcohol illegally. Does that not suggest that the
Government and retailers need to do more and that clause 27, which
deals with the two-strikes approach, is proportionate and
necessary?</div><a name="0901286000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shane
Brennan:</b></i> That 40 per cent. comes from a campaign that
targeted problem premises, although the figure is still way too high
and no one is trying to justify it. Certainly, there is much more to be
done to tackle the sale of alcohol to those under age. It is not a
problem that will go away and there is no solution to it. It is
something that retailers have to think about every day. There are
enforcement campaigns that end after a period of time, but the
retailers have to think about it every day because they are facing
young people coming into their shops everyday, and they do refuse the
majority of them.</div><a name="0901286000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point about two strikes, the concern here is that there are
different people and different reasons why people sell, and those need
to be properly understood. A three-strikes policy in this sense has not
actually been used as it stands, and we know that reviews of licences
have been brought forward in several cases against retail premises that
have failed twice. In that sense, it is a general concern about
possible distortions, but none the less, we know that, as it stands,
many retailers face that after that period of time
anyway.</div><a name="0901286000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000392"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> You said that there are different reasons why
retailers might sell and get to the three strikes, and I think that we
have discussed that before. Are you referring to the intimidation that
might take place, for example, in a shop away from everywhere else,
where the retailer feels under pressure to sell?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div><a name="0901286000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shane

the people working behind the counter, not the premises
itself.</div><a name="0901286000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000393"></a>Mr.

Brennan:</b></i> There is no reason for breaking the law. I
am not trying to justify that. However, people make mistakes in their
businesses. The reasons for that must be taken into account as well as
the effects. I am not justifying such sales, but saying that there must
be some thought about what the reasons are and how we can ensure that
such premises and people stop doing those things in the

mistakes.</div><a name="0901286000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> In relation to the 40 per cent. figure,
Vernon Coaker and his predecessors have dealt with the question of
under-age campaigns, which we have supported. The police chose specific
BCUs within the worst 1 per cent. of those with problems. In those
BCUs, the failure rates came down markedly from the worst position,
which was 40 per cent. Therefore, we are not talking about anything
like 40 per cent. We are talking about only a very small proportion of
targeted locations, selected on police intelligence, in the on-trade
and off-trade. I am not defending them. In a number cases, they were
closed or action was taken against them. We did not object to
that.</div><a name="0901286000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
81</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000395"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> So you are telling me that it is a small,
diminishing
problem.</div><a name="0901286000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> It is a diminishing problem, but I was
trying to identify where the 40 per cent. figure came
from.</div><a name="0901286000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
82</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000396"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Okay, but it is a small, diminishing problem
that we ought not to be too concerned
about.</div><a name="0901286000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> No, I did not say that. I was absolutely
clear. You need to be concerned because people are given a licence to
sell alcohol. They accept that responsibility. I was saying that it was
a targeted
operation.</div><a name="0901286000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
83</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000397"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> But even if it is targeted in those areas, it is
still a major problem when retailers in on-sales or off-sales have been
resistant to all the pressure that has been brought to bear on them to
live within the
law.</div><a name="0901286000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> Absolutely. That is why I commented on
confiscation and the like
earlier.</div><a name="0901286000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000398"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Are there any other colleagues trying to catch
my
eye?</div><a name="0901286000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
84</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000399"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I want to come back on a couple of specific
points and then discuss a slightly broader
point.</div><a name="0901286000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Craik, as we discussed, to commit the offence of persistently
possessing alcohol in a public place it  must take place on
three or more occasions within 12 months. What guidance has
ACPO given to police forces on the recording of this information?
Obviously 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>police would need to know that someone had been caught on two previous
occasions to determine whether the offence has been triggered. How will
that be recorded? Will it go on the new PentiP system or the police
national computer? What will
happen?</div><a name="0901286000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> It will go on to the force&#146;s local
system. It is possible that if somebody wandered from Durham to my area
we would not know that they had been dealt with on one or two previous
occasions, unless the officers recognised the address and asked the
control room to call Durham. That would not happen automatically.
However, most of these cases involve local people in local areas; it is
a local issue. In reality, most cops in the neighbourhood would know
such information without looking at their database. They share
conversations with each other at briefings each day and know who is on
two strikes. They know what action is being taken and whether the
person is likely to offend or not. In my force, such information is
recorded on our system and available to all my officers. It would be
available to other forces only if they contacted us and asked. It would
not be on a national
database.</div><a name="0901286000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
85</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000400"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> As we discussed earlier, my concern with the
extension of the power of directions to leave to 10-year-olds is that
there are existing powers to take children back to their homes if they
are at risk or if police have concerns about their safety. In what
circumstances would you use this power for a 10 or 11-year-old rather
than take them back to a place of
safety?</div><a name="0901286000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> It applies to 10 to 15-year-olds. Officers
would make a judgment. A 10-year-old who is out in the middle of the
afternoon with other 10 or 11-year-olds might just be moved on. This is
more likely to be applied to the 15 or 14-year-olds who are out with 16
and 17-year-olds when we want to move all of them on, not just the ones
who qualify by dint of age, leaving the others
behind.</div><a name="0901286000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is kind of
misleading sometimes to assume that, just because some are a year or
two older that they are the dominant ones in the group. Some 13 to
14-year-olds can be difficult and can be group leaders. It is about
giving the officers the opportunity either to move them or, if there is
risk of harm, to do what they would have done anyway, which is take
them home to their parents. There is also, sadly, the reality that
taking some kids home to their parents does not work, because the
parents are not interested in the problem that the kids are causing.
There may be times when officers will seek to move them on together
with the
others.</div><a name="0901286000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
86</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000401"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> But what does that say in terms of child
protection issues? You are suggesting that there is a problem with the
parents and, therefore, we are just simply moving it on; surely, a
place of safety or child protection issues are involved. That is what I
am seeing in respect of this clause and it leaves me uncomfortable. Are
we saying, &#147;If there is a young child, we simply move them
on&#148;?</div><a name="0901286000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i> That could happen, but with the 10 or
11-year-olds, depending on the time of day, what the risk is and who
they are with, in most cases&#151;nearly all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>cases&#151;they would be taken home. However, they may come straight
out again. If that is so, they may be taken home again. We may report
them to social services and there may be some subsequent action. In the
meantime, we need something to happen now to make that issue go
away.</div><a name="0901286000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
suggesting for a moment that a child of 10 or 11 who is vulnerable
would simply be moved on to other streets with no other action being
taken. There would be either an attempt to take them home or, if that
was not successful, there would have to be follow-up action. However,
the problem with follow-up action is that it takes until the next day
or the next week and does not solve the problem there and
then.</div><a name="0901286000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
reassuring the public, it is also about letting them see something
demonstrably being done to solve the problem on that day, as well as in
the longer term. A child such as the one we are talking about would
probably end up being subject to acceptable behaviour agreements. If
just taking them home did not work and the problem went on and on,
there would, then, potentially, be an antisocial behaviour order and
the rest of it.</div><a name="0901286000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an escalator of responses. These additional clauses enable our
officers to deal with particularly intractable, difficult situations
and give them some choice to use their
discretion.</div><a name="0901286000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
87</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000402"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> But principally it is the teenagers rather
than the very young children whom you would expect to be using this
power
against.</div><a name="0901286000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Craik:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="0901286000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
88</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000403"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On the broader point, obviously there are
some partnership initiatives&#151;or less statutory measures, if I
can describe them in those terms&#151;being undertaken in various
parts of the country to try to reduce the harm associated with alcohol
consumption and to provide education as well. In that context, I am
thinking of the community alcohol project, based out of St. Neots and
also some ways in which businesses use business improvement districts
in consultation with local authorities. The Broadstream BID in
Birmingham, which I visited, is one example of how the night time
economy is being managed in that
manner.</div><a name="0901286000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would the
witnesses be prepared to comment on the impact of the code
arrangements? Do you see those helping the situation and helping
promote such partnerships or are there some risks that they will
undermine some of the good work that is starting to be done in a number
of
communities?</div><a name="0901286000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
White, from a local authority perspective, are local authorities
engaging with partners in such ways to try to have a different
approach, rather than simply looking at law enforcement, and are they
considering longer-term interventions to try to change behaviour and
patterns of
behaviour?</div><a name="0901286000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
White:</b></i> As a district councillor, I sit on a council
with one third of the licensed premises of Birmingham, which is quite a
remarkable statement, given the size of Birmingham versus St. Albans.
The approach there is for the local authority to work with the licensed
trade. It is not in the interest of the licensed trade not to work with
the local authority or vice versa. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>It is much cheaper for everybody for there to be schemes such as
PubWatch and similar. Generally speaking, although individual premises
cause me difficulties as an elected member, and cause the council
difficulties, they are few and far between, given how many we are
dealing with. That has got to be the starting point of a good and,
indeed, positive approach to licensing.</div>
<a name="0901286000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consumption of alcohol in a
calm setting is part of the British way of life and is something that
we would wish to preserve rather than ban. That is why I am nervous
about mandatory conditions. For instance, under the Licensing Act 2003,
we have the concept of the designated premises supervisor, which was
imposed on all licensed premises, including occasional users, such as
clubs and churches. That is a cost and a difficulty that has not helped
the process.</div><a name="0901286000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
always a danger that something written in Whitehall will not suit a
particular pub on a corner in a particular market town or something in
the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne. Therefore, the more we deal with
local conditions set by local demands and use the representations of
local people regarding what they want, the more likely it is that we
will be
successful.</div><a name="0901286000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shane
Brennan:</b></i> Something worries me about imposing
regulations and conditions on premises, rather than looking at
partnership alternatives. I do not think that anyone intends
partnerships to be simply the place where this should all start. We
have to ensure that partnerships are maintained. We have seen great
success, for example, in relation to the community alcohol partnership,
to which you referred, in St. Neots. That is now taking
place to a wider extent in Cambridge and other parts of the
country.</div> <a name="0901286000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Industry and
the enforcement community need to work together to look at the problems
of, in this case, under-age drinking. They need to look at all the
different levers, and they will see real results through that
partnership approach. My fear is that if people do not look at those
options first and are pushed towards imposing conditions, or burdens,
that will create the potential for a confrontational
relationship&#151;not simply a lack of communication or partnership.
That is something we need to avoid, whatever happens with this
legislation.</div><a name="0901286000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000404"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Mr. Shenker, in terms of harm
reduction and addressing some of these deep-seated issues, what are
your thoughts on partnership working and the interrelationship between
mandatory, statutory, regulatory and partnership
approaches?</div><a name="0901286000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Don
Shenker:</b></i> We have seen some good examples of voluntary
partnership working&#151;you mentioned Birmingham and St. Neots. The
problem is that there is good practice and there is actually being
responsible. The problem with the St. Neots approach is that we do not
know how sustainable it is in the long term. It is a good approach, but
we do not know how long it will last. It requires committed buy-in from
a lot of different partners. Officials and partnerships change, and
people come and go.</div> <a name="0901286000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to try to tackle the issue of alcohol-related crime and
disorder, we need to have some minimal national standards in place by
which all licensees across the on-trade and off-trade abide. That way
we can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>eradicate some of the poor practice that we have seen. In relation to
some of the price promotions that we have seen in the on-trade, for
example, people are not acting illegally when they allow people to
drink for free once they pay &#163;5 on the door. That causes huge
problems for the police. Some local authorities are good at dealing
with those things and some are not so good. The Government need to take
some action in dealing with this. In relation to alcohol issues, crime
and disorder costs us &#163;7 billion a year. We would save an awful
lot of lives and police time if we had some national minimum standards
on price promotions, and some national standards on training and point
of sale information.</div> <a name="0901286000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
honestly believe that whatever the regulatory cost burden would be, it
is quite clear from the economic analysis that I have seen that there
would be an absolute economic gain in terms of the industry&#146;s
profit margins&#151;it would be charging more if it had a minimum
price. If loss-leading was not an issue, the industry would gain in
terms of income and the Exchequer would gain in terms of VAT.</div>
<a name="0901286000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have a decision
to make. Do they want to try to tackle the problem across the board in
terms of on-trade and off-trade, or do they want to try to tinker
around the edges, as they have done with alcohol-related problems? This
is an opportunity to try to provide some national standards for
responsible practice, with which, I think, many people in industry
would agree.</div> <a name="0901286000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a concern about the burden of regulation and cost. If you are in the
business of selling alcohol, you need a budget that allows you to do
that responsibly. If you do not have a budget to do it responsibly, I
am afraid you should not be in the business of selling
alcohol.</div><a name="0901286000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> May I comment on one or two things? To pick
up on what Don said, interestingly enough the KPMG study that looked at
the whole issue of promotions&#151;in an unsatisfactory way, as far
as we are concerned&#151;did not find one example of a
&#147;&#163;5 to drink all night&#148; or &#147;women in
free&#148; offer. We have actively discouraged that through our
promotions policy, which appears to have worked reasonably effectively.
As I have said, the report did not find one example of that, even
though the Home Secretary referred to it on Second Reading. We think
that there is a minimum standard, and that it is worth looking at
raising standards, in one form or another, and tackling particular
premises. The standard is that you have to get a licence in the first
place, and you have to go through a series of tests and training to
qualify for that licence.</div>
<a name="0901286000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">On your original question,
Mr. Brokenshire, about impact&#151;yes, there may well be
an impact. Mr. Ruffley, with his own company, Greene King,
in his
constituency&#151;</div><a name="0901286000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000405"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I wish it was my own company. I represent
it.</div><a name="0901286000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Hayward:</b></i> Or Ms Keeble in Northampton&#151;they will
know what the companies that work in their towns and cities do to help
communities.</div><a name="0901286000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Hayward:</b></i> We have discouraged them, as I have said,
but in terms of the work of Carlsberg and Greene King, you will be very
much aware of the excellent work and projects that people fund, such as
taxi schemes and help to get home in one form or another, or the BID
schemes to which you have referred. There is a risk, and it is
important that any consideration or legislation works its way around
that so that it does not deter the excellent work that those companies
do.</div><a name="0901286000185"></a>

KPMG gave a snapshot. I have been dealing with this issue for almost

an update on how the merger has followed through, as that is essential
to one of the key agencies using the powers in this

gives them a better opportunity for a better career path.</div>
<a name="0901286000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you are
asking about numbers, I am afraid I will have to ask you to wait until
May when, as statute dictates, we will be publishing our annual report
to the House via Ministers. If you are asking for a general indication,
I would say that intelligence that we receive on a daily basis
indicates that criminals have noticed that the civil recovery powers
are powerful and bite at the one thing that motivates them to engage in
organised crime, which is the compilation and acquisition of wealth. I
think they also notice that we are rather more aggressively settling
cases before they come to fruition in the High Court&#151;a
necessarily expensive but full process. Perhaps I should say no more,
as I am bound by convention not to release the figures until we reach

Brokenshire:</b> In that context, before we start to look at
what is in the Bill, could you and your colleagues flesh out what you
see as the principal impediment or limitation that is inhibiting you
being able to enforce effectively the powers you already have, as well
as the shortcomings that have been identified to necessitate the
legislative change that we have before us in the

Evans:</b></i> Largely, the changes proposed in the Bill, in
my view, are of a technical nature backed up by evidence of experience
of operation of the law since 2002. If you were to ask me what the
major impediments are, I would say that there are none except
ourselves. That is a question that I could perhaps direct to Mick
Creedon, who heads the ACPO league nationally for really embedding as a

Creedon:</b></i> Moving away from your question about ARA
going into SOCA, because that is a specific issue around that agency
and the civil side of it, the feel for the question I took was almost
one of why things are not working as they should. I would take issue
with that. I think the Act, as a relatively recent Act, has been a
fantastic success. The huge increase in performance in terms of the
volume and value of assets recovered and so on, shows that. Across
policing it is being embraced more and more. I agree with Paul
absolutely. The impediments to this are our ability to understand it
and use it at every level of criminality.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div><a name="0901286000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues
raised in these clauses are exactly as Paul described. This is us,
working with partners and the Home Office, recognising that some fine
tuning is necessary. That is not that surprising because we are trying
to use this widely. I do not think that the measures proposed are
particularly radical. They do not change the Proceeds of Crime Act 2000
particularly. I do not think that there is necessarily a failing in the
legislation. It is a recognition of how hard it is to mainstream this
across 250,000 police officers and police
staff.</div><a name="0901286000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
94</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000413"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Obviously the reason for asking the question
was not necessarily to be critical. It was to understand the background
or the triggers here so that we, as the people scrutinising this, can
better understand why, for example, some of the powers have been taken.
As you recognise, there has been some criticism from the Bar Council
about the human rights impact of some of the provisions. Therefore, as
a starting point I am seeking to understand the background and the
basis on which these new powers are being sought. From what you are
saying, your experience of the application of the legislation before
the courts or otherwise suggests that there is some justification for
seeking to push certain elements, if I can use that
terminology.</div><a name="0901286000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> You are right. To a certain extent what we
have seen over the past few years, and in some cases bitter experience,
shows how difficult it is to enforce some of the confiscation orders
and how easy it is for assets to be hidden and moved away. Even though
an asset might be restrained, it does not necessarily mean that it will
be easy to get to the confiscation. So when issues are raised here
about our ability to seize and retain property in the light of a
pending confiscation order, they seem perfectly sensible, provided that
the safeguards are in place, which I believe they are.</div>
<a name="0901286000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
things we have learnt about the most organised criminals and their
ability to dissipate and move assets, and there are measures here that
will hopefully stop that. I am not sure how well known it is, but we
talk of a pipeline in asset recovery with a huge amount of cash,
confiscation orders and civil actions going in. It takes a long time to
go through that pipeline. It is very crooked and it has gaps and holes
in it. This is an attempt to make sure that we do not lose things
during that pipeline of a
case.</div><a name="0901286000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Gibson:</b></i> If I may add a view from the Metropolitan
police on some of the issues that have been mentioned so far and some
of the challenges. One of the most challenging things is to mainstream
the use of POCA by our officers. We are having to raise consciousness.
We are having to make them aware of how this is not just a bolt-on to
an investigation. It can be a mainstream approach. It can be the first
and most appropriate approach to tackling criminality. That is one
issue. The second has been building up the skills and experience to do
this. That has been a major investment programme for us. There have
been advantages through incentivisation to do that, but it costs us
more than we get back. We have to find resources to put into this. We
believe in it as the benefits are more than just financial, there are
benefits to the community and to the higher principles of criminal
justice.</div><a name="0901286000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
most definitely is a success story. The Metropolitan police is on
target to hit its main value target for confiscation of &#163;42
million. We were at &#163;35 million as of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>December. We have seized over &#163;4 million in cash already this
year and there will be much more by the end of it. On the timeline of
performance, since POCA, our performance has gone up 700 per cent. That
is a fast take-off and it is a success
story.</div><a name="0901286000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Evans:</b></i> May I add one point of clarification? 
I have been doing this sort of job for more years than I care to
remember, and one self-evident truth strikes me at the end of that
experience. Criminals are engaged in serious and organised crime for
one reason alone: the acquisition of criminal property and assets. They
need those for three reasons. The first is the lifestyle that it
creates, or the bling factor. The second is the retirement fund. They
do not think in the same way as the people in this room. They believe
that they will never face capture and that they are invincible. They
therefore need money to buy the villa in Spain. The third reason, which
is the most important element in the acquisitiveness of organised
crime, is the feeling of significance and status that the acquisition
of wealth gives
criminals.</div><a name="0901286000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why many criminals have spent significant resource, effort and
ingenuity in trying to defeat the purposes for which the 2002 Act was
placed on the statute book. For that reason, this Bill proposes
significant but small technical changes to some of the ways in which
the 2002 Act has operated, enabling us to re-level the playing field.
That is how I feel about the
matter.</div><a name="0901286000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
95</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000414"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On a couple of specifics, there are certain
changes to confiscation orders, but how often have magistrates refused
confiscation orders in practice? Do you have any experience of that?
There is some suggestion that there have been problems, but it would be
useful to get a feel for the nature of
them.</div><a name="0901286000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> I have no data. Perhaps Tristram from the
Metropolitan police has examples as a
practitioner.</div><a name="0901286000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tristram
Hicks:</b></i> Refusing confiscation orders is relatively
unusual. The issue is getting evidence of assets being seized to the
magistrates so that they can make the orders. I think that refusal is
the
exception.</div><a name="0901286000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000415"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> To broaden the point slightly, there was some
debate and consideration at the time of the Assets Recovery Agency of
the interrelationship between some of the powers granted to it and the
application of human rights. That was used as mitigation for some of
the problems in advancing and enforcing claims. Is that still a
relevant consideration or has the case law sorted itself out? Is this
what you were seeking to remedy in these
provisions?</div><a name="0901286000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Evans:</b></i> The human rights aspects that were tested in a
variety of cases, including the case of Walsh, have been settled.
However, nothing is ever really settled. That issue is not causing us
delay or trouble regarding the challenges made on these grounds in
litigation that is before court or about to go to court. Therefore, it
is not addressed in these clauses. However, the complexity that we face
with civil litigation based on criminal lifestyle can often create a
burden in a case that takes significant time and effort to resolve. If
we are to be fair in trying to produce this litigation&#151;civil
recovery is essentially litigation, not accusation&#151;we need to be
thorough and fair. For that reason, some of these cases are enormously
complex with vast amounts of documented material. It is that, rather
than anything in the Human Rights Act 1998, that sometimes causes delay
and leads to complexity.</div>

97</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000416"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Has that been your experience as well,
Mr. Hicks, in the context of the Metropolitan
police&#146;s use and application? What have been the challenges
before the courts? Are those legislative or have they been to do with
intelligence and the
evidence?</div><a name="0901286000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tristram
Hicks:</b></i> The problem with confiscation orders being
enforced is primarily the absence of assets that are available for
confiscation at the point of enforcement. Successful confiscation
enforcement is a product of cash and assets being seized or restrained
at the very earliest part of the process, because as soon as a criminal
is alerted to the risk of their assets being taken away, they can
quickly dissipate those assets and move cash and property. Some of the
difficulties that we have had over the years have been to do with our
inability to seize and restrain effectively at the beginning of the
process. Part of that is about skills and experience, but a lot of it
is to do with our inability to seize and retain assets for the purposes
of confiscation
enforcement.</div><a name="0901286000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
98</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000417"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> A question on civil recovery for you,
Mr. Evans. I understand that a cash forfeiture order
has to be granted by a magistrate, whether it is contested or not, and
that SOCA believes that to be quite bureaucratic and time consuming. In
what proportion of cases in which there is a cash forfeiture order in
play will the alleged offender get lawyered up and waste time? Is it a
high proportion? Is if half of
them?</div><a name="0901286000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Evans:</b></i> I do not have the exact
figure.</div><a name="0901286000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000418"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> In rough
terms.</div><a name="0901286000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Evans:</b></i> The problem is a slightly different one. Many
cases&#151;for the police service, rather than for SOCA, for
different reasons to do with the nature of the casework&#151;proceed
to uncontested forfeiture. In those cases, we believe that if the
respondent is put on notice that we intend to proceed with a forfeiture
hearing and does not respond, there should be no need for a hearing
about the criminal nature of the cash. The experience of colleagues is
significant. A significant amount of court time is taken up with cases
that do not end up with an argument, and that is the point that we are
trying to address in the
Bill.</div><a name="0901286000222"></a>

just common sense because the orders are not contested in many
cases.</div><a name="0901286000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul

100</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000420"></a>Mr.

Creedon:</b></i> On the volume, in respect of policing, you
might be aware that this started off, in cash terms, with a
&#163;10,000 threshold. That became &#163;5,000 and then
&#163;1,000, and&#151;lo and behold&#151;the world did not end.
We all envisaged problems that that would cause us, with lots of cash
being returned, but that is not the
case.</div><a name="0901286000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
police terms, this afternoon I checked the numbers relating to the
growth in volume. In the year 2005-06, there were about 800 cash
forfeiture orders. In 2006-07 there were 1,150, last year there were
2,200, and this year, on profile, there will be more than 4,000. There 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>has been a massive growth. The process is bureaucratic. You have to go
to court every three months and consider whether to use your financial
investigator, your in-house lawyer, or outsourcing, as some forces do.
The process becomes bureaucratic and
costly.</div>
<a name="0901286000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">It makes
common sense to move forward cases where an order is uncontested as
quickly as possible. A lot of forces would find that a cost saving, as
would the courts. It might surprise you to learn that there are
occasions when an individual wants to keep as clear as possible of
large amounts of cash found on or near them and wants to deny any
knowledge of it, because that could be clear evidence of a
money-laundering offence that they have been
committing.</div><a name="0901286000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Evans:</b></i> At the moment, we are turning up with a
lawyer, a financial investigator and evidence only for the court to
find that there is no one on the other side. Some criminals would
prefer to walk away from the money, rather than face an embarrassing
revelation of how they obtained it.</div>
<a name="0901286000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
101</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000421"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Chief Constable, in your view, what is the single
most important change that the clauses will bring about in relation to
the proceeds of crime, and what will make the biggest difference for
your
officers?</div><a name="0901286000231"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> For policing, I think that clauses 33 and 36
are the most important. Clause 33 deals with the power to retain seized
property and clause 36, which sets out the paralleled and mirrored
power, gives the power to seize and search property. The other clauses
vary in importance, but they are not quite as important for us. Clauses
33 and 36 give the police the chance, as early in the process as
possible, to stop those most organised criminals from doing everything
that they can do to lose, dissipate, hide or devalue the
asset&#151;we obviously requested those powers to apply at the arrest
stage, rather than the charge stage, because there is sometimes a long
time lag between
them.</div><a name="0901286000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
102</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000422"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> It is very useful if the practitioners tell us
what is most important to them, so I will pay extra attention to those
two clauses. Do you anticipate more litigation from suspects as a
result of those new
powers?</div><a name="0901286000233"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> We have to, because we will be seizing and
retaining property, and not under the existing PACE powers, which
relate to other criminal investigations, but under the power of a
future confiscation order. I have looked at the
proposals&#151;obviously we work with the Home Office&#151;and I
think that scrutiny and judicial oversight should bring some
independence. The other aspect that I really need to stress is that
this will be used proportionately. It will be used not by every PC and
motorway cop, but by trained financial investigators who know what they
are doing. Clearly, the other safeguards relate to the nature of
property that cannot be taken so that you cannot undermine
someone&#146;s lifestyle or business by taking things that will stop
that. There is a risk of it, of course, but that is the case with huge
amounts of
legislation.</div><a name="0901286000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
103</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000423"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Let us move on to the topic of extradition,
because obviously there are additional provisions on extradition in the
Bill, in many ways relating to the new Schengen information system and
the European arrest warrant. Just as background, what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>has been the effect of the application of the European arrest warrant on
requests made to this country and citizens who are extradited? What
sort of numbers are we talking about, and what sort of cases have they
generally been applied to?</div>
<a name="0901286000235"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Gibson:</b></i> I will answer that, and Murray will help me
out if I get it wrong. There has been very fast growth in the use of
the European arrest warrant, and it has caused a problem because the
system that we have for managing it in England and Wales has been based
on one force&#151;my own Metropolitan police&#151;and we were never
resourced for that. In the past, this was seen as a specialist activity
requiring specialist skills and knowledge of foreign jurisdictions and
so forth, so our approach was that a small number of people undertook
it nationally. As things have taken off with Schengen I and the early
notification of the European arrest warrants, the numbers have grown
from 246 in 2006 to 435 in 2007 and 527 in 2008, and that is just from
the European arrest warrants. The numbers are projected to keep growing
to about 1,700 in 2010, when Schengen II will come online.</div>
<a name="0901286000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difference
between Schengen I and Schengen II is that we currently get paper
notification coming through SOCA, and therefore we have to put the
system on to the police national computer. However, in 2010,
information will be put on to the Schengen system, which will be bolted
on to the police national database, so it will be put on in the country
of origin. There are a whole load of people currently on the Schengen
system, to which we are not connected. That will come on line, as will
the circulation of wanted
people.</div><a name="0901286000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation has created overstretch in the Metropolitan police. We simply
cannot manage this exponential growth. Through the Association of Chief
Police Officers, we have put colleagues in the other 42 police forces
on notice that they are going to have to manage this. SOCA will notify
them of people sought who are residing in their force area and they
will be responsible for making the arrest. That will cause some
difficulties because of the ways in which the court and the transport
system out of the country operate. The only court in the country that
deals with extradition is the City of Westminster. Part of the
provisions allows electronic connection between the City of Westminster
and other parts of the country, although City of Westminster will
remain the only court. The main exit ports are Heathrow and Gatwick. We
have a special arrangement with Poland. A military flight is used to
take the Polish, who are the greatest users of the European arrest
warrant, out of the country on a monthly
basis.</div><a name="0901286000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be problems with how forces around the country get their people to
the airport, get them airside and hand them over to law enforcement
agents of a foreign jurisdiction. This is where we are: rapid take-off,
planned and continued exponential growth, and having to change the way
we do business. But it is not just the police that will have to change;
other parts of the criminal justice system will have to change to
accommodate this growth.</div>
<a name="0901286000239"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Evans:</b></i> Would it be helpful if I explained
SOCA&#146;s role in some of this? It is twofold. We act as the
administrative authority that certifies the incoming request, so
experienced officers check the fine print and detail of each and every
one of these EAWs&#151;the growth is exponential&#151;to check that
they are in order. Having collated any further intelligence on the
subject of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>warrant, we would then pass it out to a police force to action. It is
our responsibility to manage the court process of the extradition,
appointing CPS prosecutors and the like. We act in support of the front
end and I think we are all coping with some sense of just how big this
problem could be and what new arrangements would be required. For
example, in SOCA, we anticipate that the growth in business is
sufficient for us to consider moving out of central London to the
north-west and with significant extra numbers, not only to fulfil our
requirement to move people out of the south-east, but also because the
labour markets will be more amenable to us employing folk in the
north-west. The business case is of that order as we consider moving a
chunk of
work.</div><a name="0901286000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
104</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000424"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> In terms of the information that you hold on
this request and the statements that you have made about exponential
growth, to what extent do these requests relate, first, to other
European nationals in this country whose home country is seeking
extradition to get them back to face charges and, secondly, to British
citizens sought in other jurisdictions? Thirdly, of that number, how
many are subject to claims or potential prosecution for offences that
would not be prosecutable here? Obviously, there is concern that the
European arrest warrant is used in certain cases to charge and arrest
someone in this country when there is not an offence here, thus
breaking the normal rules on extradition that something has to be
chargeable in both
countries.</div><a name="0901286000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Murray
Duffin:</b></i> Before I answer that, let me say that the
figures Mr. Gibson was citing were actual arrests. We have
far more requests than arrests. Every request has a resource
implication because there needs to be research to find out whether a
person is in the country. The number of requests is about double the
number of arrests.</div>
<a name="0901286000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on to
your question, very few of our requests relate to British nationals.
The vast majority&#151;95 per cent. or more&#151;relate to foreign
nationals who are in England and Wales, which is our area of business,
with the offence having been committed in their home country or another
foreign country.</div>
<a name="0901286000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">On dual
criminality, the only case I can think of that we have dealt with in
which the offence is not an offence in the UK is a high-profile
holocaust denial case, which I am sure you are aware
of.</div><a name="0901286000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
105</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000425"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I shall go back to the initial line of questioning
because most of the controversy from outside groups that have written
to us about the proposals is centred on the confiscation of property
and cash in the gap between arrest and charge, and in gaps between
making arrests. How big a problem is it that large amounts of goods
that you think are the result of criminal activity disappear, or are
significantly reduced, before you can seize that property?</div>
<a name="0901286000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> From a policing point of view, you have to
recognise that one benefit that we have already seen is the ability to
mainstream activity, so we are getting into low amounts and low-value
orders at times, but equally into very high-value orders. A high-value
order has two elements, the first of which, as we described earlier, is
the ability to hunt down and realise assets. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>second is that a case can easily take two and a half to three years to
go from the start, and intelligence gathering, through to prosecution
and the final confiscation order. We have a lot of experience of assets
going in that
time.</div><a name="0901286000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are getting better at the restraining procedure, but restraining still
allows a person to have access to the assets and to use them. There are
two elements. First, the person who is under investigation and who will
potentially be charged is still able to drive around in their BMW and
have a lavish lifestyle. Secondly, it is very difficult for us to have
any oversight, control or knowledge of how assets are being dissipated,
including&#151;the experienced guys at the Met, particularly
Tristram, know about this&#151;by being moved abroad. While it is
easier to have arrangements with some jurisdictions, it is very
difficult with others.</div>
<a name="0901286000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could not
quantify how many confiscation orders would be affected by that issue.
However, when we did the consultation, in which we consulted each of
the 43 forces in England and Wales, through a chief officer,
this was a commonly raised issue&#151;hence it went to the Home
Office. The original thinking was that this should happen post-charge,
but we have requested post-arrest because of the difficulty
involved.</div><a name="0901286000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Evans:</b></i> I would add that in the world of serious and
organised crime, it would be unusual for us to investigate any
organised criminal who had not developed a strategy for the protection
of wealth in the event of arrest or investigation. This is meant to
deal with the low-order end of that
problem.</div><a name="0901286000249"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> ACPO, working alongside SOCA, has done an
awful lot in recent years to try to understand the depth and size of
organised criminal enterprises across the UK. As we get better at that
and share understanding, one thing that comes out, unsurprisingly, is
the enormity of criminal wealth. That does not mean that we are going
to move straight to a position in which we can seize it and go for
confiscation, but that opens our eyes and makes us think about how we
can best take action to secure it. As Paul started off by saying,
regarding tiers of people&#146;s motivation, to go through the
process of getting the confiscation order, but then not to be able to
get to the asset is, frankly, a failure of justice. The
criminal&#146;s biggest worry is not the sentence, but their assets
being taken from them, and they will get more and more sophisticated at
hiding assets from
us.</div><a name="0901286000250"></a>

Creedon:</b></i> It is a combination of all those
things&#151;vehicles are a common one, but it can also be high-value
items. Properties are more difficult, and clearly they can be
transferred to different people. The bit not to underestimate is when a
criminal who knows that an investigation is going on, thinks, &#147;I
know what profit I&#146;ve made, but I may as well just decimate that
in the period between my arrest and my final confiscation order,
because it&#146;s going to be taken off me anyway.&#148; So, when
the confiscation order is made, the value that is quite rightly there
is realised down
here.</div><a name="0901286000252"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul

public interest in us being able to finish the game. It is not a game
of two halves, you have to get to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>the final whistle and that is the moment when the asset is transferred
into Crown hands. Many of the points in the Bill and the discussions
here and with Home Office officials, who have been very supportive, are
about doing what it says on the tin&#151;confiscating. I can make a
lot of effort with my officers, doing all of the preparatory work, the
arrest, the restraint, the financial investigation, the court hearing
and the confiscation hearing, but unless I get the money, I might as
well not have bothered. That is the point and that is what we are
trying to
address.</div><a name="0901286000253"></a>

107</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000427"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I think, Mick, that in an earlier answer on this
topic you said that you have to recognise property and assets that are
essential to what might be a legitimate business. How do you draw the
distinction?</div><a name="0901286000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> One of my roles in ACPO is working with the
service on best practice and guidance. We have worked with the National
Police Improvement Agency on clear guidance. Obviously, there has
always been a power under PACE to seize property subject to, say, a
money laundering investigation or whatever else the offence may be. We
have tried to be very clear about what you should and should not take.
Clearly, there are things that people need for their lifestyle, which
are proper for them to retain. That is where this power will help. Out
of it, as you are aware, there will be codes of practice and guidance.
Therefore, what people need to lead a normal lifestyle will be very
clear, but, frankly, the 58-in plasma screen TV may not be what you
need for that ordinary lifestyle. There has to be a degree of common
sense and we will see where the level settles. The ability to have a
real life or run a business will be protected by scrutiny, judicial
oversight and, I hope, codes of practice and
guidance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000429"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> On the question of extradition, what do
extradition requests to you or requests that you make elsewhere
typically cover? There was a big joke on Second Reading that requests
could involve pig rustling in Poland. Is that serious? At what level do
you arrest someone or request extradition? Are people extradited for
going back to another European country having not paid &#163;50-worth
of parking fines in London and or vice versa?</div>
<a name="0901286000258"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Gibson:</b></i> It varies. In a second, Murray will chip in.
Different countries use extradition requests in different ways. We
grade them as high, medium and low risk according to the seriousness of
the offence for which we are arresting them. Murder, rape, kidnap,
firearms offences and so on are at the top end and theft and fraud are
at the bottom end. The high-risk figures that I have before me range
from 94 per cent. from Albania to 15 per cent. from Poland, 13 per
cent. from Hungary and 9 per cent. from the Czech Republic. That gives
you an indication. The higher the risk, the more serious the offence
is.</div><a name="0901286000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Use
of the European arrest warrant varies tremendously. Poland is the
biggest user&#151;for comparison, between 13 May 2008 and
23 January 2009, Poland issued  270 requests and
Germany issued 23. That reflects the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>Polish constitution, whereby they are obliged to follow through the
judicial process. Under the framework agreement, they circulate the
warrant in Poland and can then make use of the European arrest warrant.
Germany takes the same approach as the United Kingdom, where we
consider how serious the offence is, if extradition would be
proportionate and whether we want the costs to the public
purse.</div>
<a name="0901286000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Murray
Duffin:</b></i> It is the proportionality issue. All of the
old&#151;for want of a better word&#151;European countries consider
proportionality. If an officer wants an EAW issued by the CPS and the
magistrates, proportionality has to be addressed. In the high-profile
cases that you are talking about, such as piglet rustling, the
UK&#146;s view is that we will not go through everything involved in
an EAW, such as issuing it, making the arrest, keeping the person in
custody for two or three weeks while the extradition is ordered and
dealing with the returning issues and all the costs that that implies.
The Poles&#146; view is steadfast in that if they have a case and a
suspect, they will prosecute it to the nth degree. In some regards, you
must admire their tenacity. When we make an arrest, they will always
collect and go to the effort of taking the person
back.</div><a name="0901286000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Polish flights that Mr. Gibson has alluded to are carried
out at their request. Their aircraft come over to Biggin Hill every
three or four weeks and take back a number of their nationals. There
have been a number of bilateral meetings between the UK and Poland to
address the disproportionality. The Poles say that they are following
the rules and that is the way it is. Different countries interpret
proportionality in different
ways.</div><a name="0901286000262"></a>

when we will have the bolt-on to the police national computer. By then,
it will probably be the police national database. It will feed directly

searching the Schengen information system. The two will be

misuse of identity, and the Europol information system, to which we are
in the business of connecting police sources in the same way as Allan
has described for the Schengen system by 2010. These are complex
systems, but they must be delivered because they will simplify the
process. In doing so, they will simplify the administrative overheads
that have been described today. The paper-based system is not what we

116</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000437"></a>The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):</b> Good afternoon. Thank you
for your time. May I summarise what has been said? There appears to be
a consensus that this Bill is building on the success of the Proceeds
of Crime Act 2002. The real problem has been with retaining property
pre-charge. Has that been a core difficulty with the operation of the
Act with property dissipating before we can restrain it, Mr.
Creedon and Mr.
Evans?</div><a name="0901286000279"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> Yes; in our consultation with all the forces
of England and Wales, this was one of the significant problems that was
raised. As you are well aware, the gap between the value of
confiscation orders and the actual value enforced is worryingly large.
This is an attempt to close that gap by recognising that we can take
more early on, this will realise at the point of confiscation more in
line with the valuation of the order&#151;clearly a vehicle will lose
value, as properties are now. This was a strong feeling. Other elements
are important&#151;there is some regularising and some ambiguities
that are being cleared up&#151;but the point you make about that gap
is a significant
one.</div><a name="0901286000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Evans:</b></i> Our cases are different; they are qualified by
the nature of our investigations. Our investigations tend to have a
long, intense covert phase followed by an overt phase, by which point
we would have generally profiled the financial affairs and assets of
the subject of the investigation; we are therefore in a slightly
different position. We can see where ACPO is coming from: it is too
easy for criminals to realise that they are facing capture and to
dissipate, give away, pay away, or gift an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>asset in their possession without really gifting it&#151;they know
they can get it back later. We tend to go after a better class of
criminal.</div><a name="0901286000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000438"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> One of the points that is often put to me when I
have raised this is that this is completely unnecessary; restraint
orders do the
job.</div><a name="0901286000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> No,
again.</div><a name="0901286000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901286000439"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is a point that is often put to me. It is
said that we have no need for this and it is an unnecessary step; that
we are unnecessarily infringing the rights of individuals because
restraint orders will do all that needs to be
done.</div><a name="0901286000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> Tristram works with this more than I do
day-to-day, but from a policy perspective and the national feedback,
that is not the case. There is a huge volume of confiscation orders and
confiscation activity compared with the very low number of restraint
orders. They do not match up because it is not straightforward to get a
restraint order. Within a restraint order is the provision for that
person to have necessary lifestyle expenses, which can be quite high,
depending on the lifestyle they manage to profile. The orders do not
alter the fact that they can damage, remove, hide or give away their
property. I do not think that restraint orders are the answer. The Bill
gives us a parallel power that will ensure that we do not have to rely
on
them.</div><a name="0901286000285"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tristram
Hicks:</b></i> It is worth saying that this legislation is
still quite new in its operation and we are still discovering how much
property there is that may be linked to the proceeds of crime. It is
difficult to estimate the amount of property that we are not seizing
because, by definition, we are not seizing it. An illustration may be
gained from the fact that the Met police obtained 13 restraint orders
before the Act in 2002 and this year will be looking at something like
350 restraint orders. This is an illustration of the scale of assets
that we believe are at risk of dissipation&#151;which is how we
obtain the restraint orders. There have been many instances where, even
with a restraint order, criminals have attempted to sell property and
move what may be considered to be fixed items, such as kitchens, in
order to escape the penalty of a restraint order. The evidence shows
that, even with restraint orders, there is a dissipation of assets. As
I have said before, the enforcement of confiscation orders depends on
tangible assets being seized and retained if we believe that they will
be
dissipated.</div><a name="0901286000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
117</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000440"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> It is extremely important for me to ask you to
comment on this. As we have seen from some of the comments about the
proposals in the Bill, people are necessarily worried about the human
rights and civil liberties implications of what we are doing to the
individuals concerned&#151;but we can see the benefits to the broader
community, if we concentrate on that. It would be helpful if you said,
between you, something about the importance that you attach to the
judicial safeguards that are in the Bill and about the use of these
powers&#151;whether you consider them appropriate, for example. It
would also be helpful if you stated on the record whether you believe
that the codes of practice that will go alongside the provisions need
to ensure that this power should be used only where it is necessary and
proportionate to do so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div><a name="0901286000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> The starting point for policing, of course,
is that human rights underpin what we do. There may be commentators who
would say otherwise, but the reality is that human rights are implicit
and feature in our operational audit and operational planning. Human
rights are fundamentally important. We would not want this power if the
oversight was not in
place.</div><a name="0901286000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
are well aware that the new change in policing involves, among other
things, a simple test of the public trust and confidence in policing in
terms of dealing with local problems with local partners, and so on.
Nothing will undermine that more easily than if we are seen to abuse
our powers in a public way. However, from a chief constable with an
ACPO lead, there is no fear of that
whatsoever.</div><a name="0901286000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measures that are put in place vary, but one part of the process
includes the judicial oversight, the necessary senior officer&#146;s
authorisation and the independent overview. But the more important part
is in respect of the codes of practice and the guidance that will go in
parallel with that, along with the quite proper inspection. Rest
assured that HMIC will inspect and make sure that forces are doing what
needs to be done. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is there
and people will complain to it, should they think that things have not
worked out as they would have wished. There is a combination of
measures and there has been a commitment from ACPO to ensure that we
use those
properly.</div><a name="0901286000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
started earlier by saying that this measure will not be used in a
cavalier way by a police constable on the street who may think,
&#147;Well, I can just take that and keep hold of it.&#148; This
will be rolled out gradually through specialist units and financial
investigators working within the confines that the Act, as it will be,
will
offer.</div><a name="0901286000291"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Evans:</b></i> Just a general point from me, Minister, if I
may, and then something about the process of managing this
control.</div><a name="0901286000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
welcome the scrutiny that the Bill provides. We want to get this right
each time and every time. Not to get it right will, as Mick rightly
says, undermine public confidence. That applies to proceeds of crime
powers, civil recovery powers, intrusive surveillance powers or
property interference
powers.</div><a name="0901286000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a process point, the system that has been set out here to scrutinise
decision making within the agencies and the police service is almost
identical to that in place for other surveillance. So organisations are
geared up to processes that rigorously check, in an independent sense,
the decisions being made by officers on the ground, including those
made by the senior officer. The system is supplemented by annual
inspection regimes and the ability for members of the public to make a
full and frank complaint about our behaviour either to the court or to
the
IPCC.</div><a name="0901286000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000441"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
119</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000442"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> What is your view of the provision to extend to a
judge the power to grant an additional 48 hours to a requesting
country, should that be necessary for the relevant EAW papers to be
provided?</div><a name="0901286000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Evans:</b></i> First, can I say that the occasions on which
we would expect to use the additional 48 hours are extremely rare?
Indeed, the pre-arrest aspect of the operation of the EAW system has
been used a handful of times&#151;probably less than
10&#151;although I do not have a precise figure here. With the
benefit of hindsight we would, perhaps, have placed 96 hours in the
original Extradition Act 2003. It is to cover this eventuality: the
receipt of a request on a Saturday when there is a bank holiday in the
court on a Monday. It is in those circumstances, and those
circumstances alone, that we will apply to the court&#151;I should
emphasise that this will be a decision for the judge not for the
officers in the case&#151;for that
extension.</div><a name="0901286000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are cases of real, significant, indicative risk to the public. To give
the broad outline of one recent case: a person was wanted for murder in
a European jurisdiction. His sister lived in Bristol and intelligence
there indicated that he was going there to harm. The arrest warrant
arrived on a Friday and it was a bank holiday Monday. We got in
position to make the arrest, but just within the 48 hours. We were up
to the wire. I would not like to be in a position where we had to
replicate that or, worse, release someone who then goes on to harm
someone else. Minister, to reassure you and colleagues, this would be
used in circumstances where there would be significant risk to the
public and therefore a proportionate use of the
power.</div><a name="0901286000299"></a>

It is far easier with an EAW for us to ask for somebody in a European
jurisdiction who is wanted for an offence in the UK to be returned to
us. Our relationship with our European colleagues, all organised
through SOCA, is very good. My unit physically collects all of the high
risk ones who are wanted within the MPS. So, for example, we will
physically go out and collect anyone who is wanted for a murder in
London and bring them back. Our officers have specialist training on
those collection procedures. It just makes life easier. There is
nothing in the Bill that will really change the way we do things for
people coming in. If we do not know whether they are in a specific
European country they will all be on the Schengen information system.
That will mean that more people who are wanted in the UK will be
brought to notice within other European countries and therefore more
will be returned to us to face justice here. So it is a good

Evans:</b></i> This is a very important point. There is a
quid pro quo here about European co-operation which goes something like
this. It will, I hope, come as no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>surprise to the Committee to know that one of the things that SOCA has
been engaged in since its start-up has been the absolute rigorous
pursuit of fugitives from UK justice. That is those individuals who
fled to foreign jurisdictions, often in Europe. We all know of the
Costa del Crime, but there are other places in Europe, particularly
with the expansion, where British criminals can find a home. We want
them back to face justice. Our lives have been significantly simplified
since 2003 by the ability to operate that through this
system.</div>
<a name="0901286000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is no
secret that over 28 very serious, in some cases violent and dangerous
criminals, have been returned in the last year to the UK jurisdiction
from Spain. That was part of operation Captura, run jointly with the
police service, ACPO and Crimestoppers. It is a significant
contribution to the administration of UK justice and, importantly, to
notions of public safety and public perceptions of safety that we are
able to use this to reach out to jurisdictions in a way that hitherto
would have been very complicated. The price we have to pay in running
the system for requests inward is more than repaid by the assistance
that we can mandate in 27 countries&#151;one third of the
world&#146;s landmass&#151;in relation to our own serious criminal
problem. That is a significant consideration. These provisions will
help us make more efficient what is already quite
efficient.</div><a name="0901286000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000445"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have some quick questions to round off
with. When I was questioning earlier, there was the implication that
the costs of compliance with the enhanced Schengen arrangements, the
requests being received and the officer-time required to follow through
on requests from other European jurisdictions were growing and growing.
Can you indicate the cost in manpower of complying with the system as
it is now, when we have this exponential
growth?</div><a name="0901286000306"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Gibson:</b></i> I can give a very broad indication. Our
police authority had to make provision for doubling the size of our
extradition unit to deal with this. That gave us some respite in
managing the upward trajectory in the number of arrests but only a
respite, which is why we had to go back to our colleagues in ACPO and
say that we need a permanent solution. There will be implications over
time for each force.</div>
<a name="0901286000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I notice the
Bill does not have a cost on policing, though it has a cost on other
parts of the criminal justice system. There most definitely will be a
substantial cost to policing as this takes off, because the cost in
time and prisoner escort of moving people around the country is
substantial. When you are going to 1,700 from a base of 200 over three
or four years that must be reflected in
costs.</div>
<a name="0901286000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000446"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Obviously, that is a cost that will have to
be shared by police forces around the country in respect of requests
for people located in their jurisdiction&#151;in officer time to
track them down and make arrests and so
on.</div><a name="0901286000309"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Gibson:</b></i> Precisely. I notice that other parts have got
some provision for that but it is not reflected on
policing.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000447"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Do you want to add anything, Mr.
Creedon, on the impact of this on policing more generally?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div><a name="0901286000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Creedon:</b></i> When the Met first wrote&#151;I cannot
remember when but it was a good 12 months ago&#151;outlining some of
the issues around this, forces and regions began to ask what it would
mean for them. There will be a significant impact, there is no getting
away from it. This is not a fight between ACPO and the Met because we
understand the implications for them. The only issue for policing is
that to a certain extent there was a small portion of the Met that was
top-sliced and funded to provide this for 42 other forces. We
understand exactly where they are coming from in terms of the growth
and the reality. The issue about financing&#151;albeit it is a tiny
part of the entire police financing&#151;is not straightforward. The
other aspect for most forces will be about capacity capability against
need and we will need to look perhaps at some collaborative activity
around how to do this. In my own region in the east midlands it is
something we do as a cluster of forces.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="0901286000448"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> There has been quite a lot of debate about
the impact of new communities in certain police force
areas&#151;language and associated issues. Presumably, on the basis
of what we have heard of the proportion of these European arrest
warrants that are of foreign nationals sought overseas, you can see
that if you have new communities in certain parts of the country this
could have a disproportionate affect in those police force areas
compared with
others.</div><a name="0901286000313"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Murray
Duffin:</b></i> If you look at the numbers, over
50 per cent. of all extradition activity takes place in
London and over 70 per cent. in the south-east because that is where
people in the main have come to. When you talk about the effect on
individual police force areas, there is no doubt that the number of
Polish requests slants the issue. You would normally expect more
arrests and activity to take place in the large conurbations, but quite
often in places such as Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, where there are
large migrant agricultural communities made up of east Europeans, we
have a large number of requests and arrests precisely because those
communities have grown up, as you
say.</div><a name="0901286000314"></a>

Brokenshire:</b> 43 per cent. Clearly etched on your mind. One
final point on extradition generally. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>A point has been made about the undertakings given to a third-party
state that you seek extradition from one country to be prosecuted in
this country then to be returned to that original country to serve the
sentence. In what proportion of cases are these specific requests
attached, in terms of driving the point that has been made in this
Bill? Are there situations where those requests are made of UK
nationals, because an issue has been flagged that a request could be
made of a UK national in a non-EU jurisdiction&#151;they come and
serve their sentence here and are then returned to that non-EU country.
Could you help the Committee by giving a flavour of some of the
examples that have perhaps driven this amendment to be sought in the
Bill, if it has been sought from law enforcement at
all?</div><a name="0901286000317"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Murray
Duffin:</b></i> It has not been sought by law enforcement. It
is more for the judicial authorities. Some countries have in their
constitution that their nationals cannot be surrendered for trial in
another jurisdiction. The way round this, for want of a better
argument, is that the person does return, does come to wherever they
are being requested, and the quid pro quo is that they serve their
sentence back in their host country. That is really what has driven
this. It is not a policing
issue.</div><a name="0901286000318"></a>

responsibility for extradition outside of the EU. That is definitely
something where expertise matters. It is not a standardised system. It
can vary from one jurisdiction to another. Countries of part 2 and part
3 are where there are one-to-one extradition treaties, mutual legal
assistance treaties or there is a one-off arrangement negotiated
through our Government with a foreign Government. We retain
responsibility for those.</div>
