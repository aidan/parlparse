<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulations</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>8.55 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): I am pleased that you are in the Chair again, Mr. Hurst.<P>
On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''Could we not have had a better idea of what the content of those regulations might be, and can he at least tell the House now whether they will be subject to the negative procedure of the House, or to its affirmative counterpart?''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Secretary of State for Transport replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''That sounds to me like an extremely good bid to participate in the Committee stage of this Bill, when all these issues can be explored at length over several weeks.''&#151;[Official Report, 28 January 2003; Vol. 398, c. 765.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>Unfortunately, my hon. Friend's bid was not successful, but three excellent colleagues are on the team.
<P>
I want to explore the scope of the regulations covered by clause 8. There are two schools of thought on the subject. The first holds that the Bill should say little, but be merely an enabling measure while most of the powers to implement its provisions should be left to regulations. The Government may argue that that applied in the case both of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 and the subsequent Civil Aviation Act (Investigation of Air Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1996 and of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 and the subsequent Merchant Shipping (Accident Reporting and Investigation) Regulations 1999.
<P>
The sweep of the clause is breathtaking; it goes much further than those Acts and enabling regulations. Subsection (1) gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations about the way in which the rail accident investigation branch is to conduct its investigations. The clause sets out the scope of the regulations in detail. It states that the regulations may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''(a) confer a function on the Chief Inspector of Rail Accidents or on the Branch;
<P>
(b) make provision about the way in which a function of the Chief Inspector or the Branch is to be performed;
<P>
(c) permit or require the Chief Inspector to appoint a person to conduct or participate in an investigation''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I should much prefer the functions of the chief inspector to have been set out in the Bill. Under other clauses, notably clause 5, the chief inspector may arrange for the rail accident investigation branch to assist any person. Elsewhere, he is able to rely on assistance from other people in the performance of his <p>


<b>Column Number: 76</b></p>


function. The chief inspector's powers are far-reaching, so the clause should be much more specific about his functions.
<P>
The Government were concerned that the branch's investigation should not be delayed or constrained by any criminal investigation or judicial process. They consulted on a number of proposals that could be covered by the regulations. Why do those proposals not appear in the Bill? They included placing a duty on any relevant person, including any contractor or agent, to preserve evidence; giving the branch an unfettered right of access to accident sites but placing it under a duty to protect the chain of evidence; and preventing disclosure of certain categories of information or data, such as medical or private information or opinions expressed in the analysis of information without the order of the court.
<P>
It was further proposed that no statement made by a witness in connection with a rail accident investigation branch investigation or inquiry would be disclosed to the police or the Health and Safety Executive save by order of a judge, unless the witness had agreed it. A judge would have to consider whether the wider public interest outweighed any impact that disclosure might have on the investigation. The rail accident investigation branch could release details of those who had given evidence in the course of an investigation or inquiry.
<P>
Why, given that the Government consulted in such detail, are there no specific references to the proposals in subsection (1)? Subsection (2) allows regulations to be made that could require the rail accident investigation branch to ensure that its reports were not made public until any person or organisation whose reputation might be adversely affected had been given the opportunity to make representations on the draft report. Again the regulations are far-reaching and could jeopardise the thrust of the Bill. The Secretary of State and both the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary have told us that the purpose and objective is to have a swift investigation to get to the root cause of the accident and to share the results with the industry. That laudable objective is supported by all sides.
<P>
The philosophy behind the provisions in subsection (2) for the regulations to contain certain requirements about the report's publication and timing arises from the strictures of Lord Cullen. His report made it clear that he supported the aviation accident investigation branch's approach to publication. He reasoned that on completion of an investigation, the investigating inspector would be required to prepare a report, a copy of which would be submitted to the Secretary of State. The report would be required to contain relevant safety recommendations.
<P>
The aviation accident investigation branch regulations state that a recommendation should in no case create a presumption of blame or liability for an accident or incident. Aviation reports must be circulated to the parties likely to benefit from their findings in respect of safety and must be made public in the shortest possible time&#151;if possible, within 12 months of the accident or incident&#151;in such a manner <p>


<b>Column Number: 77</b></p>


as the chief inspector thinks fit. If the investigating officer is of the opinion that publication is likely adversely to affect the reputation of any person or deceased person, he must give notice to that person or to a representative of the deceased. The notice must include particulars of any proposed analysis of facts and conclusions as to the cause or causes of the accident or incident that may affect the person on whom notice is served. In practice, the investigating officer sends the whole report.
<P>
The investigating officer is required to consider any representations made prior to the report's publication. In practice, where substantive representations are made, the person or representative, is invited to meet the investigating officer to discuss matters.
<P>
It is my understanding that the Government consulted on a proposal that the report should be made publicly available, normally within 12 months of the accident or incident. They also consulted on a proposal that the report should not be made public unless any person or organisation whose reputation might be adversely affected was informed by notice and given the opportunity to make representations. It is also my understanding that clause 8(2)(e) provides for the inclusion of those provisions.
<P>
It would benefit the Committee enormously if the Minister could tell us how the provisions have worked in practice for the aviation accident investigation branch. The report must be made public within 12 months of completion. What has been the effect of that on the investigator's ability to get to the root cause of the accident, to conclude his report and to share it with the industry? Have matters been delayed by 12 months, or have there been further delays? We all agree that we would like to get to the root cause of accidents through independent investigation and that the results should be shared at the earliest opportunity. That applies equally to the maritime accident investigation branch.
<P>
Consultation on subsection (2), which deals with publication of the findings of accident investigations, suggested that a duty should be placed on the chief rail accident inspector to ensure that infrastructure managers, railway undertakings, safety authorities&#151;in this case, the Health and Safety Executive&#151;the bereaved, the injured, emergency services, representatives of staff and users, owners of damaged property, and manufacturers are, as far as possible, kept informed about the progress of an investigation. Additionally, in-depth consultations and private briefings should be arranged before the rail accident investigation branch report is published for those injured in a crash, their next of kin and the close family of fatalities.
<P>
Clause 8(2)(e) and (f) enshrine the requirements that should appear in the regulations, following the recommendations of Lord Cullen, who said that the investigation of rail accidents and incidents of whatever nature should be brought under the overall control of the RAIB. However, those paragraphs do not result from consultation alone. The Secretary of <p>


<b>Column Number: 78</b></p>


State on Second Reading and the two Ministers in Committee have reliably informed us that they draw heavily on the experience of the aviation and merchant shipping investigation branches. If the Committee is to agree to such wide-ranging powers, it would help if we knew more about the background to the drafting.
<P>
Under clause 8(4):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''The Secretary of State may make regulations about the use, disclosure and destruction of information acquired by the Branch; in particular, the regulations may&#151;
<P>
(a) prohibit the disclosure of information in specified circumstances;
<P>
(b) permit the disclosure of information in specified circumstances;
<P>
(c) require the disclosure of information in specified circumstances;
<P>
(d) make provision by reference to whether or not a person consents to a disclosure which relates to him.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Similar provisions apply to the enabling legislation that set up the aviation and marine accident investigation branches. On close inspection, however, marked differences are apparent.
<P>
I referred to two different schools of thought at the outset, and I personally come down on the side of building more detail into the Bill because it is only through primary legislation that we parliamentarians can exercise our right to scrutinise powers. When we debated clause 7, we saw what powers were being conferred on the investigator in each case. It is staggering that we are being asked to approve a clause conferring powers on the chief inspector of rail accidents in performance of his functions. That needs further elucidation and exploration.
<P>
The Minister may want to talk the Committee through the likely timetable of the enabling regulations. When will the Government state the functions of the chief inspector, who will be in an immensely powerful position? If the Committee now, and the House later, agree to the clause, we shall lose control over scrutiny of the powers and the exercise of that function, because it will be implemented in regulations.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
To recap, there are two schools of thought. The Minister may reply that the Conservative Government who set up the two existing accident investigation branches fell into the category of taking sweeping powers, because they implemented measures in regulations rather than in Bills. I might disagree. I will admit to being confused, because we have been reliably informed by the Secretary of State and the two Ministers that we are using as a model two well-established, well-functioning, highly regarded and independent accident investigation branches, which look after two different sectors. Will the Minister say why the Bill parts company in style and content from the other two enabling Acts?

<P>

<B>The Minister for Transport (Mr. John Spellar):</B> I thank the hon. Lady for making my speech as well as hers.<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I am just practising.<p>


<b>Column Number: 79</b></p>


<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> That is all right. A long apprenticeship is obviously needed.<P>
The hon. Lady raised many points that I wanted to make about precedent and practicality. The Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is no more detailed about the marine accident investigation branch chief inspector's functions. It simply says that regulations may specify the functions of the chief inspector and MAIB inspectors. The powers of the rail accident investigation branch inspectors have been modelled on those of MAIB inspectors.
<P>
The hon. Lady rightly asked about the consultations that took place on the regulations. Those are intended to help us to draft the regulations, not just the Bill. We will consult on the regulations shortly after Royal Assent. She also asked about any differences in the aviation accident investigation branch and the experience of parallel bodies. The AAIB has seen the Bill and says that it has experienced no problems with similar provisions. The hon. Lady asked about our general consultation on the Bill and on what could be in draft regulations. We hope to publish a response to the consultation shortly&#151;probably within the next month.
<P>
We have drawn on two successful models, exactly as Lord Cullen recommended, and we have asked how we can implement the best practice and procedures appropriate to the railways. How do we outline the functions of the inspector? In what framework will detailed regulations be drawn up and, if necessary, subsequently amended, without the need to return to primary legislation? Out of practicality, we are right to draw on experience, and we have struck the right balance between proper parliamentary scrutiny of the broad powers and a practical policy for implementation.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister and may be able to assist him. He said that the Government would come forward with the regulations shortly after Royal Assent, but the word ''shortly'' means different things to different people. Will he put a time scale on that?<P>
We have not yet reached the crux of the Opposition's concern. The enabling powers given under the Civil Aviation Act 1982, for which the most recent regulations were published in 1996, specify the powers of the inspector more precisely and define his functions. I am relatively new to politics, and so perhaps can still be surprised. I should like to know whether it is normal for a clause&#151;in a Bill that is not the most controversial before the House&#151;to state that a function shall be conferred on the chief inspector of a branch through regulations, without the House knowing when those regulations will come into force or having a chance to be consulted on the functions.
<P>
We discussed that matter at some length under clause 7, which covers the investigator's powers. The chief inspector's powers to inspect rail accidents and to enter land, which may include private property and dwelling houses, are very extensive. The 1996 implementing regulations of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 specifically state that the inspector shall be <p>


<b>Column Number: 80</b></p>


equipped with a summons, albeit one made under his own hand. That gives the inspector very wide-ranging powers.
<P>
In the context of the Government's own Human Rights Act 1998, I am concerned that a number of people will object to the powers and the function of the chief inspector, and that we are being asked, in good faith, to agree that those functions will be decided later. I will revert to a similar point later in our discussions. The Minister is taking an awful lot for granted if he believes that the Opposition will agree to confer functions on the chief inspector through enabling legislation without having had any indication of what those functions might be.
<P>
The powers of the chief inspector are extensive, and the impact of a rail accident will be fairly localised. We are not considering the situation of a tanker accident at sea, or an air accident on the scale of Lockerbie, where damage and the fallout from the aircraft are spread over very large areas. The impact will be localised, and it should be easy to identify the affected areas. However, I ask the Minister to allow us to discuss the functions of the chief inspector. This is an appropriate point at which to discuss that, as the Secretary of State promised that we could have a lengthy and full debate in the Committee about the contents of the various clauses. Will the Minister share with us the functions of the chief inspector and the way in which the inspector will discharge those functions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> We have been going over old ground already discussed under previous clauses. I stress again to the hon. Lady that the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is brief about the functions of the chief inspector, and the details are left to the marine accident branch regulations. I do not want to be repetitious, and I have already outlined the reasons why we are acting in that way.<P>
The hon. Lady also asked for a definition of ''shortly''. As ever in Government responses, ''shortly'' means shortly.

<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Requirement to investigate</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Good morning to you, Mr Hurst, and to the Committee?<P>
I listened with interest to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh), and I have considerable sympathy with many of her points. She is right that the Committee deserves more information about what regulations may contain and a better understanding of the Government's thinking on various aspects of the Bill. That is also true for clause 9. The hon. Lady will have several points to make, so, not wishing to steal her thunder, I will concentrate solely on two aspects.<p>


<b>Column Number: 81</b></p>



<P>
I am looking in particular at subsection (2)(a). Subsection (1) says that the inspector will be able to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''direct that any railway accident or railway incident of a specified kind or which occurs in specified circumstances shall be investigated by each person who managed or controls, or participates in managing or controlling, all or any part of railway property.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The chief inspector will rightly be able to direct persons to carry out investigations by the industry. However, subsection (2)(a) says that the directions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''shall specify the manner in which the investigation is to be conducted.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>My reading of that is that the direction will detail how the investigation is to be carried out. That is interesting because it implies that the rail accident investigation branch and chief inspector will tell the industry body&#151;a train operating company, Network Rail or a rolling stock operating company, for example&#151;how to go about an investigation rather than allow it to use any relevant expertise to search for the cause of that accident or incident.
<P>
It is equally interesting that having said that the chief inspector will specify the manner in which the investigation will be carried out, the direction appears not to detail the issues that the investigation will cover. Will the Minister make it clear that nothing in the direction will prevent an industry body from investigating any aspect of an accident or incident from which it believes it can learn lessons to improve future railway safety?
<P>
My second point is about subsection (6). Earlier parts of the clause specify that if a direction is given to a person to carry out an industry investigation and the person fails to do so, he or she will be deemed guilty of an offence. That is understandable. If there is a clear requirement to carry out an investigation and a person refuses to do so, there must be some sanction. However, I have some difficultly in understanding why subsection (6) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''But in proceedings against a person for an offence under subsection (3) of failing to comply with a direction it shall not be necessary to prove that he was aware of the direction.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Will the Minister explain in what circumstances it would be appropriate for someone to be deemed to be guilty without clear evidence that they knew that they had been issued with a direction to carry out such an investigation? There may be good reasons for that, but it would be helpful for future cases if the Minister stated firmly for the record the cases in which the Government believe that the subsection is important and should apply.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> My questions are not dissimilar from those on the issues explored in the debate on clause 8.<P>
Subsection (1) provides the chief inspector of rail accidents with the power to direct that an industry investigation be carried out by the relevant party. Subsection (3) creates a new offence and makes it an <p>


<b>Column Number: 82</b></p>


offence for that party to ignore that direction. I shall dwell for a moment on subsection (1) and let the words speak for themselves:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''The Chief Inspector of Rail Accidents may direct that any railway accident or railway incident of a specified kind or which occurs in specified circumstances shall be investigated by each person who manages or controls, or participates in managing or controlling, all or any part of railway property&#151;
<P>
(a) on which the accident or incident takes place; or
<P>
(b) which is involved in the accident or incident.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Curiously, the explanatory notes, which are so helpful on other clauses, say nothing about clause 9. I question its drafting, as there appears to be another typographical error. There has already been at least one, and there are one or two more on today's amendment paper. The Department must be much more careless than it was when the Conservatives were in government, but the Minister is responsible and I am sure that he will give us good reasons for the errors.
<P>
Will the Minister say what is a railway accident or railway incident ''of a specified kind'', and what are ''specified circumstances''? On Second Reading and in Committee, we have explored at length what constitutes an accident or an incident, although I hesitate to suggest that the Opposition parties have been more helpful in defining an accident or incident than the Government or the Bill have been.
<P>
It is unacceptable that a new offence is created under the clause. Under subsection (4),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''a person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (3) shall be liable&#151;
<P>
(a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or,
<P>
(b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Subsection (3) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''A person to whom a direction under subsection (1) applies commits an offence if he fails to comply with it.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>It is incumbent on the Committee to be able to explain to people what the specified circumstances are and what the specified railway accidents and railway incidents would be.
<P>
Again, subsection (2) is far reaching. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''A direction&#151;
<P>
(a) shall specify the manner in which the investigation is to be conducted; and
<P>
(b) may make provision for a case where more than one person would be required to conduct an investigation, whether by requiring a joint investigation or by requiring or enabling one or more persons to conduct an investigation on behalf of others.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is a very sweeping direction, and the Bill should be more specific.
<P>
Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''The Chief Inspector shall publish a direction issued by him under subsection (1) in a manner which he considers will bring it to the attention of each person who is likely to be required to comply with it.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>How does the Committee know that the manner in which the investigation is to be conducted will be sufficiently public and well directed? How do we know that the person to whom the direction has been issued will know that it is directed against him or that he will pay any attention to it? What is the purpose of the clause? It would seem to have a very serious purpose as it creates a new offence that carries a not insubstantial penalty. The chief inspector is given a specific power, <p>


<b>Column Number: 83</b></p>


but we are no further forward in knowing what his function is under clause 8. We do not know how the person to whom the direction is issued will be informed of it, or whether he will have committed an offence.
<P>
On reflection, the Minister may feel that the clause is not as well drafted as it might be, and I would sympathise with him in that respect. However, if he honestly believes that the clause is well drafted, I have some substantive questions. In two or three years' time, hon. Members might be approached by a constituent who has been issued with a direction and not even known that he or she had committed an offence. The clause's drafting is questionable; if the Government want to create a new offence they should be much more specific in stating that the offence will be brought directly to the attention of the person concerned, and in specifying the manner in which the chief inspector will do that.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Lady that directions will be sent to the train-operating companies and will be published. The purpose of the clause is to implement Lord Cullen's recommendation that the RAIB should regularly examine the reports of formal industry investigations, which would<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''determine whether there are matters of local or national importance which should be brought to the attention of the industry, for example if a number of accidents suggested a significant trend.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>We want the industry to co-ordinate its actions to a greater extent in that regard and that is best done under the RAIB umbrella, in a similar way to how the shipping and aviation sectors operate. The clause will ensure that minimum standards are followed and that there is consistency in the procedures. I hope that, as a result, companies will draw to the attention of staff and managers, especially those who will conduct internal company investigations, what their rights and responsibilities are. The issue is slightly different from RAIB investigations, but the clause will enable us to drive safety right through the industry and provide the mechanism for doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am sorry that the Minister has finished his speech and is not just giving way, as he has failed to answer any of our questions. I hope that he will have another opportunity to respond later.<P>
I asked why an industry investigation will be carried out under a direction that specifies how the investigation is to be carried out but not what issues will be covered. The hon. Member for Vale of York asked the same question in slightly different language. As the Minister was unable to answer my question, I shall express it differently: it would be most helpful if he could confirm that an industry body investigating an accident would be allowed to look at all the factors that it believes might have had a bearing on that accident or incident. For example, following a collision after a signal passed at danger, would it be permissible for the train operating company to consider issues that are outside its direct responsibility, such as those that relate to signalling or the track in that area?<p>


<b>Column Number: 84</b></p>



<P>
The second point relates to someone being summoned for failing to follow a direction when he was simply unaware that the direction had been issued. Subsection (6) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''in proceedings against a person for an offence . . . of failing to comply with a direction it shall not be necessary to prove that he was aware of the direction.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That seems totally unfair. There must be a clear requirement to demonstrate that the person was aware that he had received such a direction. If the Minister's answers so far are the best we are going to get from the Government, I remain totally unconvinced about the wording of various aspects of the clause and would be minded to suggest that the Committee vote on it.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I posed a number of questions to the Minister. The clause says:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''The Chief Inspector of Rail Accidents may direct that any railway accident or railway incident of a specified kind or which occurs in specified circumstances''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>One hates to repeat oneself, but will the Minister tell us precisely what the specified kind of accident or incident and the specified circumstances would be? He said that a notice would be given to the train operating company, presumably in the usual way. Being issued with a parking fine, which is not as serious as but not dissimilar to the penalty under subsection (4), is one way of being told that one has committed an offence. In planning consultations, the planning authority is effectively required only to fly post in the smallest available font. Displaying a poster is deemed to be notice. The Minister will have to do a little better to clarify the purpose of the clause, or we shall have to return to the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> I hope that I can help the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) a bit further. It will be for the chief inspector to decide. That is made quite clear in clause 1. The chief inspector can say that he is concerned about particular incidents that are taking place on the railway and say how he wants those investigations to be conducted. If, as the hon. Gentleman says, issues concern a number of operators the chief inspector may well be looking at an investigation by one of his own inspectors, whom he would direct. But he makes those judgments about the appropriate locus for such investigations.<P>
The industry itself&#151;the train operators or Network Rail&#151;can and will make its own investigations. It will look at the causes of minor incidents, particularly if there is a series of incidents, to find out whether there is a fundamental problem. After all, that applies right across industry, not just transport. When difficulties arise, even if they are not related to safety and where there is no threat to life, industry will look at those incidents to establish causes and to remedy them. Rather than have his inspectors conduct all the investigations, the clause enables the inspector to tell companies how they should carry out investigations to get some sort of consistency. One important feature of such investigations, and this draws very much on the experience of the other two branches, will be examination of underlying problems to see whether <p>


<b>Column Number: 85</b></p>


they have an industry-wide application and the dissemination of that information at the earliest possible date to spread best practice more rapidly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I hear what the Minister is saying, but he is now redefining the word ''manner''. Manner implies the way in which an investigation is carried out, not, as the Minister said a few moments ago, the locus of the investigation. We are told that the chief inspector will specify the locus of the investigation, not the way in which it is carried out. The record will clearly show what the Minister said.<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> I am clearly saying that the chief inspector determines the locus by deciding whether he wants the inspectors to investigate certain issues under his direction. Some issues will properly be investigated at company level. The inspector will be able to prescribe the procedures under which investigations take place in order to ensure consistency and to facilitate the spread of best practice. Other matters are consequential on having a regime to ensure that the directions are followed at company level.<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): I am particularly concerned about subsection (6), under which the person committing an offence does not necessarily have to prove that he was aware of the direction. Why not? Is that normal? For a simple person like myself, a recorded delivery might constitute sufficient proof. What is the current maximum statutory fine?<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> It is quite normal to provide that ignorance of a law or regulation is not necessarily a defence, and the maximum fine on the current scale is &#163;5,000. A direction specifies the manner, but it can also specify the types of accident to be investigated&#151;in this case, under clause 1. On the point raised by the hon. Member for Bath, clause 2 deals with the procedures under which the investigation is being conducted.<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I am going either deaf or mad&#151;[<w5>Interruption.] That guarantees keeping the Under-Secretary awake. Did I hear the Minister say that the powers are being exercised under clause 1? Does he not mean subsection (1) of the clause, which would put a different gloss on the matter?<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> A verbal typographical error.<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Indeed. I hope that we do not have too many of them.<P>
I accept that ignorance of the law is no excuse, but I seek further clarification from the Minister. He said that a train-operating company would be notified that a direction had been issued against it. A &#163;5,000 fine is not substantial, even in circumstances where not much money is being made and the franchises are being renegotiated. Precisely how will the company be informed about the direction, and how will it be made aware that the channels of information are working?<p>


<b>Column Number: 86</b></p>



<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> The hon. Lady shows a considerable lack of confidence in the train operating companies set up under Conservative legislation. The various regulatory bodies for the railway industry regularly notify the companies of relevant procedures, any changes to them and subsequent directions. Whatever its problems, the rail industry has always benefited from good communications in respect of regulations. I find the idea of considerable ignorance in this sector an odd proposition. In some cases, people may not follow the procedures, but we all want to ensure that operators do follow them and promote best practice&#151;precisely why the Cullen report recommended the establishment of an RAIB to identify the causes of accidents and to spread best practice by highlighting the lessons to be learned from them. We all agree with that and it is central to the Bill's purpose.<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I seek further clarification of how the notification will be delivered&#151;by post or, in today's world, by e-mail? Could a receipt be sent in that way? It is not the same as a summons, which has to be issued in person.<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> These could, if necessary, be sent by recorded delivery, but I stress again that directions to train operators can be published to facilitate broad knowledge of what is going on in the industry. The hon. Gentleman reveals a considerable lack of confidence in train operators. The Bill is about improving the safety culture in the industry and we are here providing the mechanism to achieve that.<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> It is not so much a lack of confidence in the operators as in the postal system. We all have experience of letters going missing. I have no problem with the concept; I simply want a failsafe. I am interested in finding out how these important directions and notifications will normally be delivered to the persons concerned. As I said, the post, and even e-mails, can go wrong. We must be fair to the people involved. It is not that we want them to avoid the notifications; we want to ensure that they are aware of them so that they can get on with the job. That is my worry&#151;not the principle, but the practicalities.<P>

Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.<p>


<b>Column Number: 87</b></p>



<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Accident regulations</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I beg to move amendment No.16, in<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>clause 10, page 6, line 32, at end insert<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> 'Accident reports such as those conducted in the event of a road accident should be completed by the relevant investigators acting under the provision of this Bill, ensuring greater transparency and security across all modes of travel.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to deal with a particular issue, so I request, particularly in view of yesterday's statement by the Secretary of State, a stand part debate on clause 10.
<P>
The amendment deals with the provision whereby:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''The Secretary of State may make regulations in connection with the investigation of railway accidents and railway incidents''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The explanatory notes say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''Clause 10 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations which would allow, for example, requirements to be made on the reporting of accidents and incidents to the RAIB (so that they may then investigate those accidents and incidents). Such provision would not affect existing obligations to report accidents to HSE''&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT>the Health and Safety Executive.
<P>
The document that is referred to in respect of road accidents is called Stats15 or Stats19&#151;I cannot remember which, but the Minister will know what I am talking about. My understanding is based on familiarisation that I have had with road accident cases, and I believe that the casebook ''Wilkinson's Road Traffic Offences'' is the authority, as it goes into great detail on the issues. The police fill in road accident reports primarily to record the root cause of the accident and, in doing so, they consider driver behaviour in terms of the vehicle's speed and whether the driver was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
<P>
The accident report also goes into detail about the state of the road surface. It notes whether it was a dry day or whether the weather could have contributed to the accident. A wet road can affect a car's braking distance, and an icy road can affect a car's ability to stop in time or not to veer off the road or into the path of an oncoming vehicle. Poor visibility owing to fog or mist can also have an impact. The statistics noted in the road accident reports are vital to determining the root cause of an accident.
<P>
The thinking behind our amendment was summed up by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) clearly and poignantly on Second Reading, when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''our starting point should be the fact that a life is a life is a life. Saving a life on the roads or in the air is at least as valuable to society as saving one in any other context.''&#151;[Official Report, 28 January 2003; Vol. 398, c. 778.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>We enjoy an inherently good safety record on our railways and roads in this country. However, because by definition more people tend to get hurt in one railway accident or incident than in a huge number of accidents on our roads in any one day, rail accidents appear more graphic and horrific.We set great store by the fact that the loss of a life, or an injury incurred, is equally damaging and should have equal value whether it occurs on the railways, in the air, on the sea or on the roads. We want greater transparency in <p>


<b>Column Number: 88</b></p>


respect of safety, and we want to see that we are working towards increasing the security and safety of all modes of transport. On Second Reading, we noted with regret that we should have liked the Bill to touch on aspects of road safety&#151;but we can return to that at a later stage.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have procedures in place. Clause 10(1) empowers the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''make regulations in connection with the investigation of railway accidents and . . . incidents.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>We believe that, as part of that investigation, accident reports relating to railways could usefully draw on the experience with roads. Road accident reports have been in operation for some time. I understand that the authorities&#151;the Under-Secretary might confirm that that includes the Highways Agency and the police&#151;rely on them, for example, to improve the safety of a road. Clearly, if a road becomes known as an accident black spot, road accident reports will play a special role.
<P>
My next point will be particularly appropriate for the Under-Secretary. A rumour has reached me that Portland helicopter base may be under threat. In the context of saying that a life is a life and that equal value should be given to a life, whether it is lost on the railways, at sea or in the air, I hope that at some stage we can ask the Under-Secretary whether that rumour is true. It might be more appropriate to raise it under the maritime provisions of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Unless the hon. Lady can convince me that a helicopter base has any relationship to the Bill, I hope that the Minister will not deal with that matter when he replies.<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I hope to raise the matter at a later stage of this Bill, or under another Bill, which I believe will come to the Floor of the House at the end of this month. I am grateful to you for that helpful guidance, Mr. Hurst.<P>
Knowing the spirit of generosity that the Under-Secretary demonstrates on these occasions, I hope that he will acknowledge that amendment No. 16 is a practical proposal. We have benefited from drawing on reports in connection with road accidents, and such reports could be used as the model for accident reports relating to the railways. When accident reports are drafted under regulations under the clause, will the Government, rather than just establishing the root cause and, under the previous clause, giving directions to the train operating company, investigate the possibility of examining the characteristics of a particular length of track, the speed at which the train was going and other factors relating to the accident? That would enable us to learn from those reports. I have explained the thinking behind the amendment and I hope that the Under-Secretary will see that it has merit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Liberal Democrats are accused of using all sorts of parliamentary procedures to raise issues and then disseminating them in our infamous ''Focus'' leaflets, but the hon. Lady's raising of the rumoured <p>


<b>Column Number: 89</b></p>


closure of Portland helicopter base beats even some of our attempts in Committee and on the Floor of the House.<P>
The hon. Lady has moved an interesting amendment, suggesting that the way in which statistics on road accidents and incidents are collated should be used as a model for railways. I do not believe that it is necessarily a good model for us to follow. As she rightly says, data are collected under stats19, but if she studies the data in any detail she will see that they are relatively crude and simplistic. It is not really possible to glean from analysing the data the sort of helpful proposals that she mentioned.
<P>
The hon. Lady was right to say that it is important that such data be compiled and analysed in great detail. I hope that we will see improvements in the way road accident and incident data is gathered and analysed. The Committee will be interested&#151;and, I am sure, Mr. Hurst, you will be delighted&#151;to know that on Monday I was trudging through deep snow in Stockholm. My reason for going there was specifically to look at how the Swedish Government are using the collation of information on road accidents to influence vision zero, which is their scheme to reduce the number of road accidents.
<P>
The Committee will doubtless be interested to know that the Swedish Government have just established a new organisation called Strada, which is designed to bring together all the road accident and incident statistical data, not only from the police but from other bodies, including hospitals. That will be of particular relevance in respect of today's debate about data from hospitals on gunshot wounds being collated for police work.
<P>
In the same way, it is vital to ensure that detailed data on our railways are collected and that adequate information is available. I am sure that the hon. Lady is aware that such data are already collected by Railway Safety, which produces a statistical bulletin. The issue for the Minister is to give the Committee an assurance that, with the additional benefit of the work from the RAIB, we will look at ways of developing statistical analysis to ensure that we learn some significant lessons for the future improvement of rail safety.
<P>
I give an example. Strada was surprised to discover that the side of the road is more significant that previously thought. In a large number of accidents, the degree of injury was increased significantly where there were boulders on the side of the road. As a result of that research, a major programme to clear the sides of roads has begun. I am sure that other examples may arise from appropriately detailed analysis of railway statistics.
<P>
We are not minded to support the hon. Lady's amendment because we do not believe that the example she has chosen is a good one to follow. I am using this opportunity to try to obtain from the Minister a clear assurance that much more detailed gathering and analysis of statistics is intended.<p>


<b>Column Number: 90</b></p>



<P>
I end by giving an example of where much more detailed information on the railways could be gathered and analysed. The Minister may be aware&#151;I have received parliamentary answers on the matter&#151;that many incidents on the railways that have led to deaths and serious injuries were the result of vandalism or the starting of fires. The Minister will also be aware that in many of those cases there is no statistical data to tell us where such incidents occur. It is therefore not possible to identify the hot spots of that sort&#151;or black spots as the hon. Lady referred to them in relation to the roads&#151;on the railways. Much progress is needed in that area. Will the Minister assure us that improvements will be made?

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport </B>(Mr. David Jamieson): This has been an interesting and wide-ranging debate, which, Mr. Hurst, must have tested your patience. I shall, of course, stick with your stricture and focus firmly on the issues under debate.<P>
Clause 10 is not about the rail accident investigation branch report itself. That is covered elsewhere in the Bill. The clause concerns the reporting by industry to the rail accident investigation branch that an accident or an incident has occurred. It is then the responsibility of the rail accident investigation branch to analyse the data from those reports.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I apologise to the Minister for intervening so soon, but a further question has just occurred to me. We know that, very shortly, the rail safety and standards board will be set up. That will in part replace Railway Safety, which currently gathers the statistics and carries out the analysis. Will the Minister confirm that, in future, the rail accident investigation branch, and not the rail safety and standards board, will compile that information?<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> I am reliably informed that RSSB will gather information and give it to the rail accident investigation branch. I hope that that addresses the hon. Gentleman's point.<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It is clear from the clause that the regulations will require a person to notify the rail accident investigation branch. Will there be an equal requirement on people to notify the RSSB?<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> The requirement in the clause is to inform the rail accident investigation branch.<P>
The hon. Member for Vale of York made some interesting points, but sadly many of them were not relevant to the Bill. She made the good point that the importance of saving a life is just as relevant in one form of transport as it is in another. I accept the premise of that argument.
<P>
We have one of the best records on road safety in the world. Sweden also has a very good record in that area. The hon. Member for Bath went to Sweden, but he did not tell us what he did there other than look at road safety.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Would the Minister like the details?<p>


<b>Column Number: 91</b></p>


<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> This may be testing your patience, Mr. Hurst, as well as that of the Committee.<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am delighted to tell the Minister what I did in Sweden, because a number of issues that I discussed there will come up later in the Bill. I discussed with the Swedish Ministry of Transport the improvements that it has made in dealing with road safety issues. I then met the police and was given a very nice Swedish police baseball cap. I discussed enforcement with the police, and will return to that matter when we discuss the British Transport police.<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> I am sure that the Committee is endlessly grateful to the hon. Gentleman for telling us that, and I am sure that an account will appear in a ''Focus'' leaflet shortly.<P>
The hon. Member for Vale of York made an important point about transparency, which we should address specifically. The rail accident investigation branch will carry out its investigations openly and transparently and will be required to keep all those affected by the accidents&#151;the industry, regulators, owners, manufacturers and, importantly, the bereaved and injured&#151;informed of the progress of the investigations. Following an accident, the rail accident investigation branch will publish a report as quickly as possible within 12 months on the accident and its causes. I assure the Committee that if urgent safety lessons emerge immediately, the rail accident investigation branch will publish interim reports so that the lessons can be shared with the industry as quickly as possible. If it became clear within days or weeks that a particular aspect of the track or a carriage had caused the accident, the branch would make an interim report to ensure that immediate action was taken, rather than wait for the final report to come out.
<P>
<H5>10. 15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Vale of York spoke about roads to say that investigations into rail accidents will continue to be conducted in much greater detail than the investigations that currently take place into road accidents. Most accidents on the road are not investigated at all, because the police are not called to those incidents. They may involve injury and considerable damage, and lessons could be learned from them, but many are not investigated at all. Indeed, it could be argued that it would be impractical to do so.
<P>
The rail accident investigation branch will gather all the relevant data and use them to inform safety recommendations. The hon. Lady gave the example of the state of the road or the weather, and the hon. Member for Bath asked whether the branch will analyse data fairly and draw lessons from them. The simple answer is yes. If a particular piece of rolling stock or line has a problem, it will be up to the branch to make the relevant report. I hope that hon. Members can draw comfort from that response.
<P>
I do not want to be drawn too much on helicopters, and I can say only that whether at sea, on road or on rail, we endeavour to ensure the maximum safety <p>


<b>Column Number: 92</b></p>


commensurate with the standards set out in the relevant regulations. The hon. Lady will appreciate what I am saying.
<P>
The rail accident investigation branch will establish the root causes of rail accidents and incidents and publish detailed reports as soon as possible. That is designed to create the maximum possible transparency and security by sharing all safety lessons with the industry.
<P>
<B>Tom Brake (Carshalton and Wallington):</B> On the point of transparency, will the Minister clarify whether the statistical information to which he referred will be available publicly rather than just to the industry, and whether the information will be broken down by train operating company, so that people can compare the safety record of each company?<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> Yes, the aviation and marine accident investigation branch reports are public. I see them on a regular basis, and RAIB reports will be available publicly to all those who need to respond to them.<P>
I hope that I have answered the questions of the hon. Member for Vale of York, and on that basis, I urge her to withdraw her amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Subject to any later developments, I must say that it is nice to see the Under-Secretary returning to better health. I am most grateful for his reply. The amendment was designed to prompt debate and to elicit the information that we have had. If it emerges from the root causes report and from the information that will be shared with the industry that there is an accident black spot on a particular line or stretch of line, that will be useful for the industry. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I am grateful for the chance to talk about the background and thinking behind the clause. It allows the Secretary of State to make regulations that would allow requirements to be made in the reporting of accidents and incidents to the rail accident investigation branch so that it may investigate them. We are told that such provision would not affect existing obligations to report accidents to the Health and Safety Executive.<P>
In a written ministerial statement&#151;one of the curious new instruments that have replaced the old ''Gardeners' Question Time'' planted written question&#151;the Secretary of State said yesterday:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''In April of last year my predecessor asked the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) for advice on the report of the rail industry's European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) programme team on how best to take forward the recommendations from the public inquiry on train protection systems jointly chaired by Professor Uff and Lord Cullen. I have now received the Commission's advice, in a letter to me of 5 February from the Commission Chair. I have placed a copy in the Library.''</FONT></UL><p>


<b>Column Number: 93</b></p>


<UL><font size=-1>
<P>
</UL></FONT>I do not yet have a copy of that letter, but when I do, I shall read it with great interest. It would be helpful, Mr. Hurst, if we could make use of your good offices to make representations on behalf of the Committee that what is probably quite a short letter should be published in Hansard for the benefit of hon. Members rather than our having to snaffle off to the Library to find our own copy.
<P>
The Secretary of State continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''The Commission says that the present programme of fitting the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) 'is already delivering real safety benefits'. The Commission 'accepts that the Uff/Cullen timetable for installing ERTMS is not viable' and that 'the current state of technology means that at the moment further use of health and safety law to mandate ERTMS is not appropriate'. They endorse Level 2 as the best system for this country, although the Commission's consultants describe Level 2 as still at an early stage of development, and accept that Level 1 will reduce capacity. The Commission recommends that the Strategic Rail Authority take the lead in developing a single national programme for ERTMS development. I have accepted the HSC's advice.'' &#151;[Official Report, 5 February 2003; Vol. 399, c. 14-16WS.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Committee will recall that, in columns 769 and 770 on Second Reading, the Secretary of State helpfully set out the relevant merits and the state of play of each level.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady's remarks are ranging much too widely. The clause is narrowly drawn, and I would be obliged if she could contain herself to it.<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I hear your strictures, Mr. Hurst, and will follow them to the letter.<P>
The Ministers told us on Tuesday to expect an important announcement from the Health and Safety Commission that would have a bearing on the clause. In the absence of any further advice from the Ministers, I understand that that statement was released in the letter to which the Secretary of State referred, and which has now been put in the Library. The notes that the Library prepared refer to the role of the Health and Safety Executive:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''Clause 10 allows the secretary of state to make regulations which would allow requirements to be made for the reporting of both rail accidents and incidents to the RAIB. Currently all accidents are reported to the HSE and BTP when they occur and all incidents are reported to the HSE. The government proposed in the consultation document that the industry added another body, the RAIB, to the list of those who need to be reported to when an accident occurs. It did not propose the separate reporting of incidents to the RAIB and HSE but thought that the RAIB would have the right to obtain that information from the HSE as well as industry and HSE reports.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I merely ask what bearing that work by the Health and Safety Executive will have on future work on the European rail traffic management system. Perhaps the Under-Secretary can confirm that the statement that we were expecting from the Health and Safety Executive is the one that has now been placed in the Library. That would be most helpful.
<P>
Subsection (2)(a) gives the Secretary of State far-ranging powers to make regulations that may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''require a person to notify the Rail Accident Investigation Branch of a railway accident or railway incident''.</FONT></UL><p>


<b>Column Number: 94</b></p>


<UL><font size=-1>
<P>
</UL></FONT>Is that provision the same as those for, say, a serious road accident, when the drivers of the vehicles are obliged to report the accident to the police. Does subsection (2) create a new requirement for a person to give notification of such an accident? That raises the question of who that person might be. By implication, will the clause enable regulations to describe who that person should be? The clause is limited and could go much further by detailing what the regulations will specify. We are not assisted by the Library, which informs us that certain consultations took place, but does not report them in any detail.
<P>
Subsection (2) further says that the regulations may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''make provision about the timing, form and content of notice given by virtue of paragraph (a).''
<P>
</UL></FONT>It is important to elicit from the Government an indication of whether, for example, there will be a 24-hour period in which a person&#151;again, it will be interesting to know who that person should be&#151;should inform the railway accident investigation branch of a railway accident or incident. The Under-Secretary indicated that there are certain circumstances in which a person is not obliged to report a road accident. It is my clear understanding that a road accident must be reported if there is a fatality or a person is injured, even if only slightly. I seek an assurance that the regulations will specify that, because we are still in the dark about whether every accident will be deemed to be a railway accident or incident when a person is killed or seriously injured.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
Can the Minister confirm that the regulations will specify the severity of the accident or incident and will state that precise circumstances? He alluded to circumstances in which an accident needs to be reported and there is substantial damage to property&#151;presumably the carriage, the railway station or dwelling houses adjacent to or abutting the station. We need more information about the precise scope of the regulations.
<P>
Subsection (3) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''The regulations may, in particular, require a person to take or not to take specified action following an accident or incident&#151;
<P>
(a) pending the commencement of an investigation, or
<P>
(b) during the process of an investigation.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Minister may like to draw on the experience of the other two branches of investigation, the marine and aviation accident investigation branches, to help us this morning. Subsection (3) is not sufficiently clear and we need further information.
<P>
Subsection (4) states that the regulation may create an offence. I imagine that it will be a new offence, but we are told that it would not be an offence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding the maximum term which may be imposed by a magistrates' court in accordance with section 78 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>It would be helpful to know what the terms of the offence are, even in the broadest outline. I am sure that the Minister must have some idea of that. When are the Government going to produce these regulations? The clause is illuminating up to a point but leaves huge scope for the enabling regulations. The Minister for Transport indicated earlier that the regulations would <p>


<b>Column Number: 95</b></p>


be produced shortly after the Bill receives Royal Assent and he must have more detailed knowledge that could help us to understand the clause better. The Under-Secretary may be in a position to share that with us.
<P>
I am particularly concerned about subsection (4)(b). It confers on the Secretary of State ''a discretionary function''. I always shudder when I hear that expression, although less so when it applies to the present Secretary of State than when it applied to his predecessor. What will that discretionary function be? What is the purpose of conferring a discretionary function by regulation, rather than specifying it in the Bill? What is the remit of the function? Who would exercise it on behalf of the Secretary of State? We know that the present Secretary of State is a very busy man.
<P>
Can the Under-Secretary confirm that clause 10(4)(c) is the normal format for conferring jurisdiction on a court or tribunal? Obviously, the situation will be different in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland and Scotland, but will he confirm whether the clause will apply to all parts of the United Kingdom? As the explanatory notes do not specify anything else, I can only assume that it will.
<P>
The explanatory notes also say that the additional staffing needed by the Department for Transport for the rail accident investigation branch is identified in table 1 of the regulatory impact assessment. It is anticipated that 14 professional staff and eight support staff will be needed. I assume that those are the inspectors and investigators that were referred to earlier. Will the Under-Secretary put my mind at rest and assure me that clause 10 will not lead to further employment, but that the functions of clause 10 will be carried out by those who already work for the Department?
<P>
To recap, we believe that clause 10 is misleading and does not go far enough. We need to know who will be required to notify the rail accident investigation branch in the case of a fatality or serious injury and what the timing will be. Will it be 24 hours, three months or a year? We also need to know the content of the notice given under subsection (2)(a) and whether it will be published in the usual way or in the form of a letter, leaving it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) said, to the vagaries of the Post Office. Finally, I seek guidance on who will discharge the discretionary function, and would welcome a little more information about the offence created by the clause.

<P>

<B>Tom Brake:</B> I shall make two brief points. First, subsection (3) refers to<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''(a) pending the commencement of an investigation, or
<P>
(b) during the process of an investigation.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Is it likely or possible that the regulations will require some action, such as monitoring a site, to be taken or not taken after an investigation?
<P>
Secondly, I want to reinforce the point made by the hon. Member for Vale of York about the discretionary function conferred by subsection (4)(b). What will be the range and remit of that function, and who will exercise it?<p>


<b>Column Number: 96</b></p>



<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> This has been an interesting debate, in which a considerable number of questions have been raised, and I shall endeavour to answer them.<P>
The Government have no wish to add an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to the system of accident reporting. Subsection (2) simply allows the Secretary of State to add the rail accident investigation branch to the list of organisations to which accidents on the railway must be notified. I hope that that clears up one point raised by the hon. Member for Vale of York. Other organisations include the Health and Safety Executive, the police and, in some circumstances, the other emergency services. The Government intend to ensure as far as possible that the additional notification requirement to the rail accident investigation branch will operate in much the same way as existing notification requirements placed on the train companies.
<P>
The hon. Lady mentioned the European rail traffic management system. In the margins of Tuesday's sitting, we drew to the attention of the official Opposition and the Liberal Democrats the fact that a statement would probably be made this week. We felt that that information should be available to the Opposition. There is no link between the Bill and any decision or announcement made by the HSE, but because this is a safety issue, we felt that it would be helpful at least to say in the debate that such a statement would be made.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> That was most helpful. The Minister implied that the issue that formed part of yesterday's statement was of only marginal interest, but the Secretary of State devoted three columns of Hansard to it on Second Reading. I am mindful of your strictures, Mr. Hurst, but given that the Bill relates primarily to railways, yesterday's announcement should not be underplayed. The potential of the ERTMS&#151;I recall, Mr. Hurst, that I am not allowed to use acronyms, so it is the European rail traffic management system&#151;to prevent accidents is huge, so I hope that we will have some opportunity to debate its contribution. I seek guidance on what will be the appropriate stage to discuss that.<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> The hon. Lady rightly says that the implications of rail traffic systems are huge. Alas, they are not relevant to the clause, but I hope that we may find an opportunity&#151;with your permission, Mr. Hurst&#151;to discuss them. The issue was discussed on Second Reading. There was also discussion of the difference between speed on the road and speed on the railways. That was also irrelevant to the Bill, but there was quite an interesting exchange.<P>
The hon. Lady will know that clause 7, which we have passed, creates an offence of failing to disclose evidence or otherwise obstructing an investigation. Clause 10(3) will allow regulations to ensure that people do not tamper with or destroy evidence before or during an accident investigation&#151;for example, by deleting a record&#151;so that an investigator cannot use it later. Similar restrictions could be placed on a railway company, so that it would not be allowed to move a carriage that was involved in an accident until the <p>


<b>Column Number: 97</b></p>


RAIB inspectors had finished examining it. The detail of what is reported and by whom will not change. It is just that people will now tell the RAIB as well as the HSE.
<P>
The time scale to which the hon. Lady referred would depend to some extent on the severity of the incident. For example, a lesser time may be expected for a minor incident. The normal expectation will be that reporting takes place within 24 hours. The hon. Lady asked what would be reported. That will be in reference to accidents and incidents, which will be defined in regulations under clause 2. The hon. Lady will recall my right hon. Friend the Minister for Transport saying that the regulations will be commensurate with European Union regulations.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Lady asked about clause 10(4)(b), which provides for a discretionary function. An example of that function would be if the chief inspector agreed to allow a train operating company 36 rather than 24 hours to report. The court or tribunal provision in paragraph (c) is a routine measure. She also asked about the staffing for the regulator. The figures in the impact assessment are indicative. The actual numbers will be a matter for the chief inspector to determine, but we have made an effort to indicate what we expect those figures to be. She asked about the offence in subsection (4)(a). That will be for failing to notify the rail accident investigation branch of an accident or incident.
<P>
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) made a good point that some of the information that will be gleaned could be used to monitor a site by those who have responsibility. I hope that I have covered all the points that were raised.
<P>
<B>Tom Brake:</B> The Minister did not touch on the conferring of a discretionary function or set out the range of those functions. Will he indicate the remit and who may take on the functions?<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> I mentioned what the discretionary function was. I said that it would give the chief inspector a small discretion over some issues and gave the example of the length of time that a train operating company had to report an incident. That is the type of discretion available.<P>
I hope that I have been able to satisfy the Committee and that clause 10 will stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I was interested in the Under-Secretary's remarks about the European element of the regulations. He will be aware of my long-standing interest in matters European, and I am fortunate enough, Mr. Hurst, to serve on the European Scrutiny Committee under the distinguished chairmanship of your co-Chairman, Mr. Hood.<P>
The Minister for Transport said earlier in Committee, and the Secretary of State for Transport has said elsewhere, that if the Europeans came up with regulations that the Government deemed to be a better system of safety provision for railways, we would <p>


<b>Column Number: 98</b></p>


adopt them. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that such regulations would be subject to the European Scrutiny Committee and could be referred for debate to one of the European Standing Committees? The contents of those regulations could have&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that that is a matter on which the Under-Secretary should comment in debating clause 10.<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I will stick to what is within his competence, limited as you say it is, Mr. Hurst.<P>
I understand the Minister's comment that the purpose of clause 10 is simply to add the rail accident investigation branch to the list of bodies to which accidents will be reported. I am still unclear who the person under clause 10(2)(a) would be, and about the fact that it would amount to an offence if the time limit before which the accident should be reported were not respected. Should the limit be 24 hours, three months or a year? Will that person be told what severity of accident would apply, to enable him to realise that he is that person and that there is that time limit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> Let me cover a few of those points. The European Union regulations will be a minimum; some countries may decide, as we have, that standards should be higher. It would be nonsensical for our regulations not to be in line with, or at least commensurate with, those elsewhere in the EU. As for the European Scrutiny Committee considering the matter, I have to say that I do not call that Committee; it calls me. The train operator or Network Rail would report the accident.<P>
The hon. Lady asked about delays in reporting. It would depend whether those organisations were unreasonably delaying or denying information. As a lawyer, she probably understands that expression, but I think that that is how it would be defined.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Crown application</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I rise to satisfy my curiosity. The clause relates to<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''property irrespective of whether it belongs to or is used for the purposes of the Crown or a Duchy.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Will the Minister for Transport elucidate what the property of the Crown might be? For instance, the royal train springs to mind. I wonder which duchies might be involved. I am aware that the Duchy of Cornwall has extensive interests; I presume that the Duchy of Lancaster has, too. It would be immensely helpful to know.
<P>
Is clause 11 a standard clause that applied to the accident investigation branches that were set up in 1982 and 1986? What are the implications if, God forbid, the royal train is involved in an accident? I presume that the royals would not be able claim royal <p>


<b>Column Number: 99</b></p>


prerogative, saying that they did not wish the train to be subject to investigation. What property belonging to a duchy is covered by the Bill? Is it a standard clause, or was it dreamed up for the purposes of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> My understanding is that it is a standard clause, to which the Queen's consent has to be obtained. Indeed, it has been obtained. It therefore means that wherever in the country an accident happens, the accident investigation branch will be able to work without fear or hindrance. Obviously, some railway lines run through royal lands, but inspectors would still need to investigate them. My suspicion that the royal train is not Crown property has been confirmed. It is provided by the rail industry, but it is owned by Network Rail.<P>
The provisions will have been covered by existing clauses, but for the sake of clarity we have included the standard clause to enable the RAIB to go about its business.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5></font><font size=2>

<P><font size=2>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Now that the typographical errors are behind us, may I elicit from the Minister an undertaking that clause 12(3) means that the affirmative procedure will be used in each case? It is not specified that the regulations made under clause 12 relating to the clauses we have discussed will be brought forward shortly after Royal Assent. Will he confirm that the regulations will be customarily made by statutory instrument, as for the other two accident investigation branches set up under the maritime and aviation provisions?<P>
It is curious to note that under clause 12(1) the regulations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''(b) may make different provision for different cases or circumstances, and</FONT></UL><p>


<b>Column Number: 101</b></p>


<UL><font size=-1>
<P>
(c) may include transitional, consequential or incidental provision.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Will the Minister specify what ''transitional'' means? Would such transitional regulations be repealed? Will he also state what ''consequential'' means? Is the making of regulations consequential on the report? His elucidation would help us to understand clause 12. Will he reassure us that it contains no typographical errors?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> As we have already made clear in previous debates, the affirmative resolution would be used for regulations under clause 1(2). As hon. Members will recall, that allowed the Secretary of State to amend the definition of ''railway'' or ''railway property''. We have discussed the fact that it is a Henry VIII power allowing secondary legislation to amend primary legislation. Other regulations under this part of the Bill will be made by statutory instrument, as with the maritime and aviation branch regulations.<P>
The regulations will set out detailed working arrangements for the branch in the same way as for the civil aviation and maritime branches. The equivalent regulations are made through the negative resolution procedure. As Lord Cullen recommended that the RAIB should be modelled on the AAIB, we see no reason why the RAIB regulations should not be made in the same manner. We intend to publish regulations soon after Royal Assent.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> We are still no nearer to defining the meaning of ''transitional''. If the regulations are modelled on those governing the marine accident investigation branch, which have existed for some considerable time, but not for as long as those that govern the aviation accident investigation branch, why should the Government need to have transitional provisions?<P>
The Minister will know that, in most circumstances, the Opposition have a strong, almost religious, belief that all regulations should be passed under affirmative resolution procedure. However, as the Minister just reminded the Committee, the regulations under the two Acts that set up the marine and aviation equivalents were passed under statutory instrument, which weakens the argument. Will the Minister confirm that ''transitional'' regulations will be used only in the rarest of circumstances in cases where the regulations relating to transport bodies already exist? After all, he admitted that those bodies work extremely well under those regulations. I do not understand why we need transitional regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> I wondered what the religion of the Conservative party was, now that the Church of England has deserted them.<P>
The reason for transitional provisions is to allow a smooth transition to the new system. They will be used only where needed. The consequential provision is to allow regulations to deal with minor matters, where <p>


<b>Column Number: 102</b></p>


required, as a result of making the RAIB regulations. The clause is designed for good order and smooth transition.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 12, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Extent</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Subsection (1) states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''This Part extends to the whole of the United Kingdom.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''In the application of this Part in relation to Scotland any reference to a tramway shall be disregarded.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That raises two questions. First, I envisage a situation in which the clause would be dropped, especially in relation to cities such as Edinburgh and Glasgow that were sufficiently large to carry a tramway and used to have trams, and bearing in mind that the Government's adviser on integrated transport, Mr. Begg, comes from the Scottish capital. I do not know how the Government would deal with a Scottish city that wanted to apply to have a tramway.
<P>
Secondly, we had an interesting but bemusing discussion with the Under-Secretary, to which I shall return as soon as possible in the time left to us. I am still hesitant about the difference between a tram and a trolley bus. I would have accepted the Under-Secretary's explanation readily had he said simply that trolley buses do not exist in the United Kingdom. Such a factual statement would be acceptable. However, if trolley buses do exist in this country and are involved in a serious accident or incident that falls under the provisions of the Bill, they will be investigated by the police, which I take to be the British Transport police.
<P>
I therefore believe that a number of issues are at fault in part 1, which cannot now be amended. There are several uncertainties, such as what constitutes a trolley bus&#151;do they exist in this country?&#151;what constitutes a tram, and whether Scotland is to have a tramway. It is regrettable that it is not clear who the investigating authority will be for trolley buses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Hurst. I am a little confused about the implications of new clause 5, which will follow our deliberations on clause 13. Subsection (1) states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''This Part extends to the whole of the United Kingdom.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Exceptions to that provision are given in subsections (2) and (3). New clause 5 would exclude that part of the channel tunnel that is currently part of the United Kingdom. If it were successful, would we find ourselves in some difficulty?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that that problem would find its resolution on Report.<p>


<b>Column Number: 103</b></p>


<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Lazarowicz </B>(Edinburgh, North and Leith): I do not want to pursue the philosophical question of the essential nature and concept of a trolley bus, which the hon. Member for Vale of York referred to, but I would like to say something about Scotland being excluded from the clause's provisions. Unlike the hon. Lady, I have some knowledge of Edinburgh and of Scottish legislation, so I know why tramways are being excluded. The tramways are a matter that is devolved to the Scottish Parliament and Executive, whereas railways are a matter for this Parliament. However, I wonder whether the clause is too restrictive.<P>
As the Minister made clear in Tuesday's debate, it was always envisaged that the rail accident investigation branch would have discretionary powers to investigate accidents on tramways. The relevant Scottish authorities might not have the expertise to carry out an investigation into an accident that occurred on a Scottish tramway, and they might wish to ask the United Kingdom rail accident investigation branch to investigate. So far as I can see, the exclusion in clause 13(2), which deletes references to tramways in Scotland, means that the rail accident investigation branch, which is given its powers under clause 6, would not be able to investigate such an accident, even if it were invited to by the Scottish authorities. I am sure that that is not intended; I may have read the clause incorrectly. Will the Minister confirm whether the rail accident investigation branch would have the power to investigate an accident on a tramway in Scotland if it were asked to do so by the Scottish authorities?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> I think that I can assist my hon. Friend. Under clause 5, the chief inspector of rail accidents may arrange for the rail accident investigation branch to assist<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''any person . . . with or without charge''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That might appeal to the Scottish Executive. That help may be provided
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>''inside or outside the United Kingdom.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That discretionary power would enable the investigation branch to provide assistance, should it be required, in the event of there being a tramway in Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lazarowicz:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend for that welcome assurance. In case it was thought that my raising the point was unnecessary, given that there are no tramways in Scotland, I should explain that there are plans to develop tramways there. Indeed, thanks to the generous support of the Scottish Executive, plans are well advanced for a tramway in Edinburgh, the first line of which will run substantially through my constituency.<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I seek further clarification of what the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz) has just spoken about. I accept what the Minister says. I simply wonder whether clause 13(2) takes precedence over what was said earlier, because it states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ''In the application of this Part in relation to Scotland any reference to a tramway shall be disregarded.''</FONT></UL><p>


<b>Column Number: 104</b></p>


<UL><font size=-1><P>

<P>
I wonder whether lawyers will have a lot of fun over that, or whether the Minister's assurance in Committee will be sufficient.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> We first had questions about the differences between trolley buses and trams. Both run for part of the distance on roads, although trolley buses run on wheels and with no track, whereas trams run on tracks, some of which are on roads. To answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Vale of York, trolley bus accidents would be investigated by the local police force, not the British Transport police.<P>
The hon. Member for Uxbridge is right that clause 13(2) takes precedence on the question of jurisdiction. To answer the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith, clause 5 provides that the RAIB can assist if requested to do so by the body that has jurisdiction over the tramway system in Scotland. The question of which body has jurisdiction is clear from clause 13(2). As for the operational side, if there were a request from the body with jurisdiction&#151;the relevant Scottish body&#151;the RAIB could provide assistance and expertise, as it is given discretion to do under clause 5.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I hate to speak in such bleak terms, but I shall put this as bluntly as I dare. The Government are in a mess over this provision. That emerged clearly on the Floor of the House in questions to the Secretary of State for Scotland. This touches on the pertinent point raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who responded to my question on behalf of the Secretary of State, could not have put it more clearly. I do not have the Hansard in front of me, but if memory serves me correctly, she said that the issues in relation to what was devolved and what was reserved had not been resolved and were a matter of ongoing discussion.<P>
We have waited a considerable time for the Bill to come before the House and the Committee. I think that it was promised at a very early stage of this Parliament and may even have been referred to&#151;[Interruption.] There is no point in the two Ministers chuntering away with their hon. Friends. They are, rightly, deeply embarrassed. They have had plenty of time to avoid typographical errors such as we have seen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lazarowicz:</B> Having raised the issue, may I tell the hon. Lady that I for one am entirely satisfied with the answer given by the Minister? Rather than pursuing points about which she perhaps has not read as much recently as she should have, she should pursue schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998, which explains the way in which any disputes can be resolved.<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I shall respond in kind by referring the hon. Gentleman to the Hansard of Tuesday 4 February. As I said, the Under-Secretary, responding to my question, stated that the matters had not been resolved at the highest level and were subject to ongoing consultation. It is highly regrettable and <p>


<b>Column Number: 105</b></p>


unacceptable that these provisions are before us when those matters could have been resolved before we reached this stage. The Bill will leave the House in a state of confusion.<P>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<P>
I hope that new clause 5 is fairly self-explanatory, since I established that Eurotunnel is not Crown property. With the help of the Clerks, I found the right place in the Bill for this new clause. The official Opposition were not privy to the full and comprehensive consultation undertaken over many months by the Government in preparation for the Bill. I remind the Committee that I am a shareholder of Eurotunnel, although happily my shares are not of significant pecuniary value.
<P>
In 1983-84, I worked in the humble capacity of adviser to the Conservatives in the European Parliament. I had meetings with a number of officials at No. 10 in the heyday when we were in power. The No. 10 policy unit was well known to me, as eventually was the then Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> Is this a declaration of interest or a confession?<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> It is background information. I have long been a firm believer that there should be a fixed link. At the time, 20 years ago, we were all much younger than we are today&#151;<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Twenty years to be precise.<p>


<b>Column Number: 106</b></p>


<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his mathematical prowess. I was a firm subscriber to the view that there should be a fixed link and in my view Eurotunnel was the best form for it to take. I put my money where my mouth was.<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I am listening with great interest. At the risk of criticising my hon. Friend, I think I am correct in saying&#151;this may help with her declaration of shares&#151;that the tunnel under the channel is not called Eurotunnel; that is one of the companies involved. There is a slight fault in our new clause, which we should have corrected, but it is a probing measure. We want to know what the situation is. That mistake means that a very interesting debate is to come.<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend. That typographical error is clear, so we will be enable to pursue the matter. I would have preferred the new clause to read that part 1 should not apply to the channel tunnel. For the purposes of history, may I say that I was delighted when the channel tunnel scheme was chosen for the fixed link. Eurotunnel was the company to which we were invited to subscribe by the then Government. I felt that someone like me who was passionate about the fixed link not so much with France but with the rest of the European continent should make a modest investment.<P>
That is not to detract from my enthusiasm for the North sea ferries out of ports such as Harwich&#151;you will know, Mr. Hurst, that I represented Harwich for 10 years in the European Parliament. I would not wish to have a dialogue with you wearing your hat as the hon. Member for Braintree.
<P>
I apologise to the Committee for the error. Obviously, part 1 should not apply to the channel tunnel, or Eurotunnel or Eurostar.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> Or the shuttle.<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Indeed.<P>
<B>Mr. Spellar:</B> Let us have a disquisition on the hovercraft.<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> We will come to the hovercraft in due course.<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Lest there be confusion in the record&#151;<P>
