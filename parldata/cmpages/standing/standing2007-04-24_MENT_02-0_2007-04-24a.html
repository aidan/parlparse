<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000332"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health(Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> May I first say what a pleasure it is to see
you in the Chair, Lady Winterton, not least because of your
surname?</div><a name="07042462000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000333"></a><b class="B">Tim

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000334"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I can try.</div>
<a name="07042462000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to the amendment, the
point that I made earlier is that there is very little case law that
would help us to say precisely what abnormally aggressive or seriously
irresponsible would mean.</div>
<a name="07042462000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000335"></a><b class="B">Ann
Coffey</b> (Stockport) (Lab): My hon. Friend&#146;s remarks
are also pertinent to the clause as a whole, which deals with learning
disability. In view of that, I find it difficult to understand why it
is in the Bill at
all.</div><a name="07042462000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000336"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. However, as
I explained earlier, the reason we have kept in clause 2, on learning
disability, is that there has been a historic attachment to saying that
learning disability should be included in the Bill in this way, and I
am afraid that there is no getting away from that. We took the clause
out of the 2004 draft Bill, but there was heavy pressure to reinsert
it, not least from the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee. In view of
the points that were made, and the fact that hon. and right hon.
Members and peers felt that we needed to be responsive to them, we said
that we would agree with the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee on
learning disability, because that meant that when we were considering
amending the Mental Health Act 1983, we would be able to leave it as it
was
originally.</div><a name="07042462000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
my point today is that to go further than that would, I am afraid,
cause the difficulties that we have discussed, not only by creating the
potential for uncertainty and the possibility of people not receiving
the treatment that they need, but over and above 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>that, because people suffering from hyperactivity or obsessive
compulsive disorder could make a very reasonable case for doing exactly
the same thing.</div> <a name="07042462000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why I am afraid we cannot agree to the amendment. I understand
completely the sentiments of the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton
and I know that she feels extremely strongly about the issue. However,
at the same time as saying that we do not believe that the amendment is
the right approach for this particular Bill, we want to ensure that we
take on board all the issues that she raised regarding early diagnosis,
and proper care and treatment. Nevertheless, I am afraid that I must
urge the Committee to reject the
amendment.</div><a name="07042462000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000337"></a><b class="B">Angela
Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con): May I say what a
pleasure it is to serve for the first time on a Committee under your
chairmanship, Lady Winterton?</div>
<a name="07042462000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to pick up on the
Minister&#146;s final considerations of the clause, not least her
remarks immediately before the Committee rose this morning. Clearly,
she prayed in aid in support of her decision not to add autistic
spectrum disorder as outlined in the amendment. She said that there was
confusion, and she prayed in aid the case of a young man with an
Asperger&#146;s diagnosis who was apparently minded to light fires.
Whether he has an ASD diagnosis or not, I think that we all understand
such activity to be arson. She described how difficult it would be for
the court to decide whether to send him to prison or to hospital. I
have to say to her that the confusion and lack of clarity is with the
existing legislation. It is quite clear that if the words
&#147;seriously irresponsible&#148; are used and if a court
believes that someone is an arsonist, that court has a duty to identify
an appropriate determination of that case. It is up to the court to
determine whether that person, regardless of their diagnosis, is sent
to prison or hospital. Therefore, by identifying seriously
irresponsible conduct, the provision actually clarifies the situation
of a person with an ASD diagnosis who is before a court in those
circumstances. I cannot agree from the Minister&#146;s example that
that would confuse people. I think that it would clarify the current
situation.</div><a name="07042462000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000338"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b><b class="B"> </b>I admit that it is an extreme example. I
was trying to make the point that because there is little case law, the
court would have to look at each case and decide whether the action was
serious and irresponsible. By adding ASD in those circumstances, we are
putting another hurdle in the way of getting treatment to
people.</div><a name="07042462000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000339"></a>Angela
Browning:</b><b class="B"> </b>I do not want to pursue that individual
case too much, but I think that the example the Minister gave before
lunch made my case for me more succinctly than anything I had said in
my hour-and-a-half-long presentation to the Committee. The Committee
was extremely tolerant, and I am grateful to everyone. However, the
Minister&#146;s pointis that if somebody was before a court
in those circumstances, the court would have difficulty deciding
whether the action was seriously irresponsible. If it even considers
prison to be an appropriate sentence, then by definition the action is
seriously irresponsible. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>If it was not seriously irresponsible, the option of
a custodial sentence would not come into the court&#146;s
considerations. I have heard the Minister&#146;s answer, but I must
ask her to revisit that case. What is being proposed would clarify
matters and not obscure them.</div>
<a name="07042462000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, I fully
understand why the Minister does not want a large pick-and-mix list of
other conditions that might be appropriate to tag on. I hope that in
the report of my submission this morning, I will have outlined many
cases in which treatment and consideration of ASD is also appropriate
for people with learning disabilities and vice versa. The conditions
are different and it would be wrong in many circumstances to lump them
together. For the purposes of the legislation, we know from what we
have learned in recent years&#151;how the condition presents itself
and its appropriate management&#151;that that is an area that is not
being addressed at the moment.</div>
<a name="07042462000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has said that
learning disabilities are included because there is an historical
reason fordoing so. That is quite true; it is a matter of
record. Instead of looking at history, the Minister now has an
opportunity to make it. There comes a point when people must say that
there is sufficient evidence to change in legislation what has changed
around us. What has changed around us in recent years is the
recognition and management of treatment of
ASD.</div><a name="07042462000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not intend
to press the amendment to a vote, not least because the Minister has
been incredibly generous in agreeing to a meeting on Thursday, after
the clause has been debated, with me and representatives from the
National Autistic Society, including a doctor with a lot of experience
in managing such cases. I hope to have another opportunity then,
perhaps in a slightly quieter environment, to talk her through the more
salient points. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="07042462000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="07042462000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
3</h4><a name="07042462000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Changes
to exclusions from operation of 1983
Act</div><a name="07042462000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000340"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in
clause 3, page 2, leave out lines 22 to 30
and insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;&#147;(3)
Dependence on alcohol or drugs is not considered to bea
disorder or disability of the mind for the purposes of subsection (2)
above.&#148;&#146;.</div><a name="07042462000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment will remove the exclusions added in the other place. Again,
it might be helpful for me to give some background to the history of
exclusions. The Mental Health Act 1959 contained only one exclusion,
stating that nothing was to imply that anyone could be dealt with under
the Act as having a mental disorder by reason only of promiscuity or
other immoral conduct. Such a provision is quite understandable in the
context of the times, as there was still a recent history of the law
being used&#151;or, as I am sure we all agree, misused&#151;to
detain women, in particular, not for health care reasons but for moral
ones, such as having a child outside
marriage.</div><a name="07042462000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
1959 Act was overhauled in 1982, two more exclusions were
added&#151;one for alcohol and drug dependence and one for sexual
deviancy. The latter was agreed with virtually no debate, but we think
that its main target was homosexuality. It is probably worth 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>remembering that even as late as 1982, homosexuality still appeared in
the international classification of diseases as a mental disorder.
Today, of course, we do not think of it as a disorder at all, nor as
sexual deviancy.</div><a name="07042462000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we came to the current reform of the legislation, our starting point
was that the needs of patients and the risks posed by their disorders
should determine whether powers of compulsion should be used where
there is no other way of getting people the treatment that they need. I
am afraid that exclusions get in the way of that principle. They are
essentially arbitrary and do not necessarily say anything about the
needs of the individual. However, we listened carefully to what was
said to us, took account of the recommendations of the Joint Scrutiny
Committee and agreed that we should keep an exclusion for alcohol and
drug dependence.</div>
<a name="07042462000298"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="07042462000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
doubt that such dependence causes a lot of harm, but we do not have a
history of using mental health legislation to force treatment for
dependence alone, and we were persuaded that there was no compelling
case to start doing so now. By contrast, we remain convinced that the
exclusion for sexual deviancy should
go.</div><a name="07042462000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000341"></a><b class="B">Chris
Bryant</b> (Rhondda) (Lab): I am sorry that I have caught the
Minister a sentence after she said the word &#147;alone&#148;. She
will note that in the exclusions that the House of Lords has given us,
the emphasis is on the word &#147;solely&#148;. For example, there
is an exemption for people who might be detained solely on the grounds
of substance misuse. There is no such word as &#147;solely&#148; in
the Government&#146;s amendment. Would she consider changing
that?</div><a name="07042462000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000342"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b><b class="B"> </b>That is an interesting point. I suspect
that, because of the way in which the reference to dependence on
alcohol or drugs is phrased, we will have been advised that the use of
the world &#147;solely&#148; is not necessary. However, I take on
board what my hon. Friend has said and I will look into whether it
would clarify the point that we are trying to get across, which is, as
he has said, that treatment should not be forced on people for
dependence alone. I take on board the point that I think he is making
about the way in which the Bill reads, and I shall come back to him
about that. </div><a name="07042462000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, we remain convinced that the exclusion for sexual deviancy should
go. Paedophilia and various other paraphilias can constitute mental
disorders and there may well be treatment that can be offered. If a
person with such a condition meets the criteria for detention under the
Act because of the risk to themselves or to others, we believe that it
is important that the Act is available. The fact that a mental disorder
that can be treated happens to be related to sexual deviancy, or
whatever one wants to call it, does not render it somehow not a real
mental disorder.</div>

Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): As the Minister will know, I

to committing sexual acts in the sameway as to alcohol or
other substances? If so, and if somebody&#146;s dependence is of that
nature, what is the criterion for their inclusion when the alcohol or
drugs addiction is
excluded?</div><a name="07042462000038"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000344"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am not clear whether sex addiction is a
mental disorder. I suspect that it probably is. <i class="I">[Interruption.]
</i>I can see that we are getting into deep water. However, to return
to the point about sexual deviancy, the problem has been that although
various things, such as homosexuality, are not considered a
mental disorder, nevertheless things such as
paedophilia and paraphilia are considered a mental disorder. The danger
is that it has previously been possible for a paedophile to argue, for
example, that they were excluded from the Mental Health Act, as some
might prefer a prison sentence to a hospital order. We wish to get rid
of that in order to prevent such problems from
arising.</div><a name="07042462000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000345"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): It is a
pleasure to serve under you, Lady
Winterton.</div><a name="07042462000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
consideration did the Minister give to excluding paedophilia and any
other acts that would be encompassed, instead of entirely removing
proposed paragraph (b) to section 1(3) to the 1983 Act? Alternatively,
instead of considering sexual identity and orientation, homosexuality
could be specifically mentioned so that it was
exempt.</div><a name="07042462000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000346"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I will come to that point. The Lords amendment
does not restore sexual deviancy. I was trying to explain the
background to our changing the exclusions. I was explaining why,
because of the issues that I have just mentioned, we decided to exclude
sexual deviancy. The amendment does not reintroduce it. There are
different reasons why we believe that that is necessary. That is the
background to the previous exclusions. I shall now deal with why we
disagree with the exclusions that we are currently
discussing.</div><a name="07042462000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
the other place introduced a new set of exclusions into the Bill. As
hon. Members can
see,</div><a name="07042462000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sexual identity or
orientation...commission, or likely commission, of illegal or

religious or political
beliefs&#148;</div><a name="07042462000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">would be
excluded. However, those exclusions have never been included and, as
far as we can see, theyhave never been needed. Although I use
the word &#147;exclusions&#148;, I am probably using it
incorrectly, because the things that are listed are nothing of the
sort. They are about conditions, behaviours and beliefs, but none of
them are mental
disorders.</div><a name="07042462000045"></a>

Boswell:</b> On a more substantive point thanmy
earlier one, does the Minister appreciate that the background to this
matter inevitably concerns not necessarily the practice in the United
Kingdom, the good faith of Ministers or the system, but the fact that
in certain countries there are chilling experiences of persons being
singled out for mental treatment because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>their face does not fit? That may be because oftheir sexual
identity or because they happen to hold political beliefs, which we
might all find thoroughly objectionable, or they may be regarded as
morally disreputable, but none of those things constitutes a mental
illness on its own. Some other evidence would be
required for compulsory treatment to be appropriate. If that evidence
were available, these tests could reasonably be set
aside.</div><a name="07042462000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000348"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I hope that as I go through the arguments I
might be able to address some of those points. I understand what the
hon. Gentleman is saying. If we want to guard against something
happening in future, where clinicians suddenly wanted to lock people up
because of their political beliefs, for example, we can say that that
is an issue. However, being realistic, we have to say what such
exclusions are meant to do. They are meant to be exclusions from
provisions dealing with mental disorder, but as I said, the items are
not considered mental disorders in the first place. As I said, the
exclusions are
unnecessary.</div><a name="07042462000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
somebody felt that they had been detained and given compulsory
treatment because of their political beliefs, they would first have to
get two doctors to sign up to the fact that they had a mental disorder.
They would then be able to appeal to the mental health review tribunal
and say, &#147;I have been detained because these two doctors think
that my belief in x, y or z is a mental disorder, but in my view it is
not.&#148; Even in the first appeal process that a patient would go
through, we have built in safeguards in order to give a
personthe ability to appeal if the basic criteria on which
compulsion works have not been fulfilled. Somebody can say, &#147;I
do not have a mental disorder; therefore it is extraordinary that I
have been detained simply because of my particular political or
religious belief&#148;. On the other side, having said why our
safeguards make such exclusion unnecessary, there is immense potential
to create confusion about the operation of the legislation and
therefore to prevent people from getting the treatment that they need.
It is not an enormous risk, yet it is there; we cannot avoid talking
about that possibility.</div>
<a name="07042462000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also important to
recognise that we particularly need to look at whether the amendments
that have come from the other place contribute anything in making the
Bill more effective in usage for clinicians. I understand that the
Royal College of Psychiatrists has argued that it will make
psychiatrists think twice. Well, I would have hoped that they were
thinking twice in the beginning and that the approach was not,
&#147;Well, let&#146;s really think this through&#148; after the
event. We have always said that psychiatrists should examine whether
they are judging somebody else from their particular cultural stance;
they should make sure that they understand them. If they do not agree
with someone, it does not mean that that person is mentally disordered.
That should be part of best clinical practice. We should not be using
legislation to say to people that they must think about
someone&#146;s cultural beliefs, when that should be part of how they
work.</div>
<a name="07042462000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000349"></a><b class="B">Dr.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div><a name="07042462000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the Minister not agree that
all the things listed by the hon. Member for Daventry are examples of
abuse of psychiatry and mental health legislation? I understand exactly
why the hon. Gentleman is making these points, but if such things
happened in this country, we should have sufficiently well regulated
medical and psychiatric professions to ensure that they stop. I agree
with the Minister that it is much better not to have all these things
outlined individually; for a start, we do not want to put ideas into
people&#146;s heads.</div>
<a name="07042462000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000350"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I agree absolutely with my hon. Friend; to go
down such a line would almost be dangerous for us, because we would be
taking away the expectation that the clinician should be making a
proper judgment. The idea that this is somehow an excellent thing,
because it would make them think twice, is deeply
worrying.</div>
<a name="07042462000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000351"></a>Ann

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000352"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> As my hon. Friend says, I am sure that it is
quite offensive to a number of rather good
psychiatrists.</div>
<a name="07042462000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000353"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> On that point, while I understand the purity of
the Minister&#146;s argument, can she explain something that is
puzzling me? Why is it necessary to effectively ring-fence substance
and alcohol abuse? If she really wants to stand by her conviction, why
does she not simply strike out all exclusions and leave the matter to
the clinical judgment of
practitioners?</div>
<a name="07042462000299"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="07042462000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000354"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Again, that goes back to the long-standing
agreement that we must be careful in saying that we could detain
somebody solely on the grounds of their addiction to drugs and alcohol.
It has been said that someone who is an alcoholic has a mental
disorder. However, there has been a desire not to want to detain
someone who, for example, might get drunk on a Friday night and as a
result becomes violent. We have said that there would have to be an
underlying or resulting mental disorder for that person to be
detained.</div><a name="07042462000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
treatment of the person simply for their alcohol problem should
probably be the responsibility of the addiction services. However, if
we want to treat someone who has an alcohol problem and underlying
severe clinical depression that makes them detainable, that is why have
said that, in those circumstances, alcohol and drug dependency are
mental disorders. The other conditions are not mental disorders, which
is why we must have the exclusion provision for drugs and alcohol
unless we decide to detain people for drug and alcohol addiction alone,
which is something that Parliament has never said that it would
do.</div><a name="07042462000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000355"></a>Chris
Bryant:</b> The Minister has referred almost
exclusively to alcohol dependants. Clearly, no
psychiatrist in Britain will want to detain someone for getting drunk
on a Friday night. It would be a very big job detaining everyone who
did that. The Lords amendment referred to substance misuse, including
dependence, whereasthe Government amendment refers only to
dependence, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>not misuse. If they want to stick with that idea, wouldit not
be more sensible to refer to misuse
anddependence?</div><a name="07042462000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000356"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Until fairly recently, it was not clear to us
what was meant by misuse. I now understand that the Royal College of
Psychiatrists has clarified the meaning. Apparently, the idea is to
cover what might be called binge drinking. I referred to someone who
drinks every day, but on a Friday night may become very drunk and
violent. At the same time, certain people might get very, very drunk
and, for a few days, hallucinate and become delusional because of the
extent of their drunkenness. That might be an appropriate point at
which to detain them because they had become so severely delusional
that the Act would be necessary for a limited time. That is why we have
not covered that situation by &#147;substance misuse&#148;, but as
dependency.</div><a name="07042462000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000357"></a><b class="B">Hywel
Williams</b> (Caernarfon) (PC): It is a pleasure to see you in
the Chair, Lady
Winterton.</div><a name="07042462000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister suggested earlier that it would be patronising to the
practitioners to draw their attention to certain things. I draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that, in other aspects of law,
such as child-care law, it seems to be entirely appropriate to draw
practitioners&#146; attention to the need for them to give due regard
to children&#146;s background, ethnicity, language, culture and a
whole long list of matters before taking children into care. Should we
be arguing against such provisions in that other context? Would the
Minister apply the principle
across?</div><a name="07042462000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000358"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am not sure that I caught everything that the
hon. Gentleman said. I think it important for clinicians to operate in
a non-judgmental way, while looking at people&#146;s background or
culture. The viewpoint should be that people do not have a mental
disorder just because their ideas might not seem absolutely
normal&#151;to use a phrase. Our reason for thinking that such people
should not be in the clause is because everything listed there, apart
from dependence on drugs or alcohol, is not a mental disorder.
Theyare being excluded from &#147;mental disorder&#148;
for the purposes of the
Act.</div><a name="07042462000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000359"></a>Ann
Coffey:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Lady Winterton.</div> <a name="07042462000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
my hon. Friend agree that there is a world of difference in talking
about what constitutes a mental disorder in terms of substance misuse
or dependency&#151;because of the inter-relationship between alcohol
and drugs and mental disorder&#151;and in terms of putting in
exclusions such as cultural, religious and political beliefs that have
nothing to do with mental disorder but with a state of society that
might or might not come about with the overthrow of the democratic
Government? If that happened, having that in would not help any of us,
because we would all be in
jail.</div><a name="07042462000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000360"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am glad that my hon. Friend makes that point.
I was wondering about hiding behind the Bill in the circumstances where
everyone was being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>locked up for their cultural, religious or other beliefs. Holding up the
Mental Health Bill would not necessarily
help.</div><a name="07042462000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000361"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> There are many points on which I would be
grateful for greater definition between what the Minister regards as
misuse and what she regards as dependence. For example, what about the
person who goes out and gets drunk on a Friday night and then becomes
violent? What about the chap who gets severely drunk every Friday
night? Is the latter to be hauled off to a mental hospital or will he
be recommended to Alcoholics Anonymous and given hospital health
treatment or
whatever?</div><a name="07042462000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000362"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> We have been very clear about the legislation
continuing to operate as it does as the moment. We will have the status
quo when the new legislation comes in with respect to drug and alcohol
dependencies. There will be no difference in how the legislation
operates now. If somebody has drug and alcohol dependency, that is not
the only thing that they can be detained for. I want to come on to a
couple of other points, but I can go over the issue of misuse if the
hon. Gentleman did not pick it up the first
time.</div><a name="07042462000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Royal
College of Psychiatrists, which suggested an amendment, has said that
that interpretation of misuse is needed to stop binge drinking or the
casual consumption of illicit drugs being the basis of compulsion. As I
said, there is no such exclusion at the moment; it is simply in respect
of dependency. That is about a one-off misuse of alcohol or drugs. It
is true that, at the moment, we do not have wards full of binge
drinkers or casual drug misusers. That is anticipating something that
does not happen at the moment. There is nothing in the Bill that would
change the current position, but it is important to ensure that in
certain cases there is scope for dealing with people who might have
become extremely delusional for a time, and the Bill allows for
that.</div><a name="07042462000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000363"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I am confused. The reason for the
exemptions is that there is now a much broader definition in some
respects.</div><a name="07042462000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000364"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> No there is
not.</div><a name="07042462000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000365"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> We can argue that point, but we have finished
clause 1 and I do not want to revisit it. If mental illness is
considered as a condition under ICD10, the definition covers acute
intoxication, harmful use of a substance, dependent syndrome and
withdrawal state, which is a whole range. It is difficult to try to
comprehend the precise circumstances under which alcohol and drug
misuse would be completely ignored, and those under which it could just
be convenient to use the new legislation to lock somebody up because
they were extremely drunk. There is potential for abuse in
interpretation of the
rule.</div><a name="07042462000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000366"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I reiterate that, if there is an intention to
exclude binge drinkers, one would assume that lots of people are
already the subject of detention because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>of binge drinking or drug misuse on a one-off basis. That is not the
case, so it is difficult to understand why there needs to be a new
provision, rather than retention of the existing practice that covers
dependence on drugs or alcohol.</div>
<a name="07042462000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want also to make some points
on the exclusions themselves. We agree that sexual orientation is not a
mental disorder, and nor is sexual identity, if it is assumed to mean a
person&#146;s own identification of their sexual orientation.
Breaking the law and acting in a disorderly manner are not of
themselves a mental disorder, nor are political, cultural or religious
beliefs, however curious or unpalatable they might be to some
people.</div><a name="07042462000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000367"></a><b class="B">Mr.

that the Lords inserted the exclusion on cultural, political or
religious beliefs, not to help guard against overbearing clinicians,
but perhaps to protect against overbearing Governments that might lean
on clinicians. Before the Minister dismisses my concerns, let me say
that I do not think that anybody in the room thought three years ago

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000369"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman wants to
guard against a future Government that might put pressure on clinicians
who are already working hard and well with the Mental Health Act.
However, is it really the case that, having been leant on by the
Government, those clinicians might become completely different people
and detain people who make comments that are not in line with
Government policy? I must say&#151;to return to the point made by my
hon. Friend the Member for Stockport&#151;that it is unlikely that
waving the Mental Health Act around will stop a draconian
Government.</div>
<a name="07042462000300"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="07042462000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
including something that is not a mental disorder in a list of
exclusions of mental disorders is not only unnecessary but,
particularly in matters such as sexual orientation, gives the
impression that we do think that it is a mental disorder and therefore
must be excluded. It is stigmatising in that
respect.</div>
<a name="07042462000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000370"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> The Minister will be aware thatthe
scrutiny Committee recommended exclusions because the definition of a
mental disorder was being broadened. In respect of cultural, religious
or political beliefs, it is not a matter of somebody saying something
and being locked up by a draconian Government butof how those
beliefs might manifest themselves in behaviour. It is the movement from
a clinical diagnosis to a behaviour that will now determine a mental
disorder under the new definition.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div><a name="07042462000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000371"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> As I tried to make clear this morning, we have
not broadened the definition of a mental disorder. We do not expect
that many more people will be included. I gave two specific examples of
people whom I believed were currently not included&#151;those with
acquired brain injury in adulthood and those with some form of
personality disorder. It is a tiny number of people. We are not trying
to expand the number of people who could be brought under the Act. I
know that it is a popular argument that the two go together, but both
are wrong. We are not broadening the definition immensely, and we do
not want to include exclusions for conditions that are not mental
disorders in the first
place.</div><a name="07042462000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000372"></a>Chris
Bryant:</b> I am terribly sorry for not saying thank you, Lady
Winterton. It is a great delight to serve under your chairmanship. Now
that I have rectified that, will the Minister respond to the point made
differently by the hon. Member for Daventry, who is probably one of the
nicest Members of the House? He said that one of the difficulties is
that some people, because their faces do not fit, end up in the mental
health system when they might not otherwise have done. The exclusion
worded in terms of cultural beliefs might, in the view of some, fit the
need to rectify the situation whereby many black African and Caribbean
people are detained who probably would not be if they were not
culturally different from
others.</div><a name="07042462000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000373"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> That is an important point. As my hon. Friend
may know, we have a whole programme of work to deal with some of the
issues involved in black and ethnic minority detention, of which there
is a disproportionate amount. Some evidence suggests that that is not
necessarily because psychiatrists do not agree with an
individual&#146;s beliefs but because, very often, that individual
has late access to services in the first place. It is also sometimes
due to the route by which people come in&#151;through the police
system rather than through accessing services earlier.</div>
<a name="07042462000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have a series of
pilots to examine the reasons. The way to deal with that issue is to
take a good look at the clinical practice and how we can reach out more
quickly to people at an earlier stage so that they do not feel
frightened of coming forward for services, and to try to do that
through the Bill. My hon. Friend may know that we have included in the
code of practice principles on non-discrimination that must be
considered. There are ways in which we can show that.
</div><a name="07042462000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes back to my
earlier point about some of the good work on how to have values-based
practice. My Department has worked closely with
psychiatriststo put together training works and written
communications about how to ensure that practice is not based on
judging someone else because of their cultural values.</div>
<a name="07042462000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have tried to
answer the point made by the hon. Member for Daventry. First, it is
important to remember that a series of conditions have to be fulfilled
before detention can take place. Secondly, as those conditions
obviously include risk to self or others, any case involves a
risk-based assessment of whether somebody should be detained because of
the riskthat they pose to themselves or to others.
Underthe Government&#146;s proposals, appropriate medical
treatment has to be available.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="07042462000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon. Gentleman was asking
what the medical treatment would be for a cultural disagreement, such
matters would be noticed fairly quickly. As I have said, two doctors
have to agree to someone being detained and such an individual can
appeal to the mental health review tribunal and say that they have been
wrongly detained and do not have a mental disorder but rather a
different point of view. That is why we need safeguards that are clear
to everybody, so that there is a clear path down which people can
go.</div>
<a name="07042462000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000374"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> Will the Minister clarify what radical treatment
is available for acute alcohol intoxication, which appears to be
covered under ICD10 and therefore could be used for detention under the
Act?</div><a name="07042462000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000375"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Treatments are available. I am not a clinician,
as the Committee might have recognised, and I would not like to start a
precedent of giving diagnoses and prescriptions for treatment during
the course of the Bill. That would be quite the wrong path to go down.
Treatments are available and it is important, before we move on to that
point, that we reiterate that it is important that we have safeguards.
The hon. Lady asks what appropriate medical treatment is available.
Under the Government&#146;s proposals, for the first time, there is a
legal basis for considering the appropriate treatment. As it is one of
the conditions, the tribunal is given the ability to ask in many more
cases whether the treatment is appropriate for the
individual.</div> <a name="07042462000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arguments that have been made about social control are, in a sense, the
gist of the fears. Can the Bill be used for social control? I do not
believe, for all the reasons that we have discussed, that the
exclusions are necessary in that sense. I re-emphasise that nothing in
the Bill, with or without the extra exclusions, would permit action on
any basis except genuine mental disorder. That is what we need to come
back to every time. The important point is the clarification of mental
disorder and the necessity for things not to get in the way of people
receiving treatment, and I shall return to why I think the exclusions
do
that.</div>
<a name="07042462000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000376"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): The Minister is genuinely
trying to shed light on quite a difficult issue, but she is slightly
oversimplifying matters. She just said that no psychiatrist would take
a case to a tribunal or anything else and say, &#147;I&#146;m
sectioning this person because of their cultural differences.&#148;
However, a psychiatrist might regard a person&#146;s cultural
beliefs&#151;or, for that matter, their individual beliefs&#151;as
indicative of a delusion. That is what the precautions try to forfend
and
prevent.</div><a name="07042462000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000377"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am afraid that I just do not agree. The
exclusions are currently not in place, yet I do not have an enormous
amount of evidence that thousands of people are being detained because
of their cultural beliefs. I take up the point that my hon. Friend the
Member for Rhondda made about our needing to ensure values-based
practice that is non-judgmental on the part of the clinician. In a
sense, however, that is the process of ensuring that the diagnosis is
correct.</div><a name="07042462000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point that I particularly want to raise is that there is always a
concern in such cases that a series 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>of such exclusions could not only cause confusion for clinicians, but
create what we might call a lawyer&#146;s field day. If somebody had
the ability constantly to mount challenges on the grounds that they had
been detained for their beliefs, as opposed to the simple mental
disorder test, that would completely open up the Bill to people
challenging it. That could well happen in some very difficult cases.
Let us remember that in such cases we are naturally dealing with people
who do not want treatment, because that is the reason for the
detention. The more exclusions we include that are not about mental
disorder, but which muddy the issue, the more likely it is that time in
tribunals&#151;this relates to the point that the hon. Member for
Tiverton and Honiton properly raised earlier&#151;will be taken up
with trying to untangle what has been advised in order to get in the
way of getting treatment to people.</div>
<a name="07042462000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000378"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Very simply, would not the Minister therefore
agree that the right antidote to any claim that the person is being
persecuted because of their beliefs would be to adduce correct medical
evidence to the effect that their disorder is a mental one, which is
presumably the process that the clinician will have undertaken in the
first place? The clinician would then have the opportunity of
expressing that view and overturning the patient&#146;s no doubt
genuinely felt belief to the contrary.</div>
<a name="07042462000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000379"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> It is absolutely right to say that that is the
process that the clinician should go through, and that is what the
mental health tribunal has to look at. However, there are cases,
sometimes in offender situations, in which people receive quite strong
legal advice on how not to be in the situation that they are in,
particularly if there is a hospital disposal. It is sometimes in the
individual&#146;s interest not to prefer to be in a prison setting,
as opposed to a hospital setting, because of some of the implications
of that. If we simply allow legislation to pass that gives even more
opportunities for such challenges, when the basis of such decisions
should be whether someone has a mental disorder, we have to acknowledge
that there will be a lawyers&#146; field
day.</div><a name="07042462000301"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="07042462000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000380"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> On the measure relating to cultural, religious and
political beliefs, a paper from the British Psychological Society
said:</div><a name="07042462000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
amendment would only serve to exclude people whose mental disorders
were solely expressed in terms of the issues listed. It would not mean
that people engaging in these behaviours or having such beliefs were
immune from compulsion, should they otherwise meet the relevant
criteria.&#148;</div><a name="07042462000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the
proposal relates purely to whether somebody&#146;s so-called mental
illness manifests itself in a political expression. If so, action could
not be taken against them, but if they were doing other things and were
a danger to others because of their actions, other parts of the law
would naturally allow them to be dealt
with.</div><a name="07042462000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000381"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> But that is exactly the point that I am making.
The test in all this is whether there is a mental disorder. The more
that that is complicated by other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>exclusions, the greater the likelihood that it will become confusing for
clinicians, who make such judgments all the time, apparently without
locking up lots of people for their religious or cultural beliefs. That
is the initial premise; never mind this future Government who are going
to force them to lock everybody up when somehow everything will change
and people will start down the road of saying, &#147;It&#146;s
about your cultural beliefs.&#148;</div>
<a name="07042462000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate that there will be
two doctors. We are talking about the mental health review tribunal and
about ensuring good clinical practice. I return to the point: the more
exclusions there are, the more potential there is for confusion and for
challenges by lawyers who may well wish, for whatever reason, when they
give legal advice in offender cases, to say, &#147;We are going to
challenge this on all the opportunities in front of us.&#148; That is
not what we should be doing in modernising and reforming this
legislation.</div><a name="07042462000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000382"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way,
because I am desperately trying to follow her argument. May I bring her
back to a point that she made about the people who we are considering
may be those most resistant to complying with the legislation? Does she
acknowledge that a large proportion of the people who are subject to
sectioning enter the mental health services on a voluntary basis? Such
people might be deterred from seeking treatment if they think that they
might be pursued because of some cultural or religious belief that they
hold, particularly if they are a member of a black and minority ethnic
community. They might therefore be deterred from seeking any assistance
from mental health services in the first
place.</div><a name="07042462000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000383"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am afraid that I do not follow that argument
at all. The hon. Gentleman is saying that without the exclusions,
people are going to be deterred. I venture to suggest that not
everybody in such a situation will be examining the Mental Health Act.
We are talking about people who are at a vulnerable time in their lives
and are seriously ill. We are talking about the attention that should
be given when people do not want to take voluntary treatment or when
they agree to voluntary treatment but there is a worry that they will
not comply with it, which is when sectioning is sometimes
used.</div><a name="07042462000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000384"></a>Dr.
Naysmith:</b> Quite a lot of reference was made this morning
to the scrutiny that we gave the previous Bill&#151;the one that was
replaced by the amendment. One of the things that the Sainsbury centre
for mental health argued strongly was that exclusions for alcohol or
drug abuse could be included and supported, because the deterrence
argument would be strong for people who did not have a mental health
problem but did have an alcohol or drugs problem. None of that would
apply to any of the things that have been
discussed.</div>
<a name="07042462000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000385"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend, so I shall be
urging the Committee to support the Government amendment. The amendment
that has come from the other place is unnecessary and potentially
confusing. It has the potential to deny treatment to people who need it
and we might end up in the hands of a long, difficult 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>arguments over the legal aspects. Such a situation will not be good for
patients, because vulnerable people will not get the treatment that
they need.</div>
<a name="07042462000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000386"></a>Hywel
Williams:</b> Does the Minister accept that some people in
society have, in their terms, a well-founded belief that they might be
persecuted because of their religious beliefs or their cultural
background? Would not having an exclusion on that point reassure such
people that should they be sectioned, it would not be done on those
particular grounds? I make a reassurance
argument.</div>
<a name="07042462000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000387"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Again, somebody might have a fear of
persecution because of their religious belief. Where that is
accompanied by a mental disorder and that fear&#151;what they think
is happening to them&#151;is the result of it, the challenge in the
first place for our mental health services should be to try to help
that person with their condition. That should be our approach where, as
the hon. Gentleman is saying, as a result of a mental disorder such
people have a fear of religious
persecution.</div><a name="07042462000104"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000388"></a>Ann
Coffey:</b><b class="B"> </b>Surely, the way of reassuring people from
ethnic communities who might feel that their way of thinking about
things is different from that of the wider community is to ensure that
when they come into contact with mental health services they feel that
professionals understand the differences of their cultural beliefs. The
only way to reassure such people is to improve the standards of service
that we offer; we cannot do it by introducing an exclusion that will
not reassure them. This exclusion will send out the message that
psychiatrists will section such people because they have culturally
different beliefs. That is way of driving such people from the service,
rather than helping them within
it.</div><a name="07042462000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000389"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I agree that, in a sense, this matter draws
attention to something and creates fear whereas we are striving to have
the best clinical practice that says that people need to be understood
in terms of their cultural beliefs. This debate has been ongoing. I do
not believe that people are not trying to improve the situation,
because a lot of good work is being done to say, &#147;Let us be
clear that we are not judging people on the individual
psychiatrist&#146;s belief; we are trying to understand others at the
same time.&#148; It is important that the debate takes place, but it
would be wrong-headed to think that we can somehow pat ourselves on the
back because we put something in a bit of legislation that confuses
things and does nothing to sort the situation. We are talking about
service provision. For all the reasons that I have outlined, there is
no way that this measure does not get in the way of getting treatment
to people, so I ask the Committee to support our
amendment.</div>
<a name="07042462000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000390"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b><b class="B"> </b>I welcome you to the Chair, Lady
Winterton, and in doing so issue a blanket welcome from the entire

oleaginousness.</div><a name="07042462000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000392"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b><b class="B"> </b>Which was started by the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="07042462000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
desperately tried to follow the debate for the past hour, and I have to
say&#151;I hope that I am not alone in this&#151;that I feel more
confused by the Minister&#146;s explanation of what she is trying to
do at the end of it than I did when we started. She constantly goes on
about some terrible future Government wanting to lock everybody up.
However, we are more concerned about this Government, whose legislation
could end up with more people being locked up, and we are not the only
ones who are concerned. Many hundreds and thousands of mental illness
sufferers are also concerned. That is why there has been such a strong
and concerted lobby over so many years in defence of their liberties,
which are being undermined by the Minister&#146;s
proposals.</div> <a name="07042462000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government and the Minister seem to be in denial about what the
definitions that we have discussed do. Clause 1 and schedule 1 extend
the definitions of mental disorder. In clause 1, several definitions
that are in the old Act are scrapped in favour of a much wider mental
disorder definition. The explanatory notes to schedule 1 explicitly say
that the effect of
this</div><a name="07042462000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is to widen the
application of the provisions in question to all mental disorders, not
just those which fall within one of the four categories (or the
particular category or categories to which the provision applies).
Practical examples of disorders which would now be covered by those
provisions are forms of personality
disorder&#148;,</div><a name="07042462000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so on. In
my book, in most people&#146;s books and certainly in the book of the
Richardson expert committee and most of the people who have been
scrutinising the Bill closely, that amounts to an extension of the
definitions of mental disorder, which de facto means that potentially
more people can be scooped up in that net. That is the basis on which
we
start.</div><a name="07042462000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000393"></a>Ann
Coffey:</b><b class="B"> </b>We have just had a debate about mental
disorder, and the hon. Gentleman appeared to support the new definition
that brings all those things under mental disorder. Is he now saying
that he is concerned about it. If he is concerned about it, why is he
supporting it? He was perfectly at liberty to propose an amendment to
clause 1 to narrow the definition if he felt that it was too
wide.</div>
<a name="07042462000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000394"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b><b class="B"> </b>Very simply, as the hon. Lady will know,
we are supportive of the changing of the definitions of mental disorder
if that is balanced bythe exemptions. That was exactly the
line taken by the Genevra Richardson committee, which concluded
that</div><a name="07042462000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a broad definition
of mental disorder in the draft Bill must be accompanied by explicit
and specific exclusions which safeguard against the legislation being
used inappropriately as a means of social
control.&#148;</div><a name="07042462000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
quid pro quo that the Lords put into the Bill, which has been supported
by the Opposition, the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, the
Richardson expert committee and most other sensible-minded people.
There is no changing of positions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div><a name="07042462000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="07042462000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000395"></a>Ann
Coffey:</b> In that case, if the exclusions that the hon.
Gentleman wants are not included in the Bill, will he still support the
new definition of mental disorder, or will he withdraw his
support?</div><a name="07042462000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000396"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> We will then have a serious problem, but the
hon. Lady should remember that it is for her Government to overturn
amendments to the Bill, while Opposition Members are seeking to defend
what we believe are the improvements and extra safeguards that the
House of Lords has put in. We are therefore in no position to amend
something that has not yet been amended. That would be pre-empting what
the Government are trying to do. I hope that the hon. Lady and her
colleagues will not be duped into following the Minister, who seeks to
get the Committee to do so. That would weaken the Bill, reduce the
safeguards and not be in the interests of people suffering from mental
illness. At the end of the day, we will see how many Labour Members
follow the Minister in defiance of80 members of the Mental
Health Alliance and cross-party support for these amendments at all
stages in the House of Lords.</div>
<a name="07042462000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister&#146;s response
to some potential anomalies, which were first pointed out by the hon.
Member for Rhondda, was also worrying. It is quite important that the
reference to &#147;solely&#148; that was in clause 3, as amended,
has now been dropped. That is an important consideration for how we
regard dual diagnosis, yetthe Minister responded that she
&#147;envisaged&#148; that the reason why it had been changed was
whatever had then been proposed. Well, this is her amendment; it is in
her name. I would have hoped that she was better informed than to be in
a position merely to envisage why Government amendments to a Bill had
been tabled, whoever has actually written them for her. She must
support such amendments and account to the Committee for why they are
being put into the Bill now, seeking fundamentally to overturn what the
Lords have done in another place.</div>
<a name="07042462000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I also correct the Minister
on some other factual matters? The Lords amendments on sexual identity
are in accordance with the Joint Committee on Human Rights report on
transsexualism and gender dysphoria. She was also mistaken in saying
that homosexuality is not included in the ICD10; it still is, whatever
we may think of that, albeit that it says that it is not a mental
disorder. She specifically said, as the record will show, that
homosexuality is not included in the ICD10, which is wrong. Also,
paedophilia is not excluded by the Lords amendments; it is not included
in ICD10 under sexual identity or sexual orientation. So we have
problems with some statements that she has made. These are important
issues that go to the heart of this Bill, and one of the big six areas
that the Lords added to it, with cross-party support and by a large
margin. We are seeking to support their amendments
today.</div>
<a name="07042462000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000397"></a>Chris
Bryant:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman really saying that
paedophilia is not included in ICD10? It clearly is, as one of the
paraphilias.</div>
<a name="07042462000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000398"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> If the hon. Gentleman refers to the debate in
the Lords, he will see the comments from Baroness Murphy on how
paedophilia will be treated by this Bill. I suggest that he looks
there.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="07042462000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000399"></a>Chris
Bryant:</b> Just to help the hon. Gentleman, it is item F65.4,
and it is a disorder of sexual preferences. That is pretty
straightforward; he can apologise to the Committee if he
wants.</div>
<a name="07042462000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000400"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Well, like the Minister, I am happy to come back
to the hon. Gentleman on that point. My point is that paedophilia is
not included under sexual identity or orientation in ICD10. Does he
agree with that?</div>
<a name="07042462000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000401"></a>Chris
Bryant:</b> The hon. Gentleman said that it is not in ICD10,
but it is counted as a paraphilia there. That is pretty
straightforward.</div>
<a name="07042462000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000402"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am sorry if I am being misinterpreted. To read
again the words that I used, it is not included in ICD10 under sexual
identity or sexual orientation. I believe that that point is true; does
the hon. Gentleman want to challenge it? If he does not, we can take
that as read.</div>
<a name="07042462000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000403"></a>Chris
Bryant:</b> I think that it might be best if we were to
reconcile this matter afterwards with an exchange of letters, but
clearly that is not precisely what the hon. Gentleman said
earlier.</div>
<a name="07042462000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000404"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I hope that it is clear, now that I have re-read
my words, that that is what I said. I am not entirely sure why the hon.
Gentleman wants to make such an issue of it. He did not seek to take
the Minister up on what I believe was a factually incorrect statement
in her address, so I do not know why he is taking it up now. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton has said, there is a move in
the Bill from an emphasis on clinical diagnosis to an emphasis on
behaviour, and that is why it is so important to have the relevant
definitions.</div> <a name="07042462000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was a
member of the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee and I want to refer to
something that the Committee said to reinforce the point about why a
balance is needed between a wider definition and the exemptions. The
Committee
said:</div><a name="07042462000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although
we conclude that the Government should retain the definition of mental
disorder contained in the current draft Bill, we believe that the scope
should be narrowed by means of specific exemptions and by the
conditions for the use of compulsory
powers.&#148;</div><a name="07042462000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wholeheartedly
concur with that, and that is what the Richardson committee said as
well.</div> <a name="07042462000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has referred to exclusions as arbitrary obstacles to the use of
compulsion, which will cause uncertainty, yet she has conceded the
necessity of including references to drug and alcohol misuse. She has
conceded the principle, but not the
scope.</div><a name="07042462000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000405"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The whole point about drug and alcohol
dependency is that they are mental disorders. That is the issue, and
that is why they should be included.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000406"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The Minister was unable to gauge the difference
between misuse and dependence, and she said that only recently had the
Government been made aware of problems with the definitions of
misuse 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>and dependence. I agree&#151;we considered this in the pre-legislative
scrutiny Committee, and somebody referred to the Sainsbury
report&#151;that there might be a disincentive for people to seek
treatment, but similar considerations could apply to the other
exemptions that the Lords have added on sexual identity and on
cultural, religious or political beliefs, so I struggle to understand
the consistency in her
approach.</div><a name="07042462000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Alderdice made what I thought was a very important contribution to the

the subject of the everyday rubber fetishist. They have some
interesting debates in the House of Lords. The Bishop of Coventry
mentioned the Syrian monk, Dionysius the pseudo-Areopagite, and
referred to the Church of England submission that expresses concerns
about the Bill being used as a means of social control.</div>
<a name="07042462000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government appear to revel
in their condition of splendid isolation. For instance, the Mental

a series of legal challenges&#151;pertaining to either the Scottish
or New Zealand
legislation?</div><a name="07042462000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000408"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Those countries seem to be getting on with their
new legislation rather well. It is early daysfor Scotland, but
there are some good signs fromthe Scottish legislation. The
pre-legislative scrutiny Committee modelled many of its recommendations
on what had already been achieved in
Scotland.</div><a name="07042462000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
exclusions, perhaps I could also quote the evidence given to the Joint
Committee by Dr. Zigmond, from the Royal College of
Psychiatrists:</div><a name="07042462000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;People
who make life-style choices either to behave in a criminal manner, or
to drink to excess, or to gamble, or to become addicted to cigarettes
should not normally be forced to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>stop those by a health service. If a government
feels that those behaviours are inappropriate, then they should
legislate in relation to those behaviours, but they are not part of
what is generally understood as people who are
ill.&#148;</div><a name="07042462000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is right. Yet
those people could potentially be caught within the remit of this
extended mental disorder provision without the specific
exemptions.</div><a name="07042462000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if
that were not so and there was not going to be a field day for the
lawyers, as the Minister seems to claim&#151;it is usually those on
the Opposition Benches who subject the Government to the claim that
their muddled legislation will lead to a field day for
lawyers&#151;the perception among vulnerable people of what could
happen to them if they submit and present to the mental health system
would be that they will be forced quickly down a coercive route, simply
because they have other issues that are not, strictly speaking, mental
illness. That perception is deeply
damaging.</div><a name="07042462000144"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000409"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Can the hon. Gentleman give me an example of
how somebody who smokes a lot of cigarettes will be captured under the
Bill because of the changes that we have
made?</div><a name="07042462000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000410"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> We debated that issue the other day. Somebody
with a severe lung condition who smokes a lot of cigarettes could be
construed as wanting to hasten their own death. That could be construed
as some form of mental disorder. However, I would concur that that is
an extreme
example.</div><a name="07042462000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000411"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> On the exclusions relating to religion, some
religious sects or organisations&#151;for example, a Christian one
called Opus Dei and certain Islamic faiths&#151;believe in
self-flagellation as a way of atoning for sins and for penance. Would
they potentially be caught by this legislation if the religious
exemption put in by the Lords were
removed?</div><a name="07042462000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000412"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> That is another interesting line of thought:
self-harm for religious aims. However, potentially, because of the
wider definitions that now apply those people could be caught in the
net of sectioning. Whether Government Members like it or not, that is
the implication of the proposed legislation. More worryingly, that
implication is perceived by people who have what we might describe as
slightly odd religious, cultural or political beliefs, who may be
deterred from approaching mental health services for help because they
fear that they may be caught inthis
net.</div><a name="07042462000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000413"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am also interested in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s example of the person who smokes a lot of cigarettes
potentially being detained because of the changes that we are proposing
to the 1983 Act. Which of the exclusions that the hon. Gentleman wants
to see would prevent such a person from being
detained?</div><a name="07042462000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000414"></a>Tim

Madeleine Moon</b> (Bridgend) (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman
accept that the climate of fear and anxiety that exists has been
generated solely by the Opposition? There is absolutely no suggestion
in the Bill that a climate will be created and set for a future agenda
in which people who do not have severe mental health problems will be
locked away. An insult against the Government is implicit in all of the
discussion that has taken place this afternoon, but an insult more
especially&#151;I find this most fearful as a previous representative
of it&#151;against the mental health profession of this
country.</div><a name="07042462000303"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000416"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. An intervention should be relatively
brief and a question should be posed. I hope that the hon. Lady is
about to reach
it.</div><a name="07042462000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000417"></a>Mrs.

too long holding myself in. I should have intervened
earlier.</div><a name="07042462000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that a number of people demonstrate their mental health
problems through delusions that have a religious basis? I have double
checked and found evidence of people who confirmed that their delusions
included religious delusions when thought that they were God or
Mohammed. Including such delusions as an exemption would, in fact,
create a situation in which lawyers would become
involved.</div><a name="07042462000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000418"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Such matters are not fears and hypotheses that
have been dreamt up by Opposition Members to entertain or alarm the
Committee. They are the real concerns of 80 members of the Mental
Health Alliance and countless thousands of mental illness sufferers
whom they represent. Whether or not legally it turns out to be the
case, the perceptions that have been created by the Bill for those
people are deeply worrying. In no way are such matters trying to
denigrate the mental health profession. What it wants is clarity. It
needs that above all. The medical opinions of members of the mental
health profession need to be based on clarity in the legal system about
what they are entitled to do and the remit of the powers that they will
have. They are saying that the provision will create an enormous lack
of clarity and that it will undermine the therapeutic relationship
between a practitioner and the patient, which is perhaps more important
in mental health care than in physical health
care.</div><a name="07042462000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000419"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> As for clarity, my hon. Friend will recall that
we had exchanges some time ago about addiction to tobacco. Does he
agree that the clause, as drafted, would include that addiction, which
would be embraced generally within the term &#147;substance
misuse&#148;? The examples of dependence on alcohol or drugs are not
exclusive and would not exclude tobacco, whereas conversely the
Government&#146;s amendment makes no reference to dependence on
tobacco. Therefore, it would be open to a clinician to section someone
for that dependence, which would not apply if they were dependent on
alcohol.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div><a name="07042462000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000420"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, which
is not limited to tobacco. We could be looking at solvent and petrol
abuse, too.</div><a name="07042462000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming
back to the Minister&#146;s point about where such matters would be
covered under the amendment, surely she is aware that all addictions,
including tobacco, are covered by ICD10 as a mental disorder. They are
already caught up in those things. Such addictions would be regarded as
a mental disorder, whether or not they are mentioned explicitly. She
needs to do a bit more homework on the amendment&#146;s
implications.</div><a name="07042462000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
implications and perceptions for the black and minority ethnic
community, we have received submissions from the BME groups. One brief,
which refers to National Institute for Mental Health in England
documents,
states:</div><a name="07042462000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Extensive
literature confirms that racism can apply in the practice under the
current law and is even more likely under the broader definition of
mental disorder. Research in cultural psychiatry demonstrates how hard
it is to diagnose when issues of culture and belief get involved in the
mix.&#148;</div><a name="07042462000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the point
made by the hon. Member for Bridgend, the brief
states:</div><a name="07042462000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
difference between delusional behaviour and hallucinations and
culturally or religiously appropriate beliefs, such as belief in an
interaction with gods, witchcraft and spirits, is often difficult for
psychiatrists to
define.&#148;</div><a name="07042462000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
comes down to the issue that the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee,
the Richardson committee and all the other committees made absolutely
clear. People should not be subject to sectioning solely on account of
their problems with substance misuse, sexual identity or cultural,
religious or political beliefs, but on the basis of a mental illness
that can then be treated bythe appropriate professionals. By
rejecting the amendments, we run the risk that people could be subject
to coercion within mental health services on the basis of something
that is not primarily a mental illness and will not be subject to
treatment as such. Equally bad, if not worse, is the perception that
that would create. The Government&#146;s aim to remove the clear,
understandable exclusions that we are seeking to keep in the Bill would
cause a great deal of concern and angst among those who might not then
present for the help and treatment they
need.</div><a name="07042462000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is one of
the first big-issue debates about the changes to the Bill. The
Government are determined to bulldoze through their own amendments in
defiance of the vast majority of those involved in mental health, be
they practitioners, service users, service providers, charities or
others. The cross-party alliance in the Lords did not just conjure up
the amendments to alarm people, or pluck them out of the air to inflict
some defeat on the Government. After an extensive, well-informed debate
by some seriously skilled, expert and knowledgeable people, they made
the amendments to clause
3.</div><a name="07042462000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, it
will be very bad news indeed if the Government&#151;on the basis of
muddled logic, I must say, and factual errors from the
Minister&#151;cajole Labour Members into overriding those precautions
and pushing through their amendments. The Conservatives will certainly
vote against them ifthey do.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000422"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before I call the next speaker, I think
that it is appropriate to let the Committee know that it is not my
intention to allow a stand part debate, as this debate is fairly wide
ranging, to say the
least.</div><a name="07042462000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000423"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): Thank you, Lady
Winterton. I hope to be brief.</div>
<a name="07042462000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I came to this House in
1997, almost 10 years ago, people misusing drugs&#151;I am the
chairman ofthe misuse of drugs group, so I lay that on the
table&#151;found it difficult, if they also had a mental illness, to
access mental health services. Our group launched an inquiry into the
problem and published a report in 1998 on comorbidity, or dual
diagnosis. At that time, an holistic approach to treating people with
comorbidity of that type was not fashionable. It has got a darn sight
better since, but in some parts of the country it is still not right.
People out there who have mental problems and misuse drugs still find
it difficult to access mental health
services.</div><a name="07042462000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will know that some people who misuse drugs such as amphetamine,
cocaine and even cannabis with high concentrations of
tetrahydrocannabinol &#151;I am talking about 15 per cent. rather
than 5 per cent.&#151;may become mentally ill, although there is some
doubt whether a predisposition is necessary. No doubt some people may
become mentally ill as a result of using certain, although not all,
drugs.</div><a name="07042462000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
hand, people who are mentally ill and tortured by their mental illness
also try to escape their problems by turning to the kind of drugs that
other people misuse, too. The terrible problem of diagnosed
schizophrenics using cannabis is well known, and tragically, in some
circumstances, it exacerbates their clinical symptoms. I support the
Government&#146;s amendment, but I seek an assurance from the
Minister that she will do everything possible to ensure that people are
not turned away from mental health services when they are misusing
substances. Some of those people&#151;I have met them&#151;can be
extremely chaotic. The hospitals do not want them anywhere near,
because they are so chaotic. Their lives and behaviour are chaotic, but
obviously they need treatment for the drug misuse and the mental health
problems that they exhibit.</div>
<a name="07042462000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000424"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Gibson</b> (Norwich, North) (Lab): Does my hon. Friend
agree that many of the drugs are not pure, and that the by-products in
some of the drugs causethe problems? There is no guarantee
that any drug is 100 per cent. chemically
pure.</div>
<a name="07042462000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000425"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> That is true. There is also the considerable
problem of poly-misuse&#151;the use of alcohol and drugs, or of
different cocktails of drugs. There has not been a lot of research on
how those affect the mind. We need much more research, but that is a
subject for another debate.</div>
<a name="07042462000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000426"></a>Mrs.
Moon:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that many of the people
whom he is describing often end up homeless because of their chaotic
lifestyle? Frequently, the people who work with homeless people, often
in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>voluntary sector, find it difficult to get support from mental health
services for people who suffer from severe mental health
difficulties.</div>
<a name="07042462000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000427"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> I accept that point, too. It is true.</div>
<a name="07042462000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want my right hon. Friend the
Minister to assure me that she will do everything possible to ensure
that people who deal with people with comorbidity are properly trained
in the medical schools, and that we will try to get more people to work
in a more holistic manner and even to take social problems into
account.
</div><a name="07042462000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000428"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I note that a number of hon. Members hope to
speak, and I want to add my support to many of the comments made by the
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. Indeed, as he said a lot of
what I was going to say, I shall be brief. However, it is worth
repeating a few points.</div>
<a name="07042462000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition Members cannot say
often enough that we do not raise these matters only for the sake of an
argument or to prolong the debate, but out of genuine concern. There is
such a consensus in the Mental Health Alliance, and given the disparate
nature of some of the members of that alliance, it is telling that
there is such agreement on many of the problematic aspects of the
Bill.</div> <a name="07042462000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been
said, Richardson recommended in 1999 that a new mental health Act
should contain a broader definition of mental disorder. He also stated
that that needed to be balanced by some exclusions. It is not only us
who say that: our stance is supported bythe Royal College of
Psychiatrists, the British Psychological Society, the British
Association of Social Workers and the Royal College of Nursing. They
are all people with everyday contact with service usersand the
very people who will be responsible for ongoing care.</div>
<a name="07042462000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was mentioned that Scotland
and New Zealand have introduced a range of exemptions. A number of
states in Australia have done the same, despite the fact that in all
those countries the definition of mental disorder or mental illness is
narrower than ours. I hope that the Minister will tell us what note has
been taken of the experience of other countries and why that line has
been disregarded by the Government. I take her point, to a certain
extent, that people have so far not been detained, for some of the
reasons mentioned today. That does not mean that we should waste this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make it crystal clear that this will
not be tolerated in the
future.</div><a name="07042462000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="07042462000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Royal
College of Psychiatrists and others seem to be asking for clarity to
help them in their jobs. The Minister seemed to think that it was
insulting to suggest that they could not do the job already. They seem
to disagree with that and would prefer stricter guidelines, so I do not
think that it is a case of insult. I think that, particularly in a
litigious climate, that they want to be absolutely clear about what is
possible and what is not. They probably also want to safeguard
themselves and rogue members from allegations of social control. The
hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) pointed out earlier
that any such transgressions should be dealt with by professional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>bodies. However, those of us who have looked into
professional regulation will have noticed that it can take a prolonged
pattern of aberrant behaviour before it comes to the attention of the
authorities. One has only to look at the case of Harold Shipman to
realise that malpractice can go undetected for a long
time.</div>
<a name="07042462000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000429"></a>Dr.
Naysmith:</b> I think that the hon. Lady is misquoting what I
said. I did not talk about discretions and someone coming before a
regulatory body, but about the high quality of clinical practice that
we should expect and which should be automatically available. I know
that she is making the point that we do not always get that, but it
should not be something that needs to be written on the face of a Bill
that patients will never
see.</div><a name="07042462000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000430"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> One always hopes that certain matters do not have
to be written down on the face of a Bill, but, sadly, we have seen too
many examples of legislation that has been introduced as a reaction to
problems that would not have happened had every member of the
profession adhered to those high standards. I do not think that this is
the place for that debate. However, I acknowledge his point.</div>
<a name="07042462000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning, the hon. Member
for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) described how people with
autistic spectrum disorder can exhibit behaviours that, on the face of
it, can seem quite strange, but which become logical and understandable
in the context of ASD. To some extent, a parallel can be drawn with the
reasoning behind what the House of Lords was trying to do with its
amendments.</div> <a name="07042462000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) introduced a subject that
I was going to touch upon. I once visited a school where there was a
young man who had autistic spectrum disorder but who was also of
Iranian dissent. There was a practice which involved a very large
stick. It looked as though he was beating himself with it quite
severely. This was alarming behaviour to see in a school. What was
strange was that all the other children were ignoring this child and
the teachers were quite happy for this lad to have the big stick. In
that environment, people understood his behaviour and his problems and
he was quite happy. He did not need treatment, he just needed
tolerance. One can imagine a situation in which that lad grows up into
a hulking great 18-year-old and goes out into the community, which does
not understand the situation, and it is thought that there may be a
mental disorder. In fact, there is not and he should not be treated as
having such a disorder. I cite that as one fairly unusual example,
which, taken in the wrong context and without the safeguards in the
House of Lords Bill, could result in an inappropriate
sectioning.</div><a name="07042462000184"></a>

Coffey:</b> I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns, but
I cannot see how putting an exclusion in the Bill would prevent a
psychiatrist from falling below the standards to which they should
adhere in assessing people because of lack of knowledge and
understanding on their part. At the end of the day, we are asking
mental health professionals to assess individual situations. We cannot
prevent them from getting it wrong individually, as clinicians, by
having a clause in the Mental Health Bill, telling them that they are
not to get it wrong.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div><a name="07042462000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000432"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> Would that life were that simple. It is not a case
of doing that, but a clear intention in the Bill would make clinicians
think twice. We should not lose sight of the fact that mental health
services areunder huge stress. It would be easy and perhaps
understandable in some cases for people to come to an obvious
conclusion. I happen to know that many people speak highly of the
services once they access them, because they find that time and
attention are given to them, but we should not necessarily take it for
granted that that will always be done. As I stressed earlier and as
cannot be said too often, it is not us asking for the provision that I
have described&#151;&#151;it is the Royal College of Psychiatrists
itself.</div><a name="07042462000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000433"></a>Hywel

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000434"></a>Sandra

protection&#151;&#151;for their
profession.</div><a name="07042462000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted
to talk about the alcohol exemption. I still think that it is confused.
There seems to be a lack of clarity about misuse and the degree of
dependency that is necessary. The Minister may say that that has been
clarified, but Opposition Members are not entirelysure when
someone could be covered under ICD10&#151;the
International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision&#151;which is
not covered by the exemption. It still has not been

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000435"></a>Ms

The amendment that was introduced in the House of Lords is the
provision that refers to &#147;substance misuse&#148;. We are
making the point that it is not entirely clear what is meant by it.
That is one reason why we think that it should be removed: it is not
clear; it is
confusing.</div><a name="07042462000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000436"></a>Sandra

believe.</div><a name="07042462000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to sexual identity or orientation, again I have some concerns, because
without this exclusion, people with gender dysphoria, transsexualism
and fetishistic sexual behaviour will be brought within the
legislation, because those behaviours are included in ICD10. Sexual
orientation would cover the fetish behaviour. However, the JCHR
reported
that</div><a name="07042462000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
order for a non-emergency detention on grounds of unsoundness of mind
to conform to the requirements of Article 5(1)(e) ECHR, there must be
reliable evidence of a true mental disorder. We are concerned at the
possibility that a person with Gender Identity Dysphoria or transvestic
fetishism, which are recognised aspects of private life under Article
8, might be detained on grounds of mental disorder without any actual
mental disorder such as depression or actual personality
disorder.&#148;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000438"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification,
which I was not aware of. He has had a longer association with the
issue. It would be useful for the Government to consider that aspect,
so as to prevent the necessity for, shall we say, new legislation after
the event.</div> <a name="07042462000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
not go into the social control arguments, which have been raised a
number of times. However, there are also concerns in the black and
ethnic minority community about some of the implications of the
legislation. We all know that black and ethnic minority men are
committed at a higher rate for certain disorders than white males of a
similar cohort. However, we must be absolutely sure that there are no
cultural factors contributing to that&#151;hence one of the
inclusions in the Lords amendments.</div>
<a name="07042462000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000439"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I shall make this a micro-speech. I am sorry that
some hon. Members think that, in supporting the Lords amendment, we are
having a go at clinicians. I hope that I can put their minds at
restby reading a submission by the Royal College of
Psychiatrists, which
says:</div><a name="07042462000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
warmly welcome the amendments made by the House of Lords and hope that
further improvements in the House of Commons will ensure that it is
more fit for purpose.&#148;</div><a name="07042462000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to think that we are singing from the same hymn sheet as the
professional clinicians and that it is Government Members who are on
the wrong page.</div> <a name="07042462000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
confused by the Minister&#146;s assertion that the exclusions would
create a lawyer&#146;s paradise. That is not a sufficient argument
for not having the exclusions, because it suggests that people with
mental illness value their liberty less than those who are not mentally
ill. I can assure hon. Members that if my status as a free person was
being reviewed and I faced being locked up, I would fight tooth and
nail for my liberty, and I would expect someone with a mental illness
to take very much the same view. Why we think that people who are
mentally ill should not be allowed to have legal representation, or
that such representation is someone less valid than in other cases, I
do not know.</div> <a name="07042462000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
arguing her corner, the Minister said that lawyers would be arguing on
behalf of some of the most dangerous offenders, which again suggests
that the Bill is not really a public health Bill, but a public order
Bill. The Minister&#146;s focus on dangerous offenders in that
context, as opposed to people who are ill and may harm themselves,
suggests that we should perhaps have a Home Office Minister sitting
alongside her, making an argument for the public order aspects of the
Bill.</div> <a name="07042462000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that
this would be a short speech and it will be. You ruled me out of order
earlier, Lady Winterton,but I hope that this will be in order.
The British Psychological Society, which I have every reason to believe
is an august body, made a submission to the Committee that
said:</div> <a name="07042462000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
has been a long history of compulsory psychiatric treatment being used
against those who breach social and political conventions. The fact
that the 1983 Act excluded certain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>categories of people has meant that this has been less of a concern in
the UK. However, we should not be complacent about the possibility that
this might happen were there to be no
exclusions.&#148;</div><a name="07042462000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that,
Lady Winterton, I say thank you very
much.</div><a name="07042462000305"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="07042462000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000440"></a>Chris
Bryant:</b> On the face of it, it seems sensible to include
the exclusions that the House of Lords has put in place. They seem very
attractive. Many who remember Pinochet&#146;s Chile or Russia under
Soviet rule will know how mental health services were used to
incarcerate people who were not of the right political opinion. Many
British gay people, and gay people across Europe, know how it has been
to be imprisoned, or for that matter executed, for their sexuality, so
it seems intrinsically a good idea for the Bill to say expressly that
one cannot be sectioned solely on the basis of one&#146;s sexual
orientation.</div><a name="07042462000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister said in her reply earlier, and as I tried to tease out of her,
there is a significant issue in the way that many black Africans and
Caribbeans&#151;males in particular&#151;are treated under the
mental health system in the UK. Many are sectioned for psychotic
disorders beyond the extent that would be expected, although there is
probably not yet sufficient concrete evidence to be absolutely certain
of that. However, certain consultant psychiatrists in London have said
to me that they are aware of a fairly significant problem with London
mental health services whereby people from countries in Africa bring a
mentally disordered relative to Britain because they know that there
are no mental health services for the relative in the African country.
They do so knowing that their relative will receive mental health
services here, because no clinician would be able to allow him or her
to roam the streets.</div>
<a name="07042462000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see several reasons,
therefore, why it might seem intrinsically a good idea for the Bill to
contain the proposed exclusions. However, on sexual orientation in
particular, it seems bizarre that we would want to cover it in the
Bill. We should assume that nobody believes that somebody&#146;s
homosexuality is a reason for them to be sectioned. We should make that
assumption, together with the assumption that nobody should be
sectioned for their political, religious or cultural
views.</div><a name="07042462000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course there
will be complicated decisions, such as when someone says, &#147;I am
God&#148; rather than, &#147;I believe in God.&#148; Richard
Dawkins would say that both are equally delusional, but I think that
British society has a settled understanding of how religion and mental
health play together, and I do not believe that that needs to be put
expressly in the Bill.</div>
<a name="07042462000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why, despite
understanding the reasonswhy people might wish to include
them, I find the exclusions patronising and therefore inappropriate. I
also believe that they would be a legal nightmare. The person who does
not want to be sectioned, and whose lawyer says that his claim to be
God is a religious belief, will be able to advance that argument before
the courts. That gives a much more complicated set of decisions to the
courts than would be appropriate.</div>
<a name="07042462000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the end, I suppose that I
believe that there should not be any exemptions. In particular, I have
a real concern about the exemption on alcohol and drug 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>abuse. As the hon. Member for Daventry mentioned earlier, several
conditions similar to alcohol dependency are conditions for which we
section people. Bulimia and anorexia nervosa are both eating disorders.
Many people believe that alcoholism is a similar type of disorder, and
many of the treatments that people undergo for each of them, such as
the 12-step treatment, would be very similar. Why, therefore, should we
choose in no circumstances whatever to section somebody who is
alcoholic yet be prepared to section people who might be a danger to
themselves for other reasons, when I would suggest that the conditions
are relatively
similar?</div><a name="07042462000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
alcoholism, my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East made an
important speech about dual diagnosis. Where somebody is an alcoholic,
there is often a chicken-and-egg debate: is the person an alcoholic
because they are depressed or are they depressed because they are an
alcoholic? That has not been genuinely resolved in any sense, and that
is why there is a worry about people being turned away from mental
health services when their primary mental disorder is alcoholism. I am
talking not about binge drinkers or people who drink on a regular
basis, but about people who would go into delirium tremens were they to
stop drinking. Such people would have fits and hallucinations, and
would not be able to get through the morning, afternoon or evening
without having a sufficient quantity of alcohol in their
bloodstream.</div>
<a name="07042462000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I took my mother through DTs on
several occasions, so I know how horrible such situations are. I
understand why many clinicians will not want to have to enforce
detoxification or rehab, but for some people the dependency on alcohol
is the mental disorder that needs to be addressed, and all too often,
people have not received the medical and psychiatric support that they
need. Because such people often have chaotic lifestyles, they may be
dependent not only on alcohol but on other drugs&#151;in many cases,
such people are dependent on anti-depressants. As a result, it is all
too easy for the mental health services to say, &#147;I am sorry, but
we just don&#146;t think that we can really help
you.&#148;</div>
<a name="07042462000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000441"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that in the past people
with co-morbidity have been told to get rid of their substance misuse
before they proceed to be treated for their mental illness? We should
treat people holistically, as is best
practice.</div>
<a name="07042462000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000442"></a>Chris
Bryant:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. One of my
worries about the provision of mental health services around the
country relates to the fact that not every person is the same. There
needs to be a wide range of treatment methods and locations. Some
people need to be treated at home, whereas others need to be treated
away from home. Some people need to go through the 12-step process,
although I should point out that because reference is always made to a
higher power, many people have difficulty in subscribing to it. I am
keen to see genuine diversity and people being treated in a holistic
way, as my hon. Friend suggests. That is why I worry about the
exemption in respect of drug and alcohol dependency.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div><a name="07042462000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concede the Minister&#146;s
point on alcohol misuse. The Royal College of Psychiatrists&#146;
definition of misuse of alcohol is being drunk. Someone who is drunk
has misused alcohol, although they will subsequently recuperate. But
just because somebody is drunk does not mean that they should
necessarily enter into the mental health system and be
detained.</div> <a name="07042462000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
make one other point about alcoholism. I worry that, by keeping the
exemption about alcohol and drug dependency in the Bill, we are not
preparing ourselves for the future. I simply do not believe that we
know everything that there is to know about alcohol dependency. In 20,
30 or 40 years&#146; time, I think that we will have a much better
understanding of how to treat alcoholism. I hold that as a passionate
belief, even though I have no substantive evidence for it. By including
an exemption in the Bill when the matter should be left to
clinicians&#146; independent judgment, we might be disabling the Bill
for the future.</div><a name="07042462000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
want to refer to the issue of sexual identity and sexual orientation
and the exemption that exists in the House of Lords version of the
Bill. Incidentally, I shall try to elucidate the precise position in
respect of the row that I had with the hon. Member for East Worthing
and Shoreham earlier about whether homosexuality is in the ICD10 list.
It is true to say that homosexuality is in the ICD10 list, but so is
heterosexuality, so that does not take us very far forward. The fact
that something is in the ICD10 list does not necessarily mean that
anybody should consider certain people to have a mental disorder. That
is the point of the Bill. Several other hurdles have to be clambered
over. It is not just the fact of a mental disorder that is considered
but its nature and degree and whether a person will be a danger to
themselves and/or others. That has to be overcome before detention is
considered. The mere fact that something is listed in ICD10 as a mental
disorder is not sufficient. ICD10 does not state that homosexuality is
a mental disorder; it is a more complicated
measurement.</div><a name="07042462000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also true that paedophilia is not listed under a category called
&#147;Sexual identity or orientation&#148;, because there is no
such category in ICD10. It is listed under &#147;Disorders of sexual
preference&#148;, alongside fetishism, fetishistic transvestism,
voyeurism, sadomasochism, exhibitionism and various other minor
disorders. The Government need to be clear about precisely what they
expect clinicians to do about paedophilia. I hope that, if somebody
presented to a clinician and said that they had significant sexual
fantasies relating to pre-pubertal children, the clinician would want
to take action on that basis. If that mental disorder were of a nature
and degree that was significant enough, and if it was likely to lead to
danger to children, the clinician should be free to make the judgment
that the person should be detained. I should be grateful if the
Minister replied on that issue, because the exemption supported by
Government Members would make that
impossible.</div><a name="07042462000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
end by saying that I should prefer it if there were no exemptions.
Unfortunately, every psychiatristI know says, &#147;I
don&#146;t want my ward filled with alcoholics.&#148; That is not a
good enough argument, but I understand why the Minister is supporting
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>position. Nevertheless, it is important that the issue of using
&#147;solely&#148; or &#147;alone&#148; should be added into
her amendment on
Report.</div><a name="07042462000216"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000443"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am conscious of the time, Lady Winterton.
However, in the interests of time I omitted to welcome you to the Chair
and I now do so.</div><a name="07042462000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
some of their exchanges, the hon. Members for Rhondda and for Bolton,
South-East made important points about access to services, which do not
directly arise from this clause, but with which I have sympathy. I find
myself at odds with the Government on the clause. That is not always
the case. However, they have not made the case for simplification. My
colleagues have already spoken eloquently about actual fears,
particularly in relation to black and minority ethnic persons and
potential fears in relation to social control and I strongly endorse
what they have said. I am worried that the logic of the
Government&#146;s position is to make no exclusions, whereas they
bear on the clinical judgment of clinicians in relation to substance
addiction.</div><a name="07042462000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am mainly
concerned about the safeguards for the individual faced with compulsory
detention. We should not minimise that. The Minister suggested that
this might all be a lawyers&#146; row and it would get more difficult
if we defined people. I suspect that she is misadvising herself about
that. If the argument is not tied to the specifics, any good lawyer
would be arguing about something outwith the scope of mental health
legislation and could produce the same set of
arguments.</div><a name="07042462000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We in the
House are, I hope, concerned about the liberties of the individual and
safeguards from arbitrary detention. The list that is set out in the
clause, as received from the other place, is a pretty good proxy for
the kinds of stigma that, sadly, our society tends to apply&#151;or
has done historically. If I were in that situation, I would take some
comfort from the existence of the list. I believe that tribunals could
and would interpret it entirely sensibly; it would throw out the abuse
of clinical judgment and reinforce good clinical
practice.</div>
<a name="07042462000306"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="07042462000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042462000444"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Pugh</b>: I wish to make a few brief and, I hope, helpful
remarks. We learned this morning that mental disorder is what a
psychiatrist says it is, and that the definition of mental order is
left deliberately vague. Sometimes, when one is not sure what something
is, it can be helpful to say what it is not. I think that that is the
thrust of the exceptions as defined. Tangentially, what is the
Minister&#146;s view on how the definition of mental disorders for
the purposes of legislation affects service delivery in the NHS? If
something is not defined for the purposes of this Bill, does that mean
that it is not a mental disorder so far as the NHS is
concerned&#151;and, therefore, so far as entitlement to treatment
goes&#151;whether or not a person comes under the remit of this
legislation?</div> <a name="07042462000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are probably cases in which sexual orientation, religious belief or
political views are so extraordinary that by themselves they make a
prima facie case for someone having a mental disorder. Like the hon.
Member for Daventry, I would expect to see other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>associated symptoms. I note what the hon. Member for Bridgend said;
there are cases of genuine religious mania and the like. There are even
cases of people&#151;David Icke, for example&#151;whose political
views are so extraordinary that one might think that there is something
wrong with their health. The nub of the issue is that if mental
disorder is to be what a psychiatrist says it is, we are not entirely
happy to have psychiatrists saying which sexual orientation, which
religious or political belief or which cultural preference is
symptomatic of mental disorder. I think that that is the heart of the
matter.</div> <a name="07042462000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
mentioned paedophilia. It was discussed on Second Reading as something
that would not be covered or adequately dealt with if particular Lords
amendments were to be agreed. I took the trouble to ask a number of
those who had written to me directly whether they thought that
paedophilia would be considered a mental disorder and whether its
treatment would be excluded under this Bill; whether, as a logical
consequence, it would be defined not as a mental disorder but as
something else.</div> <a name="07042462000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
BMA replied by saying that it definitely remained a mental disorder,
but unlike autism, for example, it was not a candidate for compulsory
treatment, so it would be excluded from the remit of the Bill. The
Royal College of Psychiatrists said that it could be included, and that
it would be a disorder of sexual preference, though how that differs
from sexual orientation eludes me. For the Department of Health,
Professor Appleby said that it was not necessarily excluded by the
Lords amendment, but that it was excluded from mental disorders that
could be the subject of coercive powers. In that respect, the Minister
is right. The reply from Mind said that it was not intended that it be
excluded by the amendment. Strangely enough, the closest fit in views
was between the BMA and Louis Appleby.</div>
<a name="07042462000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not entirely clear what
the exceptions do, but it is fairly clear what they are intended to
achieve. That is to fetter the maximum discretion left to the
psychiatrist, with which people are evidently
uncomfortable.</div>
<a name="07042462000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042462000445"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I want briefly to respond to a few of the
remarks that have been made. This has been a helpful and thoughtful
debate. However, there have been some slightly bizarre contributions.
The suggestion by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that
we are proposing to detain under this legislation people who are
addicted to cigarettes fits in absolutely with what my hon. Friend the
Member for Bridgend said. It is very important that we do not
scaremonger; it is unhelpful to the people whom we are trying to get
treated.</div> <a name="07042462000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Rhondda again raised the issue of whether, in the
light of the debate that we have had today, we should have decided to
include drug and alcohol dependency. That goes back to many of the
representations that we received in response to the draft Mental Health
Bill in 2004. It is a difficult issue. Points have been very well made
about the fact that there are, of course, severe implications to saying
that, as a society, we would detain people on mental health wards who
simply had drug and alcohol problems. We have decided not to go down
that route. However, that does not negate the important points 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>that were raised about how we get dual diagnosis right and how we
improve services so that, on the one hand, services for drug and
alcohol addiction are effective and, on the other hand, when we need to
step in under the 1983 Act and treat the other part of a
person&#146;s condition, which can sometimes be the result of their
addiction, we get that right. Those are two important
points.</div><a name="07042462000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say again
that I understand the points that have been made about the use of the
word &#147;solely&#148;. That is simply a drafting matter. As I
have said before, I am prepared to have a further discussion about it,
if that would help to achieve greater clarity. However, in legal
effect, it is really not
necessary.</div><a name="07042462000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
hon. Members have talked about the Richardson report. It did not
suggest any range of conditions that were not mental disorders. That is
the difference with what is happening now. We are discussing excluding
conditions that are not mental disorders in the first place. That is
why there is a real difficulty in saying that, somehow, we should start
to include those disorders at this stage.</div>
<a name="07042462000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Romsey said
that we lived in a litigious climate, and that is absolutely true. That
is why I have made the point that, if we open up the Bill to more
exclusions, we will increase the opportunity for
litigation.</div><a name="07042462000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
also like to pick up on what the hon. Member for Broxbourne said when
he talked to me about people&#146;s rights; of course, I absolutely
agree with the importance of those rights. He also talked about the
fact that I had used the phrase &#147;dangerous offenders&#148;. If
I used the word &#147;dangerous&#148;, I am sure that I would have
said something like, &#147;Offenders, some of whom can be
dangerous,&#148; because that is the reality. Going back to what I
said earlier, it is also the reality that some offenders will argue
around these exclusions; that is where the lawyers&#146; paradise
comes in. The Government amendment will return the Bill to the way that
the Government think that it should be, with only one exclusion for
alcohol and drug dependents, and I urge the Committee to support
it.</div> <a name="07042462000231"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
