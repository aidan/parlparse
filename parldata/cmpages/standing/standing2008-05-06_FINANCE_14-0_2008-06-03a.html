<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000427"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I know, Sir Nicholas, that you are an aficionado
of the latest technology and no doubt had your BlackBerry to hand in
Taiwan, which was probably where it was made in the first
place.</div><a name="0806046000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
72(5) intends to ensure that the effect of abolition of first-year
allowances for small companies is felt only in future years
&#147;after the relevant date&#148;, which is in April 2008. It is
a welcome and common-sense clarification that the measure is not
intended to be retroactive and will not undo the provision that was in
force in previous years. However, the provisions of subsection (5),
which confirms that limitation, apply only to subsections (2) and (3).
Subsection (4) deals with the original legislation that set the rates
of first-year allowances for small companies for 2004-05, 2005-06 and
2006-07. It abolishes the reference to those provisions in the existing
statute. It is not immediately obvious why there is a need to abolish
those provisions, which set rates for previous years. Those are rates
for years that have gone by, so this is a piece of history. I do not
want to over-egg the pudding, but it seems slightly Stalinist to try to
erase the provisions from existence when they cannot have any effect on
periods after April 2008.</div>
<a name="0806046000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if
the provisions are to be abolished, it also needs to be made clear that
the abolition of the rates for those years is not retrospective. There
will be claims outstanding in respect of those previous years,
particular the most recent one, 2006-07. Surely if we are to abolish
the provisions that set the rates, subsection (5)&#151;which limits
the effect to future periods only&#151;needs to apply to subsection
(4) as well as to subsections (2) and (3). It has been suggested to me
that that is simply a drafting error, but perhaps there is a more
complex explanation for the treatment applied to the changes in
subsections (2) and (3) compared with that applied to those introduced
in subsection (4). The amendment simply seeks to extend the protection
offered by subsection (5) to the changes made by subsection
(4).</div><a name="0806046000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000428"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Ideally succinct. I call Maria
Eagle.</div><a name="0806046000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000429"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Sir Nicholas, I would like to make it clear, as I
did this morning, that I am Angela, not
Maria.</div><a name="0806046000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000430"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I do apologise. I know the Minister so
well.</div><a name="0806046000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000431"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> You are not the first person, even today, to make
that mistake, and you will not be the last. Obviously I also forgive
you for all such slips in future.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div><a name="0806046000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before turning to the
Opposition&#146;s amendment, I should explain that the clause seeks
to repeal certain first-year allowances, following the introduction of
the annual investment allowance&#151;which we debated this
morning&#151;from 1 April this year for corporation tax, and from 6
April for income tax. It removes from the legislation the spent time
limit of the higher rate of first-year allowances for small enterprises
only. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge moved an amendment
that I believe is based on a misconception. He wondered about the
removal of the allowances, and he asked whether there was a reason for
that that was not apparent to him in the Bill, or whether there was a
mistake in drafting the Bill.</div>
<a name="0806046000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was not a mistake in
drafting the Bill. Essentially, the reason is that this is what I would
call the &#147;Monty Python&#146;s parrot&#148; clause. The
allowances no longer exist; they have expired; they are no longer. They
expired in their own way, and the clause removes them from legislation
so as not to have a load of spent provisions clogging up tax
law.</div><a name="0806046000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000432"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I entirely understand that, and I sympathise with
the intention. However, will there not be outstanding cases, relating
to those periods, that have not yet been settled or finally agreed? If
we do not put in the saving provision that subsection (5) introduces,
those cases will be gone, expunged&#151;I do not want to drop into
the hon. Lady&#146;s language. They will never have been part of the
legislation. There will therefore be nothing to refer back to. That is
the concern. The treatment of the changes made by subsections (2) and
(3), that is that they are limited by subsection (5) to future periods
only after April 2008, seems entirely sensible, and it would seem
entirely sensible to do the same with subsection
(4).</div><a name="0806046000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000433"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The provisions were time limited on their
introduction, and the legislation that introduced them provided for
their natural expiry on given dates. Those dates have now all passed,
so it is not appropriate or necessary to include a relevant date for
their repeal, as the amendment seeks. I do not think that there is an
issue; there is certainly no drafting error. We have checked.
Obviously, when we saw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, we
checked whether there was a technical issue or problem. We do not
believe that there is, so I hope that with those reassurances, he will
withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="0806046000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000434"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I accept what the hon. Lady says, but I still
cannot see it in the Bill, and there could be concerns about
outstanding claims. Those who have raised the issues will have heard
what she has said this afternoon. If necessary, we will come back to
the Minister at a later stage, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000437"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 161, in clause 74, page 40, line 16, leave out

(6).</div><a name="0806046000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000438"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I am delighted to speak to amendments Nos. 160
and 161 to clause 74 on capital allowances and cars with low carbon
dioxide emissions. Under section 45D of the Capital Allowances Act
2001, 100 per cent. first-year allowances have been made for
expenditure on cars with low carbon dioxide emissions between 17 April
2002 and 31 March 2008. Clause 74 extends that period for a further
five years to 31 March 2013. I support extending the period, because it
makes sense to lengthen the time over which the tax incentives will be
in place, but I question the Government&#146;s change in definition
of a low carbon dioxide emission car.</div>
<a name="0806046000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the same
clause the Government&#146;s approach demonstrates the contradiction
of their overall problems with green taxation. On the one hand, the
clause contains something that is welcome: an extension of the fiscal
measure for a further five years. On the other hand, the very same
clause contains measures that change the definition of a low-CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>car to make it harder for cars to qualify for the same provision.
It reduces the CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions figure that cars must not
exceed in order to qualify from 120 g to 110 g per kilometre
driven.</div>
<a name="0806046000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that a transitional rule will also operate for car leasing contracts
entered into before the CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>reduction comes into effect on 1
April 2008 so that those contracts will be unaffected, which seems
sensible. I do not understand, however, why the Government are making
it harder and reducing companies&#146; incentives to use lower
emission cars. It just seems contradictory: we are extending the period
of a fiscal measure while weakening the measure intrinsically. It seems
somewhat of an oxymoron, albeit in the form of a clause in the Finance
Bill.</div> <a name="0806046000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should better
understand the second aspect of the clause, which changes the
definition of a low carbon emission car from 120 g to 110 g per
kilometre driven, if there was already evidence, for example, that
consumers and companies were making great strides towards lower
emission cars&#151;in other words, if we had had an initial target,
there had been progress towards it, and it therefore seemed sensible to
the Treasury to recreate the stretched target effect and encourage a
further, new step. The Treasury&#146;s projections for car emissions
over the coming years do not seem to reflect that expected movement. I
am not clear why the Treasury is now making the fiscal incentive harder
to reach, rather than keeping it at the current
level.</div><a name="0806046000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="0806046000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
illustrate briefly what I mean by touching upon the numbers of cars
that will be affected by the provisions. I received parliamentary
figures from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>Ministers suggesting that the Government estimate that the number of
cars emitting 120 g per kilometre or less will increase from about
435,000 in 2008-09&#151;out of a total 15.6 million cars paying
graduated vehicle excise duty&#151;to about 674,000 by 2010-11, which
by then would be out of a total 19.6 million cars paying graduated VED.
If we retain the current definition of a low carbon emission car, that
would represent a growth of about 240,000 cars. By the
Government&#146;s estimations, therefore, were we to reduce the level
from 120 g to 110 g per kilometre, the number of cars expected to be
affected and incentivised by the provision would fall considerably. I
estimate the number to be 140,000 rising to 214,000 by 2010-11&#151;a
rise of about 70,000 to 75,000 cars. So it would dramatically curtail
the impact of this
policy.</div><a name="0806046000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806046000439"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000440"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I think so. The broader context to the debates
in this House and outside on VED centres around the fact that the
changes in the Budget to graduated VED were pitched by the Government
as environmental changes designed to drive a reduction in CO<span class="Sub">2.
</span>However, we know, from questions answered by Ministers, that that
is not the case and that the changes announced this year will cut
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions from motor vehicles by far less than 1 per
cent. So my hon. Friend is right to raise that issue.</div>
<a name="0806046000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, as the
Government appear to have admitted, the changes to VED will not have a
dramatic impact on motor vehicle emissions, other fiscal measures will
become all the more important. In that case, I could understand why we
would need to consider more carefully remaining measures that could
affect motor vehicle emissions and see whether they really work. That
is why I have proposed amendment No. 160, which is the primary
amendment in the group, because it essentially would retain the current
definition of a low carbon emission car at 120 g per kilometre.
Amendment No. 161 is a consequential amendment that would ensure that
the clause remains correct in substance. Those are my concerns with the
clause. We support what the Government are trying to achieve, but I
question why they are making the incentive harder to achieve.</div>
<a name="0806046000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to ask the Minister a couple of questions that will help to put this
debate in a more fact-based context. Will the Minister say how many low
carbon emission cars qualified for 100 per cent. first-year allowances
between, for example, 2005 to 2007? Of the numbers of cars I have
talked about that were outlined in the parliamentary question and
answer I have received, how many low emission cars in both the existing
and new definition proposed by clause 74 do the Government expect and
project will qualify in 2009-10 and 2010-11? I am assuming that that is
a subset of the total number of cars that we expect to be paying
graduated VED at lower band levels.</div>
<a name="0806046000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Making the test for low carbon
emission cars tougher and lowering the grams per kilometre from 120 to
110 will necessarily limit the number of cars that might qualify.
Therefore, there is a danger that rather than encourage the use of low
emission cars, which is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div>what the clause is intended to do and which we welcome, it will
discourage the purchase of greener cars. Even Government estimates
about how many of those kinds of cars they expect to be purchased and
driven around over the next few years are not particularly
confident&#151;no massive jump in the sale of such cars is predicted.
Most of the 4 million cars that the Government project will be bought
over the next two to three years will clearly be in higher bands rather
than the lowest emission bands. I shall close with those comments. I
look forward to listening to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="0806046000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000441"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Before responding to the amendments, it might help
if I explain briefly that the policy purpose of clause 74 is to extend
the 100 per cent. first-year capital allowance scheme for a further
five years&#151;until 2013&#151;for businesses that invest in the
cleanest cars.</div><a name="0806046000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the observations of the hon. Member for Wellingborough,
this is an allowance, not a tax, and therefore it actually costs the
Exchequer. The scheme is designed to try to improve the incentive for
the cleanest cars that are available on the market to be bought by
those businesses that operate fleets of cars or are involved in
business travel. When considering the clause and amendments, it is
important to focus on that particular area, rather than on the entire
car fleet; otherwise, we might get ourselves into a bit of
difficulty.</div><a name="0806046000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000442"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> There is a difference, is there not, in trying to
drive fleets towards the cleanest cars or towards low carbon emission
cars? As the Minister rightly says, we are going for the cleanest cars,
but it is a disincentive to move towards the cleanest cars. That seems
to be a change in the Government&#146;s
policy.</div><a name="0806046000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000443"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I do not agree and I shall explain why. The purpose
of extending the 100 per cent. first-year capital allowances scheme for
businesses that invest in the cleanest cars&#151;not a clean
car&#151;for a further five years and stretching the target again by
reducing it from 120 grams per kilometre of emissions to 110 grams is
precisely to ensure that the objectives of the scheme as they were
first designed are achieved. That is an effective environmental
incentive for the presence in the car fleet of the cleanest emitting
cars rather than good cars. The cleanest cars at the edge of
technological advance will find their way into the car fleets and that
will have an effect on the second-hand car market once they are leased,
used and sold on. We have focused on a particular part of the market
for a particular purpose. The idea behind the original capital
allowance scheme, which is being extended and tightened again under the
clause, was to keep things at the forefront of technological
change.</div><a name="0806046000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two
Conservative amendments would prevent us from revising the original
carbon dioxide emissions threshold down. We need to do that to ensure
that the scheme reflects advances in emissions technology since 2002,
when the first incentive scheme was put in place. The amendments would
leave the original 2002 threshold unaltered and in place until 2013.
However, massive technological change is already happening in engine
technology and emissions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 465</div><a name="0806046000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said earlier, the scheme is
meant to be an incentive and is intended to be at the forefront of
bringing the cleanest engines to market in a way that guarantees that
people taking a risk designing new technologies get a foothold in the
market. That is the point of the 100 per cent. first-year capital
allowances, which the hon. Member for Putney did not
accept.</div><a name="0806046000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000444"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> My understanding is that the point of the
capital allowances was to encourage a change in behaviour rather than
simply to track technological development for the sake of it. The
figures that the Government have released suggest that they do not
believe that the allowances will change behaviour. That is why I am
pressing the Minister to explain whether that is so, not to explain
whether there is a need to track technological improvements. I accept
that having the most ambitious policy possible may be a consideration,
but the ultimate aim needs to be changing behaviour. I do not see
anything in the figures that the Government have released that suggest
that they feel that such policies, particularly this one, will be
successful.</div><a name="0806046000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000445"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It already has been successful, which is why we are
tightening it. The scheme to encourage investment in the cleanest cars
was introduced in 2002. Since then the carbon dioxide emissions of the
UK car fleet have markedly reduced. In 2002, only about 7,000 cars had
emissions under the original threshold of 120 grams per kilometre
driven, but by 2006&#151;the latest available figures only reach
2006, because of how business car taxation works&#151;the number of
eligible cars in the fleets had increased more than fivefold and
improvements continue to be made. Therefore to ensure that the scheme
continues to secure its policy objective as an environmental incentive,
which is to encourage business to invest in the cleanest vehicles at
the edge of technological advance, not just to invest in a clean
vehicle, and to prevent escalating Exchequer cost and mounting
deadweight effects, the carbon dioxide threshold needs to be updated
and stretched and made more challenging, as the hon. Lady said. That
should be done to secure the policy aim of a generous 100 per cent.
write-down of the cost in the first year. The potential cost to the
Exchequer of maintaining the carbon dioxide emissions threshold at the
previous level of 120g/km to 2013, as the Opposition amendment would
provide for, is estimated at &#163;450
million.</div><a name="0806046000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first-year
allowances scheme is intended to incentivise business investment in
cars with the lowest carbon dioxide emissions: not simply low
emissions, but the lowest. Given that policy purpose and the risk of
high Exchequer cost and deadweight in relation to the amendments, I
urge the Committee to reject the
amendment.</div><a name="0806046000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000446"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I want to take up some of the things that the
Minister has said. First, on the first-year allowance&#151;the 100
per cent. write-down&#151;I have been in business and I have had to
make decisions about buying a fleet of cars and I certainly would be
attracted to something that offered 100 per cent. first-year allowance.
I may have already based my fleet on the 120 g per kilometre and
because I am into that fleet 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>structure, I cannot and am not going to change that fleet to 110 g per
year. Therefore, I am going to be penalised later on for going into
something that the Government encouraged me to do in the first
place.</div> <a name="0806046000372"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
<a name="0806046000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000447"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> There is a transitional arrangement that means that
access to the allowance will not change because of the changed
threshold for the length of that lease, so the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point is wrong.</div>
<a name="0806046000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000448"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I can only say, from my practical experience, that
we might expand that fleet year by year and I certainly would not
switch vehicles. I would keep my fleet the same for a considerable
period. The issue about the first-year allowance and the cost, which
the Minister said is &#163;450 million, is about cash flow. It
reverses either when the car is sold or in each and every year because
one is not getting the writing-down allowance. Therefore, it is not an
overall cost; it is purely a cash-flow
issue.</div><a name="0806046000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000449"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> On that basis, does my hon. Friend have any idea
where the Minister got the figure that she just quoted on the cost of
the Opposition amendments? As he rightly points out, balancing charges
on the disposal of the vehicle mean that it is simply a cash-flow
issue.</div>
<a name="0806046000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000450"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. I can only
assume that that was the cost estimated in the first year, because in
the following years it would reverse. It will be interesting if the
Government can explain that that cost may be a negative figure of
&#163;450 million in year one, but it will be positive in the
following years.</div><a name="0806046000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
real issue that I want to draw attention to is that we are hiding from
the cutting edge of technology. If the Government are really keen on
green issues&#151;I do not believe that they are because they do not
have the track record that my party has of wanting to improve the
environment&#151;they would keep it at 120 g per kilometre because it
would encourage more cars. As my hon. Friend the Member for Putney has
pointed out already, the proportion of these vehicles will be lower in
the future than it is now. Therefore, while we want to see the actual
numbers of low carbon emission cars increasing in fleets, for all the
reasons that the Minister has said, it is a mistake to reduce the
permitted level.</div> <a name="0806046000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are missing a trick and I believe that that is entirely for
financial reasons&#151;they think that it will cost them too much to
keep the allowance at this level. It is up to the Government to accept
this very minor amendment. It would show extremely good faith for the
first time in the Committee if they accepted
it.</div><a name="0806046000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806046000451"></a><b class="B">Justine
Greening</b><b class="B">:</b> I am not wholly convinced by what the
Minister has said. I do not understand where the calculation of the
&#163;450 million has come from. The Minister claimed that the impact
was a fivefold increase in cars&#151;from 7,000 to 38,000 out of a
current car population of 15.6 million&#151;which does not indicate
that behaviour has changed dramatically when one thinks of the amount
of that 15.6 million that would have been purchased by companies.
Again, on this and other measures in relation to green taxation, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div>and especially to cars, the Government are in a
mess. I will not press the amendment to a vote, but it is almost
certain that we will be coming back to these issues in the future. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000452"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000454"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> A number of amendments tabled to schedule 25 have
been selected separately and I will try to be brief in discussing each
of them. Hopefully we can rattle through
them.</div><a name="0806046000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule will
introduce a payable tax credit in respect of enhanced capital
allowances. Enhanced capital allowances were introduced in 2001 and
offer 100 per cent. first-year allowances for certain types of
qualifying expenditure. Generally it is expenditure that, for policy
reasons, the Government wish to encourage, such as expenditure on
energy-saving
equipment.</div><a name="0806046000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will leave
aside the broader question of the efficacy of using fiscal policy to
influence corporate investment decisions and focus on some practical
questions. We will see over time how effective these measures are in
enticing companies to make capital expenditure that they otherwise
would not wish to make. We will also judge over time what the economic
impact of that
is.</div><a name="0806046000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 212 and 213 address an important point in relation to this
schedule. As drafted, the payable credit is available only to
companies. By tabling these amendments, we seek to understand why that
incentive will not be available to sole traders and to partnerships. I
said earlier in today&#146;s proceedings that the Government have a
stated objective of maintaining fairness of the tax system by ensuring
that people engaged in similar economic activities pay broadly the same
overall level of tax, regardless of the legal form that they chose for
their business. This discrimination against sole traders and
partnerships flies directly in the face of the pursuit of that
objective. The Exchequer Secretary must explain why the Government have
limited this payable tax credit to those companies that arguably need
it least and excluded partnerships and sole traders. The measure is
also highly discriminatory against smaller businesses. Small and
medium-sized enterprises are overwhelmingly sole traders. Excluding
sole traders and partnerships discriminates against them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div><a name="0806046000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be the
first to admit that the amendments are a clumsy attempt at probing this
issue. In order to avoid the daunting task of going through the entire
schedule and amending every reference to company or companies, I have
taken the coward&#146;s way out and sought to amend the definition of
company in this schedule to include partnerships and sole traders. That
is inelegant, but practical for our purposes this afternoon. If the
Government see the light and accept that the provisions should be
extended to include partnerships and sole traders, I will be happy to
withdraw the amendment and allow the professional draftsmen to do it in
a much more sensible way. I hope that this proposal will at least allow
the Exchequer Secretary to respond to the substantive
point.</div><a name="0806046000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 213 is a necessary consequential amendment because starting dates
for the different tax periods would be different if partnerships and
sole traders were included. Will the Exchequer Secretary tell us in
plain language why, in the face of the Government&#146;s rhetoric
about fairness between different types of legal structure, sole traders
and partnerships need to be discriminated against in the way that is
proposed by the
schedule?</div><a name="0806046000088"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000455"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Before I speak to the amendments, it might be
helpful if I set out the purpose of the schedule. The Budget 2007
package of reforms that announced this change was intended to encourage
investment. It includes a refocusing of the incentives for small
companies towards incentives. First-year tax credits, also referred to
as payable enhanced capital allowances, are one of the incentives. Like
the annual investment allowance, which we discussed earlier, first-year
tax credits are aimed at promoting business investment specifically in
environmentally sustainable places. The Government recognise that high
and sustainable levels of economic growth must not come at a cost to
the environment, and a number of policies are currently in place aimed
at trying to make that growth more environmentally
sustainable.</div> <a name="0806046000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 100
per cent. first-year allowances and ECAs are already available for
investment in designated energy-saving and environmentally beneficial
plant and machinery&#151;that means water-efficient as well as energy
saving. Those allowances deliver a cash-flow boost by way of a
shortened payback period to businesses that invest in green plant and
machinery, which becomes more attractive to purchasers owing to the
reduced relative cost. The purpose of the ECAs is to address market
failure. The more environmentally sustainable infrastructure, to which
I have just referred, is often much more expensive than less
environmentally sustainable water and energy efficient
systems.</div><a name="0806046000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000456"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am sorry to be pedantic, but market failure is
a phrase that trips off the lips of Ministers rather too easily. Why is
it a market failure just because the environmentally-friendly kit costs
more than the non environmentally-friendly
kit?</div><a name="0806046000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000457"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It is a market failure simply because the price
signal would suggest that one would purchase a cheaper kit&#151;be it
water or energy efficient infrastructure&#151;to do the job intended.
A more environmentally sustainable kit might have been only just
developed&#151;it will probably be new technology, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div>used by fewer people and only just getting its feet in the
market&#151;and so be more expensive. I do not need to explain the
reasons for that to the hon. Gentleman. The idea, therefore, is to
level the playing field in the choice between those two options. That
is the economic justification for an ECA, which would be payable if an
individual company were to choose a more environmentally sustainable
kit over a well-established but less environmentally sustainable one
already on the market. That is well-established economic theory on
which I do not need to lecture
him.</div><a name="0806046000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
benefit to businesses of ECAs can be reduced when they are
loss-making&#151;this is the point of the schedule before
us&#151;particularly when the tax losses cannot be relieved for a
number of years, perhaps because the business remains loss-making for
an extended period. That would reduce the incentive for loss makers to
invest in the green plant and machinery, because they would not get the
benefit of the credit. The schedule introduces first-year tax credits
available in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred on, or after,
April 2008, and will be of particular benefit to start-up companies
investing in equipment for their
businesses.</div><a name="0806046000364"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
first-year tax credit regime will allow companies, within the charge to
corporation tax, to surrender losses attributable to investment in
designated energy-saving or water-efficient plant and machinery to the
Government in return for a cash payment. The regime is broadly based on
the well tested model for research and development tax credits.
Obviously, a company may utilise losses that it has made only once, so
once a loss is surrendered for a tax credit, it cannot be carried
forward or relieved in any other way. The cash payment that a company
will receive is 19 per cent. of the loss surrendered&#151;subsequent
amendments will deal with that point, so I shall not labour it now.
Provisions are in place to vary that percentage, but there is an upper
limit, or cap, on the amount that can be claimed, which is a necessary
feature of the scheme to prevent the Exchequer from unlimited exposure
and to ensure that the annual cost of the measure does not exceed
anticipated levels. The cap must be set at a level to ensure that
companies of all sizes can obtain a genuine benefit from the tax credit
scheme.</div>
<a name="0806046000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
seek to extend the benefits of the scheme to sole traders or
partnerships. There are issues here about fraud, abuse and complexity,
which we dealt with in a similar context earlier. The hon. Gentleman
again raised the point about the Government being in favour of fairness
between different legal forms of companies. That is true, but it is not
the same as saying that there should be no differences between the tax
treatment or legal treatment of different forms of company.</div>
<a name="0806046000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="0806046000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the hon. Gentleman were to take his comments to their logical
conclusion, he would seem to be arguing for a single tax form for all
types of company, be they partnerships, sole traders or those limited
by legal liability. I am not certain that I understand the
philosophical point that he was making when he said that we are
discriminating between different forms of company. In UK law there are
different legal forms of company that have different types of tax
liabilities, ranging from income tax to dividends and corporation tax,
and which are long standing in UK law. I am not certain why he seems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div>to be saying that the Government discriminate against those different
forms of company, because we do not. There are several different
strands of ownership that individuals who wish to set up either as
limited liability companies, sole traders or partnerships can choose to
adopt.</div><a name="0806046000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806046000458"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
understand the point that the hon. Lady is trying to make and do not
think that anyone is suggesting that there should be an absolutely
identical tax treatment for different sorts of business organisation.
Nevertheless, surely the market failures and the cash flow problems
that emerge in the early stages of any business, which she put forward
as a justification, apply every bit as much to sole traders and
partnerships as they do to companies, if not
more.</div><a name="0806046000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000459"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> There are different tax systems for sole traders
and partnerships, which allow them to make different arrangements for
writing off investments they make. There are issues relating to how one
would define what limited liability partnerships are. For example,
there is a long history of limited liability partnerships being used as
a way of abusing R and D tax credits, and there are examples that we
have to avoid so that in any system in which we create a circumstance
where money is available to be paid back, set against losses, we must
ensure that that can be done in a way that does not encourage fraud,
avoidance or abuse. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said
that we are discriminating against sole ownerships and partnerships who
need those payments the most, whereas companies in fact currently
access ECAs far more than sole traders and
partnerships.</div><a name="0806046000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000460"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Unless I have misunderstood, they are not
available now, so how can companies access them more than partnerships

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000461"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The allowances are available currently, and what we
are discussing in this clause is a payment for those who are loss
making, and that is what is different.</div>

Hammond:</b> I understand that point, but does she agree that
it is a big extrapolation to say that because companies access ECAs
more than sole traders and partnerships, they need the payable tax
credit more than sole traders and partnerships? It will be small,
start-up and unprofitable businesses that can take advantage of this
payable credit. We are creating another artificial driver to
incorporation. We have seen that before in the incentives that the
Prime Minister introduced while Chancellor to incorporate with
zero-band small companies rates that had to be clawed back when the
consequences were not those that he had wanted to
see.</div><a name="0806046000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000463"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The Government&#146;s aim is to encourage and
support companies, particularly start-ups, to invest in green plant and
machinery, and the tax rules differ for incorporated and unincorporated
businesses. With regard to aspects such as tax rates and personal
allowances, unincorporated businesses already have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>more generous provisions than companies for relieving losses in the
early years of trading, and allowing companies to surrender losses for
tax credits redresses a difference there. There is form in that some
schemes have been set up using limited liability to abuse R and D tax
credits. That would be likely to happen again if we allowed the
extension of this generous scheme to sole traders and partnerships, as
proposed in the Opposition
amendments.</div><a name="0806046000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000464"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> This is the second occasion on which the Exchequer
Secretary has mentioned the notion of fraud and form, as she put it.
Can she give the Committee some evidence of this behaviour by sole
traders and partnerships that has deprived the Treasury in the way that
she has explained? It is important in this debate that we have some
direct evidence that we can look at so that we can make a judgment
about whether the amendments are the right way
forward.</div><a name="0806046000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000465"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Some of the issues with the film tax credit would
give such examples. I can write to members of the Committee with
examples if that is what they wish. I do not intend to stand here and
detail particular instances of fraud and abuse. That would be quite
wrong. The hon. Gentleman can take it from me that there are plenty of
examples where limited liability partnerships have been created to make
extremely dubious claims and avoid tax liabilities. That is far from
the intended purpose of either the R and D tax credit scheme or this
measure.</div><a name="0806046000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000466"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The hon. Lady has alluded to fraud in the R and D
tax credit system. The structure of her argument was that the
first-year payable tax credits broadly reflect the arrangements for the
R and D tax credits and there have been problems with those. She has
mentioned only limited liability partnerships, but says that we will
therefore exclude all partnerships and all sole traders. If there is
evidence to suggest that there is a problem with limited liability
partnerships, she should by all means exclude them, but she should not
throw the baby out with the bathwater and exclude all of the sole
traders and ordinary partnerships that make up the great majority of
SMEs. If there is evidence of such abuse, where is the proposal in the
Bill to correct that by excluding partnerships and sole traders from
access to the R and D tax
credit?</div><a name="0806046000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000467"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I have talked about limited liability partnerships,
but we have also seen avoidance schemes where individuals seek to abuse
the first-year allowances available to SMEs for expenditure on
information and communications technology. There is evidence that these
schemes are targeted for avoidance by the self-employed. The
anti-avoidance group advice is that we would need very robust
anti-avoidance rules if the tax credit regime were to be extended to
the self-employed.</div><a name="0806046000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman should give us some insight into what he thinks could be
done if the amendments were accepted to reduce what we believe is a
real danger of avoidance activity, which would be very costly to the
Exchequer. It is clearly much easier for an individual than a limited
company to receive a spurious 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div>payment and disappear, although both individuals and companies are
within the self-assessment regime. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs has the facility to check a company&#146;s address and
directors&#146; details at Companies House. It has no way of checking
the bona fides of an individual claimant. It is the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment, not mine. He must explain to the
Committee whether he is being complacent about the avoidance potential
for his amendments or whether he has a view about how he could shore up
what we believe is a high risk of avoidance behaviour should his
amendments make it on to the statute
book.</div><a name="0806046000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000468"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am slightly taken aback by a challenge from the
Exchequer Secretary to explain my proposals for anti-avoidance, when
she has been completely unable to explain to the Committee the
avoidance that she is so concerned about. She has, however, made a
couple of specific points that are worthy of consideration. She
referred to the availability of sideways relief in some cases for
partnerships and sole traders, and I accept that to some extent, it
would be a way of relieving unrelieved capital expenditure for a
loss-making start-up business. That is a sound point and worth
considering. I do not accept, however, her lecture on economic
theory&#151;that where a low-volume product costs more than a
high-volume product, it is evidence of market
failure.</div>
<a name="0806046000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000469"></a>Angela

<a name="0806046000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000470"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The hon. Lady did say that. It may be evidence of
a situation that the Government do not like and want to intervene on,
but it is not evidence of market failure. We must be careful about
detecting market failure. I may have said this before, but her
predecessor detected market failure in every corner, and it is not the
culprit in the situation under discussion.</div>
<a name="0806046000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady raised the issue
of sideways relief and the way it interacts with the ability of sole
traders and partnerships to claim it. I shall seek the
Committee&#146;s leave to withdraw the amendment so that I can
consider the issue and talk to others outside the House about it. She
has not, however, answered the question about reform to the R and D tax
credit regime. If there is abuse on the scale and of the order that she
talks about, the Government should table amendments to the R and D tax
credit regime similarly to exclude partnerships and sole traders, but I
have not seen any sign of such activity. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.</div>
<a name="0806046000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<a name="0806046000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000471"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 214, in
schedule 25, page 301, line 39, leave
out &#145;19%&#146; and insert
&#145;20%&#146;.</div><a name="0806046000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment; it will not take me a moment to make the point.
The amendment seeks to alter the payable rate of credit from 19 per
cent. to  20 per cent. There is no particular magic about
the  20 per cent. rate, other than that, conveniently, it was
the small companies rate before the proposals to increase it still
further. We cannot see any magic about 19 per cent. Perhaps there is a
complex calculation that shows why the payable credit has been set at
that level. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div>It is not, after all, the main rate of corporation tax, it is no longer
the small companies rate, and it is not the capital gains rate or any
rate that I am aware of. It may be the VAT rate in one or two European
countries, but what is the logic of 19 per cent? How was it calculated,
and how was it arrived at?</div>
<a name="0806046000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000472"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It may help if I explain why the Government have
set the rate of credit at 19 per cent., which is essentially what the
hon. Gentleman asked.</div>
<a name="0806046000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with the R and D tax credit,
first-year tax credits are intended to help loss-making companies by
delivering the benefit of the tax relief provided by enhanced capital
allowances earlier than they would otherwise receive them, because of
their loss-making status. Reflecting the time value of money,
and&#151;this is the balance in setting the rate&#151;the fact that
we do not wish to incentivise companies to be loss-making, because it
would result in all sorts of negative behavioural consequences as I am
sure the hon. Gentleman agrees, we discount the rate at which the
credit is given to loss-makers. That is the first thing: it must be
less than the credit that would be delivered to those making a
profit.</div> <a name="0806046000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
based on how long a company, on average, makes a loss before it turns a
profit as a start-up, 19 per cent. is a generous rate of allowance for
companies paying the small companies rate of tax. It was decided upon
by undertaking research to find out how long in general start-up
companies take to get into profit, analysing how it works and knowing
that it must be below 20 per cent. so that we do not incentivise actual
loss making. Nineteen per cent. is above the amount of credit that
would be implied by taking a value of the time aspect of money for cash
flow, which would make it
generous.</div>
<a name="0806046000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="0806046000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
balance between recognising that in future the rates of tax might
change and recognising that the generosity of relief to loss makers and
profit makers might shift. The hon. Gentleman might notice that we have
taken up the question of how to vary the rate of the credit in future
years. However, the key balance is to ensure that we do not reward loss
makers to the same degree as profit makers.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000473"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her
explanation. The 19 per cent. figure is not quite as generous as she
was making out because it has to be set against the intended rate
rather than the previous rate of small companies&#146; tax. She has
provided the Committee with an explanation of why the Government have
arrived at 19 per cent. and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.</div>
<a name="0806046000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000474"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 210, in
schedule 25, page 302, line 18, after
&#145;machinery)&#146;, insert</div>
<a name="08060433000002"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;or section 45D (expenditure on
cars with low carbon dioxide emissions) or section 45E (expenditure on
plant and machinery for gas refuelling stations) or section 45F
(expenditure on plant and machinery for use wholly in a ring-fence
trade)&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div><a name="0806046000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, this is
a probing amendment and offers the Minister the opportunity to explain
why payable tax credits are limited to expenditure qualifying by virtue
of section 45A of the Capital Allowances Act 2001, which relates to
energy-saving plant and machinery and section 45H, which relates to
environmentally beneficial plant and machinery. The Capital Allowances
Act 2001 also provides for first-year qualifying expenditure to be
incurred in other areas. For example, section 45D provides for
expenditure on cars with low carbon dioxide emissions, which is the
subject we have just been discussing. Section 45E provides for
expenditure on plant and machinery for gas refuelling stations and
section 45F provides for expenditure on plant and machinery for use
wholly in a ring-fenced trade.</div>
<a name="0806046000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, all of those areas qualify for enhanced capital
allowances. When the Minister made her introductory comments, she
explained that enhanced capital allowances were not usable by
loss-making companies. In order to incentivise start-up businesses in
particular and companies that are not profitable and thus not able to
benefit from enhanced capital allowances in general, a payable credit
was introduced. Nowhere has she explained why the payable credit is
available only for expenditure qualifying under sections 45A and 45H.
This probing amendment therefore would insert provisions for the
qualification to extend to qualifying expenditure by virtue of sections
45D, 45E and 45F. Perhaps the Minister could explain the logic behind
the restrictive approach of the
Government.</div><a name="0806046000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000475"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The amendment would extend the availability of
first-year tax credits so that expenditure on cars with low carbon
dioxide emissions, plant and machinery for gas refuelling stations, and
plant and machinery for use in wholly ring-fenced trades would
qualify.</div><a name="0806046000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
some expenditure currently qualifies for the first-year allowances, the
Government&#146;s intention has always been clear: to support
investment by loss-making businesses and environmentally beneficial and
energy-saving technologies. Enhanced capital allowances were only
extended to low carbon emission cars and gas refuelling stations
temporarily to incentivise take-up of those technologies. Through ECAs,
energy and water saving technology is a permanent feature of the
capital allowances code. Energy-saving and water-saving technologies
tend to be more expensive than comparable equipment that is not
environmentally-friendly and tax incentives are intended to compensate
for that.</div> <a name="0806046000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government expect the chief beneficiaries of first-year tax credits to
be start-up businesses seeking to ensure that their carbon footprint,
and water and energy usage is reduced. It does not therefore make sense
to extend this to the purchase of vehicles, particularly because low
emission vehicles also benefit from other tax relief&#151;namely, the
reduced vehicle emissions duty and reduced company car
tax.</div><a name="0806046000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman said that this is a probing amendment, but he seems to
want to extend first-year tax credits to all plant and machinery used
by North sea oil companies. That is an unnecessary incentive given that
the Finance Act 2006 made a change that indexes forward losses
attributable to capital allowances, which will provide up to 42 per
cent. more relief than was previously available. The hon. Gentleman
will know 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 475</div>that the tax regime for North sea oil is different, and is wholly
appropriate to what is a particular area of activity. I presume that he
supports the ring-fencing of the North sea oil regime. Taken together,
the extensions suggested in the probing amendment would cost 
&#163;100 million, which is several times the current estimate of the
cost of first-year tax credits. So I hope that with those explanations
the hon. Gentleman will assume that the Government&#146;s intentions
have been probed, and that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0806046000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000476"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I accept the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s point
on equipment for use in a ring-fenced trade. We will come to petroleum
revenue tax later in the Committee, and can address those issues then.
All I did was to take the areas that are eligible for enhanced capital
allowances but which were not included in the payable tax credit. I
understand what the hon. Lady says, but in her introduction she
suggested that this was simply a measure to deal with the situation
where enhanced capital allowances were currently of no use to
companies, to ensure that they could benefit from them. She said a few
moments ago that she did not want to extend the allowances to low
carbon dioxide emission cars, because this was only ever a temporary
arrangement. We have just debated a clause in which she extends that
temporary arrangement by another five years to 2013. I would have
thought that investing in the cleanest&#151;to quote her
phrase&#151;car was indeed an investment in environmentally-friendly
technology.</div><a name="0806046000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000477"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman is aware that there are generous
tax allowances&#151;which we have just debated&#151;for those
businesses that wish to purchase the lowest-emitting cars, but this is
another area of assistance, which includes payments for tax credits.
Just because there is one incentive in one place in the tax system for
a car, that does not mean that we should extend all other sustainable
incentives to cars. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman could
accept that the car issue is being dealt with in that instance, and
that here we are dealing with energy efficiency and water-efficient
infrastructure.</div><a name="0806046000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000478"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Exchequer Secretary is wrong that there are
provisions elsewhere. She is referring to clause 74 on energy-efficient
cars. The point is that the cars covered by clause 74 may attract
enhanced capital allowances, but in these
circumstances&#151;companies that are not profitable&#151;the cars
will be of no value to them. That is precisely why the hon. Lady is
introducing the payable tax credit. As she says, the Government have
been truly probed and we have understood something of the Exchequer
Secretary&#146;s thinking. I am not sure whether Committee members
will consider that thinking entirely logical, but at least we have an
explanation of it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0806046000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000479"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 211, in
schedule 25, page 302, line 20, leave
out &#145;2013&#146; and insert &#145;2018&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div><a name="0806046000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is another probing
amendment: why is the cut-off date for the payable tax credit set at
2013? There was no mention of a cut-off date in the draft legislation
that was issued with the technical note for consultation, but 2013
appeared in the published Bill. I have no particular attachment to the
2018 date, but I want to understand the rationale for the 2013 date
being in the Bill&#151;rather than leaving the regime as an
open-ended one that the Government could change at any
time&#151;especially as there was no consultation on the proposal to
include an end
date.</div><a name="0806046000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000480"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The intention of the date is to create a structure
whereby we can assess&#151;when we get there&#151;how effective the
system has been and whether it needs to be reviewed, changed, rolled
forward or abandoned. Part of that is about evaluating the
effectiveness of policy. The thinking behind the 2013 date is that it
creates an appropriate time by which the system could be up and running
and gives us time to assess the effect that it is having so we can
return to it and consider whether to extend it further, roll it forward
or abandon it. It is about assessment. The feeling was that setting the
date at 2013 provided the right time scale within which to carry out a
reasonable assessment of how well the system was working, whether it
was giving value for money and whether it merited being continued or
changed.</div><a name="0806046000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000481"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Can the Minister explain precisely how this will
operate procedurally? If, as is being suggested, the period will come
to an end in March 2013, is she suggesting that the process will go
ahead up to the Budget in 2013, whereupon it will immediately be
extended or not extended and therefore got rid of? Is that period
sufficient? I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge had in mind that the regime looking at the credits should be
extended over a slightly longer period&#151;perhaps 10
years&#151;during which the  10 per cent. annual write-offs,
which we discussed this morning in relation to similar allowances,
could be considered. I am interested in how the Minister envisages the
provision being put in place procedurally and what the process will be,
because realistically, for decisions to be made, we are talking
effectively about a two or three-year process, whereupon 2013 will
shortly be  upon
us.</div><a name="0806046000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000482"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The intention is to see how the new system works,
how it beds in and what effect it has. Hopefully, it will have a
positive effect. I believe that that will be so, but we have to
consider the evidence. As 2013 approaches, we will have evidence and we
will be in possession of some facts about how many credits have been
paid, and what they have achieved in reality in terms of ensuring that
more energy and water efficient infrastructure has been bought and
installed in the economy. We will also be able to assess the value and
usefulness of the expenditures implied by the tax credit being
paid.</div><a name="0806046000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that,
as is usual in the assessment of the effectiveness of particular
credits and policy, there will be calls for evidence and consultations
with those who have used the credit. Then we will be able to have a
debate about whether the policy needs tweaking or changing or whether
it has served a useful purpose. All of that will take place in good
time so that a useful 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column477" />Column number: 477</div>policy will not be ended suddenly. Officials are well aware of the time
scales set in the Bill and will be able to work with those and make a
seamless transition to a deepening scheme of even greater effectiveness
or to a policy decision that the scheme has achieved its useful
purposes, whereupon it will be taken and it will be dealt with
accordingly.</div><a name="0806046000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is too
early to say, other than in theory, but there is no particular problem
with 2013 as a date: it provides time for the scheme to bed in, for
people to get used to using it, for officials to assess how it is
working and for there to be good evidence of its working. At the
appropriate time, decisions on future structures will be arrived at
sensibly.</div><a name="0806046000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000483"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Given that the Government make a great play of
their commitment to environmental taxes and environmental changes in
respect of the behaviour of individuals and businesses and talk readily
about how we have to plan for a considerably longer period ahead, up to
2050, it is a little bit curious that such a short period is allowed
here. No time restriction is needed in the schedule. Obviously, a
future Finance Bill could make amendments if there were concerns about
the way in which the provision was operating at some point in the
middle of the next decade. It is slightly curious that everything is
being talked of in terms of targets for 2020 or for 2050, yet in this
regard it is a relatively short period of time in which there will be
direct scrutiny of whether these particular allowances are
working.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000484"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> There are other examples of such allowances being
introduced for five years, assessed and then rolled forward or not.
Clause 75, on gas refuelling stations, was for a five-year period
initially to see how effective it was. After sufficient evidence had
been gathered there was a power to extend it and there is a power to
extend this. I do not think that it is an issue that should unduly
worry the Committee.</div>
<a name="0806046000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000485"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her
explanation&#151;in fact, I rather agree with her. I am rather in
favour of sunset clauses in general. But I cannot help noticing that
she seems to think that they are a good idea where provisions introduce
concessions to the taxpayer, and my experience in Committee has been
that Government are rather more resistant to sunset clauses when the
boot is on the other foot. I would be happy to agree that most things
in this Finance Bill should have a 2013 sunset
clause&#151;</div><a name="0806046000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000486"></a>Angela

tax?</div>
<a name="0806046000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000487"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> &#151;that way the Government have to do all
the good things that the Minister talked about: evaluating how it is
working, ensuring that there are not unintended consequences and seeing
if it needs tweaking to work better. A sunset clause would be a good
idea with many
innovations.</div><a name="0806046000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said, from a sedentary position, &#147;Does that include
income tax?&#148;&#151;no, of course not. I am talking about
innovations; new ideas. Later in Committee we might suggest that
sweeping new powers for HMRC to enter premises should be time-limited,
so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column478" />Column number: 478</div>that we can evaluate how they have worked. It is a very good idea in

Hammond:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 208, in
schedule 25, page 307, line 14, after
&#145;tax&#146;, insert &#145;that is due and
payable&#146;.</div><a name="0806046000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000489"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 209, in schedule 25, page 307, line 23, leave out from

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000490"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Paragraph 18 of the new schedule provides for
HMRC to make payments in respect of first-year payable tax credits
claimed by companies. Payments are to be made when inquiries into a
company&#146;s tax return are completed. There is also a provision
that enables HMRC effectively to set off payable tax credits against
corporate tax payments due from the taxpayer and, equally, to make
provisional payments in respect of payable tax credits&#151;I assume
that that is where inquiries are ongoing&#151;where the final
corporate tax obligations of the taxpayer are not yet resolved, and
thus there may be some need in the future to offset some element of
corporation
tax.</div><a name="0806046000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 208
simply seeks to clarify that only tax due and payable can be set off
against payable tax credits. That will ensure that HMRC cannot withhold
payable tax credits against a future liability to corporation tax that
will become due at a point in the future in respect of a later
chargeable period. I hope that that was always the intention and that
the Minister can accept that the words &#147;due and payable&#148;
simply clarify that
intention.</div><a name="0806046000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 209 seeks to clarify the situation with regard to provisional
payments on account of first-year tax credits. As drafted, the
legislation&#151;as we have so often seen elsewhere&#151;gives HMRC
absolute discretion on the payment of provisional tax credits. The
amendment would make it clear that the amount paid provisionally has to
be &#147;just and reasonable&#148;. I was happy to hear, earlier in
our proceedings, the Exchequer Secretary saying that &#147;just and
reasonable&#148; is a well established term in the tax statutes. I
think she said that it occurred 72 or some other large number of times
throughout tax legislation&#151;she read that out this morning. All
we are seeking to do is to ensure that HMRC&#146;s behaviour in
relation to provisional payments of payable tax credits is just and
reasonable. That is an appropriate restriction on HMRC&#146;s
discretion and I hope that the Minister will
agree.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000491"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The amendments would change the rules for how a
first-year tax credit can be set off against other tax liabilities and
impact on the discretion that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs
has to make a payment when an inquiry has been opened into a tax 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column479" />Column number: 479</div>return. I do not believe that the Opposition&#146;s amendments are
necessary. The Government have based the design of the first-year tax
credits on the successful research and development tax credits for
small and medium-sized enterprises. The two subsections that the
amendments would change are mirrored in the R and D tax credit
legislation, and the Government have not received any representations
from business that those conditions would benefit from being
changed.</div><a name="0806046000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
amendment would limit the scope of paragraph 18(2) by stipulating that
amounts payable in respect of first-year tax credits, or interest on
such credits, can be used to discharge only those corporation tax
liabilities that are &#147;due and payable&#148;. However, those
additional words will have no effect, because paragraph 18(2) is
drafted in terms of discharging liability to pay tax, not liability
pure and simple. The provision would not allow for the tax credit to be
set off against expected liabilities in any case; it could be set off
only against crystallised liabilities to pay. In effect, therefore,
liability to pay is just another way of saying that the corporation tax
must be due and payable. So the additional words are
unnecessary.</div><a name="0806046000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the second amendment, HMRC is under no obligation to make a payment
where an inquiry is ongoing, but in the interests of providing support
to business where possible, HMRC can use its discretion to make
payments, for example, on the elements of the claim about which it is
happy, while the inquiry is still open. The amendment would change the
basis on which HMRC may make such provisional payments to require it to
make provisional payment on a &#147;just and reasonable&#148;
basis. Given that HMRC is under no obligation to pay, and does so at
its discretion in order to be as helpful as possible to the taxpayer
concerned, the amendment would undermine the beneficial feature of the
legislation and might&#151;paradoxically&#151;lead to HMRC deciding
that it will not make any payments at its discretion, to avoid being
challenged in court. I urge the Committee to reject those unnecessary
amendments.</div><a name="0806046000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000492"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> On the first amendment, the Minister has
clarified the intention. She says that the amendment is
unnecessary&#151;whether or not it is, she has clarified the point,
so I am grateful to her. I am rather less happy about her response to
amendment No. 209. I would have thought that HMRC would always be
expected to act justly and reasonably. Frankly, I did not care much for
her tone. She said that if we impose on HMRC an obligation to act
justly and reasonably, it might decide not to make any payments at all.
What is HMRC? We are Parliament. We make the decisions, and Ministers,
who are accountable to Parliament, ensure that they are carried out
properly. That is not the job of some unaccountable, invisible body
using its unfettered discretion in a fit of pique, because its
Parliament has sought to constrain it, and deciding that it will not
make any payments or implement the Government&#146;s
will.</div><a name="0806046000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000493"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman is going slightly
over the top, perhaps because we have been in Committee all day. I am
sure that he will agree that HMRC should not be put in a situation
where it should pay tax credits to companies that have not paid 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column480" />Column number: 480</div>corporation tax. His second amendment addresses a
situation in which HMRC is trying to be helpful to a business over
which an inquiry might be ongoing. In certain circumstances, if it is
happy with bits of the tax payments or liabilities, it can make
payments. His amendment would make that not discretionary, but subject
to &#147;just and reasonable&#148; clauses, which could be
challenged in a court. That seems unreasonable given that HMRC cannot
make tax credit payments to organisations that might have outstanding
liabilities against which they can offset tax credit liabilities. That
is perfectly reasonable in my
view.</div><a name="0806046000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000494"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The hon. Lady&#146;s position appears to be
that it would be outrageous if HMRC was subject to any oversight from a
court of its
behaviour.</div><a name="0806046000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000495"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> That is not what I said. Do not be
ridiculous.</div><a name="0806046000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000496"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I think that if the hon. Lady reads the record,
she will see that that is exactly what she said. She said that HMRC
must be completely unfettered in the use of its discretion to make such
payments as it thinks fit. In contrast, under amendment No. 209 it
would make payment on a provisional loss of such amount as is
&#147;just and reasonable&#148;. Should the courts ever become
involved in looking at what is just and reasonable, I think that they
would take into account an ongoing HMRC inquiry. They would hopefully
look at the amount that should be paid in the light of
that.</div><a name="0806046000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are merely
seeking to establish the principle that HMRC should not have areas of
unfettered discretion in this way that could thwart the will of
Parliament and the intention of the Government. I thought that
amendment No. 209 was entirely unexceptionable. I thought that the
Exchequer Secretary was going to bob up and say that it was completely
unnecessary because there is a long-established principle that HMRC, as
with any Government body, always has to act in a way that is just and
reasonable because it is subject to judicial review.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Now she is saying that it is. A
few moments ago she told us that she did not think that it was at all
reasonable for HMRC to be subject to the oversight of the
courts.</div><a name="0806046000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000497"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman should not put such ridiculous
words in my mouth. I was talking about a context in which a tax credit
claim is outstanding and where there is an inquiry into whether an
organisation has paid its corporation tax. I said that in order to be
helpful, HMRC should be able to make payments in areas of the tax
return that it is happy with. That is the context for this discussion
and it is not any wider  than
that.</div><a name="0806046000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman should not seek to put words in my mouth and widen the
context. This is a very narrow context based on what is the perfectly
reasonable premise that HMRC should not be forced to pay tax credits to
companies when it is not satisfied that they have paid their
corporation tax liabilities and that tax credits can be kept aside to
cover corporation tax liabilities in the event of an ongoing inquiry
that may discover outstanding corporation tax liabilities. That seems
perfectly reasonable to me and the hon. Gentleman should stop
hyperventilating and putting words in my mouth in an attempt to widen
the context when I am making very specific
comments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 481</div><a name="0806046000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000498"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> That was a very long intervention, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="0806046000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000499"></a>The
Chairman:</b>
Clarification.</div><a name="0806046000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000500"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> As it stands, the schedule
says:</div><a name="0806046000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In those
circumstances HMRC may make a payment on a provisional basis of such
amount as it thinks
fit.&#148;</div><a name="0806046000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">As amended, it would
read:</div><a name="0806046000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In those
circumstances HMRC may make a payment on a provisional basis of such
amount as is just and
reasonable.&#148;</div><a name="0806046000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest
that all of the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns would be properly taken
into account in determining what is just and reasonable. HMRC would
still have discretion, but it would be a discretion fettered by a
requirement to behave in a way that was just and
reasonable.</div><a name="0806046000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
I was expecting the hon. Lady&#146;s response to be that the
amendments were unnecessary because HMRC always would behave in a way
that was just and reasonable and by long-established principle would be
subject to the intervention of a court if it did not. She has not
chosen to go down that route, but has decided to go down one that says
that HMRC must have unfettered
discretion.</div><a name="0806046000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am disappointed that in this group of amendments, we have had a
perfectly satisfactory answer to amendment No. 208 and a very
unsatisfactory answer to amendment No. 209. I tabled the amendments as
probing amendments, but I am not happy with the answer that the
Exchequer Secretary has given to amendment No.
209.</div><a name="0806046000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000501"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I urge my hon. Friend, if possible, to put this
matter to a vote. It is an extraordinary explanation that, if we insert
&#147;just and reasonable&#148;, HMRC will have a hissy fit and not
make any payments at all.  That is a remarkable statement from
the Exchequer
Secretary.</div><a name="0806046000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000502"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister is smiling, but when she reads the
record she will understand what my hon. Friend means. She may perhaps
not have intended to say what she did
say.</div><a name="0806046000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="0806046000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000503"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman finishes, perhaps I can
help him even further. What he is arguing is that there should be a
just and reasonable test for what is currently at the discretion of
HMRC. Its discretion in what is meant to be a helpful
activity&#151;if there is an inquiry ongoing and HMRC is happy with
one part of the tax return, it might make a tax credit payment rather
than not do so&#151;is turned by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment into something that can be tested in the courts using the
&#147;just and reasonable&#148; structure.</div>
<a name="0806046000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">A just and reasonable
provisional payment has to reflect the ongoing inquiry and therefore
prejudge the issue under consideration. I am not sure that a judge
would wish to be asked to make that judgment while an inquiry was
ongoing. If companies received payments before their final tax position
was calculated, were able to request a payment on account and were then
overpaid tax credits, HMRC would need to make a specific assessment to
recover the overpayment, which would make the mechanics of the system
even more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 482</div>cumbersome and turn a provision that is meant to be helpful into
something different.</div><a name="0806046000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that his amendment creates
those kinds of problems, and turns what is meant to be
helpful&#151;</div><a name="0806046000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000504"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Is this an
intervention?</div><a name="0806046000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000505"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I was attempting to be helpful before the hon.
Gentleman put his amendment to the vote. If he does not like the
explanation I have given, he knows what he has to do about
it.</div><a name="0806046000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000506"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> With respect, I am not surprised that officials
would give the Minister the kind of briefing she has just read out. If
I were doing their job, I would prefer not to be subject to any kind of
oversight, rather than to be subject to it. She now appears to be
arguing that the courts could not decide what was just and reasonable,
but HMRC can. That does not strike us as very reasonable. As I
understand it, the amendment would require that, when a payment is to
be made, the amount of such payment is the just and reasonable amount.
I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 208, but I would seek your
permission, Sir Nicholas, to press amendment No. 209 to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000540"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Paragraphs 24 and 25 of proposed new schedule A1,
which will be inserted in the Capital Allowances Act 2001, set out the
circumstances in which the payable tax credit must be repaid. If there
is a disposal within four years, part or all of the credit will be
clawed back. One would clearly expect such a provision in legislation
of this type. However, as drafted, the clawback will catch intra-group
transfers where ownership of an asset changes, but a continuity of
business provision applies: in other words, a transfer subject to
section 343 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, where the
legal owner of the asset changes but the beneficial ownership and
control on an intra-group transfer does not.</div>
<a name="0806046000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest that
it is inappropriate to claw back payable tax credits simply because the
ownership of the asset has shifted within a group of companies where a
continuity of business provision is in effect. Proposed new paragraphs
25(5)(a) and 25(7)(a) already deal with situations in which assets are
disposed of at arm&#146;s length. Sub-paragraphs (5)(b) and (7)(b)
deal only with transfers intra-group, which are subject to the
provisions in section 343 of ICTA 1988. The amendments would delete
those two sub-paragraphs and sub-paragraph (8), which provides a
definition, so that there will be no clawback where the transfer of
ownership of the asset is an intra-group transfer and the business
continuity provisions of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988
apply.</div> <a name="0806046000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Exchequer Secretary is not prepared to accept the amendment, can she
explain what risk to the Exchequer needs to be dealt with in this
regard? It is not obvious that there is any scope for abuse or
avoidance created by excluding intra-group transfers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>from the clawback provisions. Our concern is that corporate
reorganisations will be unnecessarily inhibited, but obviously if there
is a serious avoidance issue, we will be pleased to hear what that is
from her and certainly give it proper
consideration.</div><a name="0806046000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000541"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I hope that I can explain the avoidance potential
and persuade the hon. Gentleman not to push his amendment, which seeks
to undermine the effectiveness of the clawback mechanism included in
the first-year tax credit regime. That mechanism is intended to protect
the Exchequer by preventing a business from claiming first-year tax
credits for an asset and then immediately selling it on. Where a
company sells an asset that has been subject to a tax credit claim
within the clawback period, we will potentially claw back, by means of
an assessment, any tax credits paid. However, the company will be able
to keep the tax credits that relate to any loss made on the disposal of
an asset. If the asset is scrapped, there will be no
clawback.</div> <a name="0806046000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would withdraw the potential for a clawback of first-year
tax credits where a company transfers an asset as part of the transfer
of a trade and one of the continuity of business provisions
applies&#151;in other words, intra-company transfers. The continuity
of business provisions state that in certain circumstances where an
asset is transferred from one company to another as part of the
transfer of a trade, transfer of the asset is ignored as a disposal
event for capital allowance purposes. The result is that the successor
company gets the same capital allowance and charges as the predecessor
company would have done if it had continued to carry on the
trade.</div>
<a name="0806046000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, such
an asset transfer must be treated as the disposal of the asset for
first-year tax credit purposes and the clawback will be considered if
the asset transfer took place within the clawback period. Without such
a provision, the company could easily avoid a clawback charge by
transferring the asset with its trade to a new company in the same
group. The successor could then immediately sell the asset without
being subject to a clawback charge, as it had not received a tax credit
in the first place. The amendment would therefore undermine the
integrity of the first-year tax credit regime, so I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will agree that there is a potential problem here and
withdraw his amendment as a result of my
explanation.</div><a name="0806046000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000542"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady. She has given an
example in which a tax-avoidance ruse could be introduced. It strikes
me that another way of dealing with this, which would avoid any
impediment to ordinary corporate reconstruction or reallocation of
assets within a group, would be to ensure that the clawback provision
persisted so that the potential for clawback was not only on the first
transfer, but persisted for future transfers. I think that she was
saying that, if a transfer were made without clawback, a future
transfer outside the group would not be subject to clawback, which
would give rise to a potential for avoidance.</div>
<a name="0806046000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to accept the hon.
Lady&#146;s point, as she makes a good case against the amendment as
it is drafted, but I would prefer the solution to be in provisions that
allowed the clawback ability to persist and endure beyond the first
transfer. That way, so long 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 485</div>as transfers were made intra-group, they would be okay, but if one were
subsequently made outside the group, the clawback would be applied to
the transferee within the group who had received the transfer of the
asset from the original company that received the payable
credit.</div> <a name="0806046000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
pursue that at this stage, because that is clearly an issue of
substance, but I think that I have a difference with the Exchequer
Secretary over how best to address the avoidance concern. I want to go
back and check how significant the concern about inhibiting intra-group
transfers really is, and whether it is something that we need to ask
the Government to look at again on Report. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="0806046000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000543"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I have one additional point that was not
contained in any amendment. That is because it was drawn to my
attention too late and because when amendments are tabled, Sir
Nicholas, it gives Ministers too much notice. It is always good to have
one that they do not have notice of so that we can see how they do.
&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">] </i>It will be the Financial

<a name="0806046000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister tell the
Committee how the upper limit for payable first year tax credits, which
is set at the higher rate of &#163;250,000, and taxpayers PAYE plus
the NIC contributions bill, interacts with payable R and D tax credits?
That is a simple question. Can she confirm that, if a company has
claimed R and D tax credits, the full upper limit for payable first
year tax credits would still be available to it&#151;there is no
offsetting of one against the other, it does not use up its entitlement
to first year tax credits if it has already claimed payable R and D
credits?</div>

Break.</div><a name="0806046000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000550"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> My hon. Friend suggests &#147;break&#148; as
an alternative, during which, I have no doubt, you worked extremely
hard in the interests of your constituents and of the Committee,
scrutinising the amendments being tabled and selecting those suitable
for consideration. It is a pleasure to be here under your
chairmanship.</div> <a name="0806046000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is in my name, but perhaps it would be helpful to the
Committee for us to have a slightly wider discussion about the purpose
of the clause. Clause 78 builds on the simplification provided by the
introduction of the annual investment allowance. It delivers a further
simplification of the capital allowances scheme, which will be of
particular benefit to the smallest businesses, although I know that
Opposition Members do not share that view.</div>
<a name="0806046000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure is a direct response
to suggestions made during consultation on the capital allowances
reforms over the past year. It will enable businesses to accelerate the
tax relief that they receive by claiming and writing down the allowance
for all of their unrelieved capital expenditure on plant and machinery,
where the unrelieved expenditure in either or both their main and
special rate pools does not exceed &#163;1,000. As businesses will no
longer have to calculate writing down allowances on very small balances
each year, that will result in a significant administrative burden
saving, provide a modest cash flow boost and encourage further
investment. The introduction of the measure will enable businesses to
write off 536,000 main rate pools and 600 special rate pools in the
first year. Allowing pools to be written off in this way avoids the
need to write down pools over a very long periods, in some cases beyond
the economic life of the asset. It is therefore in line with the wider
principle of aligning capital allowances to the economic life of the
asset.</div> <a name="0806046000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">After the
Finance Bill was published we received further representations to the
effect that the small pools limit should be kept under regular review,
and amended as and when appropriate. Both the Opposition&#146;s
amendment and our amendment seek to respond to those representations.
They both introduce a Treasury power into clause 78, enabling the small
pools limit to be varied by secondary legislation. The difference
between the two approaches, and the reason I ask the Committee to
reject the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment&#151;unless it is a
probing one&#151;is the flexibility that that power
provides.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column487" />Column number: 487</div><a name="0806046000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition&#146;s suggested power only allows the increase of the
small pools limit. I think that I understand why the hon. Gentleman
suggests that. Our amendment mirrors our approach in other clauses in
this part of the Bill. It allows us to increase or decrease the limit.
However, I agree with Opposition Members that it is much more likely
that the limit will be increased. It may be, however, that wider
economic circumstances and the benefits of the AIA mean that in future
years a lower limit would achieve the same benefit to business. It is
also possible that in the face of abuse, the Government of the day may
wish to reduce the limit. I believe, therefore, that the Opposition
amendment would tie the hands of a Government wishing to react to the
evidence and changing circumstances in the most appropriate way. That
is the purpose of our amendment and that is why I think that it is
preferable to that of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, but
I would be interested to hear what he has to
say.</div><a name="0806046000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000551"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Financial Secretary has set out the case for
both my amendment and for hers. I was fascinated by the fact that she
knows that there are 536,000 main rate pools that will be written off
by the amendment. It is interesting that somebody at the Treasury or
HMRC is counting them. I am wondering how they would get the figure.
Presumably they would have to go into the individual tax computations,
look at the pools and assess how many of them were above or below
&#163;1,000. I do not want to dismay any officials in the room, but I
am minded that Sir Peter Gershon might be interested that somebody has
been going through all the returns and checking how many pools there
are below
&#163;1,000.</div><a name="0806046000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000552"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that
I am told that 618,000 businesses have main pools of between &#163;1
and
&#163;1,000.</div><a name="0806046000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000553"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I apologise. I thought that the right hon. Lady
said 536,000. In her opening remarks she must have given a different
figure. There are clearly two people in HMRC counting pools, or perhaps
more than two people. Perhaps it is more than one-man-year&#146;s
worth of work, but valuable work it
is.</div><a name="0806046000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial
Secretary has essentially made the case. We have a difference of view.
We think that this is a good measure; we support the underlying measure
in clause 78. However, it is a shame that the Government have spoiled
it by seeking to take a power that would allow them to reduce the
&#163;1,000 cap on small pools that can be written
off.</div><a name="0806046000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is entirely reasonable to take a power to allow the cap to be
increased. As I said earlier&#151;I believe that the Financial
Secretary was not in the room&#151;we understand that it would not be
appropriate to index, to have a tedious indexing of small amounts every
year. However, we would welcome an assurance from the Financial
Secretary that the Government&#146;s intention was to periodically
uprate the cap so that it rose broadly in line with inflation. If we
gave the Government power by order to cut the cap, effectively to
nullify a measure that Parliament had agreed, the right hon. Lady could
cut it to &#163;50 or &#163;20, removing much of its benefit. That
is why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column488" />Column number: 488</div>we sought to ensure that this was an upward-only
revising provision. I accept that the Government amendment is
necessary. Our amendment would have been preferable, but I am not about
to ask my hon. Friends&#151;all three of them&#151;to vote against
the Government amendment. I hope that the Minister will reflect on my
comments.</div><a name="0806046000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

apply in circumstances when an election is made under paragraph 16 of
schedule 26, as an election under paragraph 16 can be made only at tax
written-down value? Section 198 of the 2001 Act is an election to
apportion sale price on the sale of a qualifying interest. I should be

works. I am sure that she is briefed on such an issue because it was

Kennedy:</b> Schedule 26 introduces the new chapter to the
Capital Allowances Act 2001 that defines all expenditure and long-life
assets, integral features and thermal insulation as we discussed
earlier, and special rate expenditure. It brings into effect the new
special rate pool and sets the rate of writing-down allowance for
special rate expenditure at 10 per cent. It preserves the North sea
fiscal regime but, as a result of changes introduced by clause 103 that
relates also to the North sea, the hon. Gentleman says that I should
have briefing on his specific question. It is part of the blood sport
of such Committees for the Opposition to find weaknesses in the
briefing of Ministers. I do not have a specific answer to his detailed
question, but I undertake to find out the answer, write to him and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000560"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b><b class="B"> </b>I shall make substantive comments in the
clause stand part debate, but I just want to refer now to a narrow,
drafting issue. Amendment No. 194 deals with the issue in a slightly
different way. Amendment No. 217 would leave out subsections (3) and
(4). The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Taunton only seeks to
leave out subsection (3), for some reason which he will no doubt
explain.</div> <a name="0806046000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
question of understanding the clause a little better. We believe that
subsections (2) and (3) are redundant. Subsection (1) says that
industrial buildings allowances and agricultural buildings allowances
do not apply after the relevant date, which is provided in subsection
(4) as a date in 2011. Having established that IBAs and ABAs will not
apply after a date in 2011, why is there then a need in subsection (2)
to abolish the provisions that introduced IBAs and ABAs&#151;in other
words, to make it as though they never existed? Why effect that
abolition only from the relevant date in subsection
(3)?</div>
<a name="0806046000378"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

to make no difference at all if subsections (2) and (3) are removed

already have the longest tax code in the world, and we do not want to
make it unnecessarily longer&#151;even by two subsections. We can
deal with this matter perfectly adequately simply with subsections (1)
and (4).</div>

the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000562"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> We are clearly going to have a debate of some
substance on clause stand part, so I will reserve my more general
comments for that. The amendments tabled by both Conservative and
Liberal Democrat members of the Committee seek to apply the withdrawal
of IBAs and ABAs only to expenditure incurred after the relevant date,
which is to say 1 April or 6 April 2011. This means that anyone who
incurred expenditure on industrial or agricultural buildings up to 31
March or 5 April 2011 would still be able to claim the full amount of
IBAs or ABAs.</div>
<a name="0806046000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
clear to me why Conservative or Liberal Democrat Members would wish not
to apply the withdrawal to expenditure entered into in the knowledge
that IBAs and ABAs were being withdrawn&#151;that is, any time after
the announcement in 2007. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge
asked me a specific question 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 490</div>about subsections (2) and (3) and suggested they were redundant.
Subsection (1) applies to expenditure incurred after April 2011, and
subsections (2) and (3) remove the allowances for existing expenditure.
I am not sure whether that entirely answers his
question.</div><a name="0806046000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to expenditure before that point, just as corporation tax is an annual
tax, so IBAs and ABAs provide an annual entitlement to claim relief. It
is not therefore retrospective to repeal the entitlement to these
allowances, as has been argued. I and other Ministers have made clear
since the announcements in the 2007 Budget the reason for the
withdrawal of these allowances, which is to remove the distortion they
cause by giving tax relief selectively to certain sectors while leaving
other sectors completely unable to enjoy relief of this
nature.</div> <a name="0806046000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">That change
was part of the wider package we debated earlier today. Just 200
claimants claim 95 per cent. of the value of IBAs: the vast majority of
relief goes to companies, and only 6 per cent of the combined total is
claimed by the unincorporated. I will not go into the more general
points, which I wish to make in the clause stand part debate, but I
hope that I have dealt with the specific question asked by the hon.
Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge.</div><a name="0806046000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000563"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am not sure that the Financial Secretary has
answered my question, to be honest. Let us run through the logic of
this because she presents her argument in a reasonable way. Subsection
(1) says:</div><a name="0806046000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Parts
3 and 4 of CAA 2001...do not apply in relation to expenditure
incurred on or after the relevant
date.&#148;</div><a name="0806046000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">That date is in
April 2011. Therefore, parts 3 and 4 do not apply to any expenditure
incurred after April 2011. The Government want to ensure that any
money  spent after 2011 is not eligible for industrial and
agricultural buildings allowances, so the job is done in subsection
(1).</div><a name="0806046000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does
subsection (2) need to
say:</div><a name="0806046000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Omit those
Parts of that Act&#148;?</div><a name="0806046000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
does subsection (3) need to say not to omit those parts of the Act
until after April 2011 because doing so would mess up the whole
architecture? Why do we need to omit them at all when we have neutered
them in subsection (1)? We were probing to suggest that subsections (2)
and (3) were
redundant.</div><a name="0806046000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
worse things in tax law than redundancy. I was hoping that the
Financial Secretary might just say, &#147;Yeah, you&#146;re right.
This was pretty low-grade drafting. We don&#146;t need them.
We&#146;ll take them out. Thanks very much.&#148; She did not say
that. I will not detain the Committee by pressing the point, but I hope
that when she is sitting at home with a gin and tonic in her hand and
nothing better to do, she will read the clause again and consider
whether she needs an answer to this point.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Sorry, a tonic water. I beg to ask

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000564"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The clause provides for abolition of industrial
and agricultural buildings allowances. That decision was announced
without any prior consultation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>by the Government. Regardless of the merits of the substantive action,
the Government&#146;s precipitate action in relation to business
taxation has once again undermined the UK&#146;s reputation as a safe
and secure place to do business. I have thought about this quite a bit
and I do not believe that Ministers want to damage the UK&#146;s
business reputation. Therefore, I have to conclude that they simply do
not understand the way that business thinks and the way that it reacts
to this kind of surprise being sprung upon
it.</div><a name="0806046000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
business mentality is simple and straightforward, as you know, Sir
Nicholas. Businesses like certainty. Anything that undermines their
sense of certainty and their understanding of the direction of travel
in the environment in which they are operating is debilitating. In
practical terms, it increases the premium and the return that
businesses need to operate in that environment. Businesses operating in
an uncertain and unstable environment need a higher rate of return than
businesses operating in a stable and predictable
environment.</div><a name="0806046000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition&#146;s concerns relate not so much to the principle of the
abolition of the allowances. Our preference is well known for a
simplified system with fewer allowances and lower rates. Our concern is
over the handling of this matter. A huge degree of retrospectivity is
attached to the provisions of clause 81 and schedule 27. The abolition
of the allowances as part of a general simplification and reduction in
rates of taxation may be acceptable, but investment decisions have been
made on the basis that industrial and agricultural buildings allowances
are in place. The announcement of their abolition in the 2007 Budget
was too late for people who had committed to investment
decisions.</div> <a name="0806046000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will all
have in our minds the image of terminal 5 nearing completion at the
time of the 2007 Budget announcement. Frankly, that sudden change is
yet another nail in the coffin of Britain&#146;s reputation as a safe
and predictable place in which to do business. I ask the Minister to
imagine how she would feel if she had spent &#163;5 billion of her
savings constructing a building in anticipation of industrial buildings
allowance being available, only to be told just as the roof was going
on that this allowance was going to be scrapped. She would be pretty
cheesed off with the regime and she would be thinking very hard about
whether she wanted to make further investments on that basis.</div>
<a name="0806046000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is very important that when
Government do these things and when we in Parliament allow them to go
through, we do so with our eyes wide open. The package of measures that
we are considering in this Committee represents a significant shift in
the burden of taxation between sectors. The abolition of IBAs will hit
some sectors particularly hard. Airport operators are the most
prominent example of losers, but the accelerated rate of depreciation
on long-life assets will hugely benefit utility companies.</div>
<a name="0806046000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Britain&#146;s largest
airport operator, BAA faces the withdrawal of tax relief on investment
worth some  &#163;5 billion that the group has already made
on infrastructure assets at its seven UK airports. The Minister will
know that BAA is in the process of proposing to invest very substantial
further sums in Heathrow, which in its current state, as everyone in
this Committee would agree, is something of a national 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div>disgrace and yet another impediment to promoting Britain&#146;s
attractiveness as a place in which to do business. The creation of the
Heathrow east terminal complex very badly needs investment. The net
present value of the reduced post-tax cash flow implied by  the
abolition of IBAs to BAA alone is around  &#163;500 million.
Can the Minister tell us how such a move will impact on company balance
sheets under generally accepted accounting practice? Will companies
have to take a hit on their balance sheets to reflect the changed
anticipation of future tax liability as a result of these changes to
IBAs and ABAs? Will it show up on company balance
sheets?</div><a name="0806046000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
fully recognise that there will be lots of members of this
Committee&#151;I will not say listening because they are probably
not&#151;who might not be that inclined to feel sympathetic towards
BAA. I fear that such a view misses the point. This is not just about
BAA. It is about the signal that we are sending to any potential
large-scale infrastructure investor in the UK about the certainty of
the tax depreciation regime that they face. Investment decisions are
based on models using current and known tax regimes. Sudden and
effectively retrospective changes alter the returns that have been
predicted. That will impact on our ability to get private sector
investment into infrastructure projects in the
UK.</div><a name="0806046000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000565"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I have been listening and have sympathy with some of
the points that the hon. Gentleman makes. What would his optimum time
scale be for planning the sort of tax changes that he talks about? He
is not disputing the principle of simplification. He is arguing that it
needs to be planned over a longer period of time. What would his
recommended time scale
be?</div><a name="0806046000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000566"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> That is a sensible question, and I would like to
answer it. I do not have a prepared answer, but I will answer it on the
hoof. I will divide the question into two parts. In most cases, I would
say that a three-year cycle of signalling to business the
Government&#146;s intentions for the tax regime and then fleshing it
out a year or two in advance so that there can be a proper consultation
period is probably the right regime. I have said that in other places
and I will say it again today. Business would be hugely reassured by a
commitment to a three-year rolling programme. In each year&#146;s
pre-Budget report, the Chancellor could set out the general direction
in which he expects business taxation policy to travel over the coming
two or three years. In the following PBR he perhaps sets out some more
detailed proposals, which can then be consulted upon and brought into
concrete form in the PBR after that. That would be a constant rolling
process.</div><a name="0806046000379"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="0806046000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
different issue around large-scale, effectively Government-mandated
infrastructure. The terminal 5 project has been going on for decades.
Almost one of the first things that I did as a Member of Parliament was
to appear at the terminal 5 planning inquiry. We have only got the
thing open now. There is an issue about significantly impacted
companies and pieces of infrastructure needing to be the subject of
specific discussions between Government and the providers of those
pieces of infrastructure, to ensure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 493</div>not only that we do not have an unfair effect&#151;with respect to
BAA, it is tough out there&#151;but that we do not have an unintended
impact on future behaviour by that company or similar companies. We
will need other airport facilities in this country in the
future.</div><a name="0806046000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000567"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I do not want to prolong things with my colleagues,
but it is an interesting line of discussion. The nearest example of
something similar that I can think of at the moment is incentivising
development of major investments in the North sea, to take a further
phase&#151;that is a quasi-Government initiative, or potentially so.
That might raise some of the issues that the hon. Gentleman is talking
about.</div><a name="0806046000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000568"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument
is a good one. One can envisage such situations with railway or new
road infrastructure, if we are trying to encourage private companies,
as the Government have done with the M6 toll motorway for investment in
road infrastructure. Similar considerations would apply&#151;very
long payback periods for very durable pieces of
investment.</div><a name="0806046000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
think it gets worse. With regard to the airport infrastructure in
particular&#151;let us use that as an example&#151;it is going to
be about price. It is all very well to talk about the matter as if it
will be tough luck on BAA, but what happens when we withdraw an
available tax relief or defer its benefits? Deferring a relief in time
costs money. We will increase the cost of providing that infrastructure
in future. It will be end users who have to pay more. The incidence of
the tax change will ultimately fall on end users of publicly used
infrastructure such as
airports.</div><a name="0806046000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worse still, even with regard to existing, historic investment. BAA
is a regulated operator. It has a restriction on the rate of return
that it can earn on its capital base. I would like the Minister to
confirm to the Committee whether the abolition of IBAs&#151;thus, the
reduction of the tax relief that BAA will earn&#151;will have the
effect of increasing its regulated asset base. It seems to me that it
will, thus increasing the amount of income that the company is
permitted to earn from its regulated activities. If that is the case,
put in plain English, what that means in the case of a regulated
operator is that the abolition of IBAs, even in respect of past capex,
is not effectively a hit on the operator, but becomes a hit on its
customers. When travellers are facing fuel surcharges and the effects
of the currency markets&#146; verdict on the Government&#146;s
economic policies, that apparently non-consumer-related tax change
will, in the end, be paid for by the users of those regulated
infrastructure services. The users will have to pay higher charges in
order to deliver BAA and others the return on their regulated capital
base that is permitted under the terms of the operating licence. Would
the Minister please confirm whether that is correct, and that it is,
once again, the ordinary consumer&#151;one might say, the ordinary
voter&#151;who is going to pay for the tax
change?</div><a name="0806046000290"></a>

<a name="0806046000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000570"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the hon. Member for Taunton, who
speaks for the Liberal Democrats, let me say that I have now been in
the Chair for two and a half 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 494</div>hours. I understand that the Government and Opposition are seeking to
get to the end of clause 86. For my own good health, I would seek to
adjourn the Committee for a dinner or refreshment break. I am prepared
to go as late as 8 o&#146;clock, but I would then seek to adjourn for
three quarters of an hour. I merely offer that as advice to the
Committee, whose interest and mine I am taking into
account.</div><a name="0806046000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000571"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> This is my first opportunity to welcome you to the
Chair, Sir Nicholas&#151;just as you outline the timetable for
vacating it. While I make a few brief comments, perhaps the Whips for
the other parties could arrange a more civilised timetable for our
departure.</div>
<a name="0806046000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall speak
briefly to clause 81, on which I have received a number of
representations from interested parties. The hon. Member for Runnymede
and Weybridge has already outlined the principles underlying the
difficulties that many people have with the Government&#146;s
proposal. To sum up my position, I think that there is a genuine point
about a lack of consultation and, as a result, the retrospective nature
of the changes being put in place. They were sprung on those affected,
who could have had no reasonable expectation that they would be put in
place. There is also an issue of certainty&#151;or in this case, lack
of certainty&#151;about business planning decisions made over a
quarter of a century. The expectations and time scale that people have
in mind when making such investment decisions are long-term, and the
Treasury is acting on a completely different time scale, which changes
the approach that people would otherwise have taken had they known in
advance.</div><a name="0806046000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then, of
course, there is the absolute effect of the withdrawal itself. For
illustrative purposes, it is worth explaining to the Committee what the
impact will be. A person who made an investment of &#163;100,000 in
2006-07 would receive a &#163;4,000 allowance in 2006-07 and 2007-08.
After that, it would go down, on the graded scale put before us, to
&#163;3,000 in 2008-09, to &#163;2,000 in 2009-10, to &#163;1,000
in 2010-11, and that would be it&#151;the guillotine would fall. They
could claw back &#163;14,000 of their &#163;100,000, but
&#163;86,000&#151;at the cut-off point in April 2011&#151;would
remain unrelieved for tax purposes. It is not hard to see why many
people, who made that decision in good faith in the 2006-07 financial
year, with no expectation of any changes in the foreseeable future,
because no consultation took place, are aggrieved that 86 per cent. of
the relief that in good faith they had anticipated receiving is no
longer available to
them.</div><a name="0806046000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">A retrospective
25-year time scale could impact on investments going right back to the
1980s. People who invested in the 1980s will obviously have received
most of the relief already, but they would still have qualified for
some of the relief being tapered off, which consequently they might not
receive. So we are talking about business decisions taken over a very
long period. The Institute of Chartered Accountants made the point that
in accountancy terms&#151;it does not judge the politics of the
proposal&#151;the abolition would be neater and more reasonable if
only expenditure incurred after the 2007 Budget statement was affected.
It would be interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s response to that
specific point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 495</div><a name="0806046000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall conclude with a couple of
questions. How much revenue will the abolition of the allowances be
likely to raise for the Treasury? I sourced an estimate in the region
of &#163;15 million annually, but that sounds far too low,
particularly taking into account the points made by the Conservative
spokesperson. However, if there is scope for significant revenue to be
clawed back, it would be interesting for the Minister to give a figure.
Furthermore, given that it is being tapered out, what will that figure
be on a rolling basis, through to the absolute abolition in 2011? It
would also be interesting if she indicated how much impact the measures
will have on businesses in the United Kingdom, which is a slightly
different point from how much revenue will be raised for the
Government. Finally, she would do the Committee a service if she
outlined precisely what form of consultation the Treasury embarked upon
in advance of making the changes, and what lessons it learned during
that process.</div>
<a name="0806046000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000572"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The clause withdraws industrial and agricultural
buildings allowances with effect from April 2011 and introduces a
schedule containing various consequential amendments and savings, which
we have been considering. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge,
who is deep in the throes of negotiating his way through the
proposition that you just made, Sir Nicholas, asked a number of
questions, but other points have been made.</div>
<a name="0806046000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000573"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> We would be interested in hearing the
answers.</div>
<a name="0806046000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000574"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Exactly.</div>
<a name="0806046000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our changes to
capital allowances, which are associated with the abolition of IBAs and
ABAs, are principled and reasoned. They are a necessary step forward. I
have been listening to the concerns expressed from all parts of the
Committee, and I have had representations on them, so I continue to
look closely at how the whole change will work in the coming months and
years.</div> <a name="0806046000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
have sound reasons behind them. They refocus the incentives for
investment in innovation by removing the inefficient and distortive
features of the current system. One example that I was given when
discussing the changes was that a company may gain industrial buildings
allowance for a particular type of investment, but a similar set of
companies, if they wanted to develop, for example, a bus station, would
not be entitled to that allowance. There is a serious distortion in the
way that the current system works, but our proposals are also part of a
wider reform package that includes the 2 per cent. reduction in the
main rate of corporation tax, which is effected to promote investment
and growth. By realigning the rates of allowance more closely with the
average rates of depreciation, the reforms remove the distortions
between investment decisions and between sectors.</div>
<a name="0806046000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Budget package is not
intended to target particular sectors&#151;one or two sectors have
been mentioned this afternoon&#151;but is intended to remove the
distortions between the sectors that are currently inherent in the
system. Our primary driver for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>withdrawal of the IBA and the other wider reforms is the desire to
reduce the tax system&#146;s distortive impact on commercial
decisions.</div> <a name="0806046000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">One guiding
objective was simplification. The IBAs have long been recognised as a
significant compliance burden, and in responses to the 2002-05
corporation tax reform consultation, and in the independent
administrative burden advisory board&#146;s list of priority
irritants of the tax system, the IBA features. To leave IBAs in place
would mean retaining that burden and complexity in the system for up to
25 years. It would also continue to give a tax advantage to some
sectors by providing that relief.</div>
<a name="0806046000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Runnymede
and Weybridge asked how we consulted on the measure. The allowances are
not being withdrawn overnight. We announced in the 2007 Budget that
they would be gradually withdrawn over four years, and we did so to
give businesses time to plan and to adjust to the change, as I
explained last
year&#151;</div><a name="0806046000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000575"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Will the hon. Lady give
way?</div>
<a name="0806046000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000576"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> If I can just finish my sentence, I shall be
happy to give way.</div>
<a name="0806046000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not our
policy to consult on changes to rates of taxation or allowances, or on
the removal of allowances, although we invite evidence. We consulted
extensively on the new elements of the capital allowances reforms, such
as the design of the AIA, and we received many useful comments that we
reflect in the new relief for small pools of unrelieved expenditure
introduced by clause 78 to name one example. We are giving business the
certainty it demands by setting a clear direction and by consulting on
the technical
details.</div>
<a name="0806046000380"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="0806046000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000577"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister said that announcing the intention
to withdraw IBAs four years in advance of the full withdrawal date
should give business the opportunity to plan and prepare. How does she
suggest that BAA plans and prepares for the withdrawal of the IBAs that
they factored into their business model when they decided to invest
&#163;5 billion in terminal
5?</div><a name="0806046000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000578"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman asked me a question on a point
that I will come to in a
moment.</div><a name="0806046000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
needs to be reassured that, if we left things as they were, the current
system of capital allowances would not result in a fair outcome for all
businesses. The reality is that industrial buildings allowances are a
relatively small tax relief: they apply to only 30 per cent. of
property value and only 5 per cent. of the value goes to small firms.
There are a total of 25,000 to 30,000 claims per year, but as I have
already said the top 200 claims account for more than half the cost. I
do not want to get drawn into debating one company in isolation. I
acknowledge that there are consequences not just for BAA, but for other
businesses. However, it is important to remember that the top 200
claims out of up to 30,000 claims a year account for more than half of
the cost. The true objective of the reforms is to leave the UK with a
better, modernised tax system.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div><a name="0806046000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked how the provision will impact on company balance sheets. The
rules for deferred tax accounting are complex, as I have learned. The
loss of industrial buildings allowances may need to be recognised, but
it is important to note that BAA was also able to recognise a credit in
this year&#146;s accounts for the reduced rate of corporation tax.
Any accounting impact is distinct from the tax
impact.</div><a name="0806046000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Taunton asked how much revenue would be raised by abolition. I
direct him to the Red Book, which shows that in 2008-09 to 2010-11 the
yield will be &#163;75 million in the first year, 
&#163;225 million in the second year and &#163;375 million 
in the
third.</div><a name="0806046000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that hon. Members are conscious of the time and I do not
want to detain the Committee, but I should like to take a moment to
explain things a little bit further because this is a serious issue
that is worth exploring in detail. Both my hon. Friend the Member for
South Derbyshire and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised
concerns about the impact of these changes. The latter said that the
changes should be made in a three-year cycle. I understand that that is
part of the recommendation from the CBI business tax taskforce. I am
attracted to that idea. However, as I have said, the Government gave a
four-year period of notice that the allowances would be gradually
phased out. Those allowances will only begin to be reduced from this
April and they will not finally be withdrawn until April
2011.</div><a name="0806046000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
81 plays an integral part in the reforms that were advanced in 2007.
The IBAs and the ABAs were introduced more than 60 years ago as an
incentive for post-war reconstruction and agricultural recovery. They
no longer reflect the reality of modern business. There is no good
economic case for continuing to provide a selective subsidy to some
buildings but not others. Indeed, the existence of those allowances has
distorted commercial property investment decision making by providing a
tax relief that reduces the costs of such buildings relative to shops
and offices, for example, which do not receive relief. We have decided
to withdraw those allowances on the basis that they have become a
poorly focused subsidy that is selectively available on a disparate
range of assets, some of which appreciate in
value.</div><a name="0806046000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000579"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Why did not all the arguments that the Minister
has just made apply in the then Chancellor&#146;s first Budget in
1997? Why did it take 10 years for him to find them
compelling?</div><a name="0806046000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000580"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is on
record as having expressed trenchant criticism of the idea. I shall not
quote him without having his words to hand, but for some time he has
been saying that the building allowances were poorly targeted and are
in need of reform.</div>
<a name="0806046000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000581"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Is the Minister implying that businesses that paid
close attention to the Prime Minister&#146;s words and indications
when he was Chancellor would have had a sense that the allowance was to
be abolished, and that it was not entirely retrospective for those who
did pay close attention because, as Chancellor, he had a long track
record of indicating that he was looking to bring the allowance to a
close before finally doing  so in
2007?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 498</div><a name="0806046000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000582"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I can be flippant, but it certainly was not my
intention to suggest that businesses should have known because the
allowances had been criticised. The hon. Gentleman will know that the
allowances have been criticised heavily for their lack of focus.
Although the steps that we are taking raise questions of which I have
been taking careful note, they will none the less bring about a better
regime.</div> <a name="0806046000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that
the allowances have long been recognised as imposing a significant
administrative burden on business. That was established in 2006 by a
measuring exercise of compliance burdens. However, rather than
withdrawing the allowances overnight, we decided to give businesses
time to plan. In the 2007 Budget, we announced that the allowances
would be phased out over four years. The large companies of which we
have spoken&#151;BAA has been singled out&#151;will benefit from
the reduction in the main rate of corporation tax. Retaining the
allowances for expenditure incurred up to 2011 would continue the
distortion for future investment. It will mean that until 2036 certain
businesses will receive tax relief that other businesses do not. That
is inefficient and inequitable.</div>
<a name="0806046000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Business
property&#151;buildings and land&#151;can appreciate rather than
depreciate in value. Giving depreciation relief therefore does not make
sense. Buildings are also eligible for other tax relief&#151;for
example, on the interest payments if they are purchased through
borrowing&#151;</div><a name="0806046000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000583"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="0806046000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000584"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will when I reach the end of this sentence. Tax
relief is available on the interest payments if the buildings are
purchased through borrowing and on the maintenance and repair of the
building, and relief is given through the corporate capital gains
system when they are
sold.</div><a name="0806046000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000585"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister says that it does not make sense to
give relief on buildings that may appreciate, but if that is her
concern why&#151;I think it was in the Finance Act 2006&#151;did
the Government abolish balancing charges and allowances in respect of
IBAs?</div><a name="0806046000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000586"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman must forgive me once again. In
the light of comments made in this debate, not least those of my hon.
Friend the Member for South Derbyshire&#151;I know that other Labour
Members in Committee and in the House are concerned that certain
businesses in their constituencies are affected&#151;I want to take
note of the representations being made about our proposals. I cannot
answer the hon. Gentleman immediately, but I shall write to him on that
and any other questions that he has raised that I have not been able to
answer in detail.</div>
<a name="0806046000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Financing the phased withdrawal
of the allowances will give business time to plan. We are taking an
important step, as I have said, to improve the efficiency of the tax
system and to reduce complexity, as well as undertaking a wider package
of reforms. Clause 82, which we shall come to shortly, contains
provisions for the phased reduction of the allowance. Our approach will
allow business to calculate the amount of allowance to which they are
entitled and then to restrict 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 499</div>the amount that can be set off by a quarter, a half, three quarters and
then in full. That effectively gives an allowance rate of 3 per cent.,
2 per cent., 1 per cent. and finally 0 per cent., at which point there
will be no allowance to claim. Clause 81 is intended to repeal
legislation that no longer provides relief from the relevant date. I
hope that the Committee will give the clause a fair
wind.</div><a name="0806046000327"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806046000587"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000588"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000589"></a>Mr.
Blizzard:</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas, I understood
that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge wished to get
away.</div><a name="0806046000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000590"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Is that the position? I seek to work for the
Committee. I thought that it would be sensible to conclude the clause
stand part debate. Is there any opposition to that? I indicated that I
was perfectly happy to go on for a little while
yet.</div><a name="0806046000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000591"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Further to that point of order, Sir Nicholas, it
was my understanding through the usual channels that the Committee
intended to rise at  7 o&#146;clock. I did have a pressing
engagement that I wished to attend in my constituency. If we are not to
rise at 7 o&#146;clock, as it appears we are not, I no longer have
such a pressing engagement and do not feel constrained in the questions
that I want to ask the Minister in relation to clause 81. I am very
happy to continue if that is the Committee&#146;s
wish.</div><a name="0806046000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000592"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Again, we do not want a major debate on this. It
is helpful if a debate is concluded rather than being left over until

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000593"></a>Mr.

is that it is not within the rules of the Committee to move an
adjournment in the middle of a speech. I sought to wait until the
Financial Secretary had finished her speech before moving the
adjournment, so that it was as close to 7 o&#146;clock as possible.
My understanding is that it is not the done thing or that it is against
the rules to leap up in the middle of a speech to move an adjournment.
That is why I left it until after the Financial Secretary had finished
her
remarks.</div><a name="0806046000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000594"></a>The
Chairman:</b> May I say that it is not appropriate that the
Government Whip should seek to move that the debate be further
considered on another occasion in the middle of a speech? However, if
the Government Whip wishes to put the motion again, I am obliged to put
it to the Committee. Is it the wish that the Committee should continue
for a little while or does the Committee wish to adjourn
now?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 500</div><a name="0806046000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000595"></a>Mr.
Blizzard:</b> I am happy to carry on if the hon. Member for
Runnymede and Weybridge wishes  to do
so.</div><a name="0806046000336"></a>

Chairman:</b> I am
happy.</div><a name="0806046000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000597"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> It is always up to the Government Whips to decide
what tone the Committee operates
under.</div><a name="0806046000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a very important clause and I do not feel that the Financial
Secretary&#146;s response displayed a clear understanding and
appreciation of the significance of these changes. She talked about the
Government&#146;s announcement in 2007 that industrial and
agricultural buildings allowances would not be phased out fully until
2011. She suggested that that has somehow given business the
opportunity to plan and prepare. The issue of the businesses with which
we are most concerned today&#151;particularly the one that has been
referred to&#151;is not about future expenditure, but past
expenditure. Whether there is two or five years&#146; notice, there
is no opportunity for businesses in that situation to do anything
differently. There is nothing that they can do to mitigate the effects
of the decision that has been
made.</div><a name="0806046000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The broader point
is that this measure sends a message to businesses in general about the
predictability of the UK tax regime. With respect to the Financial
Secretary, I do not feel that she has addressed that point. That is
disappointing because I would have thought June 2008 was a point when
all Treasury Ministers would be acutely sensitive of the need to try to
row back and repair some of the damage that has been done to the
business community and to the UK&#146;s once enviable reputation for
being a stable, predictable and business-friendly tax regime. Indeed,
one of the great claims of the Government of Mr. Tony Blair
was that he made a Labour Government compatible with the business
interest.</div>
<a name="0806046000381"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15
pm</div><a name="0806046000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet, in just a
year, all that work has been blown away&#151;sometimes, frankly, in a
careless manner. I do not believe that Ministers deliberately set out
to send a different message to business, but the Financial Secretary
should be aware that in practice that is what has happened.</div>
<a name="0806046000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have so far
talked pretty much exclusively about industrial buildings allowance and
industrial companies. However, we should not forget the impact that
these measures will have on agriculture, where many small and perhaps
struggling agricultural businesses will now effectively have a
retrospective change in the tax treatment of an investment that they
made perhaps many years ago in respect of agricultural buildings. To
use her phrase, how does the Minister expect them to use the four years
between 2007 and 2011 to prepare for the abolition of agricultural
buildings allowance? Certainly, what has happened will change their
attitude to future investment, and that should be of concern to us at a
time when the need to increase food production is on everyone&#146;s
agenda and is an urgent necessity not just in this country but across
the globe, as I believe the Prime Minister said yesterday. There are
constraints in food supply, rising food prices and the possibility of
serious food shortages in some parts of the third world, coupled 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div>with dramatic food price inflation in the UK and elsewhere. We need to
think about the impact on agriculture of any measures that are
announced.</div><a name="0806046000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fairness,
when the measure on ABA was announced in 2007, no one anticipated the
surge in food prices or that there would be a problem on this scale.
Have Ministers taken stock of the situation in the light of the new
circumstances and begun to consider whether the abolition of ABAs at
this time sends a damaging signal to potential investors in
agriculture?</div><a name="0806046000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the more substantial issue of industrial buildings allowance, the
Minister needs to understand that because the life of an industrial
building is likely to be very long, investment decisions made as long
as 20 years ago will still be affected by the decision to withdraw
ABAs. I sympathise with the overall intention of reducing allowances
and exceptions to lower rates&#151;although I would like to see rates
lowered more&#151;but I consistently come back to the fact that in
the manner of doing such things the Government can inflict huge damage.
Equally, they can mitigate much of that damage if they do things in the
right
way.</div><a name="0806046000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
few moments ago, the Minister said that it was not the
Government&#146;s practice to consult on or preannounce changes in
rates. I am not sure that I understand the measure to be merely a
change in the rate: it is the wholesale abolition of an allowance and
has very significant consequences. Unfortunately, I do not have a
specific example&#151;although perhaps by Report I will have
discovered one&#151;but there will be people out there who made
investment decisions in respect of industrial buildings in anticipation
of receiving industrial buildings allowance. They might, for example,
have made those decisions in the winter of 2006-07 when a preannounced
intention would have been expected to be under consultation. Those
people would rightly feel aggrieved; if they had had notice, they might
have taken different decisions. Considerable costs are being inflicted
on UK plc by the manner of carrying out this
activity.</div><a name="0806046000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now
return to BAA. The Minister answered some of the questions on BAA and,
in particular, acknowledged that it might be necessary for the changed
tax treatment to be reflected in an adjustment to the balance sheet,
but she did not deal with the question that will be on many Committee
members&#146; minds about the ultimate incidence of the change. Who
will bear the ultimate cost of it? In particular, unless I missed
it&#151;if I did, I apologise&#151;she did not deal with the
question of an infrastructure provider subject to IBAs who operates
under a regulated rate of return regime, as BAA
does.</div><a name="0806046000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not an
accountant, although two of my Front-Bench colleagues are, but my
understanding is that because of the lack of IBAs, the relevant capital
employed in the business will effectively increase. Since BAA is
allowed to earn a fixed rate of return on its relevant capital
investments, that implies that first the airlines but, ultimately, the
travelling public will pick up the tab for this. They will do so by
facing higher charges as BAA seeks to achieve that permitted rate of
return on what will now be a higher relevant capital base. The Minister
has not answered that point and I think that Committee members would
find it useful if she told us whether that analysis is correct. Will
the return that a regulated operator is permitted to earn in that way
go up as a consequence of the abolition of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 502</div>IBAs, thus passing the burden back to the already hard-pressed
travelling public?</div>
<a name="0806046000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a broad
concern that the Government do not understand the significance of the
signal that they are sending. They understand clearly the specifics of
the revenue implications of the changes being made, and I deliberately
have not disagreed with the principle behind the direction in which
they are travelling. But I hope that Ministers will reflect on the
damage being done when changes such as this are made without adequate
forewarning, adequate signalling and proper consultation. I leave the
Government with this thought: it is not just the UK&#146;s reputation
that is damaged when inadequate consultation and signalling
occurs&#151;it is the Government&#146;s reputation. If the Minister
is not worried about the UK&#146;s reputation as a place to do
business, she certainly will be worried about her own party&#146;s
reputation as a party that does have some recognition of the needs of
business and perhaps even, in some respects, tries to understand
it.</div><a name="0806046000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope also that
the Minister may, by now, have the answer to my question about
balancing charges and allowances in respect of IBAs, which I suggested
to her would have been a solution to the problem that she set out of
buildings possibly appreciating in value, which she seemed to think was
a difficulty. That could be easily addressed by the imposition of
balancing charges&#151;something which her Government abolished, I
think in the Finance Act 2006, although it may have been the Finance
Act 2007.</div>
<a name="0806046000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000598"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I believe that I gave a thorough reply to most
points made in this short debate on this important clause. The hon.
Gentleman knows that we do not sit at his convenience. Had I realised
that he was under a particular difficulty, we would perhaps not have
had the trouble that we have had. I answered his point on balancing
charges when he was temporarily out of the room, and I will revisit
<i class="I">Hansard</i> to ensure that I picked up the point exactly. To
reiterate, balancing charges were abolished to pave the way for the
withdrawal of the allowances in the Finance Act 2007&#151;that is,
last year, not 2006.</div>
<a name="0806046000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The gradual withdrawal of
industrial buildings allowances should not be seen as destabilising. It
is part of a wider package to improve the UK tax system, and the
package as a whole is designed to achieve a sensible rebalancing of the
tax
system.</div><a name="0806046000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000599"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Is the right hon. Lady saying that in advance of
abolishing IBAs, balancing charges and balancing allowances were
abolished, so that people who owned assets subject to IBAs could not
plan for the intended abolition of IBAs by selling those assets on and
realising the loss ahead of this measure coming into
force?</div><a name="0806046000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000600"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The advice I have is that the change was designed
to prevent forestalling and other behaviours that would otherwise have
allowed some businesses to accelerate allowances in an unfair or
unequal manner, compromising the Government&#146;s intention to
withdraw these allowances in a fair and orderly way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div><a name="0806046000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">By realigning the rates of
allowances more closely with the average rates of depreciation, as this
overall package does, the reforms remove the distortions between
investment decisions and between sectors. The package is fiscally
sustainable in the long term, and refocuses the regime on investment
and growth. Very briefly, on agricultural buildings allowances, the
withdrawal of ABAs was not an isolated measure. It is part of the
package, which we have been discussing all afternoon, that saw the
reduction in the main rate of corporation tax and the introduction of a
&#163;50,000 annual investment allowance, allowing 95 per cent. of
businesses to write off all their expenditure on plant and machinery
other than cars in the year in which they make it.</div>
<a name="0806046000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our decision to withdraw IBAs
and ABAs was based on an assessment of a number of issues common across
industry sectors. We have not sought to target either the finance
industry or the airport industry. I therefore reject the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s generalised dismissal of the approach we have taken,
but I acknowledge that there are instances of impacts that are of
concern; I know of one or two examples. I nevertheless believe that the
overall package is a good
package.</div><a name="0806046000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000601"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Will the hon. Lady give
way?</div><a name="0806046000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000602"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I ought not to. I have been far too generous, but
on this occasion I will give way one more
time</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column504" />Column number: 504</div><a name="0806046000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000603"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister is always very generous. Would she
at least acknowledge that the impact of this is that the provision of
infrastructure in future that involves buildings that would have
qualified for IBA will become more expensive, and that where that is
publicly used infrastructure&#151;whether it be airports or privately
provided train stations&#151;it is bound to be more expensive? There
will be a cost in doing
this.</div><a name="0806046000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806046000604"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I do not immediately acknowledge that that will
be an absolute consequence of these changes. The largest companies,
such as BAA, benefit the most from the reduction in corporation tax.
Overall, they will benefit from these changes and in making future
decisions on investment they will benefit from the AIA. I know the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concern, and it is right and proper for him to press
that concern, but I believe that the package of changes that we are
bringing forward as a result of these measures will, in the long term,
enormously benefit the British
economy.</div><a name="0806046000359"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
