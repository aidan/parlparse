New clause 1 Advance notice of counter demonstrations to public processions 
". (1) A person proposing to organise a counter demonstration to a public procession shall give notice of that proposal in accordance with subsections (2) to (4) to a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary not below the rank of sergeant by leaving the notice with him at the police station in whose area of responsibility that procession is proposed to start.
(2) Notice under this section shall be given not less than 14 days before the date on which the procession is to be held.
(3) Notice under this section shall 
(a) be given in writing in such form as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State; and
(b) be signed by the person giving the notice.
(4) The form prescribed under subsection (3)(a) shall require a person giving notice under this section to specify 
(a) the nature of the counter demonstration;
(b) the number of persons likely to take part in it;
(c) the arrangements for its control being made by the person proposing to organise it;
(d) the name and address of that person; and
(e) such other matters as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary for, or appropriate for facilitating, the exercise by the Commission, the Secretary of State or members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary of any function in relation to the counter demonstration.
(5) The Chief Constable shall ensure that a copy of a notice given under this section is immediately sent to the Commission.
(6) A person who organises or takes part in a counter demonstration to a lawfully determined public procession 
(a) in respect of which the requirements of this section as to notice have not been satisfied; or
(b) which differs markedly in nature from that in the notice given under this section,
shall be guilty of an offence.
(7) A person guilty of an offence under subsection (6) shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.".<P>

<P>
New clause 2 The Commission's powers to impose conditions on counter demonstrations 
". (1) The Commission may issue a determination in respect of a proposed counter demonstration to a proposed public procession imposing on the persons organising or taking part in it such conditions as the Commission considers necessary.
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the conditions imposed under that subsection may include conditions as to the lining of the route of the proposed procession or prohibiting counter demonstrators from entering any place.
(3) Conditions imposed under subsection (1) may incorporate or be framed by reference to 
(a) the Code of Conduct; or
(b) any other document 
(i) prepared by the person or body organising the procession in question; and
(ii) approved by the Commission for the purposes of this section.
(4) The Commission may, in accordance with the procedural rules, amend or revoke any determination issued under this section.
(5) In considering in any particular case 
(a) whether to issue a determination under this section;
(b) whether to amend or revoke a determination issued under this section; or
(c) what conditions should be imposed by a determination (or amended determination) issued under this section,
the Commission shall have regard to the guidelines.
(6) The guidelines shall in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of section 5(1)) provide for the Commission to have regard to 
(a) any public disorder or damage to property which may result from the counter demonstration to the proposed procession;
(b) any disruption to the life of the community which the counter demonstration may cause;
(c) any impact which the counter demonstration may have on relationships within the community; and
(d) any failure of a person of a description specified in the guidelines to comply with the Code of Conduct (whether in relation to the counter demonstration to the proposed procession in question or any previous counter demonstration).
(7) A person who knowingly fails to comply with a condition imposed under this section shall be guilty of an offence, but it is a defence for him to prove that the failure arose 
(a) from circumstances beyond his control; or
(b) from something done by direction of a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary not below the rank of inspector.
(8) A person who incites another to commit an offence under subsection (7) shall be guilty of an offence.
(9) A person guilty of an offence under subsection (7) or (8) shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.".<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): Welcome back, Mr. Welsh. It is nice to have you with us after your disappearing act this morning. I was ending my remarks when the gong went. I was speaking about clause 10 and the changes proposed in my amendments Nos. 88 to 118, but not No. 105. That list of amendments would ensure that counter-demonstrations were included in every case when processions were to be considered by the Secretary of State.
<P>
Before concluding, I want to refer to new clauses 1 and 2, which are important. As I said earlier, new clause 1 almost replicates clause 6, which deals with advance notices. Clause 6 covers advance notice of public processions; new clause 1 would also include the organisers of counter-demonstrations to public processions. The wording is similar, but there are some key areas that I want to point out to the Committee.
<P>
The advance notice under new clause 1 is 14 days; the Government propose 28 days in clause 6. We shall discuss the proposal for 28 days' notice later. Our proposal of 14 days' notice seemed reasonable, as after the organisers of a parade had submitted their application to the local police, it would be passed to the commission within a day or two and would then be public knowledge. That would give at least 14 days for the organisers of a counter-demonstration to make their views known. The application form, or whatever it is to be called I believe that it has yet to be designed will require that the person giving notice under that section of the Bill should specify the nature of the counter-demonstration. The commission should know what it is faced with before it makes a decision. Is it a sit-down protest? Will it be a peaceful protest? Will it come close to the marching parade? Such details should be submitted so that the commission can make sense of the situation.
<P>
The commission should also be told the number of persons likely to take part in the counter-demonstration. If the organisers of parades have to give the numbers of those expected to take part, it is only reasonable that protesters against parades should do the same.
<P>
The wording about the arrangements for the control of parades is similar in new clause 1 and clause 6, as is that about the name and address of the person making the submission. It has been suggested that it is difficult to specify the people involved in protests and counter-demonstrations. I would agree with that if the protests were spontaneous, but many such events in Northern Ireland are not. The organisers of the counter-demonstrations are part of the so-called residents' organisations, which are well known to the police and to most people in Northern Ireland. If they continue to organise protests and counter-demonstrations, it seems fair and reasonable that they should make clear their intentions early enough to enable the police and the commission to take a view and reach a determination.
<P>
Furthermore, if the organisers of the counter-demonstration were made to put their intentions on paper, their submission would become the basis of the decision. If the commission deemed a peaceful protest, or a protest involving a sit down, to be acceptable, those elements would become agreed terms and conditions. Breaking them would amount to an offence. As things are, in discussions and negotiations with the commission, groups could say one thing and do something different on the day. There would be no recourse to the law. The organisers of the demonstrations would shrug their shoulders and say, "It just got out of hand on the day. Our intentions were to hold a peaceful protest within the law." That is not acceptable any more. The survey findings show that the vast majority of people, from all sides of the community, do not think that it is reasonable for protest demonstrations to take place if a parade has been given the legal go-ahead.
<P>
New clauses 1 and 2 are my attempts to put some meat on the bones to tie down the intentions of the counter-demonstrators, so that proper decisions can be taken. New clause 2 would give the commission powers to impose conditions on counter-demonstrations. It could do that only if it had information and knowledge about the organisers' intentions. The advance notice is thus a logical part of the approach. The new clause is similar to clause 7 in its wording but there are slight differences, particularly in subsection (2); my wording provides that conditions imposed under subsection (1)
"may include conditions as to the lining of the route of the proposed procession or prohibiting counter demonstrators from entering any place."
<P>
One could think of other relevant situations, perhaps, but those two govern the interface between the parade and the demonstrators. The line of the route is obviously a critical area, and key points and locations on the route could also feature in violent confrontations if demonstrators so intended.
<P>
The latter provisions of the new clause provide the commission with powers of sanction against a group organising a counter-demonstration, much along the lines of the powers to invoke sanctions against parade organisers who deviate from their stated intention set[Mr. Malcolm Moss]
out in the advance notice. The offences set out in the new clause are similar to those in clause 7.
<P>
There are many amendments grouped under clause 1 rightly so because the theme is whether we entertain the idea of a need for legislation on protests, protesters and counter-demonstrations. Amendment No. 2, tabled by the hon Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross), would provide the first mention of counter-demonstrations in the Bill. I am fearful that if it is not passed, many of the other amendments on subsequent clauses will not be called. I would like some guidance on whether the Chairman will select new clauses 1 and 2, whatever happens in the next Division. I also look to the Minister in this respect because comments were made, in all sincerity, in the other place, and the Government accepted changes but they also left things on the cusp, so to speak, to discuss other amendments at a later stage.
<P>
I presume that Ministers and their officials have considered the North report's attitude to counter-demonstrations and protests. I believe that the Government are reasonably sympathetic to reconsidering the matter and I hope that the Minister, in responding to the amendments, will say whether they will do so. If he does that, I will take it as read that consideration will be given to how the proposals can be implemented, along with any practical problems that arise from the amendments. We must do something to remove the imbalance in the Bill to let the Unionists and the Orangemen know that it is not only they who will be required to complete forms and comply with the law to do something that they have done for centuries and which they believe is their right, without hindrance, to do.
<P>
If the Minister will give us the assurance that we seek we will not press the amendments to a Division. It will depend on whether he is prepared seriously to consider the arguments, which are not only mine and my hon. Friends' but those of the excellent North report. It is incumbent on the Government not to cherry pick but to embrace the thrust of the report in striking a balance between the two sides of the community.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): The amendments show one of the Bill's faults: it is unacceptable to Unionists, to Orangemen and to those of the loyal orders who believe in civil and religious liberty. They believe that they almost have the complete right to march the Queen's highway without let or hindrance. Nearly 3,000 parades take place each year, of which about 12 give trouble. We must ask ourselves whether the problems arise from the parades or from the protesters. We must acknowledge that if more than 3,000 parades in Northern Ireland take place peaceably, with the full co-operation of the police, it is hard to argue that the solution to the problem is to come down with a mighty heavy hand and restrict the liberties and freedoms of the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland, as the Bill proposes. It is designed to clobber the Orange institutions in Northern Ireland and fails completely to deal with the real problem protesters, counter-parades and counter-demonstrations.
<P>
Clause 13 deals with protesters, but it is nothing new: it is similar to an article in an existing public order order, but is has been reworded in different sections. Overall, however, the Bill says nothing about the main problem the problem of protesters and counter-demonstrations.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Anyone studying the history of the past few years must recognise that the main problem is connected with demonstrators and protesters. Resident groups, plainly fronted and acknowledged by Sinn Fein-IRA, have been the main cause of the trouble. Thus legislation to deal with the problem should focus less on parades than on the protesters. The Bill should deal not so much with perceived difficulties with parades as with the difficulties caused by protesters.
<P>
My view is that we do not really need a Bill because the law in Northern Ireland is comparable to the law here in England. The same criteria exist on the mainland as in Northern Ireland. The main problem is that the interpretation and implementation of the law has been different in Northern Ireland.
<P>
If people want to hold a parade in England, they go to the police and agree a route with them. The police then police the parade. No protester would be allowed to get near it, to intervene or to interfere with it. Certainly no protester or group of protesters would be allowed to sit down in the road, block the parade and prevent it from taking place. Protesters would simply not be allowed to have offensive weapons and threaten to use them. That just would not happen here in England.
<P>
In Northern Ireland, however, the police have refused to deal with demonstrators in the same way. Under existing Northern Ireland legislation there are five or six articles that deal with people breaking the law, but the police have very rarely used the powers that they possess.
<P>
Some people believe that Dr. North's report is wonderful. I do not, but even the report makes the point that it is incomprehensible why so few people in Northern Ireland have been prosecuted under existing law. It states:
"We are clear in our minds that there is a need for an effective offence to penalise those who act to disrupt parades and that the events of the past two years point to undoubted evidence of such behaviour. We are less clear from the evidence before us whether the paucity of prosecutions under Article 7 lies in a defect in the law or simply in an unwillingness to bring prosecutions under that particular provision."<P>

<P>
That is Northern Ireland's problem the failure of the police to police parades according to the law.
<P>
There is an annual parade in the village of Mountfield in my constituency to the local Church of Ireland church. That parade has been going on for years without any problem. This year the organisers gave their notice to the police as usual. However, certain troublemakers and Sinn Fein sympathisers decided that this year they would cause trouble. They went to the route of the parade, threatened to sit on the road and block it and threatened violence. Under the law the police should have prevented that: they should have allowed the peaceful parade to proceed through the village to the church for the religious service.
<P>
What happened? The police, under a misinterpretation of the law stopped the parade. They said, "You can't go up because by so doing you will cause a breach of the peace." That seems a foolish argument and a perverse interpretation of the law. Not only that, but the police issued the peaceful people who were marching with the document which said that they were the troublemakers who were acting illegally and that they were being stopped under the Act when they had done nothing at all and were in a perfectly peaceful parade. That is our problem in Northern Ireland the failure to police parades properly.
<P>
The Bill, instead of reinforcing the existing law, will bring in a new law to change the whole situation and makes it far easier for people to protest. They will be invited to protest and to gather to stop parades. They have discovered that once they have got away with it they will continue to get away with it. That is the problem in Northern Ireland.
<P>
In the village of Pomeroy the local Orange parade on the way home each 12 July parades a certain section, mainly the Protestant section of the village. It goes around the square in Pomeroy and back down to the hall. For many years some people have protested about that parade those who do not like us because we are British, who do not like the Union Jack, who do not like the British way of life but who are quite happy to take the Queen's money. They protest and the police block the road. They were not allowed in and the parade went through as normal, quite peaceably. Now the police do not block the route and the protesters come in and sit down and the police block the legal and peaceful parade. That creates problems because it means that the law-abiding citizen is denied his right to march the Queen's highway. It is therefore essential to deal with the counter-demonstrations and counter-protesters. There is nothing in the Bill to deal adequately with them. Changes need to be made so that those who wish to demonstrate and protest have to go through a legal process similar to the one to which those who wish to hold proper lawful parades have to undergo.
<P>
The Bill contains codes of practice, rules and regulations for those who wish to hold peaceful parades. It contains nothing of the sort for protesters or counter-demonstrators. They should be subject to a code of practice that requires them to give notice that they will parade. They should have to go through procedures that are similar to those for people holding lawful parades.
<P>
It is difficult for provisions on counter-demonstrators to have much beneficial effect. Most protests take place suddenly and unexpectedly and many protesters are brought in to create trouble. However, if the Bill made some effort to deal with them, we might have more confidence in the Government's resolution on solving the problem.
<P>
Unionists and law-abiding people see a Bill that deals almost exclusively with their parades, but does nothing about troublemakers. It gives Unionists very little confidence in the Government whom they are under at this time. It increases their perception that the Government are more interested in placating Republicans and Sinn Fein than in protecting the rights of the people of Northern Ireland. It is a continuation of the Government's perceived policy of removing, as far as they can, those things which are part of the British way of life and the British emblem from the people of Northern Ireland.
<P>
Those are real perceptions and if the issue is not tackled with great care, there will be far more problems this year than there were last year. There might have been 15 or 20 trouble spots last year, but, if the Bill is enacted, there will be 30, 40 or 50 or even more in the year that lies ahead. It is essential that the Bill is amended and that protesters, as well as law-abiding citizens, understand that they have to abide by certain strictures of the law.

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office </B>(Mr. Adam Ingram): I welcome you back, Mr. Welsh. Much has happened in your absence not just lunch and the period between the two sittings.
<P>
We are dealing with an enormous group of amendments. One might think that once we have dealt with all the issues that have been raised, there is probably nothing more to be said about the Bill would that that were so. Experience tells me otherwise. I suspect that there will be one or two more important debates.
<P>
Before I deal with the detailed comments by the hon. Members for East Londonderry, for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) and for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson), I shall deal with a specific point made by the hon. Member for West Tyrone. He spoke about the number of people prosecuted under article 7 for breaking up a procession. He is right there are very few prosecutions under that article, but that does not mean that people are not prosecuted for offences linked to such activity. Indeed, there are prosecutions under the disorderly conduct provisions. Unfortunately, their extent cannot be highlighted because for some time this is the history of such prosecutions RUC statistics have not broken down disorderly conduct charges. If that changed, one of the allegations made by the hon. Member for West Tyrone might not have as much force as it seems to have.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I remind the Minister that far more provisions than article 7 are relevant. Such people could be prosecuted under several articles 7.1, 9.1, 18.1, 19.1, 20.1 and 22.1. How many prosecutions have been brought?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I cannot give the figure off the top of my head, but there are few prosecutions. When I mentioned article 7, I of course meant to include the other relevant articles. The point is that there are prosecutions for disorderly conduct, but I cannot prove the detail because RUC statistics do not break down in such a way. This is a minor part of the debate because the weight of the argument 
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> It is the major point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It may be a major point to the hon. Gentleman, but the major points made previously by him, his hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) and the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire dealt with a wider area. The main[Mr. Ingram]
theme running through all contributions it is set out in the amendments and the new clauses is the desire for identical treatment for parades and counter-demonstrations. My recollection is that that was the weight of the arguments presented by hon. Members this morning.
<P>
The Government are absolutely committed to balanced, even-handed and effective legislation. The Bill was never intended as anti-parade or to provide incentives for those who oppose parades. I hope to prove that in my discussion of the amendments, which in substantial part do provide incentives for the opponents of parades.
<P>
Grave difficulties have been associated with contested parades in recent years and in some cases, Northern Ireland was pushed to the brink of anarchy. But that does not mean that we are asserting that certain parades are the sole cause of the problem. On both sides of the divide, malign forces have sought to inflame for their own ends the passions that the issue arouses. This is not a one-way street on which counter-demonstrators are bad and everyone associated with parades and marches is good that is not the reality.
<P>
Forces on both sides of the divide try to manipulate the reality on the ground. Elected politicians have a direct responsibility: when mayhem results from such activity, everyone associated with it should be roundly condemned, and such condemnation should not be specific to one side.
<P>
I am arguing that there must be even-handedness, and the Government's commitment to that was clearly demonstrated in the other place. Many issues dealt with by the amendments were discussed in considerable detail. On the back of that debate, the Government tabled amendments to achieve an even greater balance. The provisions include the harmonising of the maximum sentences for offences by participants and protesters, the raising of the threshold for the Secretary of State's powers to ban public processions and increased parliamentary scrutiny for amending statutory documents under the Bill.
<P>
Equally, in other areas we sought to demonstrate why the perceptions of imbalance were due to a misunderstanding of the legislation. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire claimed that there is an imbalance in the legislation. I know that I cannot quote from contributions made in the other place, other than those made by my ministerial colleague, but I refer the hon. Gentleman to statements by his noble Friend, speaking on behalf of the Opposition. Phrases such as "much more balanced", "much more equitable", and "much fairer" were used to describe the Bill. That is a flavour of the summation of the debate on Third Reading in the other place. Those words were spoken not by my noble Friend, but by the hon. Gentleman's noble Friend, on behalf of the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is not a significant point. At that time the Opposition spokesman had obtained from the Government considerable changes to the Bill. My noble Friend's remarks have to be related to his starting point and it is true that the Bill was more balanced than it had been. My contention is that it still needs to be balanced, in a different way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I can refer the hon. Gentleman to other comments, which I would not agree with, which were made during the proceedings, to the effect that this is now a parades-enabling Bill. It is not; there is balance within it. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman reads the comments made in the other place. Not only his noble Friend put forward the arguments on which the amendments were made; cross-party and cross-community views were expressed and taken on board by the Government.
<P>
We demonstrated at length during the Bill's consideration in the other place that there is no need for the extension of the Secretary of State's banning power to cover counter-demonstrations because she already has the power under the public order order to ban all open air public meeting. That power will remain when the Bill comes into effect.
<P>
On a general point, the 61 amendments and two new clauses share one fundamental problem: the lack of a definition of what is a protest and what is a counter-demonstration. There are definitions in law of an open air public meeting and a public procession. Some of the amendments refer to counter-processions. We can define certain aspects of that; some are straightforward. The definition of a procession is straightforward but a counter-demonstration is an entirely different concept. We would all know a counter-demonstration if we saw one, but unfortunately that is not enough for legal definition. Much work would have to be done on that concept if any of the amendments were to be considered. It is hard to get a precise definition that would satisfy the demands of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I prefaced my remarks this morning by saying that I recognised that there might be difficulties in terms of definition, and I offered the opportunity for the words "protest" or "protesters", or whatever was legally more efficacious, to be used. That need not be a stumbling block. The North report used the words "protest" and "protesters". I am not a lawyer, but we all understand what we are trying to achieve and if the amendments fall only on the basis of semantics, there will be many disappointed people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is not only in terms of semantics; it is on the basis of precise definition. I am not a lawyer either. Unfortunately the barrister, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), who earlier gave free advice, is not in his place. If he were here, he could perhaps give me some more free advice, but I am giving the best advice available from those who have the responsibility of drafting legislation, and there are difficulties associated with that.
<P>
We all agree that the North report was correct in rejecting the idea of a notice requirement or coverage for the commission for all open-air public meetings. Open-air public meetings could constitute almost anything, from preaching in a town square to all kinds of innocuous or otherwise uncontroversial demonstrations which may have nothing to do with the problems to which parades have given rise. We do not want to introduce any new burdens on the commission, nor do we want to impose new burdens on the citizens of Northern Ireland unless there are compelling reasons for so doing. The wider the remit and the wider the definition, the more is drawn in. It would be helpful to take in turn the main issues covered by the amendments and to deal with them specifically on the back of the general explanation.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 17 would extend the commission's educational remit to cover counter-demonstrations as well as public processions. The commission will want to keep itself fully aware of the situation on the ground that is one of its main purposes. Indeed, it could hardly exercise its functions without understanding the likely level of opposition to any given procession. I would, however, be most reluctant to give the commission a formal remit to promote greater understanding of the issues concerning counter-demonstrations as well as public processions. The purpose of the Bill is to put in place structures that will lead to a fair and even-handed solution to the issue of parades. We are looking to a time when all sections of the community can express their identity in whichever way they choose without infringing the rights of others.
<P>
We do not want to give the impression that parades are interminally and inevitably going to be accompanied by associated protests, but that is the thrust of the amendments. By their nature, counter-demonstrations can take many shapes and forms, unlike traditional processions or parades. Apart from the question of definition, there is the possibility of an impossible burden being placed on the commission in its early years.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 82 and 83 were tabled by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and would extend the code of conduct to cover the conduct of counter-demonstrators. That proposal was discussed at considerable length in another place. As my noble Friend Lord Dubs said, we are not opposed to the amendments in principle, but we have some difficulty in seeing their point. After all, under the Bill the commission can take into account breaches of the code of conduct in reaching future decisions. It was pointed out in our debate that the commission has no corresponding mandate against counter-demonstrations, but it is not easy to see what sanctions it could have, short of forcing more parades through a contested area in the future as a punishment. I do not think that anyone would consider that to be a good idea, if by writing counter-demonstrations into the Bill, we effectively provoke those who want to protest to formalise their protest so that it would fall under the conditioning of the Bill. We would end up with a plethora of political demonstrations which do not currently exist.
<P>
I am conscious of the weight of argument about a code of conduct for counter-demonstrators and I want to consider the matter further. I want to reflect on the strength of the argument in today's debate and perhaps return to the issue on Report. My earlier comments led hon. Members to believe that I am still against the idea. That is my instinct, but my mind is not closed on the matter. That is why I want to give it further consideration.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The Minister says that if we make protests legal by creating codes of conduct, we will invite more of them, but surely the reverse would be the case. The realisation that they would have to comply with a complicated procedure would deter many protesters rather than encouraging them to hold more protests.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am not convinced of that, but I want to consider it further. We have to try to predict what will happen in the future. There are strong arguments on both sides of the divide. I want to move forward on the specific issue in amendments Nos. 82 and 83 and I will take it away to give it further thought. That was what was said in the other place. I have heard what has been said here and I hope to come back to the issue on Report if I feel that that is necessary.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 84, 149 and 150 deal with extending the guidelines to cover counter-demonstrations. The amendments logically go together with new clauses 1 and 2, which introduce a regime of commission scrutiny for counter-demonstrations, including advance notice and the ability to impose conditions. Those conditions would, in turn, be informed by the guidelines. There may be something to be said for introducing a notice requirement for counter-demonstrations, although the problems of definitions, which I have described, remain.
<P>
The Government are committed to implementing the recommendations in the North report. We agree in particular with the recommendation that open air public meetings can most suitably remain a matter for the police. We do not want to overburden the commission unnecessarily. In practice, the problems posed by counter-demonstrations are more likely to be of a public order nature and most appropriately dealt with by the police.
<P>
North's main recommendation on the criteria for deciding whether to impose conditions on parades was that criteria needed to be extended to cover the impact of a parade on community relations. That is intimately related to the phenomenon of parades in areas that are overwhelming of the other tradition. The question of the impact on community relations is, however, likely to apply to counter-demonstrations, which are bound to take place on home territory. That fact that we are not extending the commission's remit in that regard does not mean that the authorities will be toothless when dealing with the problems that counter-demonstrations cause. The power of the police to impose conditions on open air public meetings are essentially similar to the commission's. Again, I want to take away the arguments that have been advanced and give them due consideration. If necessary, I will return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I accept the Minister's comments in the spirit that they are made. As regards mediation, the commission's role is to try to bring two sides together. That will be unlikely in the critical areas and a decision one way or the other will have to be made. In some situations, however, some of the steam could be taken out of the parade situation if local people had the right[Mr. Moss]
to demonstrate. I am not against people's right to protest and make their feelings known.
<P>
If the commission allows a parade to proceed, I want to ensure that it has additional specific information from the organisers of the protest so that it knows where it stands. If conditions are broken, sanctions can follow. At least the commission will know that a community wants to make a valid and peaceful protest, which ought to be allowed. That should not over-colour the judgment in allowing the parade to go forward. Matters could, however, work practically to help the overall situation. People have a right to protest peacefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is a valid point, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts my point that counter-demonstrations and protests can take many forms. Counter-demonstrators may make a submission in relation to a march one year and they may be required to conform to a code of conduct, if there is one. If there are provisions for parades, they would apply to them as well. But next year, events may not occur in exactly the same way. The reality is that those who march and parade along their traditional routes tend to conform to a pattern, and lessons can be learned from the way in which a parade is conducted. The same does not apply to counter-demonstrations.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross </B>(East Londonderry): I do not think that the Orange Order or any other loyalist order in Northern Ireland or elsewhere would object to a normal, peaceful protest that remained within the law. I have seen some of those in the past, although mighty few. We are, however, concerned that the protests that we are talking about are not organised on that basis. To be perfectly honest, they are organised by the IRA. The IRA does not organise them to protest, but to make absolute mayhem. We are discussing the most violent so-called protests, which are really a descent into anarchy caused by the armed terrorist group. The Government have not faced up to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The Government have faced up to it. The RUC faces up to it every time such an event occurs, because the RUC and the Army tend to be in the front line when dealing with such violent reactions. As I said, such reactions do not come just from protesters, but can come from many people associated with parades and marches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I see the hon. Gentleman shaking his head. We could go back over much of that argument. I am not necessarily talking about people who take part in marches, but those associated with the marches and parades. We should all remember the vivid pictures of Drumcree and elsewhere in Northern Ireland over recent years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> No. Counter-demonstrators who have an orchestrated and malign intent not to simply stop a march, but to provoke another reaction in Northern Ireland, are hardly likely to co-operate with any structure laid down in the legislation. It will not tackle that problem. If people are clever, and conform, assuming that a law is in place, and then breach that law, the next year those people will be of a different shape and form, so that the people being dealt with are no longer the same as the previous applicants.
<P>
That is part of the complexity and difficulty associated with counter demonstrations. That is why on balance although I will consider some of the aspects that I have outlined it is better to leave the powers in the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, and to rely on the RUC and on the security forces to tackle serious problems that relate to the break-down of public order.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 178, 179, 176, 152 to 155 and 157 to 161 also deal with extending the confiscation of alcohol to people participating in counter demonstrations. The answer to the problem is quite simple. The hon. Member for East Londonderry made in one sense a heavy-weathered, but also detailed, examination of the relevant clauses. There are two major catch-all phrases within the relevant parts of the Bill. Clause 12, as drafted, will apply to a person who
"is otherwise present at, or is in the vicinity of, a place on the route or proposed route of a public procession".<P>

<P>
Clause 12(4) deals with people who travel in vehicles to such an event to participate in a counter demonstration.
<P>
The Government have tried to craft the Bill to cover that type of eventuality, and so that it does not prohibit people from peacefully going about their activities. The hon. Member for East Londonderry mentioned someone sitting in his or her garden, or in his or her own house, and suggested that that person could be subject to the confiscation of alcohol. Those are not public places. The Bill's definitions must be precisely understood. If need be, I shall take the hon. Gentleman through that matter in greater detail. The Government have dealt with the anxieties that the hon. Gentleman raised. For that reason, I do not believe that the amendements are necessary or required.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 180, 88, 202, 89, 203, 90, 204, 124, 94, 95, 125 I shall get a job on the lottery, I know 96, 126, 97, 127, 128, 98, 131, 99, 132, 100, 133, 101, 134, 102, 135, 103, 136 104 and 106 to 110 cover the extension of the Secretary of State's banning power to cover protest meetings. The issue was discussed in detail in the other place. As my noble Friend Lord Dubs made clear, the Secretary of State already has powers to ban protest meetings. She has powers to ban any open air public meeting, which includes counter demonstrations. Those powers are more or less identical to those that apply to public processions. The relevant provisions will remain in the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. I therefore cannot see the point of the amendments; the law already takes account of them. Many of the amendments are technically defective and would have the ironic effect of making life more difficult for those who organise public processions.
<P>
Allow me to provide an example. The Secretary of State, in deciding whether to impose conditions would have to take into account the disruption and disorder that might result from counter-demonstrations as well as from the procession, so that could provide a bizarre and perverse incentive to the counter-demonstrators to do whatever they could to get the original parade banned. I am sure that that is not the intention of those who drafted the amendments, but that is my assessment of them. They could have the opposite effect to what is intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am having difficulty in understanding the Minister's logic. He said that the Secretary of State would have powers to ban counter-demonstrations, so counter-demonstrators would ratchet up their counter-demonstrations to have parades banned. My amendment, however, would give the Secretary of State the power to ban counter-demonstrations, not parades. I am therefore puzzled about his apparent crossing-over of the argument.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) made the point I hope that I am not misquoting him that the Chief Constable has to choose between two evils the build-up of opposition between the two camps facing each other at Drumcree rather than the parade or the original protest. At some stage during the escalation of hostilities, the Secretary of State could have said that the demonstration could not be allowed to go ahead as originally planned.
<P>
While I am on my feet I would like to ask the Minister how often a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has banned a public meeting. I know of no occasions on which that has happened. Clause 13 is supposed to catch people who disrupt parades. Is there nothing in current public order Acts to deal similarly with such disruption? How many people have ever been arrested on that account?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I cannot provide statistics off the top of my head, but if the hon. Gentleman believes that it is important I can make that information available to him.
<P>
The interpretation of the powers provided in the Bill to the Secretary of State is important. There could well be a ratcheting effect between the people in the parade and the counter-demonstrators, which could have an important impact on the community. Banning a counter-demonstration as such might not work. It could not be applied easily because of the potential impact within the community in the areas through which a parade is proceeding. In those circumstances, the parade could be subject to banning powers.
<P>
That is why we resisted in the other place and why I feel it right to resist today. I have provided hon. Gentlemen with two instances of where we can make progress the code of conduct and the notice relating to counter-demonstrations. I want to consider those matters further. I do not go as far as saying that I shall take on board the other aspects of the matter that have been raised. However, if the Government felt that it was necessary, it would be possible to return to a range of questions on Report. At present, I do not think that the other amendments and new clauses would benefit the balance that we are seeking in the relevant parts of the Bill. I therefore hope that they will be withdrawn, and I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I get the impression that the Minister is on a very steep learning curve. He is learning, and the Committee and the House are learning, what we are up against, and the great difficulties involved in dealing with terrorist organisations' orchestration of events. The Minister said that there is no definition of a counter-demonstration. I am not sure that it is not possible to create a definition. Efforts have been made in the past, as he will know.
<P>
Perhaps we could again consider the difficulties facing parade organisers. Let us suppose that a parade is not turned back; it is allowed by the commission, but stopped by a counter-demonstration. People will have been arriving from a wide area, and will know that the parade is a legal one. They will expect to attend a legal procession. All at once the event is stopped. If the parade is in a rural area it is a different matter from one that takes place in town. That is a different ball game because of the side streets. Everything can be thrown into confusion. The larger the town or city, of course, the more likely is the malign influence of which the Minister spoke. The matter would be out of control of the organisers. Neither they nor anyone else would be able to deal with it. Even if they could deal with those that they had invited, it would be impossible for them to take control of the others. That is why I have always believed that the parades should be put through. That is the quickest way to get rid of the problem or to diminish it.
<P>
I know that Lord North referred to competing rights, but I am not sure that that is the case. We enjoy certain rights and freedoms which should be open to all. I have no objection to that. As to the view that parades passing the door are intimidatory, that may be true of a few, but it is a very few. Most go through quickly and are over and done with. Individuals are not really that intimidated. They might say. "Those damned Orangemen", or "Those damned Hibernians are coming down the street", and they might not be all that happy about it, but they will accept it. It is over in 20 minutes and then they can go about their business.
<P>
If the right to march is upheld, many of the problems are eliminated. I turned the corner of the street a week or 10 days ago and 30 young fellows were standing opposite the police station holding up a placard saying "Free all the prisoners now" and a number of other things. I am not in the slightest intimidated by such things, but I dare say that some people might be, because they know what lies behind them. Folk would be worried not about 30 young fellows standing in the street, but the shadow of the gunman behind them.
<P>
If processions are opposed and stopped, there is an increase in the number of malign influences or malign figures who turn up from all over the place. My hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone raised the question of prosecutions. The police and courts do not publish the figures in a way that allows comparisons, but we can read the papers. We know that there are practically no prosecutions of those, no matter how violent, who engage in opposition to parades. As the Minister knows, there are sometimes thousands of people involved. The police also have a habit of bringing them to court and delaying and delaying. They are not dealt with until 12 to 15 months afterwards, by which time many people have got away and many of the original charges[Mr. William Ross]
disappear into the sand and are never heard of again. People have seen that happen throughout their lives and they are not happy about it. If these people are to be prosecuted it should be done immediately and the lesson should be hammered home.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in many cases where the police have recommended prosecutions to the Director of Public Prosecutions (Northern Ireland) there have been no prosecutions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I have heard those stories but I have no proof that that happens. It seems remarkable that there have been so few prosecutions even for serious incidents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point about the delay in prosecutions. The Government are beginning to tackle that seriously. There is a major problem in that area. It is being looked at not just in terms of Northern Ireland but in terms of the cross-departmental impact between England and Wales. It is a serious problem. We are aware of it and we are beginning to tackle the delay in the administration of justice. It is not an easy problem to resolve, but it is one that we are taking on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I hope that when the Government tackle it they will take a long hard look at the events that followed the lobbying of the former Prime Minister at the Guildhall in Londonderry and the total mess that that whole affair turned into. I am sure that the Minister is well aware of that. If he is not, he should ask his officials to brief him on it as he would find it of great interest.
<P>
The Minister said that under certain circumstances events could create more counter-demonstrations. The Bill will do that. My concerns arise from having lived with this for many years. It has driven me slowly but inexorably to the conclusion that instead of doing what we are doing we should be looking at the American system, which is basically that all processions have a right to be put through.
<P>
If we did that some Protestant towns, Unionist areas and Orange areas would no doubt be offended when the Sinn Feiners wanted to walk down the street. But in two or three years those Sinn Feiners would say that it was not worth the candle. They would not bother coming and the whole thing would diminish. We are going about this the wrong way. The Government have got it wrong and they are adding to the problems.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for repeating the undertaking by his noble Friend Lord Dubs in the other place on 9 December at c. 118 when he said that the Government would look at the matter and consider these points in the House rather than in the other place. The Minister has said that he will do that. I am a bit sorry that he has not gone a little further down the road since 9 December, but I am grateful to him for looking at the matter again. It is a serious point that goes to the heart of the whole concept of the Bill. As the Minister is prepared to look at this again, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman withdraws his amendment it would be in order to let the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I suppose that the hon. Gentleman can withdraw his amendment, but not mine. I too welcome the assurances from the Minister. I thank him for the sensitive way that he has addressed the issues that we put to him this afternoon and this morning. There is a need in terms of perception to try to tweak this in a slightly different direction and get a bit more balance. The substance may not be great, but the perception may be most important. The North report talks of the perception that the parades and the counter-demonstrations are used politically by both sides. I do not propose to say which side uses them more politically.
<P>
One of the benefits of the clauses that relate to parades is their requirement that applications are made and detailed advance notice is given of demonstrations. That is useful because there will be a clear statement of intent on paper, for the public to see. As it will be easy to see how the situation has deteriorated or changed, people can be held accountable. That is a positive aspect of some of the clauses, but it applies in the main only to those organising processions and parades.
<P>
Although I accept the difficulties in defining counter-demonstrations, we should try to find a way through them. The mere fact of so-called organised protesters having to give advance notice would mean that if a residents' group, for example, was political in the purist sense and run by Sinn Fein IRA it would disappear, but at least we would know the source of the protest. However, the protesters may be genuine residents who come together to submit a true and honest protest, as they have the right to do. An application in writing will mean that the community has a chance to see whether people have deviated from their original intentions and whether the final outcome was so different from the intent that it made what they were purporting to do in the first place very suspicious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments. Does he accept my point that although counter-demonstrations can take many shapes and forms they can change from one year to the next and from one parade to the next those involved in parades and marches tend to operate in a structured way and, to use their phraseology, in a traditional manner? They go down their traditional route, as they see it, and tend to parade and march in a specific way. That is not necessarily the case in counter-demonstrations, which is partly why complications arise. In seeking movement from me, the hon. Gentleman should take into account the totality of the argument.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I accept that valid point. I would expect the protests and demonstrations to change each year different residents on the estates may be involved, and different people may come in to organise them. We are discussing only 20 marches a year that are opposed. It is only a small proportion of the total number.
<P>
Whether the marches change each year is irrelevant; once the march or parade organiser has made an application, giving 28 days' notice according to the Bill, the statement of intent will be clear and we will know how many people will be involved and so on. If there is to be an official protest the Minister knows what I mean it is reasonable that the commission and the community should know about it and about the scale of any potential protest. It may change every year, but each year the commission has to take a decision whether to allow the parade through and different factors will apply every year. That does not necessarily undermine what the amendments would do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eddie McGrady </B>(South Down): I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's remarks this afternoon and in the forenoon on the subject of legitimising the counter-demonstrations or protest. I agree with the Minister that we must consider that at greater length. Is the hon. Gentleman not concerned that doing as he suggests would give equal validity to the counter-demonstration and to the demonstration against which it protests? I do not think that that was the purpose of the argument, but it could be its result. A statutory provision could be used to give rise to protests. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there could be more protests than there are today?
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman not also agree that many legitimate protests have, on occasions, been taken over by paramilitaries with a consequent increase in violence? That scenario could be exacerbated by the equalisation of the right to initiate a protest. As the hon. Gentleman will know, protests can be spontaneous as well as orchestrated, and the dividing line between the two is difficult to define. His point deserves great consideration, but it would create difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful for those helpful comments. I recognise that legitimising protests in the way that the amendments suggest might lead to the opposing sides facing each other.
<P>
So-called spontaneous protests are not spontaneous. Outsiders are often bused in, but nothing or very little is done about that. No one is taken to court or prosecuted. No one is made responsible; it is as though such events just happen. They do not just happen; they are orchestrated. If we can get some people in the community to stand and be counted, it will at least be a start. If events go wrong on the day and the problems escalate, the police have the power to take action as they see fit.
<P>
I believe in the right to protest; it is a valid one. However, I worry about what the commission will do if no agreement is reached through mediation. It is damned if it does, and damned if it does not. The two communities should come together and try to agree that a parade may pass as long as it is a certain kind of parade. That is what the Bill seeks to encourage. As long as the scale of the demonstration by the community against the parade is acceptable to the commission and the Secretary of State, the operation will become legitimate; that will at least keep the lid on the problem.
<P>
If the lid subsequently blows off because the situation has changed, we will see either that the community's intent to protest at a certain level has been usurped by outsiders, or that their original intent was designed to give false testimony. That will provide a political point against those who engineer the protests and we will know who is to blame. We will be able to point the finger, whereas now things just appear to happen and no one does anything about them. We are going round in circles hence, the need for a Bill like this.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's remarks on the matter and his promise to take a further look at it. I know that the problem is difficult; I would not pretend for a moment that it is easy. Amendments Nos. 82 to 84, which I have taken from the North report, would provide a universal code of conduct for protesters. They would not deal with specific protest groups in particular parts of Northern Ireland or on particular estates or roads. A code of conduct should embrace all the people who wish to protest at whatever level. That is a better way to proceed than some of the later amendments and new clauses.
<P>
I leave the matter with the Minister, and I am happy not to press my amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 67, That the clause stand part of the Bill: 
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Functions of the Commission</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 1, line 11, after `public', insert `throughout the United Kingdom'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 16, in page 1, line 12, at end insert `in Northern Ireland'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The amendment is slightly different from those that we discussed earlier. It is intended to increase mutual understanding a phrase now beloved of the Government about band parades. I confess that when I re-read the amendment I discovered that I had not said what I intended to. The wording should have been
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"after `public', insert `in Northern Ireland and throughout the United Kingdom'."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would have meant that the commission would have a duty to try to educate the public in Great Britain about the whole meaning of band parades and processions and everything that lay behind them in Northern Ireland. It would have to educate people about how many processions there were, what kind they were, their object, what they signified and how they were expressions of cultural identity. Some weeks ago, in the other place, Lord Fitt said that a person once exhibited the Irish tricolour as an expression of his cultural identity. I think that the individual concerned was exhibiting it as a territorial claim. We are familiar with that in Northern Ireland, in the outworking of articles 2 and 3.
[Mr. Ross]
<P>
The educational process is essential. There is great ignorance as to what the band parades are about, not only in the mists of Northern Ireland, but especially on this side of the Irish sea.
<P>
If we watch a football match on television, we see only snapshots of it. We might have some idea that there was a row on the football field, or that someone was sent off, or that a couple of goals were scored. We do not see the whole picture, and we have no idea of the ebb and flow of the play. Someone who has never been in the blue room at the Rangers cannot understand the emotional appeal that it has to those who follow that football club.
<P>
I am one of those who do not throw, kick or hit a ball. I take very little interest in doing so. When my sons hear me say that they recognise me as an unmitigated philistine, as someone who has never understood the merits of rugby, the game that they play most of the time.
<P>
One can get the wrong impression from snapshots. They sometimes colour people's views; indeed, sometimes they form people's views of processions and parades. There is an educational process for the commission to carry out, not only in Northern Ireland, but outside it. I hope that it will do so in such a way that it will increase people's background knowledge. In my efforts to do that, the Minister kindly sent me, the second time that I asked he did not send anything the first time the statistics for parades in Northern Ireland up to 30 June last year. The statistics for the latter half of the year are not yet ready.
<P>
It has been the custom of the police to label such statistics "Loyalist", "Nationalist", "Other". That is a crude measure; it does not tell us anything. We do not know what kind of procession has been described. More than a year ago I asked for the figures to be broken down. The police have done so, but not to the extent that I would really like. A wealth of detail is hidden behind the broken-down figures that we have, so that we cannot understand the whole picture.
<P>
The figures are fascinating because I know about the situation in Northern Ireland. They have been broken down into broad Unionist and nationalist groupings. Unionist parades have been broken down by police sub-division into Orange order, Royal Black Preceptory, Apprentice Boys, band only, political party group and other. Nationalist parades have been broken down into the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Irish National Foresters, band only, political grouping and other. The figures are fascinating.
<P>
The first thing that we realise when we look at the figures is that the Orange order and the Royal Black Preceptory are very widespread. We also see that all the bodies hold processions all over Northern Ireland.
<P>
The figures also tell us about the Ancient Order of Hibernians, which is the principal nationalist-catholic organisation. It has interesting roots; it was originally a mutual insurance company and at one time had 350,000 members in the island of Ireland, although it is now sadly diminished. When we consider the statistics for the Ancient Order of Hibernians we discover that, despite being non-existent in many parts of Northern Ireland, it has processions in those parts where it is active and its members are relatively numerous. The top place is new mid-Ulster Cookstown and Magherafelt. It had 11 processions in Cookstown and 15 in Magherafelt. Those figures do not include 15 August, which is the other day on which the Ancient Order of Hibernians traditionally processes. The figures cover most of the Orange processions, but only half of the AOH's processions. It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us about the rest of them.
<P>
We have a picture of that parading organisation. It parades in a very mixed part of the country. In the Magherafelt and general south Derry area, the AOH and the Orange order process through the same villages. Not in living memory has there been a single attack on an AOH procession by Protestants I do not know of one. Perhaps the Minister could tell us of a parade that faced opposition or efforts to stop it. Indeed, at two places in Northern Ireland in the past year, the Orange Institution told the AOH that it was more than welcome whenever it showed a degree of reluctance to come. They said, "You are perfectly welcome. Come along."
<P>
I want the amendment accepted because of that background. I want to lay this small extra burden on the commission so that it can educate people and perhaps even Members of the House of Commons who would, I hope, read its reports. In those circumstances, there is an excellent case for the Government to accept the amendment.
<P>
Two of the highest sets of figures for Protestant processions are for my area of Coleraine and Limavady. The Orange order has 11 processions in Coleraine and 8 in Limavady. When we consider band-only processions, we discover that there are 18 in Coleraine an 26 in Limavady. Those are not all through towns; some are collecting ventures, in which bands go round the country. I suspect that some still take place without the police knowing about them, but I know of one or two bands that give the police formal notice of every single procession. Their whole collecting programme is laid out and that must account for quite a number of the 26 parades in Limavady. Yet quite a number of other parades some of which are quite large take place in that town every year.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If people realised the mosaic of different activities, they could be brought to a clearer understanding of how much of a jigsaw the whole issue is. If they understood that, especially in this Committee, in the House and in Great Britain, they might take a more rational view and understand that what they see on their television screens is not usually legitimate protests by the local citizenry but rather organised thuggery by terrorist organisations. I want the Parades Commission to be given this duty so that people would get a much clearer understanding of the real, instead of the mythical, situation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) for tabling amendments Nos. 15 and 16, because it is important to recognise the educational role of the commission. However, that is not its primary function. If we extended that responsibility over a wider remit, we could detract from the commission's main purpose, which is, of course to find a point of agreement or accommodation through mediation and thus to try to avoid some of the worst excesses that we have seen in various places during the marching season.
<P>
Amendment No. 16 is desirable in one sense, but it would place a substantial burden on the commission. We would have to think about how that educational role could be fulfilled and we would be putting an extra burden of responsibility on those who have been appointed to the commission and given the arduous task of dealing with hotly contested issues in Northern Ireland issues that the people of the United Kingdom may or may not be switched on to. They certainly get switched on to them when there are major points of conflict that is usually what is portrayed by the media, and one cannot blame them for that. They are merely reflecting the reality on the ground. In this case, it is indeed reality, not perception, when major disorder is associated with particular parades.
<P>
While I am tempted to accept the amendment, I do not want to extend the commission's role because it has other important functions from which the proposed function would detract. I do not like to use the phrase "motherhood and apple pie", but that is what it could become, because the role and duties of the commission may not be fulfilled if the dedication and commitment of its members lie elsewhere. The amendment would impose an impractical and unrealistic duty on the commission. We want to see it carrying out those tasks for which it has the prime responsibility.
<P>
Educational knowledge will flow through from what the commission does, in terms of its understanding of what is happening on the ground with individual parades. Education, however, can best happen where people are willing to listen. It will be difficult to get the people of the United Kingdom enthused about all the parades and marches that the commission will have to consider in a given year.
<P>
While I am tempted to accept the amendment, my natural approach is not to provide burdens and duties that will not be imposed the real duty rests elsewhere. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> That is interesting. The Minister clearly sees the need for this education process he is not denying that. People in Northern Ireland know perfectly well what the situation is. They do not have to be educated that is the point. People in Britain need to be educated, as do those in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. If the Minister will not accept that so far as the general public are concerned, will he accept that research into and reports of these matters produced by the commission should at least include a clear breakdown of the processions? Members of the House would then clearly understand the situation and would not have to depend on the myth and montage that we have seen time and again on our television screens, or on reporters who are looking for a noisy story rather than reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman has asked me to direct the commission in that way. My feeling is that the commission would want to ensure that what it was doing on the ground was properly presented and explained, and was getting the widest possible circulation. As elected representatives, we have a responsibility because such reports are likely to be presented to the Houses in different forms. They will certainly be placed in the Library. We have an educative role. We must take the assessment made by the Parades Commission and the information provided by it to the wider public and speak about reality, not perceptions.
<P>
I say to the members of the Ulster Unionist party that we all have a responsibility to speak in real terms, not to stoke the fires of perception. If the Parades Commission says something that they may not have thought about or understood in the past, I hope they will shoulder the responsibility and say, "We have learnt something from the process that we have been involved in and we will tell our community that perhaps we have not acted in a way conducive to bringing a normal, rational society to Northern Ireland." We all have a responsibility to learn, and that includes members of the Ulster Unionist party. I still take the view that there is no need to extend the Bill in the way suggested in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I support the amendment. It is necessary that the people in the rest of the United Kingdom learn more about what is going on in Northern Ireland. I do not know how many members of the Committee have been to Northern Ireland, where half of them come from or where their constituencies are. Therefore, I should be reluctant to dictate to them or criticise what they do in their areas. They have more authority to speak for their constituencies and know their situation better than I, who has probably never been to their constituencies.
<P>
Ministers such as the Minister of State, who obviously thinks that the Ulster Unionist party does not yet know enough about Northern Ireland, come over without being fully conversant with the situation. I suggest that the commission might educate Ministers, because if they were fully conversant they would never have brought forward a Bill such as this. Furthermore, they should recognise that the people of Northern Ireland, who have elected us to this House, are better able to speak about the situation there than Ministers who come over but know very little about it. If the Conservatives had won the last election and there had been no Conservative Members in Scotland, the Labour party would have criticised that Conservative Government if they had dictated what Labour Members in Scotland should and should not do. Ministers of the Labour Government are arrogant to come over to Northern Ireland, dictate to us and criticise us about how we represent the people of Northern Ireland. I remind the Minister that the Labour party has no Members in Northern Ireland and the Government should have more respect for Members who are elected there.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> Is it not still true that the Labour party will not even allow people of a Labour persuasion from Northern Ireland to join its party? Surely that is an act of gross discrimination against people of that view in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank my hon. Friend 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that we will stay in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Indeed, Mr. Butterfill. I am sure that when the commission is formed and obtains its powers, it will soon educate the Ministers at Stormont about the realities of Northern Ireland and remove their stupid perceptions.
<P>
Furthermore, it is necessary that the commission should seek to educate people on the mainland because there is an abysmal ignorance here about the situation in Northern Ireland. That is not because of any malevolence on the part of people here towards Northern Ireland it is simply that they do not understand the situation. I have discovered that when they are spoken to and the situation in Northern Ireland is explained to them, they soom sympathise with the people of Northern Ireland and, indeed, with their Unionist views. Those from the mainland who come over to Northern Ireland soon recognise the Unionist position.
<P>
I support the amendment and I believe that it would be advantageous for the commission to have an educational role. I appreciate the Minister's difficulty and his fear that that role might grow and detract from the commission's main role, but certain actions could be taken to educate people over here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not want to extend this debate unnecessarily but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that members of the loyal orders have in recent years come to this place and elsewhere in Britain, to visit Members of Parliament in their constituencies and carry out that educative role, which they see as important.

<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> The Committee has come to the end of its consideration of amendments 15 and 16, which were grouped together. Having listened to the Minister, I should like to read carefully what he said. When I have done so, I may think it appropriate to return to the matter on Report. The question of education has not been properly addressed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 13, leave out from "to" to "disputes" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"act as mediator to resolve".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 59, in page 1, line 21, leave out "mediate, or".
<P>
No. 9, in page 1, line 21, leave out ", or facilitate mediation,".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> This is one of those times when we come to a very sad and unnecessary division between the UUP and the SLDP. It is clear that the SDLP has decided that the commissioners should not be involved in mediation. If they are not involved, I fail to see how on earth they can reach a firm conclusion.
<P>
I believe that the commission should be fully involved. The commissioners, after all, took up their posts, and they have been involved in mediation before. They have been running around talking to every Tom, Dick and Harry in the country to anyone who was prepared to talk to them. They have sought meetings with all sorts of people, and yet now they are being told to "promote and facilitate" mediation, under clause 2(1)(b), as a means of resolving disputes. They will not do anything themselves they will promote and facilitate. Does that mean that it is intended that the commissioners should sit in an ivory tower, directing a host of people to go around the country and chat to folk?
<P>
We are told, and the Government seem to believe, that only a dozen possible places exist where there is contention about processions although the figure has now crept up to 20. These people whom the Government have appointed are sadly diminished by the departure of one member of the commission, the Rev. Roy Magee, who had predicted very hairy situations to put it mildly with regard to keeping the community peaceful. No wonder the poor chap looks a bit tired, after all that he has been through. They were getting involved in mediation, face to face, talking to folk, expressing their views and listening to what people had to say. They did everything that they could to reach agreement, and on some occasions brought people at opposite ends of the political and religious spectrum together in one room. They deployed their most carefully thought through arguments about why people should all live in peace and harmony. Now we find that their role is only to promote and to facilitate.
<P>
I do not think that that is good enough. If commissioners are appointed, they should go out and earn their cash. They should go and do something. They should have to sit down with the people concerned and explore all the issues that are brought before them. If they did so, they would achieve a much clearer understanding of the true causes of the dispute in Northern Ireland, through that learning curve that is so evident in such gatherings. They would also come to understand who is genuinely insulted and annoyed by processions. They would clearly understand what motivates the people who run parades, and the people who oppose them. They would achieve a much better understanding. Their chairman is a trade unionist. He would know the fierce passions that were aroused whenever the question of pay was discussed in his working life. He would know how furious some people get about whether they are given 1 or 10 more per week. He would know that such emotions are sometimes not easily resolved, and that people have even gone on strike and closed industries down for months. However, that is not comparable to debates over the nation to which people belong, which involve claims to territory. The chairman has some learning to do yet.
<P>
In view of the new powers envisaged in the Bill, commissioners will have to be accurate in what they say and do. They will have to know exactly what is possible and know exactly where the line needs to be drawn. It is therefore vital for these people to get down on the streets of towns and villages and listen to what contending parties are saying. They must hear what has happened at first hand.
<P>
It is no use saying that people at Drumcree were spoken to last year. The Minister has already told us on two or three occasions that the situation changes from year to year. Different people are wheeled out who have different concepts and arguments. The whole situation is different: there is a new creation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman is reading too much into what I said. When he actually reads what I said, it may help him. I said that it could happen, not that it would happen inevitably. I referred only to the possibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> It is becoming clear that I am in a learning curve too. The Minister has downgraded my understanding by saying that it could happen. He has not told me yet whether it did happen. My impression is that in the case of Bellaghy it will have to happen. The gentleman who was so prominent there is living in the Republic now. I understand that there are other gentlemen who would like to chat with him. As I said, he is in the Republic and he is not coming back.
<P>
There will be a different set of people. Someone else will have to be wheeled out to do the organising of counter-demonstations or counter open-air meeings, as the Minister described them. Poor Mr. Graham and his fellow members will come along to Bellaghy and talk to the clergy, who are sometimes involved. I do not know of changes there in recent years or of any imminent changes. When the clergy are spoken to, the same arguments and views tend to be expressed. The Orange Institution, the Apprentice Boys, and the Black Preceptory often have overlapping memberships.
<P>
The front organisation the IRA will then be spoken to by the commissioners. However, instead of being confronted by Mr. McGlinchey and Mr. Hasson, perhaps a Mr. Smith will be there. He and his cohorts will be at the meeting. Another group of new faces will be present and slightly different arguments will be advanced. How on earth are the commissioners, whose views may be coloured by the circumstances in Bellaghy, the experience of previous years and the views put by the former contenders, going to gain a clear understanding? A different situation is likely to be created by new minds, new tongues and new thoughts on how to deal with an intractable situation.
<P>
It is therefore essential for the commissioners to see how the land lies themselves, to hear what the individuals in contention may have to say. They may have to consider a new situation in which more people will have moved from the area because they are fed up with having their windows broken every weekend. They become weary of the intimidation that they experience in those situations. I recall that 30 or 40 years ago the main street of Bellaghy was 90 per cent. Protestant. It is very different today. It did not all happen by accident. A number of the hunger strikers came from that area, as do some well-known murderers who have friends and relations still living there. There are people with somewhat extreme views who have made life unpleasant, so others have tended to move away.
<P>
We are debating a change that the commission will have to deal with. I believe that it should have to "act as mediator", as suggested in amendment No. 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> How does the hon. Gentleman envisage the process working in practice? He mentioned Bellaghy and he has obviously given the matter some thought. As he was talking, I wondered how it would work in practice. The local parade people in Bellaghy would have to give 28 days' notice and send in their submissions saying that they will have a parade on a certain date. It will be passed on to the commission by the police, but how will the commission know that there is opposition to that parade in Bellaghy? How will it be communicated? Will there be a protest group organised? How does the hon. Gentleman envisage the procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> If the procession is spontaneous, no doubt people will ring up the commission. However, if it has been arranged in advance, we would expect protests to be organised.
<P>
Instead of making life difficult for the ungodly, the Bill will make it much easier because there will be a whole month's warning. Parades are not secret; they interlock all over the countryside. There could be one in Bellaghy this Sunday, in Limavady next Sunday, and in Kilrea another Sunday. They are fixed in the calendar. Unless the people involved arrange to change the day of their parade, everyone knows when they will be and whether they are on the same day.
<P>
Allowing 28 days will make it much easier to organise opposition to a parade. I am now clear about how the Government or the commission envisage the opposition to arise. Will there be a crash-course crisis resolution every time there is a parade when concerned residents see the AA report and find out about it? I suppose that they will have to ring the commission and go to the police to make their views known. Will the commission proceed on the basis of what has happened in recent times? I do not know. No doubt the Minister does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Perhaps it would be helpful if the Committee was aware that not only will the organisers have to give notice to the police, but they will have to advertise the fact that they are having a parade. In other words, people will be encouraged to protest under the code of practice that the commissioners will produce.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I was not aware of that, and it fills me with foreboding. The Minister has mentioned various guides and codes of conduct I think there are three different lots. Would not it be a good idea to ensure that every member of the Committee has that information by Monday morning? I have had no such guides sent to me, and I am surprised about that. Is there a good reason why not? I think that it would be worth while to see them, to see what is required of parade organisers. It appears that people are to be told to go out and cause a grievance among people. That seems a bit daft. I should have thought that the quieter most such matters could be kept, the less likelihood there would be of opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised a point about the codes of practice and guidance. My advice is[Mr. Ingram]
that those documents have been available to hon. Members since before the Bill was introduced in the House. It is not the Government's responsibility to spoon-feed every hon. Member. I see that the hon. Member for West Tyrone has a copy of the documents, so at least someone is alert to the matter.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I am pleased to see that, but given the range of stuff that pours in from Government sources and every quango in the land, every day, I am a bit surprised that the Government did not see fit to give copies to every Member of the Committee. They are relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> May I place on record what the practice code says? It states:
"if the parade will pass through an area where people of another cultural identity live, it will again be necessary to serve early notice and to include in that notice details of the person to whom representatives of the local community might approach about aspects of the parade."
<P>
In other words, they must tell the opposition that they are having a parade.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I suggest that we stick to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Indeed, Mr. Welsh, I am happy to do so, because the craziness of the statement that my hon. Friend has just read out takes my breath away. It bears no relationship to what is needed in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Amendment No. 2 embodies the clear demand that the commission be involved in the front line. The people concerned have taken the job on I assume that they are more or less volunteers. They have all been appointed by Government. They did not have to take up their posts. They should go and earn their corn. Amendment No. 9, which would omit the words "or facilitate mediation" from clause 2(2)(a), would ensure that they would have to act. If some crisis blows up at the last minute, there will not be time to run around among the various staff, to summon them and obtain written reports from them and hold discussions and all the rest. It will be nonsense to try to send someone else to deal with the matter. The commissioners will have to be involved themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Amendment No. 59 would delete the two words "mediate, or" from clause 2(2)(a), because I perceive a difficulty in the requirement for the commission as a body, as distinct from commissioners or someone appointed by it, to be involved in mediation.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry referred to the Rev. Roy Magee having resigned from the commission. That has been mentioned several times today as an example of the problems that exist. I understand that his problem was that he did not want to be a mediator and to take decisions. He saw those functions as distinct. That is the kernel of this simple amendment. The executive summary of the North report refers specifically, at page 24, paragraph (b), to promoting and facilitating mediation and the search for local accommodation in respect of contentious marches. The commission members do not themselves seek the mediation role, although it is possible that any number of members of the commission, and other people, may be thought suitable for the work of mediation, negotiation or arbitration whatever word one wants to use. But under the Bill the commission will mediate, and, having done so, will take a decision whether to impose conditions, regardless of whether the mediation has been successful.
<P>
That will greatly inhibit the work of the mediators because those with whom they are expected to mediate and negotiate will be conscious that the body will take the decision. In such circumstances, I would be inclined to up the ante to the extreme. However, negotiators who are not in the commission per se would be at least once removed from the intensity of lobbying for one particular side, and the commission as a body would then be able to report upon its mediation process.
<P>
To explain my point, I say that the only body that is akin to what I mean I do not say that it is an absolute guarantee of success is the Planning Appeals Commission. It takes decisions on appeals but members do not participate in the hearing of evidence. That is the nearest analogy to what I am proposing.
<P>
I want a space between the mediators they may be commissioners or drawn from a variety of people outside the body and the act of taking a decision, making an affirmation or rejecting the conditions. That is my purpose and it reflects the wishes of the North commission, who have had some experience in these matters; it should not be lightly rejected. As I said, that is the very point on which the Rev. Roy Magee, who did such a magnificent and dedicated job, felt it necessary to resign. He could not see himself acting as a mediator and having then to take a decision, good or bad. That is a valid, legitimate and logical point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Has not the hon. Gentleman illustrated a great weakness in relation to mediation? We have heard a tremendous amount about the impartiality of the commissioners, but there is no guarantee that the mediators will be impartial because there is no way of ensuring that they will be. The whole idea of impartiality is negated if we remove from the commission the idea that they should be doing the mediating.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Surprisingly, I can thank the hon. Gentleman for the information that he has given me, because it proves my point: there should be a gap between those taking the decision and those engaged in mediation. I cannot say whether those involved will be of full integrity, unbiased and so on but if they are contaminated, if I may use that word, by their contacts and the pressures of mediation, at least the body taking the decision based on their reports and recommendations will be at one remove.
<P>
I emphasise that I am not talking about whether the commissioners should or should not be engaged in mediation but about the commission itself. That is the difficulty. I recommend that the words "mediate, or" be deleted from the clause. It would then read:
"The Commission may in accordance with the following provisions of this Act 
(a) facilitate mediation between parties",
<P>
and so on. That would give the commission scope to act in the best way to bring the process forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that the people involved should not be perceived to be contaminated. Does he understand the feelings of the Unionist community when they see that the chairman of the Foyle SDLP constituency association is one of the commissioners? In the eyes of the Unionist population, she is contaminated.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I resent that intervention. I was responding to the hon. Gentleman's colleague, the hon. Member for West Tyrone, when he referred to the necessary gap between those engaged in mediation and those making the decision. I sought to use the word "contaminated" in inverted commas because it is a difficult word to use. I very much resent the implication that an honourable lady, who has served the community well and without blemish and who is a member of my party, is contaminated. If the Unionists believe that she is contaminated, they should examine how they assess people.
<P>
It is appropriate and it is a matter of practicality that, according to the requirements of the North report, the commission be given powers to facilitate mediation. However, the commission should not necessarily, by statute, have to participate in that process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I shall briefly deal with a point made by the hon. Member for South Down. Last year, the commissioners mediated between the various groups. The mediators will not now mediate, but other mediation organisations will do that for them. The report made will not necessarily be impartial and there is no way to guarantee that the mediation groups will be, either. Therefore, when the commissioners take a decision, they may do so on the basis of biased information. That will make it difficult for them to make an impartial decision.
<P>
That illustrates the difficulty of having so-called private individuals mediating in such cases. The police, who know what is going on, should decide on public order grounds alone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Some heated words have flown across the Committee. The hon. Member for East Londonderry trod on dangerous ground when he said that people were contaminated because they came from one section of the community in Northern Ireland. Such phraseology and such attitude inflame passions in Northern Ireland. Some people may even describe it as a form of sectarianism. I know that the hon. Gentleman would not want to be accused of that, but people could interpret his remarks that way. He effectively said that those who have a role on the commission be they mediators or not and who come from the Nationalist community or tradition are contaminated by virtue of their background.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The corollary could be that those who come from the Unionist tradition are equally contaminated and cannot be reasonable in coming to conclusions on these issues. The reality on the ground must be that people can come from any sector of the community in Northern Ireland and act objectively in the greater and best interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect on the wider implications of what he said about a particular individual. It does not help what we are trying to achieve with the Bill and generally across the board in Northern Ireland.
<P>
We have looked carefully at the amendments. They raise a fundamental question about the role of the commission and of those who serve it. Amendments Nos. 3 and 9 perplex me somewhat. What seems to be proposed is that the responsibility for mediation should rest solely with those who act on behalf of the commission. If that is so it takes away an important measure of flexibility from the commission to do its job in the best way possible.
<P>
The Bill has been framed to maximise the flexibility in relation to the work to be carried out by those acting on behalf of the commission or the commissioners themselves. It goes slightly further than what was said in the North report. It creates a greater degree of flexibility. On that basis I would ask that the amendments be withdrawn. If they are not, I will ask my hon. Friends to vote against them.
<P>
In tabling amendment No. 59 the hon. Member for South Down clearly feels that there should be a separation of powers. He is right in saying that a real debate is taking place. Roy Magee clearly took that point of view. He has a right to do so, but that of itself does not make it right. He is eminent in this area. He has made a major contribution, but although he brings considerable experience to it he is not the sole arbiter of what is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Does the Minister accept that now that the area of mediation has been opened up, there is no way that he can guarantee impartiality in relation to mediators? That defeats the whole purpose of a scheme based upon impartiality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There is nothing certain in life except death and sometimes coming to Committees to listen to hon. Gentlemen. Absolute guarantees are impossible but we must recognise that in Northern Ireland there are many men and women of good will who want to make a contribution in this area and who can operate in an impartial way as best they can, even though they may come from a particular sector within the community.
<P>
Otherwise, the hon. Gentleman is saying that people exist within their ghettoes and their traditions and cannot escape from them: they can speak only from a partial viewpoint. If that is the case, there will never be a resolution to what is taking place in Northern Ireland. That runs counter to what the people of Northern Ireland feel and want for their future. They want to be part of a normal society, in the belief that it is possible for a person to have an individual view without its contaminating him and making him unable to understand another person's point of view.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 59, the Parades Commission has made it clear that it would seek to promote local accommodation, largely through these authorised officers gathering information in local areas[Mr. Ingram]
and making contact and building relationships with local groups. As it stands, the Bill will give the commission the flexibility to act as it believes most appropriate in any given circumstance.
<P>
There could be circumstances in which the commission would want to engage in mediation directly. There is no requirement under the Bill to do that. The Bill merely gives the commission an enabling power. That gives it a useful degree of flexibility. Although I was tempted by certain aspects of amendment No. 59 because of what people like Roy Magee had said, I have taken another balanced view on this issue.
<P>
Removing the commission's enabling power may inhibit it from dealing with some unforeseen event. We should have in place the maximum flexibility for the commission to act as it sees fit. That will allow the commission to learn from its experiences as the process evolves.
<P>
Given the difficulties, it is inevitable that the commission will not do everything right in the first year. There will be a steep learning curve for the commissioners and those who act on their behalf. The commissioners will be dealing with a difficult area, but they will learn and build upon that. Therefore, there should be maximum flexibility to allow them to deal with matters as they see fit. I ask the hon. Member for South Down to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> What the Minister says thoroughly alarms me. He expects mistakes to be made. Has he any understanding of the consequences of a bad mistake in the first year? If not, he should think carefully about the import of what he has said. His remarks should fill us all with deep concern. As before, mistakes in this area can cost lives in Northern Ireland. None of us wants that.
<P>
If the commissioners are not to mediate, who will? Are people being selected? How will those people be selected? What are their qualifications? When they go out to meet people, will they keep accurate minutes so that a check can be made to see whether their advice is unbiased? These are not light matters. I treat the Bill with great seriousness, for I have seen what has happened in the past few years. We know how close we were to a real explosion rather than rumbling discontent in comparison to what could have happened, it was little more than that.
<P>
We need to know who those people are. I am deeply alarmed that the commissioners will be ivory tower people it has been confirmed rather than people who are on the ground doing the job for which they are paid. In regard to Miss McIvor, I have met the lady a few times. I found her a very pleasant, able and intelligent woman. But the reality is that she is the chairman of the constituency party of the leader of the SDLP. What would the SDLP and every nationalist in Northern Ireland say if my constituency chairman or a County Grand Master of the Orange Institution was in that position? She is perceived as the equivalent.
<P>
The appointment was extremely foolish the lady should have long since resigned, knowing that she could not possibly be acceptable to the broad Unionist community and has done nothing to enhance the reputation of the commission and the commissioners in the eyes of the people.
<P>
I know that we must stop soon, so I shall leave my remarks there. I hope that the Minister will reply to my questions about the mediators and their qualifications.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> In view of the Minister's remarks and in order to facilitate the Committee's progress and leave the choice to the commission, rather than making the matter mandatory, I shall not press amendment No. 59, which is in my name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There is a straightforward point to be made to the hon. Member for East Londonderry, who has asked questions about the next amendment and the next part of our debate: we will deal with that in due course, perhaps immediately after I sit down or perhaps at some time in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> That does not take us very far. We will shortly go away for the weekend and the Committee will not sit again until Tuesday. We will come back and be given a heap of information in another rushed sitting because the Government are pushing the Bill through with inordinate haste. We are having two sittings a day, two days a week, in an effort to get it through when there was no need for that.
<P>
We have no idea who will undertake the mediation. Are staff from the Minister's office running around Northern Ireland, trawling through the great and the good, trying to find people who are willing to get involved? Are we expected to accept that that is a balanced and reasonable process? If the Minister thinks that, he is not living in the real world. We need to know what sort of qualifications those individuals will have. Will accurate minutes be kept?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is speaking to amendment No. 80. Will he please speak only to the amendment that is before the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> It is quite clear that I am not the only person who has deep concerns about such matters. As we will come to them shortly, I will ask questions then. I hope that when we do ask questions, we will be given a list of those who have been approached and be told whether they are willing to serve. In the light of what the Minister has said, we shall consider the amendment and perhaps try to return to the matter because we do not believe that the question has been exhausted. Given that time is short, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned. [Mr. Dowd.]
